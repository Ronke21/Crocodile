==Early life==
===Ancestry===

Drew Blythe Barrymore was born on February 22, 1975, in Culver City, California, to actor John Drew Barrymore and aspiring actress Jaid Barrymore (born Ildikó Jaid Makó), who was born in a displaced persons camp in Brannenburg, West Germany, to Hungarian World War II refugees. Through her father, Barrymore has three older half-siblings, including actor John Blyth Barrymore. Her parents divorced in 1984.

In 2023, Barrymore displayed an AncestryDNA test onscreen on her talk show, which assessed her genetic ancestry as primarily European, with 6% Northern Indian.

Barrymore was born into an acting family. All of her paternal great-grandparents, Maurice and Georgie Drew Barrymore, Maurice and Mae Costello (née Altschuk), and her paternal grandparents, John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, were actors, with John being arguably the most acclaimed actor of his generation. Barrymore is a niece of Diana Barrymore, a grandniece of Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore and Helene Costello, and a great-great-granddaughter of Irish-born John and English-born Louisa Lane Drew, all of whom were also actors. She is a great-grandniece of Broadway idol John Drew Jr. and silent film actor, writer and director Sidney Drew.

Barrymore&#x27;s godmothers are actress Sophia Loren and Lee Strasberg&#x27;s widow, Anna Strasberg; Barrymore described her relationship with the latter as one that &quot;would become so important to me as a kid because she was so kind and nurturing.&quot; Her godfather is filmmaker Steven Spielberg.

Barrymore&#x27;s first name, Drew, was the maiden name of her paternal great-grandmother Georgie Drew, and her middle name, Blythe, was derived from the birth surname (Blyth) of her great-grandfather who later took the stage name of Maurice Barrymore. In her 1991 autobiography &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot;, Barrymore recounted early memories of her abusive father, who left the family when she was six months old. She and her father never had a significant relationship and seldom spoke.

===Childhood===

Barrymore grew up on Poinsettia Place in West Hollywood, until she moved to Sherman Oaks at the age of seven. In her 2015 memoir &quot;Wildflower&quot;, she says she spoke &quot;like a valley girl&quot; because she grew up in Sherman Oaks. She moved back to West Hollywood on becoming emancipated at age 14. She attended elementary school at Fountain Day School in West Hollywood and Country School. In the wake of her sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was a regular at Studio 54 as a young girl, and her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media. She was placed in rehab at 13, and spent eighteen months in an institution for the mentally ill. A suicide attempt at 14 put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer David Crosby and his wife. The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she &quot;needed to be around some people that were committed to sobriety.&quot; Barrymore described this period of her life for &quot;Little Girl Lost.&quot; After a successful juvenile court petition for emancipation, she moved into her own apartment at the age of 15.

==Career==
===1980–1989: Early roles as a childhood actress ===

Barrymore appeared in a dog food commercial when she was eleven months old. After her film debut with a small role in &quot;Altered States&quot;, she played Gertie in &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Director Steven Spielberg felt she had the right imagination for the role after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. &quot;E.T.&quot; was the highest-grossing film of the 1980s and made Barrymore one of the most famous child actors of the time. She won the Young Artist Award for Best Young Supporting Actress and was nominated for the Rising Star Award at the British Academy Film Awards. In the eighth season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, she became the youngest person to guest-host the series at 7 years old. Barrymore said that &quot;nobody treated me like a kid there&quot; and she didn&#x27;t feel different than any other cast member despite her age.

In the 1984 film adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s 1980 novel &quot;Firestarter&quot;, Barrymore played a girl with pyrokinesis, and the target of a secret government agency known as The Shop. That year, she also played a young girl divorcing her famous parents in &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot; and was nominated for her first Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. In his review in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm.&quot;
Barrymore endured a troubled youth and continued acting during the decade. She starred in the anthology horror film &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye,&quot; also written by King. It received positive reviews and Barrymore was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actress. For &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, Barrymore declined the role of Cecile, which went to Uma Thurman. Barrymore starred in the romance film &quot;See You in the Morning&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the &quot;fashionable phoniness&quot; of the film, but positively singled out Barrymore. In &quot;Far from Home&quot;, she played a teenager who gets stranded with her father in a small, remote desert town. The film went largely unnoticed by audiences and received negative reviews from critics, who dismissed the sexual portrayal of her role.

===1990–1999: Leading roles and stardom ===
Barrymore&#x27;s rebelliousness played itself out on screen and in print. She played a poor teenage girl in &quot;Poison Ivy&quot;, which was a box-office bomb, but was popular on video and cable. Her character &quot;Ivy&quot; was ranked at #6 on the list of the top 26 &quot;bad girls&quot; of all time by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Barrymore was 17 when she posed nude with her then-fiancé, actor Jamie Walters, for the cover of the July issue of &quot;Interview&quot; magazine; she also appeared nude in pictures inside the issue.

In &quot;Guncrazy&quot;, Barrymore played a teenager who kills her abusive stepfather. &quot;Variety&quot; remarked that she &quot;pulls off impressively&quot; her character, and Barrymore was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film. She played the younger sister of a murdered ballerina in &quot;No Place to Hide&quot; and a writer followed by what is apparently her evil twin in &quot;Doppelganger&quot;. Both films were panned by critics and failed to find an audience. She appeared in the western film &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, which follows four former prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and prison escape. Roger Ebert, in his review for the film, wrote for &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;: &quot;What a good idea, to make a Western about four tough women. And what a sad movie.&quot;

Barrymore posed nude for the January 1995 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. Soon after, her godfather Steven Spielberg gave her a quilt for her 20th birthday with a note that read, &quot;Cover yourself up.&quot; Enclosed in the quilt were copies of her &quot;Playboy&quot; pictures which had been altered by Spielberg&#x27;s art department so that she appeared fully clothed. Barrymore later said that she would not let her own child make the same choice she did.

While appearing on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, Barrymore climbed onto the desk, flashed her breasts to David Letterman and gave him a kiss on the cheek as a birthday gift. She modeled in a series of Guess? jeans ads during this time. In the late 1990s, Barrymore re-established her image and continued to be a highly bankable star.

In &quot;Boys on the Side&quot;, Barrymore played a pregnant girl attempting to escape from her abusive boyfriend. It was a box office success and was positively received by critics. In the superhero film &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, she played one of the two female assistants for Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones).
Barrymore had a small role in Wes Craven&#x27;s slasher film &quot;Scream&quot; (1996). She read the film&#x27;s script and was interested in being involved, approaching the production team herself to request a role. The producers were quick to take advantage of her unexpected interest and signed her to play the lead role of Sidney Prescott. However, after unexpected commitments, Barrymore played Casey Becker in a minor role and Neve Campbell took the leading one. &quot;Scream&quot; was released to critical acclaim and made $173 million worldwide. She was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.

In &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; (1998), Barrymore played a waitress in love with the titular character, played by Adam Sandler. &quot;Variety&quot; found the film to be a &quot;spirited, funny and warm saga&quot; that serves them up &quot;in a new way that enhances their most winning qualities&quot;. Budgeted at $18 million, the film grossed $123.3 million internationally. In &quot;Home Fries&quot; (1998), Barrymore played a pregnant woman unknowingly falling for the stepson of the late father of her baby. She starred in the historical drama film &quot;Ever After&quot; (1998), which made $98 million and was inspired by the fairy tale Cinderella. Roger Ebert said about Barrymore and the film: &quot;she can hold the screen and involve us in her characters&quot;.

Barrymore voiced the titular anthropomorphic Jack Russell terrier in the Christmas television film &quot;Olive, the Other Reindeer&quot; and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. After establishing Flower Films, Barrymore and Nancy Juvonen produced the company&#x27;s first film, &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;, in which Barrymore played an insecure copy editor for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and a high school student. While reviews from critics were mixed, &quot;CNN&quot; noted: &quot;There are two words which describe why this film works: Drew Barrymore. Her comedic timing and willingness to go all out in her quest for a laugh combine to make &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; a gratifying movie-going experience&quot;. The film was a commercial success, grossing $84.5 million.

===2000–2008: Established actress ===
In &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu played the trio of investigators in Los Angeles. The film was a major box office success and helped solidify Barrymore&#x27;s standing in her production company as one of the film&#x27;s producers. Barrymore starred in &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot;, as a teenage mother in a failed marriage with the drug-addicted father (based on Beverly Donofrio&#x27;s real-life story). When the production of &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; was threatened, Barrymore stepped forward with financing from the company and played the title character&#x27;s English teacher. Although the film was less than successful at the box office in the wake of 9/11, it reached cult status after the DVD release, inspiring numerous websites devoted to unraveling the plot twists and meanings.

Barrymore starred in George Clooney&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;, based on the autobiography of television producer Chuck Barris. Barrymore reprised her role in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; and starred with Ben Stiller in &quot;Duplex&quot;. Flower Films and Happy Madison Productions produced the film &quot;50 First Dates&quot;, in which Barrymore played an amnesiac woman and Sandler played a marine veterinarian. Summing up Barrymore&#x27;s appeal, Roger Ebert, in his review for the film, remarked that Barrymore displayed a &quot;smiling, coy sincerity&quot;, in what he described as an &quot;ingratiating and lovable&quot; film. &quot;50 First Dates&quot; was a commercial success; it made US$120.9 million in North America and US$196.4 million worldwide.In the 2005 American remake adaptation of the 1997 British film &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, Barrymore played the love interest of an immature schoolteacher (Jimmy Fallon). The film grossed a modest US$50 million worldwide and had generally favorable reviews by critics who felt it &quot;has enough charm and on-screen chemistry between [Fallon and Barrymore] to make it a solid hit&quot;. Barrymore starred in the 2006 animated film &quot;Curious George&quot;, based on the book series of the same name. She and Hugh Grant starred in &quot;Music and Lyrics&quot;, which focuses on the relationship that evolves between a former pop music idol and an aspiring writer as they struggle to compose a song for a reigning pop diva. The romantic comedy, released in February 2007, received largely positive reviews, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; finding the two to be &quot;great together&quot; in it. The film was a commercial success, grossing US$145 million globally.
In Curtis Hanson&#x27;s poker film &quot;Lucky You&quot;, Barrymore played an aspiring singer and the subject of the affections of a talented player. In Raja Gosnell&#x27;s film &quot;Beverly Hills Chihuahua&quot;, Barrymore voiced the titular character, a richly pampered pet who gets dognapped in Mexico and has to escape from an evil Doberman.

=== 2009–2019: Directorial debut and television roles === 
Barrymore starred in the ensemble comedy &quot;He&#x27;s Just Not That Into You&quot;, which received mixed reviews, partly due to her limited time on screen, while it grossed US$178 million worldwide. She played Edith Bouvier Beale, the daughter of Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale (Jessica Lange) in the HBO film &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;, which is based on the 1975 documentary film. The television film was a huge success, winning five Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Peter Travers found Barrymore to be a &quot;revelation&quot; in her role. Barrymore was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film and the Screen Actors Guild for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries.

Barrymore starred in her directorial debut film &quot;Whip It&quot;. It follows a high-schooler (Elliot Page) ditching the teen beauty pageant scene and participating in an Austin roller derby league. Barrymore worked with screenwriter Shauna Cross for months on script revisions, with Barrymore pushing her to &quot;avoid her story&#x27;s tidier prospects, to make things &#x27;more raw and open ended.&#x27;&quot; While the film found limited box office receipts, it was favorably received; according to review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, critics agreed that her &quot;directorial debut has enough charm, energy, and good-natured humor to transcend its many cliches&quot;. For her venture, Barrymore garnered nominations for a Bronze Horse at the Stockholm Film Festival and for the EDA Female Focus Award at the 2009 Alliance of Women Film Journalists. In &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fine&quot;, Barrymore played the daughter of a recently widowed retiree (Robert De Niro). The drama flopped at the box office, but Stephen Holden for &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered Barrymore &quot;as ingenuous as ever&quot; in what he described as a &quot;small role.&quot;

Barrymore starred with Justin Long in Nanette Burstein&#x27;s film &quot;Going the Distance&quot;. It follows a couple dealing the ups and downs of a long-distance relationship, while commuting between New York City and San Francisco. It garnered generally mixed reviews by critics, who summed it as &quot;timelier and a little more honest than most romantic comedies&quot;, and budgeted at US$32 million, the film made US$40 million at the worldwide box office.

On August 2, 2011, Barrymore directed the music video for the song &quot;Our Deal,&quot; for the band Best Coast, which features Chloë Grace Moretz, Miranda Cosgrove, Tyler Posey, Donald Glover, Shailene Woodley and Alia Shawkat. Barrymore starred in the biopic film &quot;Big Miracle&quot;, which covers Operation Breakthrough, the 1988 international effort to rescue gray whales from being trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska. Her character, Rachel Kramer, is based on Greenpeace activist Cindy Lowry. Despite a positive critical reception, the film flopped at the box office.

In &quot;Blended&quot;, Barrymore played a recently divorced woman ending up on a family resort with a widower (Sandler). Film critic James Berardinelli dismissed the &quot;hit-and-miss humor&quot; of the story and wrote that &quot;as [Sandler and Barrymore] are concerned, the third time is definitely not the charm&quot;, as part of an overall lukewarm critical response. The film ultimately grossed US$128 million worldwide. She and Toni Collette starred in &quot;Miss You Already&quot; (2015), as two long-time friends whose relationship is put to the test when one starts a family and the other becomes ill. Reviewers embraced the film, while it received a limited theatrical release.

In the Netflix original television series &quot;Santa Clarita Diet&quot;, Barrymore played a real estate agent who, after experiencing a physical transformation into a zombie, starts craving human flesh. Along with co-star Timothy Olyphant, Barrymore served as an executive producer on the single-camera series, which was favorably received upon its premiere; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that &quot;much of [the series&#x27; laughs] comes down to the uncrushable Drew Barrymore charm&quot; and furthermore remarked: &quot;The show is a welcome comeback for Barrymore, the eternally beloved grunge-era wild thing—it&#x27;s not just her big move into TV, but her first high-profile performance anywhere in years. In a way, it circles back to the roles she was doing in the early [90s], playing deadly vixens in flicks like &quot;Guncrazy&quot; or &quot;Doppelganger&quot;&quot;.

===2020–present: &quot;The Drew Barrymore Show&quot; ===
Barrymore starred in Jamie Babbit&#x27;s film &quot;The Stand In&quot;. It was set to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2020, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 14, 2020, Barrymore launched a syndicated daytime talk show, &quot;The Drew Barrymore Show&quot;, which is also available on Spotify in a podcast format. On December 4, 2020, she appeared as a guest star on &quot;Martha Knows Best&quot;. On March 11, 2021, Barrymore said she was taking an indefinite hiatus from acting. She wrote a cookbook with chef Pilar Valdes entitled &quot;Rebel Homemaker&quot;, which was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. In June 2021, she launched &quot;Drew Magazine&quot;, a quarterly released lifestyle magazine by publisher Bauer Media USA. Barrymore was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2023.

In September 2023, Barrymore announced she would continue her syndicated TV talk show despite the ongoing WGA strike, writing, “I own this choice”, when explaining her reasoning via social media. While SAG had stated that as the host of the show she was not under any obligation to strike, her show continued without unionized writing staff. Audience members showing support for the Writer&#x27;s Guild were kicked out of the studio and had any WGA pins confiscated. Due to these events, the National Book Foundation removed Barrymore from being the host of the then upcoming 74th National Book Awards. Barrymore apologized for her actions later that week in a video on Instagram, claiming that, &quot;I believe there&#x27;s nothing I can do or say in this moment to make it OK.&quot; Barrymore deleted the apology video from her account following criticism. On the 17th, Barrymore announced on her Instagram account that she would be postponing production of her talk show until the strike ends due to the backlash, writing, &quot;I have listened to everyone, and I am making the decision to pause the show&#x27;s premiere until the strike is over”. She also added, “I have no words to express my deepest apologies to anyone I have hurt, and, of course, to our incredible team who works on the show and has made it what it is today”. A spokesperson for CBS Media Ventures said, &quot;We support Drew&#x27;s decision to pause the show&#x27;s return and understand how complex and difficult this process has been for her.&quot;

The company partnered with her because &quot;she emulates the iconic image of CoverGirl with her fresh, natural beauty and energetic yet authentic spirit,&quot; said Esi Eggleston Bracey, vice president and general manager of CoverGirl Cosmetics North America. She brought not only her personality into this endorsement but also her creative side, as she also helped create the ads.

In an interview with &quot;Contactmusic.com&quot; in 2003, Barrymore said: &quot;Do I like women sexually? Yeah, I do. Totally. I have always considered myself bisexual. I love a woman&#x27;s body. I think a woman and a woman together are beautiful, just as a man and a woman together are beautiful. Being with a woman is like exploring your own body, but through someone else&quot;.

Barrymore is the godmother of Frances Bean Cobain, the daughter of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love.

<text>David Wark Griffith (January 22, 1875 – July 23, 1948) was an American film director. Considered one of the most influential figures in the history of the motion picture, he pioneered many aspects of film editing and expanded the art of the narrative film.

To modern audiences, Griffith is known primarily for directing the 1915 film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. One of the most financially successful films of all time and considered a landmark by film historians, it has attracted much controversy for its degrading portrayals of African Americans, its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan, and support for the Confederacy. The film led to riots in several major cities all over the United States and the NAACP attempted to have it banned. Griffith made his next film &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916) as an answer to critics, who he felt unfairly maligned his work.

Together with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, Griffith founded the studio United Artists in 1919 with the goal of enabling actors and directors to make films on their own terms, as opposed to the terms of commercial studios. Several of Griffith&#x27;s later films were successful, including &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; (1919), &quot;Way Down East&quot; (1920), and &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; (1921), but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure. He had made roughly 500 films by the time of &quot;The Struggle&quot; (1931), his final feature, and all but three were completely silent.

==Early life==

Griffith was born on January 22, 1875, on a farm in Oldham County, Kentucky, the son of Jacob Wark &quot;Roaring Jake&quot; Griffith, a Confederate Army colonel in the American Civil War who was elected as a Kentucky state legislator, and Mary Perkins (née Oglesby). Griffith was raised as a Methodist, and he attended a one-room schoolhouse, where he was taught by his older sister Mattie. His father died when he was 10, and the family struggled with poverty.

When Griffith was 14, his mother abandoned the farm and moved the family to Louisville, Kentucky; there she opened a boarding house, which was unsuccessful. Griffith then left high school to help support the family, taking a job in a dry goods store and later in a bookstore. He began his creative career as an actor in touring companies. Meanwhile, he was learning how to become a playwright, but he had little success. Only one of his plays was accepted for a performance. He traveled to New York City in 1907 in an attempt to sell a script to Edison Studios producer Edwin Porter; although Porter rejected the script, he gave Griffith an acting part in &quot;Rescued from an Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; instead. As a result of this experience, Griffith decided to try his luck as an actor, and he appeared in many films as an extra.
== Early film career ==

In 1908, Griffith accepted a role as a stage extra in &quot;Professional Jealousy&quot; for the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, where he met cameraman Billy Bitzer. In 1908, Biograph&#x27;s main director Wallace McCutcheon Sr. fell ill, and his son Wallace McCutcheon Jr. took his place. McCutcheon Jr. did not bring the studio success; Biograph co-founder Harry Marvin then gave Griffith the position, and he made the short &quot;The Adventures of Dollie&quot;. He directed a total of 48 shorts for the company that year.

Among the films he directed in 1909 was &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot;, an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; novel. Showing the influence of Dickens on his own film narrative, Griffith employed the technique of cross-cutting—where two stories run alongside each other, as seen in Dickens&#x27; novels such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. When criticized by a cameraman for doing this technique in a later film, Griffith was said to have replied &quot;Well, doesn&#x27;t Dickens write that way?&quot;.

His short &quot;In Old California&quot; (1910) was the first film shot in Hollywood, California. Four years later, he produced and directed his first feature film &quot;Judith of Bethulia&quot; (1914), one of the early films to be produced in the U.S. Biograph believed that longer features were not viable at this point. According to Lillian Gish, the company thought that &quot;a movie that long would hurt [the audience&#x27;s] eyes&quot;.

Griffith left Biograph because of company resistance to his goals and his cost overruns on the film. He took his company of actors with him and joined the Mutual Film Corporation. There he co-produced &quot;The Life of General Villa&quot;, a silent biographical-action movie starring Pancho Villa as himself, shot on location in Mexico during a civil war. He formed a studio with Majestic Studios manager Harry Aitken, which became known as Reliance-Majestic Studios and later was renamed Fine Arts Studios. His new production company became an autonomous production unit partner in the Triangle Film Corporation along with Thomas H. Ince and Keystone Studios&#x27; Mack Sennett. The Triangle Film Corporation was headed by Aitken, who was released from the Mutual Film Corporation, and his brother Roy.

Griffith directed and produced &quot;The Clansman&quot; through Reliance-Majestic Studios in 1915. The film later became known as &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. It is one of the early feature length American films. The film was a success, but its depiction of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, race relations in the American Civil War, and the Reconstruction era of the United States aroused much controversy. It was based on Thomas Dixon Jr.&#x27;s 1905 novel &quot;The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan&quot;, which casts Southern slavery as benign, the enfranchisement of freedmen as a corrupt plot by the Republican Party, and the Ku Klux Klan as a band of heroes restoring the rightful order. This view of the era was popular at the time and was endorsed for decades by historians of the Dunning School, but it met with strong criticism from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and other groups.

The NAACP attempted to stop showings of the film. This ban was successful in some cities, but nonetheless it was shown widely and became the most successful box-office attraction of its time. It is considered among the first &quot;blockbuster&quot; motion pictures, and it broke all box-office records that had been established until then. &quot;They lost track of the money it made&quot;, Lillian Gish remarked in a Kevin Brownlow interview.

Audiences in some major northern cities rioted over the film&#x27;s racial content and the violence. Griffith&#x27;s indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him the following year to produce &quot;Intolerance&quot;, in which he portrayed the effects of intolerance in four different historical periods: the Fall of Babylon; the Crucifixion of Jesus; the events surrounding the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre (during religious persecution of French Huguenots); and a modern story. &quot;Intolerance&quot; was not a financial success; it did not bring in enough profits to cover the lavish road show that accompanied it. Griffith put a huge budget into the film&#x27;s production that could not be recovered in its box office. He mostly financed &quot;Intolerance&quot; himself, which contributed to his financial ruin for the rest of his life.

Griffith&#x27;s production partnership was dissolved in 1917, and he went to Artcraft, part of Paramount Pictures, and then to First National Pictures (1919–1920). At the same time, he founded United Artists together with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks; the studio was based on allowing actors to control their own interests rather than being dependent upon commercial studios.

He continued to make films, but he never again achieved box-office grosses as high as either &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; or &quot;Intolerance&quot;.

== Later film career ==
Although United Artists survived as a company, Griffith&#x27;s association with it was short-lived. While some of his later films did well at the box office, commercial success often eluded him. Griffith features from this period include &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; (1919), &quot;Way Down East&quot; (1920), &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; (1921), &quot;Dream Street&quot; (1921), &quot;One Exciting Night&quot; (1922), &quot;The White Rose&quot; (1923), &quot;America&quot; (1924) and &quot;Isn&#x27;t Life Wonderful&quot; (1924). Of these, the first three were successes at the box office. Griffith was forced to leave United Artists after &quot;Isn&#x27;t Life Wonderful&quot; (1924) failed at the box office.

He made &quot;Lady of the Pavements&quot; (1929), a part sound film, and only two full-sound films: &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Struggle&quot; (1931). Neither was successful, and after &quot;The Struggle&quot;, he never made another film.

In 1936, director Woody Van Dyke, who had worked as Griffith&#x27;s apprentice on &quot;Intolerance&quot;, asked Griffith to help him shoot the famous earthquake sequence for &quot;San Francisco&quot;, but Griffith was not given any film credit. Starring Clark Gable, Jeanette MacDonald and Spencer Tracy, it was the top-grossing film of the year.

In 1939, the producer Hal Roach hired Griffith to produce &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939) and &quot;One Million B.C.&quot; (1940). He wrote to Griffith: &quot;I need help from the production side to select the proper writers, cast, et cetera, and to help me generally in the supervision of these pictures.&quot;

Although Griffith eventually disagreed with Roach over the production and departed, Roach later insisted that some of the scenes in the completed film were directed by Griffith. This movie was the final production in which Griffith was involved. However, cast members&#x27; accounts recall Griffith directing only the screen tests and costume tests. When Roach advertised the film in late 1939 with Griffith listed as producer, Griffith asked that his name be removed.

Griffith was for decades held in awe by many members of the film industry. He was presented with an honorary Oscar by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1936. In 1946, he made an impromptu visit to the film location of David O. Selznick&#x27;s epic western &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;, where some of his veteran actors—Lillian Gish, Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey—were cast members. Gish and Barrymore found their mentor&#x27;s presence distracting, and they became self-conscious; in response, Griffith hid behind the scenery when the two were filming their scenes.

== Death ==
On the morning of July 23, 1948, Griffith was discovered unconscious in the lobby at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Los Angeles, where he had been living alone. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage on the way to a Hollywood hospital. A public memorial service was held in his honor at the Hollywood Masonic Temple. He is buried at Mount Tabor Methodist Church Graveyard in Centerfield, Kentucky. In 1950, The Directors Guild of America provided a stone and bronze monument for his grave site.

== Legacy ==
Griffith has a controversial legacy. Despite criticism, he was a widely celebrated and respected public figure during his life, and modern film historians continue to recognize him for his contributions to the craft of filmmaking. Nevertheless, many critics during his lifetime, as well as in the decades since his death, have characterized him and his work (most notably &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;) as upholding white supremacist ideals. Historians frequently cite &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; as a major factor in the KKK&#x27;s revival in the 20th century, and it remains controversial to this day.

Performer and director Charlie Chaplin called Griffith &quot;The Teacher of Us All&quot;. Filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Lev Kuleshov, Jean Renoir, Cecil B. DeMille, King Vidor, Victor Fleming, Raoul Walsh, Carl Theodor Dreyer, and Stanley Kubrick have praised Griffith. Sergei Eisenstein expressed his admiration for Griffith as an &quot;outstanding master&quot;, but criticized &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;, calling it &quot;disgraceful propaganda of racial hatred towards the colored people&quot;.

Griffith seems to have been one of the first to understand how certain film techniques could be used to create an expressive language; it gained popular recognition with the release of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915). His early shorts —such as Biograph&#x27;s &quot;The Musketeers of Pig Alley&quot; (1912), show that Griffith&#x27;s attention to camera placement and lighting heightened mood and tension. In making &quot;Intolerance&quot;, Griffith opened new possibilities for the medium, creating a form that seems to owe more to music than to traditional narrative.

* In the 1951 &quot;Philco Television Playhouse&quot; episode &quot;The Birth of the Movies&quot;, events from Griffith&#x27;s film career were depicted. Griffith was played by John Newland.
* In 1953 the Directors Guild of America (DGA) instituted the D. W. Griffith Award, its highest honor. However, on December 15, 1999, then DGA President Jack Shea and the DGA National Board announced that the award would be renamed as the &quot;DGA Lifetime Achievement Award&quot;. They stated that, although Griffith was extremely talented, they felt his film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; had &quot;helped foster intolerable racial stereotypes&quot;, and that it was thus better not to have the top award in his name.
* On February 8, 1960, Griffith was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is located at 6535 Hollywood Boulevard.
* In 1975, Griffith was honored on a 10-cent postage stamp by the United States.

<doc id="7890" wikidata="Q25391" url="?curid=7890" title="Dune">
<text>A dune is a landform composed of wind- or water-driven sand. It typically takes the form of a mound, ridge, or hill. An area with dunes is called a dune system or a dune complex. A large dune complex is called a dune field, while broad, flat regions covered with wind-swept sand or dunes, with little or no vegetation, are called &quot;ergs&quot; or &quot;sand seas&quot;. Dunes occur in different shapes and sizes, but most kinds of dunes are longer on the (upflow) side, where the sand is pushed up the dune, and have a shorter &quot;slip face&quot; in the lee side. The valley or trough between dunes is called a &quot;dune slack&quot;.

Dunes are most common in desert environments, where the lack of moisture hinders the growth of vegetation that would otherwise interfere with the development of dunes. However, sand deposits are not restricted to deserts, and dunes are also found along sea shores, along streams in semiarid climates, in areas of glacial outwash, and in other areas where poorly cemented sandstone bedrock disintegrates to produce an ample supply of loose sand. Subaqueous dunes can form from the action of water flow (fluvial processes) on sand or gravel beds of rivers, estuaries, and the sea-bed.

Some coastal areas have one or more sets of dunes running parallel to the shoreline directly inland from the beach. In most cases, the dunes are important in protecting the land against potential ravages by storm waves from the sea. Artificial dunes are sometimes constructed to protect coastal areas. The dynamic action of wind and water can sometimes cause dunes to drift, which can have serious consequences. For example, the town of Eucla, Western Australia, had to be relocated in the 1890s because of dune drift.

The modern word &quot;dune&quot; came into English from French around 1790, which in turn came from Middle Dutch &quot;dūne&quot;.

==Formation==
A universally precise distinction does not exist between ripples, dunes, and draas, which are all deposits of the same type of materials. Dunes are generally defined as greater than 7 cm tall and may have ripples, while ripples are deposits that are less than 3 cm tall. A draa is a very large aeolian landform, with a length of several kilometers and a height of tens to hundreds of meters, and which may have superimposed dunes.
Dunes are made of sand-sized particles, and may consist of quartz, calcium carbonate, snow, gypsum, or other materials. The upwind/upstream/upcurrent side of the dune is called the stoss side; the downflow side is called the lee side. Sand is pushed (creep) or bounces (saltation) up the stoss side, and slides down the lee side. A side of a dune that the sand has slid down is called a slip face (or slipface).

The Bagnold formula gives the speed at which particles can be transported.

==Aeolian dunes==

===Aeolian dune shapes===
Five basic dune types are recognized: crescentic, linear, star, dome, and parabolic. Dune areas may occur in three forms: simple (isolated dunes of basic type), compound (larger dunes on which smaller dunes of same type form), and complex (combinations of different types).

====Barchan or crescentic====
Barchan dunes are crescent-shaped mounds which are generally wider than they are long. The lee-side slipfaces are on the concave sides of the dunes. These dunes form under winds that blow consistently from one direction (unimodal
winds). They form separate crescents when the sand supply is comparatively small. When the sand supply is greater, they may merge into barchanoid ridges, and then transverse dunes (see below).

Some types of crescentic dunes move more quickly over desert surfaces than any other type of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 metres per year between 1954 and 1959 in China&#x27;s Ningxia Province, and similar speeds have been recorded in the Western Desert of Egypt. The largest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than three kilometres, are in China&#x27;s Taklamakan Desert.

====Transverse dunes====
Abundant barchan dunes may merge into barchanoid ridges, which then grade into linear (or slightly sinuous) transverse dunes, so called because they lie transverse, or across, the wind direction, with the wind blowing perpendicular to the ridge crest.

====Seif or longitudinal dunes====

Seif dunes are linear (or slightly sinuous) dunes with two slip faces. The dunes lie generally parallel to each other The two slip faces make them sharp-crested. They are called &quot;seif&quot; dunes after the Arabic word for &quot;sword&quot;. They may be more than 160 kilometres (100 miles) long, and thus easily visible in satellite images (see illustrations).

Seif dunes are associated with bidirectional winds. The long axes and ridges of these dunes extend along the resultant direction of sand movement (hence the name &quot;longitudinal&quot;). Some linear dunes merge to form Y-shaped compound dunes.

Formation is debated. Ralph Bagnold, in &quot;The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes&quot;, suggested that some seif dunes form when a barchan dune moves into a bidirectional wind regime, and one arm or wing of the crescent elongates. Others suggest that seif dunes are formed by vortices in a unidirectional wind. In the sheltered troughs between highly developed seif dunes, barchans may be formed, because the wind is constrained to be unidirectional by the dunes.


Seif dunes are common in the Sahara. They range up to in height and in length. In the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula, a vast erg, called the Rub&#x27; al Khali or Empty Quarter, contains seif dunes that stretch for almost and reach heights of over .

Linear loess hills known as pahas are superficially similar. These hills appear to have been formed during the last ice age under permafrost conditions dominated by sparse tundra vegetation.

====Star====

Star dunes are pyramidal sand mounds with slipfaces on three or more arms that radiate from the high center of the mound. They tend to accumulate in areas with multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally. They dominate the Grand Erg Oriental of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around the margins of the sand seas, particularly near topographic barriers. In the southeast Badain Jaran Desert of China, the star dunes are up to 500 metres tall and may be the tallest dunes on Earth.

====Dome====
Oval or circular mounds that generally lack a slipface. Dome dunes are rare and occur at the far upwind margins of sand seas.

=====Lunettes=====
Fixed crescentic dunes that form on the leeward margins of playas and river valleys in arid and semiarid regions in response to the direction (s) of prevailing winds, are known as lunettes, source-bordering dunes, bourrelets and clay dunes. They may be composed of clay, silt, sand, or gypsum, eroded from the basin floor or shore, transported up the concave side of the dune, and deposited on the convex side. Examples in Australia are up to 6.5 km long, 1 km wide, and up to 50 metres high. They also occur in southern and West Africa, and in parts of the western United States, especially Texas.

====Parabolic====

U-shaped mounds of sand with convex noses trailed by elongated arms are parabolic dunes. These dunes are formed from blowout dunes where the erosion of vegetated sand leads to a U-shaped depression. The elongated arms are held in place by vegetation; the largest arm known on Earth reaches 12 km. Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped, blowout, or hairpin dunes, and they are well known in coastal deserts. Unlike crescent shaped dunes, their crests point upwind. The bulk of the sand in the dune migrates forward.

In plan view, these are U-shaped or V-shaped mounds of well-sorted, very fine to medium sand with elongated arms that extend upwind behind the central part of the dune. There are slipfaces that often occur on the outer side of the nose and on the outer slopes of the arms.

These dunes often occur in semiarid areas where the precipitation is retained in the lower parts of the dune and underlying soils. The stability of the dunes was once attributed to the vegetative cover but recent research has pointed to water as the main source of parabolic dune stability. The vegetation that covers them—grasses, shrubs, and trees—help anchor the trailing arms. In inland deserts, parabolic dunes commonly originate and extend downwind from blowouts in sand sheets only partly anchored by vegetation. They can also originate from beach sands and extend inland into vegetated areas in coastal zones and on shores of large lakes.

Most parabolic dunes do not reach heights higher than a few tens of metres except at their nose, where vegetation stops or slows the advance of accumulating sand.

Simple parabolic dunes have only one set of arms that trail upwind, behind the leading nose. Compound parabolic dunes are coalesced features with several sets of trailing arms. Complex parabolic dunes include subsidiary superposed or coalesced forms, usually of barchanoid or linear shapes.

Parabolic dunes, like crescent dunes, occur in areas where very strong winds are mostly unidirectional. Although these dunes are found in areas now characterized by variable wind speeds, the effective winds associated with the growth and migration of both the parabolic and crescent dunes probably are the most consistent in wind direction.

The grain size for these well-sorted, very fine to medium sands is about 0.06 to 0.5 mm. Parabolic dunes have loose sand and steep slopes only on their outer flanks. The inner slopes are mostly well packed and anchored by vegetation, as are the corridors between individual dunes. Because all dune arms are oriented in the same direction, and, the inter-dune corridors are generally swept clear of loose sand, the corridors can usually be traversed in between the trailing arms of the dune. However to cross straight over the dune by going over the trailing arms, can be very difficult. Also, traversing the nose is very difficult as well because the nose is usually made up of loose sand without much if any vegetation.

A type of extensive parabolic dune that lacks discernible slipfaces and has mostly coarse grained sand is known as a &quot;zibar&quot;. The term zibar comes from the Arabic word to describe &quot;rolling transverse ridges ... with a hard surface&quot;. The dunes are small, have low relief, and can be found in many places across the planet from Wyoming (United States) to Saudi Arabia to Australia. Spacing between zibars ranges from 50 to 400 metres and they do not become more than 10 metres high. The dunes form at about ninety degrees to the prevailing wind which blows away the small, fine-grained sand leaving behind the coarser grained sand to form the crest.

====Reversing dunes====

Occurring wherever winds periodically reverse direction, reversing dunes are varieties of any of the above shapes. These dunes typically have major and minor slipfaces oriented in opposite directions. The minor slipfaces are usually temporary, as they appear after a reverse wind and are generally destroyed when the wind next blows in the dominant direction.

====Draas====

Draas are very large-scale dune bedforms; they may be tens or a few hundreds of metres in height, kilometres wide, and hundreds of kilometres in length. After a draa has reached a certain size, it generally develops superimposed dune forms. They are thought to be more ancient and slower-moving than smaller dunes, and to form by vertical growth of existing dunes. Draas are widespread in sand seas and are well-represented in the geological record.

===Dune complexity===
All these dune shapes may occur in three forms: simple (isolated dunes of basic type), compound (larger dunes on which smaller dunes of same type form), and complex (combinations of different types). Simple dunes are basic forms with the minimum number of slipfaces that define the geometric type. Compound dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are superimposed. Complex dunes are combinations of two or more dune types. A crescentic dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest is the most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that has not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the dune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of the wind has changed.

===Dune movement===
The sand mass of dunes can move either windward or leeward, depending on if the wind is making contact with the dune from below or above its apogee. If wind hits from above, the sand particles move leeward; the leeward flux of sand is greater than the windward flux. Conversely, if sand hits from below, sand particles move windward. Further, if the wind is carrying sand particles when it hits the dune, the dune&#x27;s sand particles will saltate more than if the wind had hit the dune without carrying sand particles.

===Coastal dunes===

Coastal dunes form when wet sand is deposited along the coast and dries out and is blown along the beach. Dunes form where the beach is wide enough to allow for the accumulation of wind-blown sand, and where prevailing onshore winds tend to blow sand inland. The three key ingredients for coastal dune formation are a large sand supply, winds to move said sand supply, and a place for the sand supply to accumulate. Obstacles—for example, vegetation, pebbles and so on—tend to slow down the wind and lead to the deposition of sand grains. These small &quot;incipient dunes or &quot;shadow dunes&quot; tend to grow in the vertical direction if the obstacle slowing the wind can also grow vertically (i.e., vegetation). Coastal dunes expand laterally as a result of lateral growth of coastal plants via seed or rhizome. Models of coastal dunes suggest that their final equilibrium height is related to the distance between the water line and where vegetation can grow. Coastal dunes can be classified by where they develop, or begin to take shape. Dunes are commonly grouped into either the Primary Dune Group or the Secondary Dune Group. Primary dunes gain most of their sand from the beach itself, while secondary dunes gain their sand from the primary dune. Along the Florida Panhandle, most dunes are considered to be foredunes or hummocks. Different locations around the globe have dune formations unique to their given coastal profile.

Coastal sand dunes can provide privacy and/or habitats to support local flora and fauna. Animals such as sand snakes, lizards, and rodents can live in coastal sand dunes, along with insects of all types. Often the vegetation of sand dunes is discussed without acknowledging the importance that coastal dunes have for animals. Further, some animals, such as foxes and feral pigs can use coastal dunes as hunting grounds to find food. Birds are also known to utilize coastal dunes as nesting grounds. All these species find the coastal environment of the sand dune vital to their species&#x27; survival.

Over the course of time coastal dunes may be impacted by tropical cyclones or other intense storm activity, dependent on their location. Recent work has suggested that coastal dunes tend to evolve toward a high or low morphology depending on the growth rate of dunes relative to storm frequency. During a storm event, dunes play a significant role in minimizing wave energy as it moves onshore. As a result, coastal dunes, especially those in the foredune area affected by a storm surge, will retreat or erode. To counteract the damage from tropical activity on coastal dunes, short term post-storm efforts can be made by individual agencies through fencing to help with sand accumulation.

How much a dune erodes during any storm surge is related to its location on the coastal shoreline and the profile of the beach during a particular season. In those areas with harsher winter weather, during the summer a beach tends to take on more of a convex appearance due to gentler waves, while the same beach in the winter may take on more of a concave appearance. As a result, coastal dunes can get eroded much more quickly in the winter than in the summer. The converse is true in areas with harsher summer weather.

There are many threats to these coastal communities. Some coastal dunes, for example ones in San Francisco, have been completely altered by urbanization; reshaping the dune for human use. This puts native species at risk. Another danger, in California and places in the UK specifically, is the introduction of invasive species. Plant species, such as &quot;Carpobrotus edulis&quot;, were introduced from South Africa in an attempt to stabilize the dunes and provide horticultural benefits, but instead spread taking land away from native species. &quot;Ammophila arenaria&quot;, known as European beachgrass, has a similar story, though it has no horticulture benefits. It has great ground coverage and, as intended, stabilized the dunes but as an unintended side effect prevented native species from thriving in those dunes. One such example is the dune field at Point Reyes, California. There are now efforts to get rid of both of these invasive species.

====Ecological succession on coastal dunes====
As a dune forms, plant succession occurs. The conditions on an &quot;embryo dune&quot; are harsh, with salt spray from the sea carried on strong winds. The dune is well drained and often dry, and composed of calcium carbonate from seashells. Rotting seaweed, brought in by storm waves adds nutrients to allow pioneer species to colonize the dune. For example, in the United Kingdom these pioneer species are often marram grass, sea wort grass and other sea grasses. These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the foredune, typically having deep roots which reach the water table, root nodules that produce nitrogen compounds, and protected stoma, reducing transpiration. Also, the deep roots bind the sand together, and the dune grows into a foredune as more sand is blown over the grasses. The grasses add nitrogen to the soil, meaning other, less hardy plants can then colonize the dunes. Typically these are heather, heaths and gorses. These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration. Heather adds humus to the soil and is usually replaced by coniferous trees, which can tolerate low soil pH, caused by the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter with nitrate leaching. Coniferous forests and heathland are common climax communities for sand dune systems.

Young dunes are called yellow dunes and dunes which have high humus content are called grey dunes. Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into the slacks, and the slacks may be much more developed than the exposed tops of the dunes. It is usually in the slacks that more rare species are developed and there is a tendency for the dune slacks&#x27; soil to be waterlogged where only marsh plants can survive. In Europe these plants include: creeping willow, cotton grass, yellow iris, reeds, and rushes. As for vertebrates in European dunes, natterjack toads sometimes breed here.

==== Coastal dune floral adaptations ====
Dune ecosystems are extremely difficult places for plants to survive. This is due to a number of pressures related to their proximity to the ocean and confinement to growth on sandy substrates. These include:
* Little available soil moisture
* Little available soil organic matter/nutrients/water
* Harsh winds
* Salt spray
* Erosion/shifting and sometimes burial or exposure (from shifting)
* Tidal influences
Plants have evolved many adaptations to cope with these pressures:
* Deep taproot to reach water table (Pink Sand Verbena)
* Shallow but extensive root systems
*Rhizomes
* Prostrate growth form to avoid wind/salt spray (&quot;Abronia spp&quot;., Beach Primrose)
* Krummholz growth form (Monterrey Cypress-not a dune plant but deals with similar pressures)
* Thickened cuticle/Succulence to reduce moisture loss and reduce salt uptake (&quot;Ambrosia/Abronia spp., Calystegia soldanella&quot;)
* Pale leaves to reduce insolation (&quot;Artemisia/Ambrosia spp.&quot;)
* Thorny/Spiky seeds to ensure establishment in vicinity of parent, reduces chances of being blown away or swept out to sea (&quot;Ambrosia chamissonis&quot;)

===Gypsum dunes===

In deserts where large amounts of limestone mountains surround a closed basin, such as at White Sands National Park in south-central New Mexico, occasional storm runoff transports dissolved limestone and gypsum into a low-lying pan within the basin where the water evaporates, depositing the gypsum and forming crystals known as selenite. The crystals left behind by this process are eroded by the wind and deposited as vast white dune fields that resemble snow-covered landscapes. These types of dune are rare, and only form in closed arid basins that retain the highly soluble gypsum that would otherwise be washed into the sea.

===Nabkha dunes===
A nabkha, or coppice dune, is a small dune anchored by vegetation. They usually indicate desertification or soil erosion, and serve as nesting and burrow sites for animals.

==Sub-aqueous dunes==

Sub-aqueous (underwater) dunes form on a bed of sand or gravel under the actions of water flow. They are ubiquitous in natural channels such as rivers and estuaries, and also form in engineered canals and pipelines. Dunes move downstream as the upstream slope is eroded and the sediment deposited on the downstream or lee slope in typical bedform construction. In the case of sub-aqueous barchan dunes, sediment is lost by their extremities, known as horns.

These dunes most often form as a continuous &#x27;train&#x27; of dunes, showing remarkable similarity in wavelength and height. The shape of a dune gives information about its formation environment. For instance, rivers produce asymmetrical ripples, with the steeper slip face facing downstream. Ripple marks preserved in sedimentary strata in the geological record can be used to determine the direction of current flow, and thus an indication of the source of the sediments.

Dunes on the bed of a channel significantly increase flow resistance, their presence and growth playing a major part in river flooding.

==Lithified dunes==

A lithified (consolidated) sand dune is a type of sandstone that is formed when a marine or aeolian sand dune becomes compacted and hardened. Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the colour of the rock. Cross-bedded layers of stacks of lithified dunes can produce the cross-hatching patterns, such as those seen in Zion National Park in the western United States.

A slang term, used in the southwest US, for consolidated and hardened sand dunes is &quot;slickrock&quot;, a name that was introduced by pioneers of the Old West because their steel-rimmed wagon wheels could not gain traction on the rock.

==Desertification==

Sand dunes can have a negative impact on humans when they encroach on human habitats. Sand dunes move via a few different means, all of them helped along by wind. One way that dunes can move is by saltation, where sand particles skip along the ground like a bouncing ball. When these skipping particles land, they may knock into other particles and cause them to move as well, in a process known as creep. With slightly stronger winds, particles collide in mid-air, causing sheet flows. In a major dust storm, dunes may move tens of metres through such sheet flows. Also as in the case of snow, sand avalanches, falling down the slipface of the dunes—that face away from the winds—also move the dunes forward.

Sand threatens buildings and crops in Africa, the Middle East, and China. Drenching sand dunes with oil stops their migration, but this approach uses a valuable resource and is quite destructive to the dunes&#x27; animal habitats. Sand fences might also slow their movement to a crawl, but geologists are still analyzing results for the optimum fence designs. Preventing sand dunes from overwhelming towns, villages, and agricultural areas has become a priority for the United Nations Environment Programme. Planting dunes with vegetation also helps to stabilise them.

==Conservation==

Dune habitats provide niches for highly specialized plants and animals, including numerous rare species and some endangered species. Due to widespread human population expansion, dunes face destruction through land development and recreational usages, as well as alteration to prevent the encroachment of sand onto inhabited areas. Some countries, notably the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Sri Lanka have developed significant programs of dune protection through the use of sand dune stabilization. In the U.K., a Biodiversity Action Plan has been developed to assess dunes loss and to prevent future dunes destruction.

===Extraterrestrial dunes===
Dunes can likely be found in any environment where there is a substantial atmosphere, winds, and dust to be blown. Dunes are common on Mars and in the equatorial regions of Titan.

Titan&#x27;s dunes include large expanses with modal lengths of about 20–30 km. The regions are not topographically confined, resembling sand seas. These dunes are interpreted to be longitudinal dunes whose crests are oriented parallel to the dominant wind direction, which generally indicates west-to-east wind flow. The sand is likely composed of hydrocarbon particles, possibly with some water ice mixed in.

Dunes are a popular theme in science fiction, featuring in depictions of dry Desert planets appearing as early as the 1956 film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; and Frank Herbert&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot;. The environment of the desert planet Arrakis (also known as Dune) in the &quot;Dune&quot; franchise &quot;Dune&quot; in turn inspired the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, which includes prominent theme of dunes on fictional planets such as Tatooine, Geonosis, and Jakku.

<text>David Keith Lynch (January 20, 1946 – January 16, 2025) was an American filmmaker, visual artist, musician, and actor. Widely considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Lynch was often called a &quot;visionary&quot; and was acclaimed for films often distinguished by their surrealist and experimental qualities. In a career spanning more than five decades, he received numerous accolades, including the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the Venice Film Festival in 2006 and an Honorary Academy Award in 2019.

Lynch studied painting and made short films before making his first feature, the independent body horror film &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977), which found success as a midnight movie. He earned critical acclaim and nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director for the biographical drama &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980), the mystery thriller &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), and the neo-noir &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001). For his romantic crime drama &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990), he received the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. He also directed the space opera &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), the neo-noir &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997), the road movie &quot;The Straight Story&quot; (1999), and the experimental thriller &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006).

Lynch and Mark Frost created the ABC surrealist horror-mystery series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–91), for which he received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. Lynch co-wrote and directed its film prequel, &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992) and a third season in 2017. His acting career included roles on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; (2010–13), and &quot;Louie&quot; (2012), and in the films &quot;Lucky&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022). He directed music videos for Chris Isaak, X Japan, Moby, Interpol, Nine Inch Nails and Donovan, and commercials for Dior, YSL, Gucci and the New York City Department of Sanitation.

Lynch also worked as a musician, releasing solo albums, and as a furniture designer, cartoonist, animator, photographer, and author. A practitioner of Transcendental Meditation, he founded the David Lynch Foundation to fund meditation lessons for at-risk populations. A lifelong smoker, he died from complications of emphysema after being evacuated from his home due to the January 2025 Southern California wildfires.

==Early life and education ==

David Keith Lynch was born in Missoula, Montana, on January 20, 1946. The first film he saw was Henry King&#x27;s &quot;Wait till the Sun Shines, Nellie&quot; (1952). His father, Donald Walton Lynch (1915–2007), was a research scientist working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and his mother, Edwina &quot;Sunny&quot; Lynch (née Sundholm; 1919–2004), was an English language tutor. Two of Lynch&#x27;s maternal great-grandparents were Finnish-Swedish immigrants who arrived in the U.S. during the 19th century. He recalled that his father &quot;would drive me through the woods in his green Forest Service truck, over dirt roads, through the most beautiful forests where the trees are very tall and shafts of sunlight come down and in the mountain streams the rainbow trout leap out and their little trout sides catch glimpses of light. Then my father would drop me in the woods and go off. It was a weird, comforting feeling being in the woods.&quot; He was raised as a Presbyterian. The Lynches often moved around according to where the USDA assigned Donald: Lynch moved with his parents to Sandpoint, Idaho, when he was two months old; two years later, after his brother John was born, the family moved to Spokane, Washington. Lynch&#x27;s sister Martha was born there. The family then moved to Durham, North Carolina, Boise, Idaho, and Alexandria, Virginia. Lynch adjusted to this transitory early life with relative ease, noting that he usually had no issue making new friends whenever he started attending a new school. Of his early life, he remarked:


Alongside his schooling, Lynch joined the Boy Scouts. Later, he said he &quot;became [a Scout] so I could quit and put it behind me&quot;, and rose to the highest rank of Eagle Scout. Lynch befriended Toby Keeler, whose father, Bushnell, was a painter. Bushnell gave Lynch &quot;The Art Spirit&quot; by Robert Henri. It was a revelation, and Lynch decided to dedicate himself to &quot;the art life&quot;.

At Francis C. Hammond High School in Alexandria, Lynch did not excel academically, having little interest in schoolwork, but he was popular with other students, and after leaving he decided that he wanted to study painting at college. He began his studies at the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design in Washington, D.C., before transferring in 1964 to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston with roommate musician Peter Wolf. He left after only a year, saying, &quot;I was not inspired AT ALL in that place.&quot; He instead decided that he wanted to travel around Europe for three years with his friend Jack Fisk, who was similarly unhappy with his studies at Cooper Union. They had some hopes that they could train in Europe with Austrian expressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka at his school. Upon reaching Salzburg, however, they found that Kokoschka was not available. Disillusioned, they returned to the United States after spending only two weeks in Europe.

==Film career==
===1967–1976: Short films and &quot;Eraserhead&quot; ===
Back in the United States, Lynch returned to Virginia. Because his parents had moved to Walnut Creek, California, he stayed with his friend Toby Keeler for a while. He decided to move to Philadelphia and enroll at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, after advice from Fisk, who was already enrolled there. He preferred this college to his previous school in Boston, saying, &quot;In Philadelphia there were great and serious painters, and everybody was inspiring one another and it was a beautiful time there.&quot; He recalled that Philadelphia had &quot;a great mood—factories, smoke, railroads, diners, the strangest characters and the darkest night. I saw vivid images—plastic curtains held together with Band-Aids, rags stuffed in broken windows.&quot; He was influenced by the painter Francis Bacon. In Philadelphia, Lynch began a relationship with a fellow student, Peggy Reavey, whom he married in 1967. The next year, their daughter Jennifer was born. Peggy later said Lynch &quot;definitely was a reluctant father, but a very loving one. Hey, I was pregnant when we got married. We were both reluctant.&quot; As a family, they moved to Philadelphia&#x27;s Fairmount neighborhood, where they bought a 12-room house for the relatively low price of $3,500 () due to the area&#x27;s high crime and poverty rates. Lynch later said:

Meanwhile, to help support his family, Lynch took a job printing engravings. At the Pennsylvania Academy, Lynch made his first short film, &quot;Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)&quot; (1967). He had first come up with the idea when he developed a wish to see his paintings move, and he began discussing doing animation with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone and purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find. Taking one of the academy&#x27;s abandoned upper rooms as a workspace, he spent $150, which at the time he felt to be a lot of money, to produce &quot;Six Men Getting Sick&quot;. Calling the film &quot;57 seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit&quot;, Lynch played it on a loop at the academy&#x27;s annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint-first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey. This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1,000 () to create a film installation in his home. Spending $478 of that on the second-hand Bolex camera &quot;of [his] dreams&quot;, Lynch produced a new animated short but, upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was a blurred, frameless print. He later said, &quot;So I called up [Wasserman] and said, &#x27;Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I&#x27;ve done hasn&#x27;t turned out.&#x27; And he said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.&#x27; End of story.&quot;

With his leftover money, Lynch decided to experiment with a mix of animation and live action, producing the four-minute short &quot;The Alphabet&quot; (1968). The film starred Lynch&#x27;s wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who sings the alphabet to a series of images of horses before dying at the end by hemorrhaging blood all over her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken Uher tape recorder to record the sound of Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch found particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch said, &quot;Peggy&#x27;s niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that&#x27;s sort of what started &#x27;The Alphabet&#x27; going. The rest of it was just subconscious.&quot;

Learning about the newly founded American Film Institute, which gave grants to filmmakers who could support their application with a prior work and a script for a new project, Lynch decided to submit a copy of &quot;The Alphabet&quot; along with a script he had written for a new short film, &quot;The Grandmother&quot;, that would be almost entirely live action. The institute agreed to help finance the work, initially offering him $5,000 out of his requested budget of $7,200, but later granting him the additional $2,200. Starring people he knew from both work and college and filmed in his own house, &quot;The Grandmother&quot; featured a neglected boy who &quot;grows&quot; a grandmother from a seed to care for him. The film critics Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell wrote, &quot;this film is a true oddity but contains many of the themes and ideas that would filter into his later work, and shows a remarkable grasp of the medium&quot;.
Lynch left the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts after three semesters and in 1970 moved with his wife and daughter to Los Angeles, where he began studying filmmaking at the AFI Conservatory, a place he later called &quot;completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great ... you quickly learned that if you were going to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing.&quot; He began writing a script for a proposed work, &quot;Gardenback&quot;, that had &quot;unfolded from this painting I&#x27;d done&quot;. In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, which he reluctantly agreed to do. All the interference on his &quot;Gardenback&quot; project made him fed up with the Conservatory and led him to quit after returning to start his second year and being put in first-year classes. AFI dean Frank Daniel asked Lynch to reconsider, believing that he was one of the school&#x27;s best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create a project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that &quot;Gardenback&quot; was &quot;wrecked&quot;, he set out on a new film, &quot;Eraserhead&quot;.

&quot;Eraserhead&quot; was planned to be about 42 minutes long (it ended up being 89 minutes), its script was only 21 pages, and Lynch was able to create the film without interference. He recalled its origin: &quot;My original image was of a man&#x27;s head bouncing on the ground, being picked up by a boy and taken to a pencil factory. I don’t know where it came from.&quot; Filming began on May 29, 1972, at night in some abandoned stables, allowing the production team (which was largely Lynch and some of his friends, including Sissy Spacek, Jack Fisk, cinematographer Frederick Elmes, and sound designer Alan Splet) to set up a camera room, green room, editing room, sets, as well as a food room and a bathroom. The AFI gave Lynch a $10,000 grant, but it was not enough to complete the film, and under pressure from studios after the success of the relatively cheap feature film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, it was unable to give him more. Lynch was then supported by a loan from his father and money that he earned from a paper route that he took up, delivering &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Not long into &quot;Eraserhead&quot;″s production, Lynch and Peggy amicably separated and divorced, and he began living full-time on set. In 1977, Lynch married Jack Fisk&#x27;s sister Mary Fisk. In 1973, Lynch&#x27;s sister suggested he try Transcendental Meditation. It proved a revelation, and Lynch claimed &quot;to never have missed a session since: twenty minutes, twice a day.&quot;

Due to financial problems, the filming of &quot;Eraserhead&quot; was haphazard, regularly stopping and starting again. During one such break in 1974, Lynch made &quot;The Amputee&quot;, a one-shot film about two minutes long. He proposed that he make &quot;The Amputee&quot; to present to AFI to test two different types of film stock.

&quot;Eraserhead&quot; was finally finished in 1976. Lynch said that not a single reviewer of the film understood it as he intended. Filmed in black and white, &quot;Eraserhead&quot; tells the story of Henry (Jack Nance), a quiet young man, living in a dystopian industrial wasteland, whose girlfriend gives birth to a deformed baby whom she leaves in his care. It was heavily influenced by the fearful mood of Philadelphia, and Lynch has called it &quot;my &quot;Philadelphia Story&quot;&quot;. Lynch tried to get it entered into the Cannes Film Festival, but while some reviewers liked it, others felt it was awful, and it was not selected for screening. Reviewers from the New York Film Festival also rejected it, but it screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival, where Ben Barenholtz, the distributor of the Elgin Theater, heard about it. Barenholtz was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977. &quot;Eraserhead&quot; subsequently became popular on the midnight movie underground circuit, and was later called one of the most important midnight movies of the 1970s, along with &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;El Topo&quot;, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, and &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;. Stanley Kubrick said it was one of his all-time favorite films.

===1980–1989: Populist surrealism ===
After &quot;Eraserhead&quot;″s success on the underground circuit, Stuart Cornfeld, an executive producer for Mel Brooks, saw it and recalled, &quot;I was just 100 percent blown away ... I thought it was the greatest thing I&#x27;d ever seen. It was such a cleansing experience.&quot; Brooks viewed &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, and after coming out of the screening theater, embraced Lynch, declaring, &quot;You&#x27;re a madman! I love you! You&#x27;re in.&quot;

Cornfeld agreed to help Lynch with his next film, &quot;Ronnie Rocket&quot;, for which Lynch had already written a script. But Lynch soon realized that &quot;Ronnie Rocket&quot;, a film that he said is about &quot;electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair&quot;, was not going to be picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script by someone else that he could direct. Cornfeld found four. On hearing the title of the first, &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, Lynch chose it. &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;″s script, by Chris de Vore and Eric Bergren, is based on the true story of Joseph Merrick, a severely deformed man in Victorian London, who was held in a sideshow but later taken under the care of a London surgeon, Frederick Treves. Lynch wanted to make some alterations that would deviate from real events but in his view make a better plot, but he needed the permission of Brooks, whose company, Brooksfilms, was responsible for production. The film stars John Hurt as John Merrick (the name changed from Joseph) and Anthony Hopkins as Treves. Filming took place in London. Though surrealistic and in black and white, it has been called &quot;one of the most conventional&quot; of Lynch&#x27;s films. It was a critical and commercial success, earning eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.

After &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;″s success, George Lucas, a fan of &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, offered Lynch the opportunity to direct the third film in his original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Lynch declined, saying that he had &quot;next door to zero interest&quot; and arguing that Lucas should direct the film himself as the movie should reflect his own vision, not Lynch&#x27;s. Soon, the opportunity to direct another big-budget science fiction epic arose when Dino de Laurentiis of the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group asked Lynch to create a film adaptation of Frank Herbert&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot; (1965). Lynch agreed, and in doing so was also contractually obliged to produce two other works for the company. He began writing a script based on the novel, initially with both de Vore and Bergren, and then alone when De Laurentiis was unhappy with their ideas. Lynch also helped build some of the sets, attempting to create &quot;a certain look&quot;, and particularly enjoyed building the set for the oil planet Giedi Prime, for which he used &quot;steel, bolts, and porcelain&quot;.

&quot;Dune&quot; is set in the far future, when humans live in an interstellar empire under a feudal system. The main character, Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan), is the son of a nobleman who takes control of the desert planet Arrakis, which grows the rare spice melange, the empire&#x27;s most highly prized commodity. Lynch was unhappy with the work, later saying: &quot;&quot;Dune&quot; was a kind of studio film. I didn&#x27;t have final cut. And, little by little, I was subconsciously making compromises&quot;. Much of his footage was removed from the final theatrical cut, dramatically condensing the plot. Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be as successful as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) was a critical and commercial dud; it had cost $45 million to make, and grossed $27.4 million domestically. Later, Universal Studios released an &quot;extended cut&quot; for syndicated television, containing almost an hour of cutting-room-floor footage and new narration. It did not represent Lynch&#x27;s intentions, but the studio considered it more comprehensible than the original version. Lynch objected to the changes and had his name struck from the extended cut, which has Alan Smithee credited as the director and &quot;Judas Booth&quot; (a pseudonym Lynch invented, reflecting his feelings of betrayal) as the screenwriter.

Lynch was still contractually obligated to produce two other projects for De Laurentiis, the first a planned sequel to &quot;Dune&quot;, which due to the film&#x27;s failure never went beyond the script stage. The other was a more personal work, based on a script Lynch had been working on for some time. Developing from ideas that Lynch had had since 1973, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was set in Lumberton, North Carolina, and revolves around a college student, Jeffrey Beaumont (MacLachlan), who finds a severed ear in a field. Investigating with the help of his friend Sandy (Laura Dern), Jeffrey discovers a criminal gang led by psychopath Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), who has kidnapped the husband and child of singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) and repeatedly rapes her. Lynch called the story &quot;a dream of strange desires wrapped inside a mystery story&quot;. 

Lynch included 1960s pop songs in the film, including Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;In Dreams&quot; and Bobby Vinton&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, the latter of which largely inspired the film. Lynch said, &quot;It was the song that sparked the movie ... There was something mysterious about it. It made me think about things. And the first things I thought about were lawns—lawns and the neighborhood.&quot; Other music for the film is by Angelo Badalamenti, who scored most of Lynch&#x27;s subsequent work. De Laurentiis loved the film, and it received support at some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to mainstream audiences were very poorly received, with most viewers hating the film. The film was controversial; Roger Ebert wrote that Rossellini &quot;is asked to do things in this film that require real nerve… She is degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera.&quot; Rossellini has defended the film: &quot;I was an adult. I was 31 or 32. I chose to play the character ... I think my character was the first time we did an abused woman, a portrait of an abused woman, but also she camouflaged herself behind what she was asked to be, which was sexy and beautiful and singing, and she obeys the order, and is also victimized it. That’s the complexity of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; but also the great talent of David Lynch. I thought he did a fantastic film. I love &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;.&quot; &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was a critical and commercial success, winning the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film and earning Lynch his second Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Pauline Kael praised Lynch as a &quot;genius naïf&quot; and predicted that he &quot;might turn out to be the first populist surrealist—a Frank Capra of dream logic.&quot; She quoted a moviegoer as saying &quot;Maybe I’m sick, but I want to see that again.&quot;

=== 1990–1999: Czar of the bizarre ===

Lynch met the television producer Mark Frost and they started working together on a biopic of Marilyn Monroe based on Anthony Summers&#x27;s book &quot;The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe&quot;, but it never got off the ground. While talking in a coffee shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse washing up on a lakeshore, and went to work on their third project, first called &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; and then &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–91). A drama set in an eponymous small Washington town where popular high school student Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) has been murdered, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; featured FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) as the investigator trying to identify the killer, and discovering many of the townsfolk&#x27;s secrets; Lynch said, &quot;The project was to mix a police investigation with the ordinary lives of the characters.&quot; He later said, &quot;[Mark Frost and I] worked together, especially in the initial stages. Later on we started working more apart.&quot; They pitched the series to ABC, which agreed to finance the pilot and eventually commissioned a season comprising seven episodes. Richard Corliss wrote: &quot;Long before the series&#x27; April premiere, ecstatic critics were priming TV viewers to expect the unexpected. Lynch&#x27;s two-hour pilot didn&#x27;t disappoint. It was frantic and lugubrious in turn, a soap opera with strychnine. In one night, the show had hip America hooked.&quot;

Lynch directed two of the first season&#x27;s seven episodes and carefully chose the other episodes&#x27; directors. He also appeared in several episodes as FBI agent Gordon Cole. The series was a success, with high ratings in the U.S. and many other countries, and soon had a cult following. A second season of 22 episodes went into production, but ABC executives believed that public interest in the show was declining. The network insisted that Lynch and Frost reveal Laura&#x27;s killer&#x27;s identity prematurely, which Lynch grudgingly agreed to do, in what Lynch called one of his biggest professional regrets. After identifying the murderer and moving from Thursday to Saturday night, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; continued for several more episodes, but was canceled after a ratings drop. Lynch, who disliked the direction that writers and directors took in the later episodes, directed the final episode. He ended it with a cliffhanger (like season one had), later saying, &quot;that&#x27;s not the ending. That&#x27;s the ending that people were stuck with.&quot;

Meanwhile, he was also involved in creating various commercials for companies including Yves Saint Laurent, Calvin Klein, Giorgio Armani, and the Japanese coffee company Namoi, which featured a Japanese man searching Twin Peaks for his missing wife.

While Lynch was working on the first few episodes of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, his friend Monty Montgomery &quot;gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be executive producer or something, and I said &#x27;That&#x27;s great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;In that case, you can do it yourself&#x27;.&quot; The book was Barry Gifford&#x27;s novel &quot;Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula&quot;, about two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was &quot;just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened.&quot; With Gifford&#x27;s support, Lynch adapted the novel into &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;, a crime and road movie starring Nicolas Cage as Sailor and Laura Dern as Lula. Calling its plot a &quot;strange blend&quot; of &quot;a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy&quot;, Lynch departed substantially from the novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Despite a muted response from American critics and viewers, &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. When it won the prize, audience members booed Lynch and the film. One of them was Roger Ebert, who admitted doing so on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

After &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;″s success, Lynch returned to the world of the canceled &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, this time without Frost, to make a film that was primarily a prequel but also in part a sequel. Lynch said, &quot;I liked the idea of the story going back and forth in time.&quot; The result, &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992), primarily revolved around the last few days of Laura Palmer&#x27;s life, was much &quot;darker&quot; in tone than the TV series, with much of the humor removed, and dealt with such topics as incest and murder. Lynch has said the film is about &quot;the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim of incest&quot;. The company CIBY-2000 financed &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, and most of the TV series&#x27;s cast reprised their roles, though some refused and many were unenthusiastic about the project. The film was a commercial failure in the U.S. at the time of its release, but has since experienced a critical reappraisal. Many critics, such as Mark Kermode, have called it Lynch&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

Meanwhile, Lynch worked on some new television shows. He and Frost created the comedy series &quot;On the Air&quot; (1992), which was canceled after three episodes aired, and he and Montgomery created the three-episode HBO miniseries &quot;Hotel Room&quot; (1993) about events that happen in one hotel room on different dates.

In 1993, Lynch collaborated with Japanese musician Yoshiki on the video for X Japan&#x27;s song &quot;Longing ~Setsubou no Yoru~&quot;. The video was never officially released, but Lynch wrote in his 2018 memoir &quot;Room to Dream&quot; that &quot;some of the frames are so fuckin&#x27; beautiful, you can&#x27;t believe it.&quot;

After his unsuccessful TV ventures, Lynch returned to film. In 1997, he released the non-linear noiresque &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, which was co-written by Barry Gifford and stars Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette. The film failed commercially and received a mixed response from critics.

Lynch then began work on a film from a script by Mary Sweeney and John E. Roach, &quot;The Straight Story&quot;, based on the true story of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), an elderly man from Laurens, Iowa, who goes on a 300-mile journey to visit his sick brother (Harry Dean Stanton) in Mount Zion, Wisconsin, by riding lawnmower. Asked why he chose this script, Lynch said, &quot;that&#x27;s what I fell in love with next&quot;, and expressed his admiration of Straight, describing him as &quot;like James Dean, except he&#x27;s old&quot;. Badalamenti scored the film, calling it &quot;very different from the kind of score he&#x27;s done for [Lynch] in the past&quot;.

Among the many differences from Lynch&#x27;s other films, &quot;The Straight Story&quot; contains no profanity, sex, or violence, and is rated G (general viewing) by the Motion Picture Association of America, which came as &quot;shocking news&quot; to many in the film industry, who were surprised that it &quot;did not disturb, offend or mystify&quot;. Le Blanc and Odell write that the plot made it &quot;seem as far removed from Lynch&#x27;s earlier works as could be imagined, but in fact right from the very opening, this is entirely his film—a surreal road movie&quot;. It was also Lynch&#x27;s only title released by Walt Disney Pictures in the U.S., after studio president Peter Schneider screened the film before its Cannes Film Festival premiere and quickly had Disney acquire the distribution rights. Schneider said it is &quot;a beautiful movie about values, forgiveness and healing and celebrates America. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was a Walt Disney film.&quot; It was named one of the best films of the year by &quot;The New York Times&quot;; Janet Maslin wrote: &quot;Somehow it took David Lynch to lead audiences past the ultimate frontier: into a G-rated parable of spirituality and decency, seen from the unfashionable vantage point of old age. Mr. Lynch accomplished the unthinkable by putting Richard Farnsworth, in a devastatingly real and rock-solid performance, on a lawnmower at five miles per hour and still building enough drama and emotion for a great chase. Burned out on the surreal and the grotesque, Mr. Lynch faced down inevitable realities about aging and conscience.&quot;

===2000–2009: &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; and beyond ===

In 1999, Lynch approached ABC again with ideas for a television drama. The network gave Lynch the go-ahead to shoot a two-hour pilot for the series &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, but disputes over content and running time led to the project being shelved indefinitely. With $7 million from the French production company StudioCanal, Lynch completed the pilot as a film, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. The film, a nonlinear surrealist tale of Hollywood&#x27;s dark side, stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. It performed relatively well at the box office worldwide and was a critical success, earning Lynch Best Director at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival (shared with Joel Coen for &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;) and Best Director from the New York Film Critics Association. He also received his third Academy Award nomination for Best Director. In 2016, the film was named the best film of the 21st century in a BBC poll of 177 film critics from 36 countries. Roger Ebert, who had dismissed much of Lynch&#x27;s earlier work, wrote: &quot;At last his experiment doesn&#x27;t shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape in the form of a Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can&#x27;t stop watching it.&quot;

With the rising popularity of the Internet, Lynch decided to use it as a distribution channel, releasing several new series he had created exclusively on his website, davidlynch.com, which went online on December 10, 2001. In 2002, he created a series of online shorts, &quot;DumbLand&quot;. Intentionally crude in content and execution, the eight-episode series was later released on DVD. The same year, Lynch released a surreal sitcom, &quot;Rabbits&quot;, about a family of humanoid rabbits. Later, he made his experiments with Digital Video available in the form of the Japanese-style horror short &quot;Darkened Room&quot;. In 2006, Lynch&#x27;s feature film &quot;Inland Empire&quot; was released. At three hours, it is his longest film. Like &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; and &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, it lacks a traditional narrative structure. It stars Laura Dern, Harry Dean Stanton, and Justin Theroux, with cameos by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring as the voices of Suzie and Jane Rabbit, and a performance by Jeremy Irons. Lynch called &quot;Inland Empire&quot; &quot;a mystery about a woman in trouble&quot;. In an effort to promote it, he made appearances with a cow and a placard bearing the slogan &quot;Without cheese there would be no &quot;Inland Empire&quot;&quot;.
In 2009, Lynch produced a documentary Web series directed by his son Austin Lynch and friend Jason S., &quot;Interview Project&quot;. Interested in working with Werner Herzog, in 2009 Lynch collaborated on Herzog&#x27;s film &quot;My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done&quot;. With a nonstandard narrative, the film is based on a true story of an actor who committed matricide while acting in a production of the &quot;Oresteia&quot;, and stars Grace Zabriskie. In 2009, Lynch had plans to direct a documentary on Maharishi Mahesh Yogi consisting of interviews with people who knew him, but nothing had come of it.

=== 2010–2019: Return to television ===
In 2010, Lynch began making guest appearances on the &quot;Family Guy&quot; spin-off &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; as Gus the Bartender. He had been convinced to appear in the show by its lead actor, Mike Henry, a fan of Lynch who felt that his life had changed after he saw &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;. &quot;Lady Blue Shanghai&quot; is a 16-minute promotional film written, directed and edited by Lynch for Dior. It was released on the Internet in May 2010.

Lynch directed a concert by English new wave band Duran Duran on March 23, 2011. The concert was streamed live on YouTube from the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles as the kickoff to the second season of &quot;Unstaged: An Original Series from American Express&quot;. &quot;The idea is to try and create on the fly, layers of images permeating Duran Duran on the stage&quot;, Lynch said. &quot;A world of experimentation and hopefully some happy accidents&quot;. The animated short &quot;I Touch a Red Button Man&quot;, a collaboration between Lynch and the band Interpol, played in the background during Interpol&#x27;s concert at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2011. The short, which features Interpol&#x27;s song &quot;Lights&quot;, was later made available online.
It was believed that Lynch was going to retire from the film industry; according to Abel Ferrara, Lynch &quot;doesn&#x27;t even want to make films any more. I&#x27;ve talked to him about it, OK? I can tell when he talks about it.&quot; But in a June 2012 interview, Lynch said he lacked the inspiration to start a new movie project, but &quot;If I got an idea that I fell in love with, I&#x27;d go to work tomorrow&quot;. In September 2012, he appeared in the three-part &quot;Late Show&quot; arc on FX&#x27;s &quot;Louie&quot; as Jack Dahl. In November 2012, Lynch hinted at plans for a new film while attending Plus Camerimage in Bydgoszcz, Poland, saying, &quot;something is coming up. It will happen but I don&#x27;t know exactly when&quot;. At Plus Camerimage, Lynch received a lifetime achievement award and the Key to the City from Bydgoszcz&#x27;s mayor, Rafał Bruski. In a January 2013 interview, Laura Dern confirmed that she and Lynch were planning a new project, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; later reported that Lynch was working on the script. &quot;Idem Paris&quot;, a short documentary film about the lithographic process, was released online in February 2013. On June 28, 2013, a video Lynch directed for the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Came Back Haunted&quot; was released. He also did photography for the Dumb Numbers&#x27;s self-titled album released in August 2013.

On October 6, 2014, Lynch confirmed via Twitter that he and Frost would start shooting a new, nine-episode season of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; in 2015, with the episodes expected to air in 2016 on Showtime. Lynch and Frost wrote all the episodes. On April 5, 2015, Lynch announced via Twitter that the project was still alive, but he was no longer going to direct because the budget was too low for what he wanted to do. On May 15, 2015, he said via Twitter that he would return to the revival, having sorted out his issues with Showtime. Showtime CEO David Nevins confirmed this, announcing that Lynch would direct every episode of the revival and that the original nine episodes had been extended to 18. Filming was completed by April 2016. The two-episode premiere aired on May 21, 2017.
While doing press for &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Lynch was again asked if he had retired from film and seemed to confirm that he had made his last feature film, responding, &quot;Things changed a lot ... So many films were not doing well at the box office, even though they might have been great films and the things that were doing well at the box office weren&#x27;t the things that I would want to do&quot;. Lynch later said that this statement had been misconstrued: &quot;I did not say I quit cinema, simply that nobody knows what the future holds.&quot;

===2020–2025: Weather reports and final projects ===
Lynch did weather reports on his now-defunct website in the 2000s. He returned to doing weather reports in 2020 from his apartment in Los Angeles, along with two new series, &quot;What is David Lynch Working on Today?&quot;, which detailed him making collages, and &quot;Today&#x27;s Number Is...&quot;, in which he picked a random number from 1 to 10 each day from a jar containing ten numbered ping-pong balls. In one of his weather reports, Lynch detailed a dream he had about being a German soldier shot by an American soldier on D-Day. Most of his Weather Reports featured Lynch mentioning he was &quot;thinking about&quot; songs by a wide range of musical artists including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Everly Brothers and The Platters. After his final weather report on December 16, 2022, Lynch said in an April 2023 interview that the series, along with &quot;What is David Lynch Working on Today?&quot; and &quot;Today&#x27;s Number Is...&quot;, would not return, adding: &quot;Now I can sleep longer in the morning. I had to get up very early to consult the real weather bulletin. In two years I have not missed a single one.&quot;
In June 2020, Lynch rereleased his 2002 web series &quot;Rabbits&quot; on YouTube. On July 17, 2020, his store for merchandise released a set of face masks with Lynch&#x27;s art on them for the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2022, it was announced that Lynch had been cast in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s semi-autobiographical film &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; in a role &quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;a closely guarded secret&quot;. Lynch played John Ford, whom the young Spielberg met, an encounter Spielberg considers formative. Gabriel LaBelle played Spielberg&#x27;s alter ego Sammy Fabelman, and Lynch as Ford offers the young man advice on filmmaking. Lynch and the cast were nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. J. Hoberman wrote: &quot;Mr. Lynch never made a conventional, crowd-pleasing Hollywood movie. But in 2022, he agreed to a cameo in one: Mr. Spielberg&#x27;s autobiographical feature &quot;The Fabelmans&quot;, where the enigmatic if not eldritch Mr. Lynch was cast as John Ford, the maker of westerns and the grand old curmudgeon of American cinema. It was a sentimental gesture that one can only call Lynchian.&quot;

== Other work ==

=== Unrealized projects ===

Lynch worked on a number of projects that never progressed beyond the pre-production stage. Some of them fell into development hell and others were officially canceled.

=== &quot;The Angriest Dog in the World&quot; ===
In 1983, Lynch began writing and drawing a comic strip, &quot;The Angriest Dog in the World&quot;, that featured unchanging graphics of a tethered dog so angry it could not move, alongside cryptic philosophical references. It was published from 1983 to 1992 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Creative Loafing&quot;, and other tabloid and alternative publications. Around this time Lynch also became interested in photography and traveled to northern England to photograph its degrading industrial landscape.

=== &quot;The Cowboy and the Frenchman&quot; ===
Lynch directed a short film, &quot;The Cowboy and the Frenchman&quot; (1988), as part of &quot;The French as Seen by...&quot;, a series sponsored by the French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. The other directors commissioned for the series were Werner Herzog, Andrzej Wajda, Luigi Comencini, and Jean-Luc Godard. 

===&quot;Industrial Symphony No. 1&quot;===
While &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was in production, the Brooklyn Academy of Music asked Lynch and Badalamenti to create a theatrical piece to be performed twice in 1989 as a part of the New Music America Festival. The result was &quot;Industrial Symphony No. 1: The Dream of the Broken Hearted&quot;, which starred frequent Lynch collaborators Laura Dern, Nicolas Cage, and Michael J. Anderson and contained five songs sung by Julee Cruise. Lynch produced a 50-minute video of the performance in 1990.

===Painting===

Lynch first trained as a painter, and although better known as a filmmaker, continued to paint. He said: &quot;all my paintings are organic, violent comedies. They have to be violently done and primitive and crude, and to achieve that I try to let nature paint more than I paint.&quot; Many of his works are very dark in color; Lynch said this was because:

Many of Lynch&#x27;s paintings contain letters and words. He said:

Lynch was the subject of a major art retrospective at the Fondation Cartier in Paris from March 3 to May 27, 2007. The show was titled &quot;The Air is on Fire&quot; and included paintings, photographs, drawings, alternative films and sound work. New site-specific art installations were created specially for the exhibition. A series of events, including live performances and concerts, accompanied the exhibition. Lynch&#x27;s alma mater, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, presented an exhibition of his work called &quot;The Unified Field&quot;, which ran from September 12, 2014, to January 2015. Lynch was represented by Kayne Griffin Corcoran in Los Angeles, and began exhibiting his paintings, drawings, and photography with the gallery in 2011.

Lynch considered the 20th-century Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon his &quot;number one kinda hero painter&quot;, saying, &quot;Normally I only like a couple of years of a painter&#x27;s work, but I like everything of Bacon&#x27;s. The guy, you know, had the stuff.&quot; His favorite photographers included William Eggleston (&quot;The Red Ceiling&quot;), Joel-Peter Witkin and Diane Arbus.

===Music===

Lynch was involved in several music projects, many of them related to his films, including sound design for some of his films (sometimes alongside collaborators Alan Splet, Dean Hurley, and Angelo Badalamenti). His album genres included experimental rock, ambient soundscapes and, most recently, avant-garde electropop music. He produced and wrote lyrics for Julee Cruise&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Floating into the Night&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Voice of Love&quot; (1993), in collaboration with Badalamenti, who wrote the music and also produced. In 1991, Lynch directed a 30-second teaser trailer for Michael Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Dangerous&quot; at Jackson&#x27;s request. He also worked on the 1998 Jocelyn Montgomery album &quot;Lux Vivens (Living Light), The Music of Hildegard von Bingen&quot;. Lynch wrote music for &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;, &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, and &quot;Rabbits&quot;. In 2001, he released &quot;BlueBob&quot;, a blues album performed by Lynch and John Neff. The album is notable for Lynch&#x27;s unusual guitar playing style. He plays &quot;upside down and backwards, like a lap guitar&quot;, and relies heavily on effects pedals. Lynch wrote several pieces for &quot;Inland Empire&quot;, including two songs, &quot;Ghost of Love&quot; and &quot;Walkin&#x27; on the Sky&quot;, in which he made his public debut as a singer. In 2009, his book-CD set &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; was released. In 2008, he started his own record label, David Lynch MC, which first released &quot;Fox Bat Strategy: A Tribute to Dave Jaurequi&quot; in early 2009.

In November 2010, Lynch released two electropop music singles, &quot;Good Day Today&quot; and &quot;I Know&quot;, on the independent British label Sunday Best Recordings. Of the songs, he said, &quot;I was just sitting and these notes came and then I went down and started working with Dean [Hurley] and then these few notes, &#x27;I want to have a good day, today&#x27; came and the song was built around that&quot;. The singles were followed by an album, &quot;Crazy Clown Time&quot;, which was released in November 2011 and described as an &quot;electronic blues album&quot;. The songs were sung by Lynch, with guest vocals on one track by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and composed and performed by Lynch and Hurley. All or most of the songs on &quot;Crazy Clown Time&quot; were put into art-music videos, with Lynch directing the title song&#x27;s video.

On September 29, 2011, Lynch released &quot;This Train&quot; with vocalist and longtime musical collaborator Chrystabell on the La Rose Noire label. Lynch&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;The Big Dream&quot;, was released in 2013 and included the single &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting Here&quot;, with Swedish singer-songwriter Lykke Li. &quot;The Big Dream&quot;″s release was preceded by &quot;TBD716&quot;, an enigmatic 43-second video featured on Lynch&#x27;s YouTube and Vine accounts. For Record Store Day 2014, Lynch released &quot;The Big Dream Remix EP&quot;, which featured four songs from his album remixed by various artists. This included the track &quot;Are You Sure&quot; remixed by the band Bastille, who are known to have been inspired by Lynch&#x27;s work for its songs and videos, especially the song &quot;Laura Palmer&quot;.

In November 2018, a collaborative album by Lynch and Badalamenti, &quot;Thought Gang&quot;, was released on vinyl and compact disc. The album was recorded around 1993 but not released at the time. Two tracks from it appear on the soundtrack for &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; and three others were used for &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot;. In May 2019, Lynch provided guest vocals on the track &quot;Fire is Coming&quot; by Flying Lotus. He also co-wrote the track that appears on Flying Lotus&#x27;s album &quot;Flamagra&quot;. A video accompanying the song was released on April 17, 2019. In May 2021, Lynch produced a track, &quot;I Am the Shaman&quot;, by Scottish artist Donovan. The song was released on May 10, Donovan&#x27;s 75th birthday. Lynch also directed the accompanying video.

In August 2024, Lynch released his final album, &quot;Cellophane Memories&quot;, a collaboration between him and Chrystabell. He also directed videos for two tracks on the album, &quot;Sublime Eternal Love&quot; and &quot;The Answers to the Questions&quot;.

===Design===
Lynch designed and constructed furniture for his 1997 film &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, including the small table in the Madison house and the VCR case. In April 1997, he presented a furniture collection at the prestigious Milan Furniture Fair. &quot;Design and music, art and architecture—they all belong together&quot;, he said.

Working with designer Raphael Navot, architectural agency Enia, and light designer Thierry Dreyfus, Lynch conceived and designed a nightclub in Paris, Silencio. It opened in October 2011, and is a private members&#x27; club, but is free to the public after midnight. Patrons have access to concerts, films, and other performances by artists and guests. Inspired by the club of the same name in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, the underground space consists of a series of rooms, each dedicated to a certain purpose or atmosphere. &quot;Silencio is something dear to me. I wanted to create an intimate space where all the arts could come together. There won&#x27;t be a Warhol-like guru, but it will be open to celebrated artists of all disciplines to come here to program or create what they want.&quot;

===Literature===
In 2006, Lynch wrote a short book, &quot;Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity&quot;, which describes his creative processes, stories from his career, and the benefits he realized from his practice of Transcendental Meditation. He describes the metaphor behind the title in the introduction:

The book weaves a nonlinear autobiography with descriptions of Lynch&#x27;s experiences during Transcendental Meditation. Lynch also narrated it in an audiobook.

Working with Kristine McKenna, Lynch published a biography-memoir hybrid, &quot;Room to Dream&quot;, in June 2018.

===Website===
Lynch designed his personal website, a site exclusive to paying members, where he posted short videos, his absurdist series &quot;Dumbland&quot;, interviews, and other items. The site also featured a daily weather report where Lynch gave a brief description of the weather in Los Angeles, where he resided. He continued to broadcast this report (usually no longer than 30 seconds) on his personal YouTube channel, &quot;DAVID LYNCH THEATER&quot;, along with &quot;TODAY&#x27;S NUMBER&quot;, where he drew a random number between one and ten out of a bingo cage. Lynch also created a short film, &quot;Rabbits&quot;, for his website.

Lynch was a coffee drinker and had his own line of special organic blends available for purchase on his website and at Whole Foods. Called &quot;David Lynch Signature Cup&quot;, the coffee has been advertised via flyers included with several Lynch-related DVD releases, including &quot;Inland Empire&quot; and the Gold Box edition of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. The brand&#x27;s tagline is &quot;It&#x27;s all in the beans ... and I&#x27;m just full of beans&quot;, a line Justin Theroux&#x27;s character says in &quot;Inland Empire&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===

Lynch had several long-term relationships. In January 1968, he married Peggy Reavey, with whom he had one child, Jennifer Lynch, a film director. They filed for divorce in 1974. In June 1977, Lynch married Mary Fisk, with whom he had one child, Austin Jack Lynch, in 1982. They separated in 1985 and divorced in 1987. Lynch had a relationship with actress Isabella Rossellini and lived with her between 1986 and 1991. In 1992, he and his editor Mary Sweeney had a son, Riley Sweeney Lynch. Sweeney also worked as Lynch&#x27;s producer and co-wrote and produced &quot;The Straight Story&quot;. The two married in May 2006, but filed for divorce that June. In 2009, Lynch married actress Emily Stofle, who appeared in his 2006 film &quot;Inland Empire&quot; as well as the 2017 revival of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. The couple had one child, Lula Boginia Lynch, in 2012. Stofle filed for divorce in 2023. A divorce settlement agreement was reached on December 20, 2024, but the court had not issued a final divorce decree at the time of Lynch&#x27;s death.

===Political and public views===

In 2009, Lynch signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski after Polanski&#x27;s arrest on his 1977 sexual abuse charges, after being detained while traveling to a film festival. The petition argued the arrest would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;, and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects.&quot;

Lynch said he was &quot;not a political person&quot; and knew little about politics. Describing his political philosophy in 2006, he said, &quot;at that time [the 1990s], I thought of myself as a libertarian. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations.&quot; He continued: &quot;I&#x27;m a Democrat now. And I&#x27;ve always been a Democrat, really. But I don&#x27;t like the Democrats a lot, either, because I&#x27;m a smoker, and I think a lot of the Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking.&quot; He said he voted for Ronald Reagan in the 1984 U.S. presidential election; in the 2000 U.S. presidential election he endorsed the Natural Law Party, which advocated Transcendental Meditation. He said he would vote for Democratic incumbent Barack Obama in the 2012 U.S. presidential election.

In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Lynch endorsed Bernie Sanders, whom he described as &quot;for the people&quot;, He voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primaries, and for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in the general election. In a June 2018 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Lynch said that Donald Trump could go down as &quot;one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the [country] so much. No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way.&quot; He added: &quot;Our so-called leaders can&#x27;t take the country forward, can&#x27;t get anything done. Like children, they are. Trump has shown all this.&quot; The interviewer clarified that &quot;while Trump may not be doing a good job himself, Lynch thinks, he is opening up a space where other outsiders might.&quot; At a rally later that month, Trump read out sections of the interview, claiming Lynch was a supporter. Lynch later clarified on Facebook that his words were taken out of context, saying that Trump would &quot;not have a chance to go down in history as a great president&quot; if he continued on the course of &quot;causing suffering and division&quot; and advising him to &quot;treat all the people as you would like to be treated&quot;.

In one of his daily weather report videos in 2020, Lynch expressed support for Black Lives Matter protests following the murder of George Floyd. In a 2022 weather report, he condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and addressed Russian president Vladimir Putin directly, telling him there was &quot;no room for this kind of absurdity anymore&quot; and that Putin would reap what he had sown, lifetime after lifetime.

Lynch was present with other Boy Scouts outside the White House at the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy, which took place on Lynch&#x27;s 15th birthday. When Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Lynch was the first in his school to hear of it, as he was working on a display case rather than attending class. Lynch would later support John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories that suggest Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone.

===Transcendental Meditation===
Lynch advocated Transcendental Meditation as a spiritual practice. He was initiated into Transcendental Meditation in July 1973, and practiced the technique consistently thereafter. Lynch said he met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the TM movement, for the first time in 1975 at the Spiritual Regeneration Movement center in Los Angeles. He became close with the Maharishi during a month-long &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Enlightenment Course&quot; held in 2003, the fee for which was $1 million.

In July 2005, Lynch launched the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and Peace, established to help finance scholarships for students in middle and high schools who are interested in learning Transcendental Meditation and to fund research on the technique and its effects on learning. Together with John Hagelin and Fred Travis, a brain researcher from Maharishi University of Management (MUM), Lynch promoted his vision on college campuses with a tour that began in September 2005. Lynch was on MUM&#x27;s board of trustees and hosted an annual &quot;David Lynch Weekend for World Peace and Meditation&quot; there, beginning in 2005. The foundation has also funded meditation lessons for veterans and other &quot;at-risk&quot; populations.

Lynch was working for the building and establishment of seven buildings in which 8,000 salaried people would practice advanced meditation techniques, &quot;pumping peace for the world&quot;. He estimated the cost at US$7 billion. As of December 2005, he had spent $400,000 of his money and raised $1 million in donations. In December 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that he continued to have that goal. Lynch&#x27;s book &quot;Catching the Big Fish&quot; (2006) discusses Transcendental Meditation&#x27;s effect on his creative process. Lynch attended the Maharishi&#x27;s funeral in India in 2008. He told a reporter, &quot;In life, he revolutionized the lives of millions of people. ... In 20, 50, 500 years there will be millions of people who will know and understand what the Maharishi has done.&quot; In 2009, Lynch went to India to film interviews with people who knew the Maharishi as part of a biographical documentary.

In 2009, Lynch organized a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall for the David Lynch Foundation. On April 4, 2009, the &quot;Change Begins Within&quot; concert featured Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Donovan, Sheryl Crow, Eddie Vedder, Moby, Bettye LaVette, Ben Harper, and Mike Love. &quot;David Wants to Fly&quot; is a 2010 documentary by German filmmaker David Sieveking &quot;that follows the path of his professional idol, David Lynch, into the world of Transcendental Meditation (TM)&quot;. At the end of the film, Sieveking becomes disillusioned with Lynch.

An independent project starring Lynch called &quot;Beyond The Noise: My Transcendental Meditation Journey&quot;, directed by Dana Farley, who has severe dyslexia and attention deficit disorder, was shown at film festivals in 2011, including the Marbella Film Festival. Filmmaker Kevin Sean Michaels is one of the producers. In 2013, Lynch wrote: &quot;Transcendental Meditation leads to a beautiful, peaceful revolution. A change from suffering and negativity to happiness and a life more and more free of any problems.&quot;

In a 2019 interview by British artist Alexander de Cadenet, Lynch said: &quot;Here&#x27;s an experience that utilizes the full brain. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for. It&#x27;s for enlightenment, for higher states of consciousness, culminating in the highest state of unity consciousness.&quot; In April 2022, Lynch announced a $500 million transcendental meditation world peace initiative to fund transcendental meditation for 30,000 college students. In September 2024, Lynch made his last published broadcast speech at Meditate America 2024. He discussed the Beatles&#x27; (particularly John Lennon&#x27;s) practice of TM during their visit to India in 1968 and played a cover of &quot;Across the Universe&quot;.

==Illness and death==
In August 2024, Lynch said in an interview that he had been diagnosed with emphysema in 2020 after a lifetime of smoking and had become housebound due to health risks, which he surmised would likely prevent him from directing any new projects. Three months later, he told &quot;People&quot; that he had quit smoking in 2022, having started when he was eight years old; he said he was reliant on supplemental oxygen for most daily activities and could &quot;hardly walk across a room&quot;.

Lynch also said he could no longer leave his house, meaning that he would only be able to direct remotely. He said a project for Netflix, with working titles &quot;Wisteria&quot; and &quot;Unrecorded Night&quot;, had fallen through, but that he would like to see his unrealized projects &quot;Antelope Don&#x27;t Run No More&quot; and &quot;Snootworld&quot; realized. Lynch said that month that he was working on existing projects as much as he could, and that he was in good health except for emphysema, and had no plans to retire. 

In January 2025, Lynch was evacuated from his Los Angeles home due to the Southern California wildfires. These events preceded a terminal decline in his health, and he died at his daughter&#x27;s home in Los Angeles on the morning of January 16, aged 78. His family posted a message reading:

His death certificate, publicly reported in February 2025, concluded that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cited as the underlying cause. Dehydration was also mentioned as a significant contributor. The death certificate said he was cremated, with his ashes buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

==Legacy and tributes ==
Lynch was often called a &quot;visionary&quot;. In 2007, a panel of critics convened by &quot;The Guardian&quot; announced that &quot;after all the discussion, no one could fault the conclusion that David Lynch is the most important film-maker of the current era&quot;, and AllMovie called him &quot;the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking&quot;. Film critic Pauline Kael called Lynch &quot;the first populist surrealist&quot;. The moving image collection of David Lynch is held at the Academy Film Archive, which has preserved two of his student films. Kyle MacLachlan wrote, &quot;I was willing to follow him anywhere because joining him on the journey of discovery, searching and finding together, was the whole point. I stepped out into the unknown because I knew David was floating out there with me. It&#x27;s like Agent Cooper says to Sheriff Truman in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;: &#x27;I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.&#x27; I will miss my dear friend. He has made my world—all of our worlds—both wonderful and strange&quot;.

Lynch&#x27;s collaborators Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern, Kyle MacLachlan, Naomi Watts, and Ray Wise wrote tributes to him. MacLachlan honored Lynch with tributes in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, and on his Instagram account, where he wrote, &quot;My world is that much fuller because I knew him and that much emptier now that he&#x27;s gone.&quot; The WGA announced that MacLachlan would posthumously give Lynch the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement.

Steven Spielberg wrote of directing Lynch in &quot;The Fabelmans&quot;: &quot;Here was one of my heroes—David Lynch—playing one of my heroes [...] The world is going to miss such an original and unique voice. His films have already stood the test of time and they always will.&quot; Martin Scorsese wrote a statement that read in part, &quot;He put images on the screen unlike anything that I or anybody else had ever seen—he made everything strange, uncanny, revelatory and new.&quot; Tributes were also paid by Judd Apatow, Mel Brooks, Francis Ford Coppola, Terry Gilliam, James Gunn, Ron Howard, Patton Oswalt, Pedro Pascal, Billy Corgan, Questlove, and Ben Stiller. Critic Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; eulogized Lynch as &quot;the great American surrealist&quot;. Mel Brooks, who produced &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, called Lynch &quot;Jimmy Stewart from Mars.&quot; Lynch described himself as &quot;Eagle Scout, Missoula, Montana&quot;.

J. Hoberman wrote, &quot;Like Frank Capra and Franz Kafka, two widely disparate 20th-century artists whose work Mr. Lynch much admired and might be said to have synthesized, his name became an adjective.&quot; &quot;Lynchian&quot; has been used to describe art or situations reminiscent of Lynch&#x27;s style. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines Lynchian artwork as &quot;juxtaposing surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments&quot; and &quot;using compelling visual images to emphasize a dreamlike quality of mystery or menace.&quot; David Foster Wallace wrote, &quot;An academic definition of Lynchian might be that the term &#x27;refers to a particular kind of irony where the very macabre and the very mundane combine in such a way as to reveal the former&#x27;s perpetual containment within the latter&#x27;&quot; but that &quot;it&#x27;s ultimately definable only ostensively—&quot;i.e.&quot;, we know it when we see it.&quot;

==Style and influences==
===Influences===
Lynch described his work as more similar to that of European filmmakers than American ones, and said that most films that &quot;get down and thrill your soul&quot; are by European directors. He expressed admiration for Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman, Werner Herzog, Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski, Jacques Tati, Stanley Kubrick, and Billy Wilder. He said that Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950) was one of his favorite pictures, as were Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962), Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963), Tati&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur Hulot&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1953), Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), and Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Stroszek&quot; (1977). He also cited Herk Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; (1962) and Jerzy Skolimowski&#x27;s &quot;Deep End&quot; (1970) as influences on his work. 

Lynch said his favorite books were Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;The Name Above The Title&quot;, Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, Robert Henri&#x27;s &quot;The Art Spirit&quot;, Robert Flynn Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Anonymous Photographs&quot;, and Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;. His favorite film, and one he regularly returned to, was Victor Fleming&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;; the references he made to it are explored in Alexandre O. Philippe&#x27;s documentary &quot;Lynch/Oz&quot; (2022).

===Motifs===
Several themes recur in Lynch&#x27;s work. Le Blanc and Odell write, &quot;his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas&quot;. One of the key themes they note is the usage of dreams and dreamlike imagery and structure, something they relate to the &quot;surrealist ethos&quot; of relying &quot;on the subconscious to provide visual drive&quot;. This can be seen in Merrick&#x27;s dream of his mother in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, Cooper&#x27;s dreams of the red room in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and the &quot;dreamlike logic&quot; of the narratives of &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, and &quot;Inland Empire&quot;. Of his attitude to dreams, Lynch said: &quot;Waking dreams are the ones that are important, the ones that come when I&#x27;m quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don&#x27;t control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I&#x27;ve made or discovered; a world I choose ... [You can&#x27;t really get others to experience it, but] right there is the power of cinema.&quot; His films are known for their use of magic realism. The motif of dreams is closely linked to his recurring use of drones, real-world sounds, and music.

Another of Lynch&#x27;s prominent themes is industry, with repeated imagery of &quot;the clunk of machinery, the power of pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories&quot;, as seen in the industrial wasteland in &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, the factories in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, the sawmill in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and the lawnmower in &quot;The Straight Story&quot;. Of his interest in such things, Lynch said: &quot;It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It&#x27;s just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that.&quot;

Another theme is the dark underbelly of violent criminal activity in a society, such as Frank Booth&#x27;s gang in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and the cocaine smugglers in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. The idea of deformity is also found in several of Lynch&#x27;s films, from &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; to the deformed baby in &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, as well as death from head wounds, found in most of his films. Other imagery common in Lynch&#x27;s work includes flickering electricity or lights, fire, and stages upon which a singer performs, often surrounded by drapery.

Except &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; and &quot;Dune&quot;, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch&#x27;s films are set in the United States. Lynch said: &quot;I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films.&quot; &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and &quot;Lost Highway&quot; are intentionally reminiscent of 1950s U.S. culture despite being set in later decades. Lynch said, &quot;It was a fantastic decade in a lot of ways ... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were laying the groundwork for a disastrous future.&quot;

Lynch also tended to feature his leading female actors in &quot;split&quot; roles, so that many of his female characters have multiple, fractured identities. This practice began when he cast Sheryl Lee as both Laura Palmer and her cousin Maddy Ferguson in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and continued in his later works. In &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, Patricia Arquette plays the dual role of Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield; in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; Naomi Watts plays Diane Selwyn/Betty Elms and Laura Harring plays Camilla Rhodes/Rita; in &quot;Inland Empire&quot; Laura Dern plays Nikki Grace/Susan Blue. The numerous alternate versions of lead characters and fragmented timelines may echo or reference the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics and perhaps Lynch&#x27;s broader interest in quantum mechanics. Some have suggested that Lynch&#x27;s love for Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot;, which employs a split lead character (Judy Barton/Madeleine Elster, both portrayed by Kim Novak) may have influenced this aspect of his work.

Lynch&#x27;s films often contain characters with supernatural or omnipotent qualities. They can be seen as physical manifestations of various concepts, such as hatred or fear. Examples include The Man Inside the Planet in &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, BOB in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, The Mystery Man in &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, The Bum in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, and The Phantom in &quot;Inland Empire&quot;. Lynch approached his characters and plots in a way that steeps them in a dream state rather than reality.

===Recurring collaborators===
Lynch was noted for his collaborations with various production artists and composers on his films and other productions. He frequently worked with composer Angelo Badalamenti, film editor Mary Sweeney, casting director Johanna Ray, and actors Harry Dean Stanton, Jack Nance, Kyle MacLachlan, Naomi Watts, Isabella Rossellini, Grace Zabriskie, and Laura Dern.

Lynch received multiple awards and nominations, including three Academy Award nominations for Best Director and one for Best Adapted Screenplay. He twice won France&#x27;s César Award for Best Foreign Film, as well as the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. The French government awarded him the Legion of Honour, the country&#x27;s top civilian distinction, honoring him first as a &quot;Chevalier&quot; in 2002 and then as an &quot;Officier&quot; in 2009; Lynch was also awarded the key to the city of Bydgoszcz, Poland. In 2017, The MacDowell Colony awarded Lynch The Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contributions to American culture.

<text>David Paul Cronenberg (born March 15, 1943) is a Canadian film director, screenwriter, producer and actor. He is a principal originator of the body horror genre, with his films exploring visceral bodily transformation, infectious diseases, and the intertwining of the psychological, physical, and technological. Cronenberg is best known for exploring these themes through sci-fi horror films such as &quot;Shivers&quot; (1975), &quot;Scanners&quot; (1981), &quot;Videodrome&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Fly&quot; (1986), though he has also directed dramas, psychological thrillers and gangster films.

Cronenberg&#x27;s films have polarized critics and audiences alike; he has earned critical acclaim and has sparked controversy for his depictions of gore and violence. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called him &quot;the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world&quot;. His films have won numerous awards, including the Special Jury Prize for &quot;Crash&quot; at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, a unique award that is distinct from the Jury Prize as it is not given annually, but only at the request of the official jury, who in this case gave the award &quot;for originality, for daring, and for audacity&quot;.

From the 2000s to the 2020s, Cronenberg collaborated on several films with Viggo Mortensen, including &quot;A History of Violence&quot; (2005), &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; (2007), &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot; (2011) and &quot;Crimes of the Future&quot; (2022). Seven of his films were selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or, the most recent being &quot;The Shrouds&quot; (2024), which was screened at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.

==Early life and education ==
David Cronenberg was born in Toronto, Ontario, on March 15, 1943. Cronenberg is the son of Esther ( Sumberg), a musician, and Milton Cronenberg, a writer and editor. He was raised in a &quot;middle-class progressive Jewish family&quot;. His father was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and his mother was born in Toronto; all of his grandparents were Jews from Lithuania. Milton wrote some short stories for &quot;True Detective&quot; and had a column in the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; for around thirty years. The Cronenberg household was full of a wide variety of books, and Cronenberg&#x27;s father tried to introduce his son to art films such as &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, although at the time Cronenberg was more interested in western and pirate films, showing a particular affinity for those featuring Burt Lancaster.

A voracious reader from an early age, Cronenberg started off enjoying science fiction magazines like &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Galaxy&quot;, and &quot;Astounding&quot;, where he first encountered authors who would prove influential on his own work, including Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov, although he wouldn&#x27;t encounter his primary influence, Philip K. Dick, until much later. Cronenberg also read comic books, noting his favorites were &quot;Tarzan&quot;, &quot;Little Lulu&quot;, &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;, &quot;Blackhawk&quot;, &quot;Plastic Man&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and the original Fawcett Comics version of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, later known as &quot;Shazam&quot;. Although as an adult, Cronenberg feels superhero films are artistically limited, he maintains a fondness for &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;/&quot;Shazam&quot;, criticizing how he feels the character had been neglected. Cronenberg also read horror comics published by EC, which in contrast to the others, he described as &quot;scary and bizarre and violent and nasty—the ones your mother didn&#x27;t want you to have.&quot; He has cited William S. Burroughs and Vladimir Nabokov as influences. 

Early films that later proved influential on Cronenberg&#x27;s career include avant-garde, horror, science fiction, and thriller films, such as &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;, &quot;Vampyr&quot;, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, &quot;Freaks&quot;, &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;, &quot;Alphaville&quot;, &quot;Performance&quot;, and &quot;Duel&quot;. He also cited less obvious films as influences, including comedies like &quot;The Bed Sitting Room&quot;, as well as Disney cartoons such as &quot;Bambi&quot; and &quot;Dumbo&quot;. Cronenberg said he found these two Disney animated films, as well as Universal&#x27;s live-action &quot;Blue Lagoon&quot;, &quot;terrifying&quot; which influenced his approach to horror. Cronenberg went on to say that &quot;Bambi&quot; was the &quot;first important film&quot; he ever saw, citing the moment when Bambi&#x27;s mother died as particularly powerful. Cronenberg even wished to screen &quot;Bambi&quot; as part of a museum exhibition of his influences, but Disney refused him permission. In terms of conventional horror films that frightened him, Cronenberg cited &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;.

Cronenberg attended Dewson Street Public School, Kent Senior School, Harbord Collegiate Institute and North Toronto Collegiate Institute. He enrolled at the University of Toronto for Honours Science in 1963, but changed to Honours English Language and Literature the next year. He graduated from university in 1967, at the top of his class with a general Bachelor of Arts. Cronenberg decided to not study for a master of arts after making &quot;Stereo&quot;.

Cronenberg&#x27;s fascination with the film &quot;Winter Kept Us Warm&quot; (1966), by classmate David Secter, sparked his interest in film. He began frequenting film camera rental houses and learned the art of filmmaking. Cronenberg made two short films, &quot;Transfer&quot; and &quot;From the Drain&quot;, with a few hundred dollars. Cronenberg, Ivan Reitman, Bob Fothergill, and Iain Ewing were inspired by Jonas Mekas and formed the Toronto Film Co-op.

==Career==
=== 1969–1979: Film debut and early work ===
After two short sketch films and two short art-house features (the black-and-white &quot;Stereo&quot; and the colour &quot;Crimes of the Future&quot;) Cronenberg went into partnership with Ivan Reitman. The Canadian government provided financing for his films throughout the 1970s. During this period, he focused on his signature &quot;body horror&quot; films such as &quot;Shivers&quot; (1975) and &quot;Rabid&quot; (1977), the latter of which provided pornographic actress Marilyn Chambers with work in a different genre, although Cronenberg&#x27;s first choice for the role had been a then little-known Sissy Spacek. &quot;Rabid&quot; was a breakthrough with international distributors, and his next horror feature, &quot;The Brood&quot; (1979), gained stronger support. Even then, he showed variety by making &quot;Fast Company&quot; (1979) between &quot;The Brood&quot; and &quot;Rabid&quot;, a project reflecting his interest in car racing and bike gangs.

=== 1981–1988: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
In 1981, Cronenberg directed the science-fiction horror film &quot;Scanners&quot; (1981). In it, &quot;scanners&quot; are psychics with unusual telepathic and telekinetic powers. The film has since become a cult classic. He followed it with another science-fiction horror film &quot;Videodrome&quot; (1983) starring James Woods. The film was distributed by Universal Pictures. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked on the film&#x27;s &quot;innovativeness&quot;, and praised Woods&#x27; performance as having a &quot;sharply authentic edge&quot;. That same year he directed &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; (1983), based on Stephen King&#x27;s novel of the same name, starring Christopher Walken.

Cronenberg directed &quot;The Fly&quot; (1986), starring Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. The film is loosely based on George Langelaan&#x27;s 1957 short story of the same name and the 1958 film of the same name. It was distributed by 20th Century Fox and was a box office hit, making $60 million. Cronenberg has not generally worked within the world of big-budget, mainstream Hollywood filmmaking, although he has had occasional near misses. At one stage he was considered by George Lucas as a possible director for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) but turned down the offer. Peter Suschitzky was the director of photography for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), and Cronenberg remarked that Suschitzky&#x27;s work in that film &quot;was the only one of those movies that actually looked good&quot;, which was a motivating factor to work with him on &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; (1988).

Since &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, Cronenberg has worked with Suschitzky on each of his films (see List of film director and cinematographer collaborations). Cronenberg has collaborated with composer Howard Shore on all of his films since &quot;The Brood&quot; (1979), (see List of film director and composer collaborations) with the exception of &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; (1983), which was scored by Michael Kamen. Other regular collaborators include actor Robert A. Silverman, art director Carol Spier (also his sister) sound editor Bryan Day, film editor Ronald Sanders, his sister, costume designer Denise Cronenberg, and, from 1979 until 1988, cinematographer Mark Irwin. In 2008, Cronenberg directed Shore&#x27;s first opera, &quot;The Fly&quot;.

=== 1991–2002: Career fluctuations ===

Perhaps the best example of a film that straddles the line between Cronenberg&#x27;s works of personal chaos and psychological confusion is his 1991 &quot;adaptation&quot; of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1959), his literary hero William S. Burroughs&#x27; most controversial book. The novel was considered &quot;unfilmable&quot;, and Cronenberg acknowledged that a straight translation into film would &quot;cost 400 million dollars and be banned in every country in the world&quot;. Instead—much like in his earlier film, &quot;Videodrome&quot;—he consistently blurred the lines between what appeared to be reality and what appeared to be hallucinations brought on by the main character&#x27;s drug addiction. Some of the book&#x27;s &quot;moments&quot; (as well as incidents loosely based upon Burroughs&#x27; life) are presented in this manner within the film. Cronenberg stated that while writing the screenplay for &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1991), he felt a moment of synergy with Burroughs&#x27; writing style. He felt the connection between his screenwriting style and Burroughs&#x27; prose style was so strong, that he jokingly remarked that should Burroughs pass on, he might write his next novel.

Cronenberg has also appeared as an actor in other directors&#x27; films. Most of his roles are cameo appearances, as in the films &quot;Into the Night&quot; (1985), &quot;Blood and Donuts&quot; (1995), &quot;To Die For&quot; (1995), and &quot;Jason X&quot; (2002) and the television series &quot;Alias&quot;, but on occasion he has played major roles, as in &quot;Nightbreed&quot; (1990) and &quot;Last Night&quot; (1998). He has not had major roles in any of his own films, but he did put in a brief appearance as a gynecologist in &quot;The Fly&quot;; he can also be glimpsed among the sex-crazed hordes in &quot;Shivers&quot;; he can be heard as an unseen car-pound attendant in &quot;Crash&quot;; his hands can be glimpsed in &quot;eXistenZ&quot; (1999); and he appeared as a stand-in for James Woods in &quot;Videodrome&quot;.

Cronenberg has said that his films should be seen &quot;from the point of view of the disease&quot;, and that in &quot;Shivers&quot;, for example, he identifies with the characters &quot;after&quot; they become infected with the anarchic parasites. Disease and disaster, in Cronenberg&#x27;s work, are less problems to be overcome than agents of personal transformation. Of his characters&#x27; transformations, Cronenberg said, &quot;But because of our necessity to impose our own structure of perception on things we look on ourselves as being relatively stable. But, in fact, when I look at a person I see this maelstrom of organic, chemical and electron chaos; volatility and instability, shimmering; and the ability to change and transform and transmute.&quot; Similarly, in &quot;Crash&quot; (1996), people who have been injured in car crashes attempt to view their ordeal as &quot;a fertilizing rather than a destructive event&quot;. In 2005, Cronenberg publicly disagreed with Paul Haggis&#x27; choice of the same name for the latter&#x27;s Oscar-winning film &quot;Crash&quot; (2004), arguing that it was &quot;very disrespectful&quot; to the &quot;important and seminal&quot; J. G. Ballard novel on which Cronenberg&#x27;s film was based.

=== 2005–present: Resurgence ===

His thriller &quot;A History of Violence&quot; (2005) is one of his highest budgeted and most accessible to date. He has said that the decision to direct it was influenced by his having had to defer some of his salary on the low-budgeted &quot;Spider&quot; (2002), but it was one of his most critically acclaimed films to date, along with &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; (2007), a film about the struggle of one man to gain power in the Russian Mafia. Although Cronenberg has worked with a number of Hollywood stars, he remains a staunchly Canadian filmmaker, with nearly all of his films (including major studio vehicles &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; and &quot;The Fly&quot;) having been filmed in his home province Ontario. Notable exceptions include &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; (1993), most of which was shot in China, &quot;Spider&quot;, and &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; (2007), which were both filmed primarily in England, and &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot; (2011), which was filmed in Germany and Austria. &quot;Rabid&quot; and &quot;Shivers&quot; were shot in and around Montreal. Most of his films have been at least partially financed by Telefilm Canada, and Cronenberg, a vocal supporter of government-backed film projects, has said: &quot;Every country needs [a system of government grants] to have a national cinema in the face of Hollywood&quot;.

In 2008, Cronenberg realized two extra-cinematographic projects: the exhibition &quot;Chromosomes&quot; at the Rome Film Fest, and the opera &quot;The Fly&quot; at the LaOpera in Los Angeles and Theatre Châtelet in Paris. In July 2010, Cronenberg completed production on &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot; (2011), an adaptation of Christopher Hampton&#x27;s play &quot;The Talking Cure&quot;, starring Keira Knightley, Michael Fassbender, Vincent Cassel, and frequent collaborator Viggo Mortensen. The film was produced by independent British producer Jeremy Thomas. On television, he has appeared in the recurring roles of Dr. Brezzel in Season 3 of &quot;Alias&quot;, and Kovich in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;. He has also had main roles as Reverend Verrenger in &quot;Alias Grace&quot;, and Spencer Galloway in &quot;Slasher: Flesh &amp; Blood&quot;.

In 2012, his film &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.

Filming for Cronenberg&#x27;s next film, a satire drama entitled &quot;Maps to the Stars&quot; (2014)—with Julianne Moore, Mia Wasikowska, John Cusack, and Robert Pattinson—began on July 8, 2013, in Toronto, Ontario and Los Angeles. This was the first time Cronenberg filmed in the United States. On June 26, 2014, Cronenberg&#x27;s short film &quot;The Nest&quot; was published on YouTube. The film was commissioned for &quot;David Cronenberg – The Exhibition&quot; at EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam and was available on YouTube for the duration of the exhibition, until September 14, 2014. Also in 2014, Cronenberg published his first novel, &quot;Consumed&quot;. In a May 2016 interview, Viggo Mortensen revealed that Cronenberg is considering retiring due to difficulty financing his film projects.

Cronenberg appears as himself in the minute-long short film &quot;The Death of David Cronenberg&quot;, shot by his daughter Caitlin, which was released digitally on September 19, 2021. In February 2021, Mortensen said Cronenberg had refined an older script he had written and hopes to film it with Mortensen that summer. He further hinted that it is a &quot;strange film noir&quot; and resembles Cronenberg&#x27;s earlier body horror films. In April 2021, the title was revealed to be &quot;Crimes of the Future&quot;. It was shot in Greece during the summer of 2021, and competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival. Cronenberg&#x27;s next film &quot;The Shrouds&quot; is set to premier at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival in competition, and be released theatrically in September 2024.

==Unrealized projects==
One of Cronenberg&#x27;s earliest unproduced film concepts was &quot;Roger Pagan, Gynecologist&quot;, about a neurotic man who impersonates a medical expert. The project was initially conceived in the early 1970s in the form of a novel.

In the early 1980s Cronenberg attempted to make a film adaption of Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; that took place in the modern day. Cronenberg wrote an original script for Universal after &quot;Videodrome&quot; titled &quot;Six Legs&quot;, but the film was never made although aspects were incorporated into &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;.

Cronenberg was offered the role of director for &quot;Witness&quot; while it was under the name &quot;Come Home&quot;, but declined as he &quot;could never be a fan of the Amish&quot;. He was also offered the director&#x27;s position for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, &quot;Flashdance&quot;, &quot;Top Gun&quot;, and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;. Marc Boyman offered Cronenberg the position of director for &quot;The Incubus&quot;, but declined although this led to Boyman producing &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;.

Cronenberg also worked for nearly a year on a version of &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990), but experienced &quot;creative differences&quot; with producers Dino De Laurentiis and Ronald Shusett; a different version of the film was eventually made by Paul Verhoeven. Cronenberg related in his 1992 memoir, &quot;Cronenberg on Cronenberg&quot; that, as a fan of Philip K. Dick—author of &quot;We Can Remember it For You Wholesale&quot;, the short story upon which the film was based— his dissatisfaction with what he envisioned the film to be and what it ended up being pained him so greatly that, for a time, he suffered a migraine just thinking about it, akin to a needle piercing his eye.

In 1993, Cronenberg signed a deal with Paragon Entertainment Corporation in which he would create a six-part television series called &quot;Crimes Against Nature&quot; for CBC Television. Cronenberg described the series as &quot;William Burroughs meets Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Alphaville&quot;.&quot; He started writing it on August 1, and filming was meant to begin in February 1994 using 35 mm film. The show was set in 2010 and was about members of the &quot;Flesh Squad&quot; police force. Carol Reynolds, the president of Paragon Entertainment, stated that each episode would cost between $500,000-600,000.

In the mid-1990s, he was attached to direct a version of &quot;American Psycho&quot;, with a screenplay adaptation by the author himself Bret Easton Ellis and with Brad Pitt starring in the role of Patrick Bateman. Cronenberg&#x27;s vision of the film would have concluded with a musical number involving Barry Manilow&#x27;s &quot;Daybreak&quot; and Bateman on the World Trade Center.

In 1999, Cronenberg was reportedly interested in taking the helm of Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Confessions of Dangerous Mind&quot;, with Sean Penn at that time circling to star. The following year, he was circling to direct &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot; for which he had a &quot;good script&quot; and Rupert Everett in the lead, but MGM said no because the actor is gay. At one stage, Cronenberg was going to make &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; as a horror film, with Al Pacino starring. In 2004, Cronenberg was attached to direct &quot;London Fields&quot;, based on Martin Amis&#x27; 1991 novel of the same name.

For a time it appeared that, as &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; producer Paul Webster told Screen International, a sequel was in the works that would reunite the key team of Cronenberg, Steven Knight, and Viggo Mortensen. It was slated for production by Webster&#x27;s new company &quot;Shoebox Films&quot; in collaboration with Focus Features, and shot in early 2013. In 2012, Cronenberg said the &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; sequel had fallen through due to budget disagreement with Focus Features.

In 2010, it was announced that Cronenberg would be directing an adaption of &quot;As She Climbed Across the Table&quot; by Jonathan Lethem. The following year, Media Rights Capital picked up the project, with Bruce Wagner set to write the script.

In the October 2011 edition of &quot;Rue Morgue&quot;, Cronenberg stated that he has written a companion piece to his 1986 remake of &quot;The Fly&quot;, which he would like to direct if given the chance. He has stated that it is not a traditional sequel, but rather a &quot;parallel story&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cronenberg lives in Toronto. He married his first wife, Margaret Hindson, in 1972: their seven-year marriage ended in 1979 amidst personal and professional differences. They had one daughter, Cassandra Cronenberg. His second wife was film editor Carolyn Zeifman, to whom he was married from 1979 until her death in 2017. The couple met on the set of &quot;Rabid&quot; while she was working as a production assistant. They have two children, Caitlin and Brandon. In the book &quot;Cronenberg on Cronenberg&quot; (1992), he revealed that &quot;The Brood&quot; was inspired by events that occurred during the unraveling of his first marriage, which caused both Cronenberg and his daughter Cassandra a great deal of turmoil. The character Nola Carveth, mother of the brood, is based on Cassandra&#x27;s mother. Cronenberg said that he found the shooting of the climactic scene, in which Nola was strangled by her husband, to be &quot;very satisfying&quot;.

In a September 2013 interview, Cronenberg revealed that film director Martin Scorsese admitted to him that he was intrigued by Cronenberg&#x27;s early work but was subsequently &quot;terrified&quot; to meet him in person. Cronenberg responded to Scorsese: &quot;You&#x27;re the guy who made &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and you&#x27;re afraid to meet me?&quot; In the same interview, Cronenberg identified as an atheist. &quot;Anytime I&#x27;ve tried to imagine squeezing myself into the box of any particular religion, I find it claustrophobic and oppressive,&quot; Cronenberg elaborated. &quot;I think atheism is an acceptance of what is real.&quot; In the same interview, Cronenberg revealed that it depends on the &quot;time of day&quot; as to whether or not he is afraid of death. He further stated that he is not concerned about posthumous representations of his film work: &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t disturb me to think that my work would just sink beneath the waves without trace and that would be it. So what? It doesn&#x27;t bother me.&quot;

In &quot;Cronenberg on Cronenberg&quot;, the director further elaborated that he was raised in a secular Jewish home, and while he and his family had no disdain towards any religion, such matters were not discussed. In the same book, Cronenberg said that in his teens he went through a phase where he wondered about the existence of God, but ultimately came to the conclusion that the God concept was developed to cope with the fear of death. In a 2007 interview, Cronenberg explained the role atheism plays in his work. He stated, &quot;I&#x27;m interested in saying, &#x27;Let us discuss the existential question. We are all going to die, that is the end of all consciousness. There is no afterlife. There is no God. Now what do we do.&#x27; That&#x27;s the point where it starts getting interesting to me.&quot;

In Cronenberg&#x27;s later films (e.g. &quot;A History of Violence&quot;, &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; and &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot;) openly religious characters become more common. During an interview for &quot;A History of Violence&quot;, Cronenberg even chose to identify as a materialist rather than an atheist, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m not an atheist, but for me to turn away from any aspect of the human body to me is a philosophical betrayal. And there&#x27;s a lot of art and religion whose whole purpose is to turn away from the human body. I feel in my art that my mandate is to not do that.&quot;

In a separate 2013 interview, Cronenberg discussed the role religion plays in his films, using &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; as the main example:

I&#x27;m an atheist but not all my characters are atheists. So it&#x27;s true that I don&#x27;t think about God ever as part of my life or anything. But if you&#x27;re a dramatist and you are working with characters who come from a particular culture, you have to accept their understanding of life, and with passion. So the Nikolai character, I&#x27;m pretty sure he believes in God and most of the other characters in the movie do too. Some of them are Muslim, some of them are Eastern Orthodox, and that&#x27;s a part of their life, a part of their understanding of suffering. Because everybody in life suffers but not everybody thinks of that in religious terms. These people do. And they think of suffering as a way to salvation, also in religious terms. I am their God really, as I am creating them; that&#x27;s religious in itself. I am a very hardcore atheist believe me but you become like an actor really, as a director or a writer. You must take on the character as that character is and believe in it as you&#x27;re playing it. To allow that character to exist as he would exist. That&#x27;s really what it&#x27;s all about, so I have no problem with characters who are religious and believe in God. I would have a problem if that was the point of the whole story because that bores me and I just don&#x27;t have any emotional or intellectual respect for it, frankly.

==Awards and recognition ==

Cronenberg has appeared on various &quot;Greatest Director&quot; lists. In 2004, Science Fiction magazine &quot;Strange Horizons&quot; named him the second greatest director in the history of the genre, ahead of better known directors such as Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Jean-Luc Godard, and Ridley Scott. In the same year, &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed him 9th on their list of &quot;The world&#x27;s 40 best directors&quot;. In 2007, Total Film named him as the 17th greatest director of all time. Film professor Charles Derry, in his overview of the horror genre &quot;Dark Dreams&quot;, called the director one of the most important in his field, and that &quot;no discussion of contemporary horror film can conclude without reference to the films of David Cronenberg.&quot;

Cronenberg received the Special Jury Prize at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Crash&quot;. In 1999, he was inducted onto Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, awarded the Silver Bear Award at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival. and that November received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts.

<text>Ralph Dale Earnhardt (; April 29, 1951February 18, 2001) was an American professional stock car driver and racing team owner, who raced from 1975 to 2001 in the former NASCAR Winston Cup Series (now called the NASCAR Cup Series), most notably driving the No.3 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing. His aggressive driving style earned him the nicknames &quot;the Intimidator&quot;, &quot;the Man in Black&quot; and &quot;Ironhead&quot;; after his son Dale Earnhardt Jr. joined the Cup Series circuit in 1999, Earnhardt was generally known by the retronyms Dale Earnhardt Sr. and Dale Sr. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers in NASCAR history and was named as one of the NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers class in 1998.

The third child of racing driver Ralph Earnhardt and Martha Earnhardt, he began his career in 1975 in the World 600. Earnhardt won a total of 76 Winston Cup races over the course of his 26-year career, including crown jewel victories in four Winston 500s (1990, 1994, 1999, and 2000), three Cola-Cola 600s (1986, 1992, and 1993), three Southern 500s (1987, 1989, and 1990), the Brickyard 400 in 1995, and the 1998 Daytona 500. Along with his 76 career points wins, he has also won 24 non-points exhibition events, bringing his overall Winston Cup win total to 100, one of only four drivers in NASCAR history to do so. He is the only driver in NASCAR history to score at least one win in four different and consecutive decades (scoring his first career win in 1979, 38 wins in the 1980s, 35 wins in the 1990s, &amp; scoring his final two career wins in 2000). He also earned seven Winston Cup championships, a record held with Richard Petty and Jimmie Johnson.

On February 18, 2001, Earnhardt died as a result of a basilar skull fracture sustained in a sudden last-lap crash during the Daytona 500. His death was regarded in the racing industry as being a crucial moment in improving safety in all aspects of car racing, especially NASCAR. He was 49 years old. Earnhardt has been inducted into numerous halls of fame, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame inaugural class in 2010.

==Biography==

===Early and personal life===
Ralph Dale Earnhardt was born on April 29, 1951, in the suburb of Kannapolis, North Carolina, as the third child of Martha ( Coleman, 1930–2021) and Ralph Earnhardt (1928–1973). Earnhardt&#x27;s father was one of the best short-track drivers in North Carolina at the time and won his first and only NASCAR Sportsman Championship in 1956 at Greenville Pickens Speedway in Greenville, South Carolina. In 1963 at the age of 12, Dale Earnhardt secretly drove his father&#x27;s car in one of his races and had a near victory against one of his father&#x27;s closest competitors. In 1972, he raced his father at Metrolina Speedway in a race with cars from semi mod and sportsman divisions. Although Ralph did not want his son to pursue a career as a race car driver, Dale dropped out of school to pursue his dreams. Ralph was a hard teacher for Dale, and after Ralph suddenly died of a heart attack at his home in 1973 at age 45, it took many years before Dale felt as though he had finally &quot;proven&quot; himself to his father. Earnhardt had four siblings: two brothers, Danny (died 2021) and Randy (died 2013); and two sisters, Cathy and Kaye.

Earnhardt was married three times. In 1968, at the age of 17, Earnhardt married his first wife, Latane Brown. With her, Earnhardt fathered his first son, Kerry, a year later. Earnhardt and Brown divorced in 1970. In 1971, Earnhardt married his second wife, Brenda Gee, the daughter of NASCAR car builder Robert Gee. In his marriage with Gee, Earnhardt had two children: a daughter, Kelley King Earnhardt, in 1972, and a son, Dale Earnhardt Jr., in 1974. Not long after Dale Jr. was born, Earnhardt and Gee divorced. Earnhardt then married his third wife, Teresa Houston, in 1982. She gave birth to their daughter, Taylor Nicole Earnhardt, in 1988.

==NASCAR career==
===Early Winston Cup career (1975–1978)===
Earnhardt began his professional career in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series in 1975, making his points race debut at Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina in the longest race on the Cup circuit—the 1975 World 600. He had made his Grand National debut in 1974 in an unofficial invitational exhibition race at Metrolina Speedway, where with eight laps to go he got under Richard Childress and spun out when battling for third. He drove the No. 8 Ed Negre Dodge Charger and finished 22nd in that race, just one spot ahead of his future car owner, Richard Childress. Earnhardt competed in eight more races until 1979.

===Rod Osterlund Racing (1979–1980)===
When he joined car owner Rod Osterlund Racing in a season that included a rookie class of future stars including Earnhardt, Harry Gant, and Terry Labonte in his rookie season, Earnhardt won one race at Bristol, captured four poles, scored eleven Top 5s and seventeen Top 10s, and finished seventh in the points standings despite missing four races due to a broken collarbone, winning Rookie of the Year honors.

During his sophomore season, Earnhardt, now with 20-year-old Doug Richert as his crew chief, began the season winning the Busch Clash. With wins at Atlanta, Bristol, Nashville, Martinsville, and Charlotte, Earnhardt won his first Winston Cup points championship. He is the only driver in NASCAR Cup history to follow a Rookie of the Year title with a NASCAR Winston Cup Championship the next season. He was also the third driver in NASCAR history to win both the Rookie of the Year and Winston Cup Series championship, following David Pearson (1960, 1966) and Richard Petty (1959, 1964). Ten drivers have since joined this exclusive club: Rusty Wallace (1984, 1989), Alan Kulwicki (1986, 1992), Jeff Gordon (1993, 1995), Tony Stewart (1999, 2002), Matt Kenseth (2000, 2003), Kevin Harvick (2001, 2014), Kyle Busch (2005, 2015), Joey Logano (2009, 2018, 2022, 2024), Chase Elliott (2016, 2020), and Kyle Larson (2014, 2021).

===Rod Osterlund Racing, Stacy Racing, and Richard Childress Racing (1981)===
1981 would prove to be tumultuous for the defending Winston Cup champion. Sixteen races into the season, Rod Osterlund suddenly sold his team to Jim Stacy, an entrepreneur from Kentucky who entered NASCAR in 1977. After just four races, Earnhardt fell out with Stacy and left the team. Earnhardt finished out the year driving Pontiacs for Richard Childress Racing and managed to place seventh in the final points standings. Earnhardt departed RCR at the end of the season, citing a lack of chemistry.

Earnhardt was also a color commentator for the Busch Clash, while he also drove on that same day.

===Bud Moore Engineering (1982–1983)===
The following year, at Childress&#x27;s suggestion, Earnhardt joined car owner Bud Moore for the 1982 and 1983 seasons driving the No. 15 Wrangler Jeans-sponsored Ford Thunderbird (the only full-time Ford ride in his career). During the 1982 season, Earnhardt struggled. Although he won at Darlington, he failed to finish 18 of the 30 races and ended the season 12th in points, the worst of his career. He also suffered a broken kneecap at Pocono Raceway when he flipped after contact with Tim Richmond. In 1983, Earnhardt rebounded and won his first of 12 Twin 125 Daytona 500 qualifying races. He won at Nashville and at Talladega, finishing eighth in the points standings, despite failing to finish 13 of the 30 races.

===Return to Richard Childress Racing (1984–2001)===

====1984–1985====
After the 1983 season, Earnhardt returned to Richard Childress Racing, replacing Ricky Rudd in the No. 3. Rudd went to Bud Moore&#x27;s No. 15, replacing Earnhardt. Wrangler sponsored both drivers at their respective teams. During the 1984 and 1985 seasons, Earnhardt went to victory lane six times, at Talladega, Atlanta, Richmond, Bristol (twice), and Martinsville, where he finished fourth and eighth in the season standings respectively.

====1986–1987====
The 1986 season saw Earnhardt win his second career Winston Cup Championship and the first owner&#x27;s championship for Richard Childress Racing. He won five races and had 16 top-fives and 23 top-10s. Earnhardt successfully defended his championship the following year, going to victory lane 11 times and winning the championship by 489 points over Bill Elliott. In the process, Earnhardt set a NASCAR modern-era record of four consecutive wins and won five of the first seven races. In the 1987 season, he earned the nickname &quot;the Intimidator&quot;, due in part to the 1987 Winston All-Star Race. During this race, Earnhardt was briefly forced into the infield grass but kept control of his car and returned to the track without giving up his lead. The maneuver is now referred to as the &quot;Pass in the Grass&quot;, even though Earnhardt did not pass anyone while he was off the track. After The Winston, an angry fan sent Bill France Jr. a letter threatening to kill Earnhardt at Pocono, Watkins Glen, or Dover, prompting the FBI to provide security for Earnhardt on the three tracks. The investigation was closed after the races at the three tracks finished without incident. Many of Earnhardt&#x27;s competitors on the racetrack disliked his personal driving style. Earnhardt&#x27;s relentless pursuit of victory on the racetrack combined with his uniquely offensive driving ability led to many rivalries with fellow drivers and fines levied by NASCAR. In 1987, NASCAR began to implement a measure that was designed to incentivize less aggressive driving styles by forcing drivers who cause these undesired hazardous racing conditions to be subjected to time at the garage region during the race.

====1988–1989====
The 1988 season saw Earnhardt racing with a new sponsor, GM Goodwrench, after Wrangler Jeans dropped its sponsorship in 1987. During this season, he changed the color of his paint scheme from blue and yellow to the signature black in which the No. 3 car was painted for the rest of his life. He won three races in 1988, finishing third in the points standings behind Bill Elliott in first and Rusty Wallace in second. The following year, Earnhardt won five races, but a late spin out at North Wilkesboro arguably cost him the 1989 championship, as Rusty Wallace edged him out for it by 12 points (Earnhardt won the final race, but Wallace finished 15th when needing to finish at least 18th to win). It was his first season for the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet Lumina.

====1990–1995====
The 1990 season started for Earnhardt with victories in the Busch Clash and his heat of the Gatorade Twin 125&#x27;s. Near the end of the Daytona 500, he had a dominant forty-second lead when the final caution flag came out with a handful of laps to go. When the green flag waved, Earnhardt was leading Derrike Cope. On the final lap, Earnhardt ran over a piece of metal, which was later revealed as a bell housing, in turn 3, cutting down a tire. Cope, in an upset, won the race while Earnhardt finished fifth after leading 155 of the 200 laps. The No. 3 Goodwrench-sponsored Chevy team took the flat tire that cost them the win and hung it on the shop wall as a reminder of how close they had come to winning the Daytona 500. Earnhardt won nine races that season and won his fourth Winston Cup title, beating Mark Martin by 26 points. He also became the first multiple winner of the annual all-star race, The Winston. The 1991 season saw Earnhardt win his fifth Winston Cup championship. This season, he scored four wins and won the championship by 195 points over Ricky Rudd. One of his wins came at North Wilkesboro, in a race where Harry Gant had a chance to set a single-season record by winning his fifth consecutive race, breaking a record held by Earnhardt. Late in the race, Gant lost his brakes, which gave Earnhardt the chance he needed to make the pass for the win and maintain his record.

Earnhardt&#x27;s only win of the 1992 season came at Charlotte, in the Coca-Cola 600, ending a 13-race win streak by Ford teams. Earnhardt finished a career-low 12th in the points for the second time in his career, with three last place finishes (Daytona and Talladega in July and Martinsville in September), and the only time he had finished that low since joining Richard Childress Racing. He still made the trip to the annual Awards Banquet with Rusty Wallace but did not have the best seat in the house. Wallace stated he and Earnhardt had to sit on the backs of their chairs to see, and Earnhardt said, &quot;This sucks, I should have gone hunting.&quot; At the end of the year, longtime crew chief Kirk Shelmerdine left to become a driver. Andy Petree took over as crew chief. Hiring Petree turned out to be beneficial, as Earnhardt returned to the front in 1993. He once again came close to a win at the Daytona 500 and dominated Speedweeks before finishing second to Dale Jarrett on a last-lap pass. Earnhardt scored six wins en route to his sixth Winston Cup title, including wins in the first prime-time Coca-Cola 600 and The Winston, both at Charlotte, and the Pepsi 400 at Daytona. He beat Rusty Wallace for the championship by 80 points. On November 14, 1993, after the season-ending Hooters 500 at Atlanta, the race winner Wallace and 1993 series champion Earnhardt ran a dual Polish Victory Lap together while carrying #28 and #7 flags commemorating 1992 Daytona 500 winner Davey Allison and 1992 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Alan Kulwicki respectively, who both had died in separate plane accidents during the season.
In 1994, Earnhardt achieved a feat that he himself had believed to be impossible—he scored his seventh Winston Cup championship, tying Richard Petty. He was very consistent, scoring four wins, and after Ernie Irvan was sidelined due to a near-deadly crash at Michigan (the two were neck-and-neck at the top of the points up until the crash), won the title by over 400 points over Mark Martin. Earnhardt sealed the deal at Rockingham by winning the race over Rick Mast. It was his final NASCAR championship and his final season for the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet Lumina. Earnhardt started off the 1995 season by finishing second in the Daytona 500 to Sterling Marlin. He won five races in 1995, including his first road course victory at Sears Point. He also won the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a win he called the biggest of his career. But in the end, Earnhardt lost the championship to Jeff Gordon by 34 points. The GM Goodwrench racing team changed to Chevrolet Monte Carlos.

Earnhardt almost was ready to leave the #3 at the end of the 1995 season, according to his former crew chief Larry McReynolds. At the time, McReynolds was the crew chief for the #28 Havoline Ford Thunderbird at Robert Yates Racing. Earnhardt had actually been approached by Yates to drive the #28 for the 1995 season in place of Ernie Irvan, who was injured in a crash during the 1994 season. Instead, Robert Yates signed Dale Jarrett to a one-year deal to drive the #28. During the 1995 season, Yates was being pressed by his manufacturer to start a second team and sent a contract to Earnhardt to drive it. Earnhardt never returned the contract, and according to McReynolds the reason he did not sign was because he only wanted to drive the #28 for Yates; the team fully intended to put Irvan back behind the wheel of his old car once he was able to resume driving. Instead, Earnhardt stayed with RCR and the #3, while Jarrett was signed to drive Yates&#x27; new car, numbered 88.

====1996–1999====

1996 for Earnhardt started just like it had done in 1993—he dominated Speedweeks, only to finish second in the Daytona 500 to Dale Jarrett for the second time. He won early in the year, scoring consecutive victories at Rockingham and Atlanta. On July 28 in the DieHard 500 at Talladega, he was second in points and looking for his eighth season title, despite the departure of crew chief Andy Petree. Late in the race, Ernie Irvan lost control of his No. 28 Havoline-sponsored Ford Thunderbird, made contact with the No. 4 Kodak-sponsored Chevy Monte Carlo of Sterling Marlin, and ignited a crash that saw Earnhardt&#x27;s No. 3 Chevrolet hit the tri-oval wall nearly head-on at almost 200 mph. After hitting the wall, Earnhardt&#x27;s car flipped and slid across the track, in front of race traffic. His car was hit in the roof and windshield. This accident, as well as a similar accident that led to the death of Russell Phillips at Charlotte, led NASCAR to mandate the &quot;Earnhardt Bar&quot;, a metal brace located in the center of the windshield that reinforces the roof in case of a similar crash. This bar is also required in NASCAR-owned United SportsCar Racing and its predecessors for road racing.

Rain delays had canceled the live telecast of the race, and most fans first learned of the accident during the night&#x27;s sports newscasts. Video of the crash showed what appeared to be a fatal incident, but once medical workers arrived at the car, Earnhardt climbed out and waved to the crowd, refusing to be loaded onto a stretcher despite a broken collarbone, sternum, and shoulder blade. Although the incident looked like it would end his season early, Earnhardt refused to stay out of the car. The next week at Indianapolis, he started the race but exited the car on the first pit stop, allowing Mike Skinner to take the wheel. When asked, Earnhardt said that vacating the No. 3 car was the hardest thing he had ever done. The following weekend at Watkins Glen, he drove the No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet to the fastest time in qualifying, earning the &quot;True Grit&quot; pole. T-shirts emblazoned with Earnhardt&#x27;s face were quickly printed up, brandishing the caption, &quot;It Hurt So Good&quot;. Earnhardt led for most of the race and looked to have victory in hand, but fatigue took its toll and he ended up sixth behind race winner Geoff Bodine. Earnhardt did not win again in 1996 but still finished fourth in the standings behind Terry Labonte, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Jarrett, with 2 wins, 13 top fives, 17 top tens, and his last 2 career poles, with an average finish of 10.6. David Smith departed as crew chief of the No. 3 team and RCR at the end of the year for personal reasons, and he was replaced by Larry McReynolds.

In 1997, Earnhardt went winless for only the second time in his career. The only (non-points) win came during Speedweeks at Daytona in the Twin 125-mile qualifying race, his record eighth-straight win in the event. Once again in the hunt for the Daytona 500 with 10 laps to go, Earnhardt was taken out of contention by a late crash which sent his car upside down on the backstretch. He hit the low point of his year when he blacked out early in the Mountain Dew Southern 500 at Darlington in September, causing him to hit the wall. Afterward, he was disoriented, and it took several laps before he could find his pit stall. When asked, Earnhardt complained of double vision which made it difficult to pit. Mike Dillon (Richard Childress&#x27;s son-in-law) was brought in to relieve Earnhardt for the remainder of the race. Earnhardt was evaluated at a local hospital and cleared to race the next week, but the cause of the blackout and double vision was never determined. Despite no wins, Earnhardt finished the season fifth in the final standings with 7 top fives and 16 top tens, with an average finish of 12.1.
On February 15, 1998, Earnhardt finally won the Daytona 500 in his 20th attempt after failing to win in his previous 19 attempts. He began the season by winning his Twin 125-mile qualifier race for the ninth straight year, and the week before was the first to drive around the track under the newly installed lights, for coincidentally 20 laps. On race day, he showed himself to be a contender early. Halfway through the race, however, it seemed that Jeff Gordon had the upper hand. But by lap 138, Earnhardt had taken the lead and thanks to a push by teammate Mike Skinner, he maintained it. Earnhardt made it to the caution-checkered flag before Bobby Labonte. Afterwards, there was a large show of respect for Earnhardt, in which every crew member of every team lined pit road to shake his hand as he made his way to victory lane. Earnhardt then drove his No. 3 into the infield grass, starting a trend of post-race celebrations. He spun the car twice, throwing grass and leaving tire tracks in the shape of a No. 3 in the grass. He then spoke about the victory, saying, &quot;I have had a lot of great fans and people behind me all through the years and I just can&#x27;t thank them enough. The Daytona 500 is ours. We won it, we won it, we won it!&quot; The rest of the season did not go as well, and the Daytona 500 was his only victory that year. Despite that, he did almost pull off a Daytona sweep, where he was one of the contenders for the win in the first nighttime Pepsi 400, but a pit stop late in the race in which a rogue tire cost him the race win. He slipped to 12th in the point standings halfway through the season, and Richard Childress decided to make a crew chief change, taking Mike Skinner&#x27;s crew chief Kevin Hamlin and putting him with Earnhardt while giving Skinner Larry McReynolds (Earnhardt&#x27;s crew chief). Earnhardt finished the 1998 season eighth in the final points standings, with 1 win, 5 top fives, and 13 top tens, with an average finish of 16.2.

Before the 1999 season, fans began discussing Earnhardt&#x27;s age and speculating that with his son, Dale Jr., making his Winston Cup debut, Earnhardt might be contemplating retirement. Earnhardt swept both races for the year at Talladega, leading some to conclude that his talent had become limited to the restrictor plate tracks, which require a unique skill set and an exceptionally powerful racecar to win. But halfway through the year, Earnhardt began to show some of the old spark. In the August race at Michigan, he led laps late in the race and nearly pulled off his first win on a non-restrictor-plate track since 1996. One week later, he provided NASCAR with one of its most controversial moments. At the Bristol night race, Earnhardt found himself in contention to win his first short track race since Martinsville in 1995. When a caution came out with 15 laps to go, leader Terry Labonte got hit from behind by the lapped car of Darrell Waltrip. His spin put Earnhardt in the lead with five cars between him and Labonte with five laps to go. Labonte had four fresh tires, and Earnhardt was driving on old tires, which made Earnhardt&#x27;s car considerably slower. Labonte caught Earnhardt and passed him coming to the white flag, but Earnhardt drove hard into turn two, bumping Labonte and spinning him around. Earnhardt collected the win while spectators booed and made obscene gestures. &quot;I didn&#x27;t mean to turn him around, I just wanted to rattle his cage,&quot; Earnhardt said of the incident. He finished seventh in the standings that year, with 3 wins, 7 top fives, and 21 top tens, with an average finish of 12.0.

====2000====

In the 2000 season, Earnhardt had a resurgence, which was commonly attributed to neck surgery he underwent to correct a lingering injury from his 1996 Talladega crash. He scored what were considered the two most exciting wins of the year—winning by 0.010 seconds over Bobby Labonte at Atlanta, then gaining seventeen positions in the final four laps to win at Talladega, claiming his only No Bull million-dollar bonus along with his record 10th win at the track. Earnhardt also had second-place runs at Richmond and Martinsville, tracks where he had struggled through the late 1990s. On the strength of those performances, Earnhardt got to second in the standings. However, poor performances at the road course of Watkins Glen, where he wrecked coming out of the chicane, a wreck with Kenny Irwin Jr. while leading the spring race at Bristol, and mid-pack runs at intermediate tracks like Charlotte and Dover in a season dominated by the Ford Taurus in those tracks from Roush, Yates, and Penske, coupled with Bobby Labonte&#x27;s extreme consistency, denied Earnhardt an eighth championship title. Earnhardt finished 2000 with two wins, 13 top fives, 24 top tens, an average finish of 9.4, and was the only driver besides Labonte to finish the season with zero DNF&#x27;s.

==Death==

During the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 18, 2001, Earnhardt was killed in a three-car crash on the final lap of the race. He collided with Ken Schrader after making small contact with Sterling Marlin and hit the outside wall head-on. He had been blocking Schrader on the outside and Marlin on the inside at the time of the crash. Earnhardt&#x27;s and Schrader&#x27;s cars both slid off the track&#x27;s asphalt banking into the infield grass just inside of turn 4. Seconds later, his driver Michael Waltrip won the race, with Waltrip&#x27;s teammate and Earnhardt&#x27;s son Dale Earnhardt Jr. finishing second. Earnhardt was pronounced dead at the Halifax Medical Center at 5:16 pm Eastern Standard Time (22:16 UTC); he was 49 years old. NASCAR president Mike Helton confirmed Earnhardt&#x27;s death in a statement to the press. An autopsy conducted on February 19, 2001, concluded that Earnhardt sustained a fatal basilar skull fracture. Four days later, on February 22, public funeral services for Earnhardt were held at the Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina.

=== Aftermath ===
Several press conferences were held in the days following Earnhardt&#x27;s death. After driver Sterling Marlin and his relatives received hate mail and death threats from angry fans, Waltrip and Earnhardt Jr. absolved him of any responsibility.

The Daytona Beach Police Department and NASCAR opened two investigations about the crash; nearly every detail of the crash was made public. The allegations of seatbelt failure resulted in Bill Simpson&#x27;s resignation from the company bearing his name, which manufactured the seatbelts used in Earnhardt&#x27;s car and nearly every other NASCAR driver&#x27;s car. In October 2001, NASCAR mandated drivers from its three national series to use the HANS device, which Earnhardt had refused to wear after finding it restrictive and uncomfortable.

Team owner Richard Childress made a public pledge that the number 3 would never again adorn the side of a black race car with a GM Goodwrench sponsorship, and the car was re-numbered as the #29. Childress&#x27;s second-year Busch Series driver Kevin Harvick was named as Earnhardt&#x27;s replacement, beginning with the 2001 Dura Lube 400 at North Carolina Speedway. Special pennants bearing the No. 3 were distributed to everyone at the track to honor Earnhardt, and the Childress team wore blank uniforms out of respect, something which disappeared quickly and was soon replaced by the previous GM Goodwrench Service Plus uniforms.

Harvick&#x27;s car always displayed the Earnhardt stylized number 3 on the &quot;B&quot; posts (metal portion on each side of the car to the rear of the front windows) above the number 29 until the end of 2013, when he departed for Stewart-Haas Racing. The number 3 returned for the 2014 season, this time not sponsored by GM Goodwrench (which was rebranded GM Certified Service in 2011), driven by Childress&#x27;s grandson Austin Dillon. 

Fans began honoring Earnhardt by holding three fingers aloft on the third lap of every race, a black screen of No. 3 in the beginning of &quot;NASCAR Thunder 2002&quot; before the EA Sports logo, and the television coverage of &quot;NASCAR on Fox&quot; and &quot;NASCAR on NBC&quot; went silent for each third lap from Rockingham to the following year&#x27;s race there in honor of Earnhardt, unless on-track incidents brought out the caution flag on the third lap. Three weeks after Earnhardt&#x27;s death, Harvick, driving a car that had been prepared for Earnhardt, scored his first career Cup win at Atlanta. On the final lap of the 2001 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500, he beat Jeff Gordon by .006 seconds (the margin being 0.004 of a second closer than Earnhardt had won over Bobby Labonte at the same race a year ago) in an identical photo finish, and the images of Earnhardt&#x27;s longtime gas man Danny &quot;Chocolate&quot; Myers crying after the victory, Harvick&#x27;s tire-smoking burnout on the front stretch with three fingers held aloft outside the driver&#x27;s window. Harvick would win another race at the inaugural event at Chicagoland en route to a ninth-place finish in the final points and won Rookie of the Year honors along with the 2001 NASCAR Busch Series Championship.

Dale Earnhardt, Inc. won five races in the 2001 season, beginning with Steve Park&#x27;s victory in the race at Rockingham just one week after Earnhardt&#x27;s death. Earnhardt Jr. and Waltrip finished first and second in the series&#x27; return to Daytona in July for the Pepsi 400, a reverse of the finish in the Daytona 500. Earnhardt Jr. also won the fall races at Dover (first post 9/11 race) and Talladega and came to an eighth-place points finish.

Earnhardt&#x27;s remains were interred at his estate in Mooresville, North Carolina after a private funeral service on February 21, 2001.

==No. 3 car==
Earnhardt drove the No. 3 car for the majority of his career, spanning the latter half of the 1981 season, and then again from 1984 until he died in 2001. Although he had other sponsors during his career, his No. 3 is associated in fans&#x27; minds with his last sponsor GM Goodwrench and his last color scheme — a predominantly black car with bold red and silver trim. The black and red No. 3 continues to be one of the most famous logos in North American motor racing.

A common misconception was that Richard Childress Racing &quot;owned the rights&quot; to the No. 3 in NASCAR competition (fueled by the fact that Kevin Harvick&#x27;s car had a little No. 3 as an homage to Earnhardt from 2001 to 2013 and the usage of the No. 3 on the Camping World Truck Series truck of Ty Dillon when he ran in that series), but NASCAR, and no specific team, owns the rights to this or any other number. According to established NASCAR procedures, Richard Childress Racing had priority over other teams if they chose to reuse the number, which they did when Austin Dillon was promoted to the Cup series in 2014. While Richard Childress Racing owns the stylized No. 3 logos used during Earnhardt&#x27;s lifetime (and used presently with Dillon), those rights would hypothetically not prevent a future racing team from using a different No. 3 design (also, a new No. 3 team would most likely, in any case, need to create logos which fit with their sponsor&#x27;s logos).

In 2004, ESPN released a made-for-TV movie entitled &quot;3: The Dale Earnhardt Story&quot;, which used a new (but similarly colored) No. 3 logo. The movie was a sympathetic portrayal of Earnhardt&#x27;s life, but the producers were sued for using the No. 3 logo. In December 2006, the ESPN lawsuit was settled, but details were not released to the public.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. made two special appearances in 2002 in a No. 3 Busch Series car: these appearances were at the track where his father died (Daytona) and the track where he made his first Winston Cup start (Charlotte). Earnhardt Jr. won the first of those two races, which was the season-opening event at Daytona. He also raced a No. 3 sponsored by Wrangler on July 2, 2010, for Richard Childress Racing at Daytona. In a green-white-checker finish he outran Joey Logano to win his second race in the No. 3.

Otherwise, the No. 3 was missing from the national touring series until September 5, 2009, when Austin Dillon, the 19-year-old grandson of Richard Childress, debuted an RCR-owned No. 3 truck in the Camping World Truck Series. Dillon and his younger brother Ty Dillon drove the No. 3 in various lower level competitions for several years, including the Camping World East Series. In 2012, Austin Dillon began driving in the Nationwide Series full-time, using the No. 3; he had previously used the No. 33 while driving in that series part-time.

Richard Childress Racing entered a No. 3 in the Daytona truck race on February 13, 2010, with sponsorship from Bass Pro Shops driven by Austin Dillon. It was involved in a wreck almost identical to that which took the life of Earnhardt: being spun out, colliding with another vehicle, and being turned into the outside wall in turn number four. Dillon again returned to a No. 3 marked racecar when he started fifth in the 2012 Daytona Nationwide Series opener in an Advocare-sponsored black Chevrolet Impala. On December 11, 2013, RCR announced that Austin Dillon would drive the No. 3 car in the upcoming 2014 Sprint Cup season, bringing the number back to the series for the first time in 13 years.

Only the former International Race of Champions actually retired the No. 3, which they did in a rule change effective in 2004. Until the series folded in 2007, anyone wishing to use the No. 3 again had to use No. 03 instead.

Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo chose the number 3 as his permanent racing number when F1&#x27;s rules changed to allow drivers to choose their own numbers for 2014 and stated on Twitter that part of the reason for his choice was that he was a fan of Earnhardt&#x27;s, while his helmet design features the number stylized in the same way.

==Legacy==
&quot;Earnhardt Tower&quot;, a seating section at Daytona International Speedway was opened and named in his honor a month before his death at the track.

Earnhardt has several roads named after him, including a street in his hometown Kannapolis. Dale Earnhardt Boulevard (originally Earnhardt Road) is marked as exit 60 off Interstate 85, northeast of Charlotte. Dale Earnhardt Drive is also the start of The Dale Journey Trail, a self-guided driving tour of landmarks in the lives of Earnhardt and his family. The North Carolina Department of Transportation switched the designation of a road between Kannapolis and Mooresville near the headquarters of DEI (that used to be called NC 136) with NC 3, which was in Currituck County. In addition, exit 72 off Interstate 35W, one of the entrances to Texas Motor Speedway, is named &quot;Dale Earnhardt Way&quot;.

Between the 2004 and 2005 JGTC (renamed Super GT from 2005) season, Hasemi Sport competed in the series with a sole black G&#x27;Zox-sponsored Nissan 350Z with the same number and letterset as Earnhardt on the roof.

During the NASCAR weekend races at Talladega Superspeedway on April 29, 2006 – May 1, 2006, the DEI cars competed in identical special black paint schemes on Dale Earnhardt Day, which is held annually on his birthday—April 29. Martin Truex Jr., won the Aaron&#x27;s 312 in the black car, painted to reflect Earnhardt&#x27;s Intimidating Black No. 3 NASCAR Busch Grand National series car. In the Nextel Cup race on May 1, No. 8 Dale Earnhardt Jr.; No. 1 Martin Truex Jr.; and No. 15 Paul Menard competed in cars with the same type of paint scheme.

On June 18, 2006, at Michigan for the 3M Performance 400, Earnhardt Jr. ran a special vintage Budweiser car to honor his father and his grandfather Ralph Earnhardt. He finished third after rain caused the race to be cut short. The car was painted to resemble Ralph&#x27;s 1956 dirt cars, and carried 1956-era Budweiser logos to complete the throwback look.

In the summer of 2007, Dale Earnhardt, Inc. (DEI) with the Dale Earnhardt Foundation, announced it will fund an annual undergraduate scholarship at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina, for students interested in motorsports and automotive engineering. Scholarship winners are also eligible to work at DEI in internships. The first winner was William Bostic, a senior at Clemson majoring in mechanical engineering.

In 2008, on the 50th anniversary of the first Daytona 500 race, DEI and RCR teamed up to make a special COT sporting Earnhardt&#x27;s 1998 Daytona 500 paint scheme to honor the tenth anniversary of his Daytona 500 victory. In a tribute to all previous Daytona 500 winners, the winning drivers appeared in a lineup on stage, in chronological order. The throwback No. 3 car stood in the infield, in the approximate position Earnhardt would have taken in the processional. The throwback car featured the authentic 1998-era design on a current-era car, a concept similar to modern throwback jerseys in other sports. The car was later sold in 1:64 and 1:24 scale models.

In 2010, the Intimidator 305 roller coaster opened at Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia. Named after Earnhardt, the ride&#x27;s trains were modeled after his black-and-red Chevrolet. Another Intimidator coaster also opened at Carowinds in North Carolina the same year. Both were themed to Earnhardt&#x27;s legacy, featuring signs, flags, various artwork, as well as replicas of the cars he drove at each location. The &quot;Intimidator&quot; name and all Earnhardt branding were removed from both rides in 2024 as a result of an expiring licensing agreement.

Atlanta Braves assistant coach Ned Yost was a friend of Earnhardt, and Richard Childress. When Yost was named Milwaukee Brewers manager, he changed jersey numbers, from No. 5 to No. 3 in Earnhardt&#x27;s honor. (No. 3 is retired by the Braves in honor of outfielder Dale Murphy, so Yost could not make the change while in Atlanta.) When Yost was named Kansas City Royals assistant coach, he wore No. 2 for the 2010 season, even when he was named manager in May 2010, but for the 2011 season, he switched back to No. 3.

During the third lap of the 2011 Daytona 500 (a decade since Earnhardt&#x27;s death), and 2021 Daytona 500 (two decades since Earnhardt&#x27;s death) the commentators on FOX fell silent while fans raised three fingers in a similar fashion to the tributes throughout 2001.

The north entrance to New Avondale City Center in Arizona will bear the name Dale Earnhardt Drive. Avondale is where Earnhardt won a Cup race in 1990.

His helmet from the 1998 season is at the National Museum of American History in the Smithsonian museum in Washington D.C.

Weedeater, a sludge metal band from North Carolina, paid tribute to Earnhardt on their 2003 album &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;, with the song &quot;No. 3&quot;. The song is played with audio clips from television broadcasts about Earnhardt mixed in the background. He is also mentioned in a 2001 song composed by John Hiatt entitled &quot;The Tiki Bar Is Open,&quot; along with his legendary race number.

On February 28, 2016, after winning the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, during his victory lap, driver Jimmie Johnson held his hand out of his window, with three fingers extended in tribute to Earnhardt. This was following Johnson&#x27;s 76th Cup Series win, which tied the career mark of Earnhardt&#x27;s. This is also the track where Earnhardt claimed his sixth Winston Cup Series title.

In the week of the 2021 United States Grand Prix, McLaren driver Daniel Ricciardo drove the iconic Wrangler car from 1984 as Ricciardo has been a fan of Earnhardt since he was a child. The opportunity came after he won the Italian Grand Prix that year, and McLaren CEO Zak Brown, who owns the car, promised him that he would give him a chance to drive it.

A star is named after him through International Star Registry. The star, officially named &quot;Dale Earnhardt, Sr.,&quot; is located in the Aquila constellation at coordinates RA 19h 1m 36.36s D 16° 34′ 25.00″.

<text>A number of games have been published based on the &quot;Dune&quot; universe created by Frank Herbert.

==Card games==
* &quot;Dune&quot; (1997): Collectible card game produced by Five Rings Publishing Group/Last Unicorn Games and later Wizards of the Coast. Each player leads a planetary house, &quot;battling, conniving, and bribing its way to greatness ... players bid for powerful characters, search for the life-prolonging spice melange, avoid sandworms, engage in interstellar commerce, and, naturally, try to kill each other&quot;.

==Board games==
* &quot;Dune&quot; (1979/2019): Avalon Hill/Gale Force Nine
* &quot;Dune&quot; (1984): Parker Brothers
* &quot;&quot; (2020): Dire Wolf
* &quot;Dune: House Secrets&quot; (2021); Portal Games
* &quot;Arrakis: Dawn of the Fremen&quot; (2022); Gale Force Nine
* &quot;Dune: Imperium - Uprising&quot; (2023): Dire Wolf
* &quot;Dune: War for Arrakis&quot; (2024): CMON

==Role-playing games==
* &quot;&quot; (2000): Last Unicorn Games. Delayed by legal issues and then a corporate buyout of Last Unicorn by Wizards of the Coast, a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; run of 3000 copies of a core rule-book was initially published, pending Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s conversion of the game to its d20 role-playing game system and a subsequent wider release. The game was later discontinued, but was eventually published by Wizards of the Coast after the acquisition. Val Mayerik did interior art for the game.
* &quot;Dune: A Dream Of Rain&quot; (2004): Evil Twin Games; unlicensed fan-made game, based on the d20 System.
* &quot;Dune: Adventures in the Imperium&quot; (2021): Modiphius Entertainment. Its release coincided with the 2021 &quot;Dune&quot; film.

==Video games==
There have been six licensed &quot;Dune&quot;-related video games released.

===&quot;Dune&quot; (1992)===

1992&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; from Cryo Interactive/Virgin Interactive blends adventure with strategy. Loosely following the story of the 1965 Frank Herbert novel &quot;Dune&quot; and using many visual elements from the 1984 film of the same name by David Lynch, the game casts the player as Paul Atreides, with the ultimate goal of driving the Harkonnens from the planet Dune and taking control of its valuable export, the spice. Key to success is the management of spice mining, military forces, and ecology as the player amasses allies and skills. One aspect of the game allows the player to terraform Arrakis from a desert into a fertile and green planet, at the cost of sandworm habitat and reduced melange spice production.

===&quot;Dune II&quot; (1992)===

&quot;Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty&quot;, later retitled &quot;Dune II: Battle for Arrakis&quot; for the European release and the Mega Drive/Genesis port, was released in December 1992 from Westwood Studios/Virgin Interactive. Often considered to be the first &quot;mainstream modern real-time strategy game&quot;, &quot;Dune II&quot; established many conventions of the genre. Only loosely connected to the plot of the novels or films, the game pits three interplanetary houses — the Atreides, the Harkonnens, and the Ordos — against each other for control of the planet Arrakis and its valuable spice, all while fending off the destructive natural forces of the harsh desert planet itself.

===&quot;Dune 2000&quot; (1998)===

&quot;Dune 2000&quot;, a 1998 remake of &quot;Dune II&quot; from Intelligent Games/Westwood Studios/Virgin Interactive, added improved graphics and live-action cutscenes. Though gameplay is similar to its predecessor, &quot;Dune 2000&quot; features an enhanced storyline and functionality.

===&quot;Emperor: Battle for Dune&quot; (2001)===

&quot;Emperor: Battle for Dune&quot; (Intelligent Games/Westwood Studios/Electronic Arts) was released on June 12, 2001. A sequel to &quot;Dune 2000&quot;, the real-time strategy game features 3D graphics and live-action cutscenes, and casts players as Atreides, Harkonnens, or Ordos.

===&quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; (2001)===

Released in 2001 by Cryo Interactive/DreamCatcher Interactive, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; is a 3D video game based on the 2000 Sci Fi Channel miniseries of the same name. As Paul Muad&#x27;Dib Atreides, the player must become leader of the Fremen, seize control of Dune, and defeat the evil Baron Harkonnen. The game was not a commercial or critical success, and Cryo subsequently filed for bankruptcy in July 2002.
===&quot;Dune Generations&quot; (2001, cancelled)===

In 2001, Cryonetworks disclosed information about &quot;Dune Generations&quot;, an online, 3D real-time strategy game set in the &quot;Dune&quot; universe. An official website for the upcoming game featured concept images, a brief background story and description of the persistent gameworld, and a list of frequently asked questions. The game would be constructed using Cryo&#x27;s own online multimedia development framework SCOL.

Within &quot;the infrastructure of a permanent and massive multiplayer world that exists online&quot;, &quot;Dune Generations&quot; would let players assume control of a dynasty in the &quot;Dune&quot; universe, with the goal of first mastering the natural resources of their own homeworlds and ultimately rising in power and influence through conflicts and alliances with other player dynasties. Each of the three available dynasty types - traders, soldiers, or mercenaries - would provide a different playing experience, all with the long-term goal of gaining control of Arrakis and its valuable spice.

A preview video trailer was released in November 2001. The game was still in the alpha testing stage in February 2002, and the project was ultimately halted after Cryo filed for bankruptcy in July.

===&quot;Dune: Ornithopter Assault&quot; (2002, cancelled)===
&quot;Dune: Ornithopter Assault&quot; was developed by Hungarian studio Soft Brigade 2 for the Game Boy Advance, but was cancelled in 2002. The game was to be a 3D air-to-ground shooter featuring 20 missions, five modes, and multiplayer Link Cable connectivity. Without the license, the game was eventually released as &quot;Elland: The Crystal Wars&quot; on PC.

=== &quot;Dune: Spice Wars&quot; (2022) ===

&quot;Dune: Spice Wars&quot; was released on Steam in Early Access by French development studio Shiro Games on April 26, 2022 before being fully released on September 14, 2023. The game is inspired by &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Dune 2&quot; with a strong influence from the books rather than the films. It is a real-time strategy game with 4X elements.

=== &quot;Dune: Awakening&quot; (2025) ===
&quot;Dune: Awakening&quot; is an upcoming open world action survival massively multiplayer online game set on the planet Arrakis. It was announced by its publisher and developer Funcom on Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022; The first trailer was released on August 23, 2022. It is currently scheduled to be released on May 20, 2025 for PC, with ports for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S to follow.

==Online games==
There have also been many &quot;Dune&quot;-based MUDs (multi-user dimension) and browser-based online games, created and run by fans.

===Dune text room-based MMORPG===

&quot;Dune MUD&quot; is an unlicensed, online multiplayer game, a MUD active since 1992.

&quot;DuneMUSH&quot; was an unlicensed, online multiplayer game, a MUSH active in the early 1990s.

&quot;Dune II&quot; was an unlicensed, online multiplayer MUSH active in the early 1990s.

=== &quot;Behind the Dune&quot; ===
&quot;Behind the Dune&quot; is a pornographic, unlicensed, online flash single player game first released in 2016. The game is based on &quot;Dune&quot; (1992) by Cryo Interactive.

<doc id="7900" wikidata="Q1412151" url="?curid=7900" title="List of Dune characters">
<text>&quot;Dune&quot; is a science fiction media franchise that originated with the 1965 novel of the same name by American author Frank Herbert. &quot;Dune&quot; is frequently cited as the best-selling science fiction novel in history, and won the 1966 Hugo Award as well as the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. Herbert wrote five sequels before his death in 1986: &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969), &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976), &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981), &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984) and &quot;&quot; (1985).

&quot;Dune&quot; follows Paul, the scion of House Atreides, as his family is thrown into the dangerous political intrigues centered on the desert planet Arrakis, only known source of the oracular spice melange, the most important and valuable substance in the universe. The series spans 5,000 years, focusing on Paul and then his various descendants.

&quot;Dune&quot; was adapted as a 1984 film, and again in two parts, the films &quot;Dune&quot; (2021) and &quot;&quot; (2024). Additionally, the novel was adapted as a 2000 television miniseries, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;, and the first two sequels were also adapted as a single miniseries, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;, in 2003.

Since 1999, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son Brian Herbert and science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson have published 15 prequel novels, collected in the series &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; (1999–2001), &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; (2002–2004), &quot;Heroes of Dune&quot; (2008–2023), &quot;Great Schools of Dune&quot; (2012–2016), and &quot;The Caladan Trilogy&quot; (2020–2022). They have also released two sequel novels—&quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007)—which complete the original series.
== Overview ==
== Introduced in &quot;Dune&quot; (1965) ==

=== Paul Atreides ===

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Paul is the teenage son and heir of Duke Leto Atreides and Lady Jessica, whose family is thrown into the dangerous political intrigues centered on the inhospitable desert planet Arrakis, only known source of the oracular spice melange, the most important and valuable substance in the universe. Paul has been trained by his father and several Atreides attendants in fighting and the art of war, and by his mother in some of her Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul also possesses burgeoning prescient abilities, which are further unlocked by the inescapable exposure to melange on Arrakis. House Atreides is soon betrayed and scattered, with Leto killed, his forces devastated, and Paul and Jessica forced to flee into the open desert. They are taken in by the native Fremen, a secretive population of fierce fighters who thrive despite the scarcity of water and presence of aggressive, giant sandworms. Paul rises to lead the planetwide Fremen forces against the Imperial stranglehold over Arrakis, ultimately seizing control of the planet and deposing Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Paul&#x27;s empire is challenged by the conspiracies of various factions hoping to destroy him, while a jihad in his name rages across the universe. After he is blinded by a devastating weapon known as a stone burner, Paul exiles himself into the desert, per Fremen custom. Paul returns under the guise of &quot;The Preacher&quot; in &quot;Children of Dune,&quot; rallying against the Fremen religion and the jihad raging in his name. The Preacher is ultimately assassinated by one of Alia&#x27;s guards after calling her a blasphemer. 

Paul is portrayed by Kyle MacLachlan in the 1984 film adaptation &quot;Dune&quot;, and by Alec Newman in the 2000 miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; and its 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. The character is played by Timothée Chalamet in the 2021 film &quot;Dune&quot; and its sequel, &quot;&quot; (2024).

=== Lady Jessica ===

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Lady Jessica is the concubine of Duke Leto and the mother of his son Paul and daughter Alia. Jessica is one of the Bene Gesserit, a secretive, matriarchal order who achieve superhuman abilities through physical and mental conditioning and the use of the drug melange. Instructed by the Bene Gesserit to first conceive a daughter with Leto to further the order&#x27;s centuries-long breeding program, she disobeyed out of love for Leto, and gave him a son. This seemingly minor misstep puts the Atreides bloodline on a collision course with events that will ultimately change the fate of the universe. Pregnant with Alia, Jessica flees into the desert with Paul as House Atreides is all but destroyed by the forces of the wicked Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Finding refuge with the native Fremen, she and Paul take advantage of the legends planted there by Bene Gesserit religious engineering, casting themselves as the prophesied messiah and his mother. Jessica undergoes the Fremen version of the Bene Gesserit spice agony ritual, becoming a Reverend Mother and unlocking Other Memory, the personas and memories of all her female ancestors. But doing so while pregnant subjects the unborn Alia to an onslaught of heightened awareness for which her fragile consciousness is not prepared. Jessica returns to Arrakis in &quot;Children of Dune&quot; and recognizes that Alia, who serves as regent for Paul and Chani&#x27;s twin children, Leto II and Ghanima, has succumbed to the dangers of her unique birth and become possessed. Jessica escapes an assassination attempt by Alia, and trains Farad&#x27;n, the grandson of Shaddam IV, in the Bene Gesserit way.

Lady Jessica is portrayed by Francesca Annis in the 1984 film. Saskia Reeves plays the role in the 2000 miniseries, and is succeeded by Alice Krige in its 2003 sequel. Rebecca Ferguson portrays Jessica in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.

=== Leto I Atreides ===
Duke Leto Atreides is the planetary governor of the ocean planet Caladan who takes over the lucrative spice mining operations on the desert planet Arrakis at the behest of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. Knowing it is some kind of trap but unable to refuse the assignment, Leto proactively seeks an alliance with the native Fremen, people tempered by the planet&#x27;s harsh conditions who Leto realizes are an underestimated and untapped resource. He is accompanied to Arrakis by his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, with whom he is in love but has not married to allow for the possibility of a politically advantageous marriage, and his son and heir, Paul. Threatened by Leto&#x27;s growing influence among the Landsraad assembly of noble families, Shaddam has aligned himself with Leto&#x27;s enemy, the Baron Harkonnen. The Harkonnens, secretly bolstered by Shaddam&#x27;s fierce Sardaukar warriors and aided by Leto&#x27;s own personal physician, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, launch an attack that devastates the Atreides forces. Leto is taken prisoner by the Baron, and dies attempting to kill him.
The character has been described as &quot;regal and doomed&quot;, and &quot;warmly protective but all-too-vulnerable&quot;.

Leto is portrayed by Jürgen Prochnow in the 1984 film. Ben Sherlock of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called Prochnow &quot;mesmerizing&quot; in the role, with &quot;a commanding screen presence&quot; that &quot;brought slightly more grit&quot; than subsequent portrayals. William Hurt plays Leto in the 2000 miniseries. Hurt was the first actor to be cast in the 2000 adaptation. A fan of the novel, he told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I was a science fiction junkie ... [Director John Harrison] captured Herbert&#x27;s prophetic reflection of our own age, where nation-states are competing with the new global economy and its corporate elements.&quot; Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; wrote that Hurt &quot;brings a certain reserved calm that works for the character.&quot; Leto is portrayed by Oscar Isaac in the 2021 film. Chaim Gartenberg of &quot;The Verge&quot; wrote, &quot;Isaac exudes a sense of righteous honor, and it’s easy to see both why his men would follow him to a forsaken desert world and why he falls so thoroughly into the political traps.&quot;

In 2020, Funko produced a Duke Leto figure as part of their POP! Television line. It is a vinyl figure in the Japanese chibi style, depicting Leto in armor and styled after the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film.

Leto is also a primary character in the prequel trilogies &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; and &quot;The Caladan Trilogy&quot; by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot;, young Leto&#x27;s mother, Helena, arranges for his father, expert bullfighter Duke Paulus Atreides, to be killed by a drugged Salusan bull so she can rule Caladan as Leto&#x27;s regent. He exiles his mother to a distant convent to avoid the scandal of a public execution, and as duke takes Kailea Vernius of the industrial planet Ix as his concubine. They have a son, Victor, but grow apart, and Kailea&#x27;s resentment and insecurities build. Threatened by Leto&#x27;s attraction to the Bene Gesserit acolyte Jessica, Kailea attempts to kill him, but in the ensuing accident her brother Rhombur is critically injured and Victor is killed. Kailea commits suicide, and Leto takes Jessica as his concubine. Though instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear the mourning Leto a daughter, Jessica intentionally conceives the son he desires, Paul. Leto surrounds himself with loyal and capable individuals, and comes to be known as an effective politician, a fair and just statesman, and a capable leader of his small military. The new Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV, both admires Leto and dislikes him as a political rival. Leto&#x27;s military victory over the Tleilaxu forces occupying Ix, and his role in the subsequent political censure of Shaddam, ensure Leto a vengeful enemy in the emperor.
=== Vladimir Harkonnen ===

Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is the ruthless and cunning head of House Harkonnen, centuries-old enemies of House Atreides. The Baron&#x27;s intent to exterminate the Atreides line seems close to fruition as Duke Leto is lured to Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the lucrative spice mining operation there, previously controlled by the Harkonnens. The Baron has coerced Leto&#x27;s own physician, the trusted Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, to be his agent in the Atreides household. Yueh disables the protective shields around the Atreides palace and the Harkonnen forces (secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial Sardaukar warriors) attack. Yueh gives a captive Leto the means to assassinate the Baron, who survives the attempt as Leto dies. Escaping into the desert and later presumed dead, Leto&#x27;s son Paul reveals to his mother, Lady Jessica, that the Baron is her father. The Baron&#x27;s succession plan is to install his charismatic yet deadly younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha, as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by his brutish elder nephew, Glossu Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people. A crisis on Arrakis begins when the mysterious Muad&#x27;Dib emerges as a leader of the native Fremen tribes, uniting them against Harkonnen rule. Eventually, a series of Fremen victories against Rabban threaten to disrupt the trade of the spice, attracting the attention of Shaddam IV himself. The emperor arrives on Arrakis with several legions of his Sardaukar, and he and the Baron are shocked to discover that the Fremen warlord Muad&#x27;Dib is actually Paul Atreides. The Fremen, previously underestimated by the Harkonnens, overcome the Imperial and Harkonnen forces thanks to Paul&#x27;s military strategy, their own ferocity and their ability to use sandstorms and the giant sandworms of Arrakis to their advantage. Paul&#x27;s sister Alia, four years old but born a fully aware Fremen Reverend Mother, reveals to the Baron that he is her grandfather before she kills him with a poisoned needle called a gom jabbar.

In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Alia succumbs to the dangers of her unique birth and is possessed by the persona of the deceased Baron Harkonnen. As he promises his assistance in quelling the multitude of other ancestral voices assailing her, Alia gradually relinquishes control of herself to the Baron, and descends into depravity and a lust for power sure to destroy the Atreides empire from within. Eventually realizing that the Baron&#x27;s consciousness has surpassed her abilities to contain him, Alia commits suicide, killing the Baron in the process.

Baron Harkonnen is portrayed by Kenneth McMillan in the 1984 film, and by Ian McNeice in the 2000 miniseries and its 2003 sequel. Stellan Skarsgård portrays the character in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.

=== Chani ===

Chani is the daughter of Liet-Kynes, the Imperial Planetologist on Arrakis, and his Fremen wife Faroula. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Paul Atreides sees Chani in his prescient dreams before his family moves from Caladan to Arrakis. Later, Paul and his mother Jessica flee the Harkonnen attack that kills his father and devastates the Atreides forces, and are reluctantly taken in by a tribe of the planet&#x27;s native desert people, the Fremen. Chani, a fierce warrior, is assigned to protect and guide Paul in the Fremen ways. They soon become lovers, and Paul, now known as Muad&#x27;Dib, rises as a military and religious leader among the Fremen. Their rebellion against the Harkonnens intensifies, and Paul and Chani&#x27;s infant son is murdered in a Sardaukar raid. The Fremen overcome the Imperial and Harkonnen forces thanks to Paul&#x27;s military strategy, their own ferocity and their ability to use sandstorms and the giant sandworms of Arrakis to their advantage. With his absolute control over Arrakis and the spice, Paul deposes Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, marrying his daughter Princess Irulan to secure the throne. He vows that Chani will always be his only love, and mother of his children.

Twelve years later in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Paul and Chani remain childless. Irulan, Bene Gesserit-trained and doing their bidding, has been secretly feeding Chani contraceptives to prevent her from conceiving an Imperial heir. The Sisterhood are desperate to regain control of Paul&#x27;s bloodline for their breeding program, and are fearful of the effect Chani&#x27;s &quot;wild&quot; genes may have on their offspring. But when Chani begins an ancient Fremen fertility diet high in melange, Irulan loses her ability to interfere, and Chani becomes pregnant. Chani ultimately discovers not only Irulan&#x27;s role in her infertility but the fact that the contraceptives have caused permanent damage and will jeopardize her pregnancy. Chani seeks to kill Irulan, but Paul forbids it. He is secretly somewhat grateful to Irulan, as he has seen through his prescience that childbirth will bring Chani&#x27;s death, and so Irulan has unwittingly extended Chani&#x27;s life. Chani dies after giving birth to Paul&#x27;s twin children, Leto II and Ghanima. Having proven their ability to do so, the Tleilaxu offer to resurrect Chani as a ghola in exchange for control of the empire, but Paul refuses. Through his oracular sight, Paul has seen that Chani&#x27;s death during childbirth is far less painful and cruel than her possible future fates had she survived.

Chani is portrayed by actress Sean Young in the 1984 film, and by Barbora Kodetová in the 2000 miniseries and its 2003 sequel. Zendaya portrays the character in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.

=== Stilgar ===
Stilgar is the Fremen leader, or naib, of Sietch Tabr. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Duke Leto Atreides sends his swordmaster, Duncan Idaho, to build a relationship with the mysterious native Fremen of Arrakis, people tempered by the planet&#x27;s harsh conditions who Leto realizes are an underestimated and untapped resource. Leto allows Duncan, impressed with the Fremen and their ways, a dual loyalty to both the Atreides and Stilgar. When Leto&#x27;s son Paul and his Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, flee a Harkonnen attack, they find refuge with Stilgar&#x27;s tribe of Fremen. Paul, believed to be their prophesied messiah, comes to be known as Muad&#x27;Dib and rises as a military and religious leader among the Fremen. 

Previously underestimated by the Harkonnens, the Fremen overcome the Imperial and Harkonnen forces that control Arrakis thanks to Paul&#x27;s military strategy, their own ferocity and their ability to use sandstorms and the giant sandworms to their advantage. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Stilgar is a staunch supporter and protector of Paul, and one of his inner circle of advisors. In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Stilgar is fiercely loyal to Paul&#x27;s young heirs Leto II and Ghanima, and is conflicted as the regent, Paul&#x27;s sister Alia, descends into madness. Duncan manipulates Stilgar into killing him, knowing it will force Stilgar to join the rebellion against Alia. Later, with Leto presumed dead, Stilgar helps Ghanima and Princess Irulan escape Alia&#x27;s tyranny.

Novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son and biographer, wrote, &quot;One time I asked my father if he identified with any of the characters in his stories, and to my surprise he said it was Stilgar, the rugged leader of the Fremen... Mulling this over, I realized Stilgar was the equivalent of a Native American chief in &quot;Dune&quot;—a person who represented and defended time-honored ways that did not harm the ecology of the planet.&quot;

Stilgar is portrayed by Everett McGill in the 1984 film. Uwe Ochsenknecht plays the role in the 2000 miniseries, and is succeeded by Steven Berkoff in its 2003 sequel. Asher-Perrin called Ochsenknecht &quot;a wonderfully gruff Stilgar&quot;, but later wrote, &quot;Steven Berkoff is an incredible character actor, but there is nothing about him that even remotely invokes the old Fremen leader. Instead, he reads at the beginning like the Atreides family butler before moving onto Old British Wardog Supreme.&quot; Javier Bardem portrays Stilgar in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.

In 1984, toy company LJN released a line of &quot;Dune&quot; action figures, styled after David Lynch&#x27;s film, which included a figure of Stilgar. McFarlane Toys released a 7&quot; articulating action figure of Stilgar in 2020, styled after the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film. In 2022, Super7 released a 3.75&quot; articulating Stilgar action figure as part of its &quot;Dune&quot; ReAction line, also styled after the Lynch film.

Stilgar&#x27;s early life is explored in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, and he is resurrected as a ghola in the Brian Herbert/Anderson conclusion to the original series, &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;. The character also appears in the prequel novels &quot;Paul of Dune&quot; and &quot;The Winds of Dune&quot;.
=== Duncan Idaho ===

Duncan Idaho is the Swordmaster of House Atreides, and one of Paul&#x27;s teachers. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Leto sends Duncan to build a relationship with the mysterious native Fremen of Arrakis, people tempered by the planet&#x27;s harsh conditions who Leto realizes are an underestimated and untapped resource. Leto allows Duncan, impressed with the Fremen and their ways, a dual loyalty to both the Atreides and Stilgar, but he is later killed helping Paul and Jessica escape from the Harkonnens. Duncan is revived by the Bene Tleilax as the ghola Mentat Hayt in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, and works with Paul&#x27;s sister Alia to unravel the conspiracy against the Atreides. The Tleilaxu have secretly programmed Hayt to seduce Alia, weaken Paul psychologically and then kill him. The trauma of the attempt restores his memories of being Duncan. He is married to Alia in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, but she has succumbed to the dangers of her unique birth and become possessed by the persona of the deceased Baron Harkonnen. As Alia becomes more power-hungry and attempts to assassinate her mother Jessica, Duncan spirits Jessica and Paul&#x27;s children Leto II and Ghanima away. He manipulates Fremen naib Stilgar, a loyal Atreides advisor, into killing him, knowing that the act will force Stilgar to join the rebellion against Alia or be executed by her out of political necessity.

Thirty-five hundred years later in &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, a series of Duncan gholas provided by the Tleilaxu have served the seemingly immortal God Emperor Leto II Atreides one after the other. Most of these have been killed by Leto himself, as the serial Duncans, pledged to the Atreides in a time when justice reigned, tend to rebel against the hallmark tyranny and oppression of Leto&#x27;s rule. The newest Duncan is as disillusioned as his predecessors, and after falling in love with the Ixian ambassador Hwi Noree (who is engaged to Leto), he joins Atreides descendant Siona in her plot to assassinate Leto. He allows them to succeed, and as he dies, Leto reveals that his millennia-long plan for humanity&#x27;s ultimate survival—called the Golden Path—has come to fruition. Siona and her descendants will be invisible to prescient sight, and the end of his millennia of oppression will spark a mass diaspora of humankind which will come to be known as The Scattering.

Fifteen hundred years later, the Bene Gesserit become the consumers of Duncan gholas in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; and &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot;. The Sisterhood suspect that the Tleilaxu have implanted the gholas with some secret purpose, and when latest Duncan regains his memories, he agrees. The Honored Matres, a violent matriarchal order with the ability to enslave men using their unique sexual talents, have arrived from the farthest reaches of the universe, wreaking havoc and destruction, and obliterating Tleilaxu worlds. An attempt by the Honored Matre Murbella to sexually imprint Duncan triggers the hidden Tleilaxu purpose: to conquer the Honored Matres by using a better version of their own sexual techniques. All the memories of the previous Duncans are unlocked in the current one as he and Murbella imprint each other. Addicted to each other, they are confined to a no-ship on the Bene Gesserit homeworld, Chapterhouse. There, Duncan trains other men to enslave Honored Matres, until he and Sheeana escape in the untraceable ship.

Duncan is portrayed by Richard Jordan in the 1984 film. James Watson plays the role in the 2000 miniseries, and is succeeded by Edward Atterton in its 2003 sequel. Jason Momoa portrays Duncan in the 2021 film.

=== Wellington Yueh ===
Dr. Wellington Yueh is a Suk doctor and the trusted personal physician of Duke Leto Atreides. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is intent on the destruction of House Atreides, who have been lured to Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the valuable spice mining operation there. Though Suk Imperial Conditioning supposedly makes the subject incapable of inflicting harm, the Baron has taken Yueh&#x27;s Bene Gesserit wife Wanna prisoner, threatening her with interminable torture unless Yueh complies with his demands. Aware of Yueh&#x27;s conditioning and believing Wanna was killed by the Harkonnens, Leto&#x27;s Mentat Thufir Hawat and concubine Lady Jessica are assured that the doctor is not a Harkonnen spy.

Yueh disables the protective shields around the Atreides palace on Arrakis, and the Harkonnen forces (secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial Sardaukar warriors) attack. Yueh takes Leto prisoner, but desiring to slay the Baron in defiance of his conditioning, Yueh provides the captive Leto with a fake tooth filled with poisonous gas as a means to kill the Baron, though Leto would die as well. Upon delivering Leto, Yueh confirms his belief that Wanna is already dead, moments before the Baron&#x27;s twisted Mentat Piter De Vries kills him. The Baron escapes the poison, which only kills Leto and De Vries. Leto&#x27;s son Paul flees into the desert with Jessica, aided by survival kits left for them by a compassionate Yueh.

Yueh is portrayed by Dean Stockwell in the 1984 film, and by Robert Russell in the 2000 miniseries. Chang Chen plays the character in the 2021 film.

The character also appears in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, and is resurrected as a ghola in &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, the Brian Herbert/Anderson sequels which conclude the original series. In &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot;, a younger Baron Harkonnen consults with Yueh seeking a cure for the debilitating disease which is slowly but surely rendering him obese. Yueh is aware of no cure, but correctly suggests that the disease&#x27;s source may be the Bene Gesserit. The early years of Yueh as the physician to House Atreides are also explored in the novels. In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, set 5,000 years after &quot;Dune&quot;, Yueh is resurrected as a ghola to aid in the coming final battle with mankind&#x27;s &quot;great enemy.&quot; In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, the finale of the original series, the young Yueh ghola is wracked by feelings of intense guilt over the actions of the &quot;original&quot; Yueh. Though he does not yet possess those memories, he fears that he will repeat those mistakes. A ghola&#x27;s memories are restored by subjecting the ghola to an intense personal trauma, specific to each individual, so Yueh&#x27;s great fear of having his memories restored becomes the trigger used by the Bene Gesserit to unlock them. Later, Yueh kills the gestating ghola of Leto, having been tricked into believing that it was De Vries, and ultimately also kills the ghola of the Baron Harkonnen. Eleven years later, Yueh lives on the original Atreides homeworld Caladan, helping the Jessica ghola restore it to its former glory.
=== Mohiam ===

Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV&#x27;s Truthsayer, and Lady Jessica&#x27;s former teacher. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Mohiam subjects 15-year-old Paul Atreides to a life or death test of his humanity: he is inflicted with excruciating pain, but must exert control over his survival instinct and withstand it, or be killed instantly with a poisoned needle. Paul passes the test, having sustained more pain than anyone before him. Mohiam, though still furious at Jessica for disobeying the Sisterhood&#x27;s command that she bear a daughter for their breeding scheme, is intrigued by the potential she sees in Paul and his nascent prescient abilities. Years later on Arrakis, Mohiam is shaken by her encounter with Paul&#x27;s four-year-old sister Alia, who by misadventure had been born a fully aware Reverend Mother. Mohiam is further alarmed by the ritual battle-to-the-death between Paul and the Harkonnen heir, Feyd-Rautha, which could prove catastrophic for the Bene Gesserit breeding program no matter the outcome. Paul is victorious in the duel, and in seizing control of Arrakis, the only source of the all-important spice melange, gains insurmountable power over all civilization. Seeing the inevitability of the situation Paul has orchestrated, Mohiam compels Shaddam to give in to Paul&#x27;s demands and relinquish the Imperial throne to him.

Twelve years later in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Mohiam joins a conspiracy to topple the rule of Paul Atreides that includes the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale, the Spacing Guild Navigator Edric, and even Paul&#x27;s embittered consort Princess Irulan, Shaddam&#x27;s daughter. Paul has sworn that only his Fremen concubine, Chani, will bear his children. Knowing that the Bene Gesserit are desperate to regain control of his bloodline for their breeding program, and are fearful of the effect Chani&#x27;s &quot;wild&quot; genes may have on their offspring, Paul makes Mohiam an offer. In exchange for Chani&#x27;s guaranteed safety, and the Sisterhood&#x27;s acceptance of his decision to father no heirs with Irulan, Paul offers something of the utmost value: his sperm. This is a complicated proposition for Mohiam, because artificial insemination is forbidden in the wake of the anti-technology Butlerian Jihad, and the idea of it is as horrific to the Sisterhood as the loss of the precious Atreides genes. The conspiracy ultimately fails, and Paul kills Scytale. Edric and Mohiam are executed on orders from Paul&#x27;s sister Alia, despite Paul&#x27;s previous instructions to spare Mohiam&#x27;s life.

Mohiam is portrayed by Siân Phillips in the 1984 film, and by Zuzana Geislerová in the 2000 miniseries and its 2003 sequel. The character is played by Charlotte Rampling in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.

=== Rabban ===
Glossu &quot;Beast&quot; Rabban Harkonnen is the violent and brutish older nephew of Baron Harkonnen. He is as cruel and sadistic as his uncle, but lacks the Baron&#x27;s intelligence. The Baron tasks Rabban to rule the planet Arrakis for a time in the most brutal way possible, so that when his favored nephew Feyd-Rautha takes over, Feyd will be welcomed as a hero by the populace.

After the Baron seizes the planet back from Atreides control, Rabban tells his uncle that the Harkonnens have woefully underestimated both the numbers and threat of the Fremen population there. Known as &quot;the Beast Rabban&quot; on Arrakis for his aggression and cruelty, his Fremen nickname is &quot;Mudir Nahya&quot;, which translates as &quot;Demon Ruler&quot; or &quot;King Cobra&quot;. Rabban is killed by the Fremen and the people of Arrakeen when Paul &quot;Muad&#x27;Dib&quot; Atreides retakes Arrakis using Fremen forces.

Travis Johnson of Flicks.com.au describes Rabban as &quot;the Baron&#x27;s murderous and notably less Machiavellian nephew&quot;. Noting that the characters in &quot;Dune&quot; fit mythological archetypes, novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son and biographer, writes that &quot;Beast Rabban Harkonnen, though evil and aggressive, is essentially a fool.&quot;

Rabban is portrayed by Paul L. Smith in the 1984 film, and by in the 2000 &quot;Dune&quot; miniseries. The character is played by Dave Bautista in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.

Rabban also appears in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In the series, he kills Duncan Idaho&#x27;s parents and Gurney Halleck&#x27;s sister, and earns his nickname &quot;Beast&quot; when he strangles his own father.
=== Feyd-Rautha ===

Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is the charismatic yet deadly younger nephew and heir of Baron Harkonnen. In &quot;Dune&quot;, the Baron favors Feyd over his older brother Glossu Rabban because of Feyd&#x27;s intelligence and his dedication to the Harkonnen culture of carefully planned and subtly executed sadism and cruelty, as opposed to Rabban&#x27;s outright brutality. The Baron&#x27;s succession plan is to install Feyd as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people. Like Paul Atreides, Feyd is also the product of a centuries-long breeding program organized by the Bene Gesserit, who planned to breed a Harkonnen son with an Atreides daughter with the expectation that their offspring would have a high probability of being their hoped-for super-being, the Kwisatz Haderach. For this reason, Lady Jessica&#x27;s decision to defy the Sisterhood and to produce an Atreides son, Paul, threw the Bene Gesserit&#x27;s plans into turmoil and established an irreconcilable tension between Feyd and Paul as the scions of their bitterly opposed noble houses. The risk of one or both of these young men being killed, destroying thousands of years of genetic engineering, is so great that the Bene Gesserit send an envoy, Margot Fenring, to seduce Feyd and conceive a child, salvaging his genetic material. Margot also uses an imprinting technique to condition Feyd to be vulnerable to Bene Gesserit control in the future. It is also later noted that Feyd&#x27;s encounter with Lady Fenring produced a daughter. Feyd&#x27;s ambition and impatience to inherit the Baron&#x27;s title and power spur him to attempt his uncle&#x27;s assassination. The attempt fails, prompting the Baron to reveal to his nephew the lofty plans he has for him, possibly to even have him ascend the throne as Emperor. The Baron explains that the elevation of House Harkonnen means more to him than power in his own lifetime, so if Feyd promises to forego any further assassination attempts, he will voluntarily step down and let his nephew succeed him—after his plot against the Emperor has succeeded. Feyd agrees, but as punishment for the failed assassination attempt, the Baron forces Feyd to single-handedly slaughter all the female slaves who serve as his lovers so that Feyd will learn the price of failure. As Paul seizes control of the all-important planet Arrakis and makes his final bid to usurp the Padishah Emperor&#x27;s power, he is challenged by Feyd, the current Harkonnen leader after the deaths of the Baron and Rabban. Though famed for his prowess in single combat, Feyd intends to guarantee victory by breaking the formal rules of kanly (which govern this type of challenge) and using a hidden poison spur in his fighting outfit. He nearly succeeds in killing Paul in the ritualized fight, as Paul struggles with whether to try the paralysis word-sound given to him by his mother, and owe the Bene Gesserit his victory, or to risk his life against Feyd in a &quot;fair&quot; fight. Paul manages to defeat Feyd without the command, killing him, and goes on to accede to the Imperial throne.

Feyd is portrayed by Sting in the 1984 film, and by Matt Keeslar in the 2000 miniseries. The character does not appear in the 2021 film, but is played by Austin Butler in its 2024 sequel.

=== Princess Irulan ===

Princess Irulan is the eldest daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and the Bene Gesserit Anirul. The character serves as a &quot;de facto&quot; narrator in &quot;Dune&quot;, with excerpts of Irulan&#x27;s later writings used as epigraphs before each chapter of the novel. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context and other details intended to enhance understanding of Herbert&#x27;s complex fictional universe and themes. In &quot;Dune&quot;, a widespread rebellion of the native Fremen on Arrakis creates a disruption in the production of the all-important spice melange, bringing Shaddam and his court, including Irulan, to the planet to impose order. Paul Atreides leads the Fremen in an overwhelming victory over the combined Harkonnen and Imperial Sardaukar forces and seizes control of Arrakis, the only known source of the spice. Paul demands that Shaddam relinquish the Imperial throne to him or he will destroy all spice production and plunge the universe into chaos. Shaddam bristles at Paul&#x27;s suggestion that he marry Irulan, but she immediately recognizes the inevitability of the situation Paul has orchestrated, and tells Shaddam, &quot;Here&#x27;s a man fit to be your son.&quot; Once Paul defeats the treacherous Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen in single combat, and Count Fenring refuses the Emperor&#x27;s order to kill Paul, Shaddam capitulates.

Twelve years later in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Irulan is Paul&#x27;s consort and trusted advisor, but he has sworn that only his beloved concubine Chani will bear his children. Paul and Chani remain childless, however, because a resentful Irulan, Bene Gesserit-trained and doing their bidding, has been secretly feeding Chani contraceptives to prevent her from conceiving an Imperial heir. The Sisterhood are desperate to regain control of Paul&#x27;s bloodline for their breeding program, and are fearful of the effect Chani&#x27;s &quot;wild&quot; genes may have on their offspring. But when Chani begins an ancient Fremen fertility diet high in melange, Irulan loses her ability to interfere, and Chani becomes pregnant. Chani ultimately discovers not only Irulan&#x27;s role in her infertility but the fact that the contraceptives have caused permanent damage and will jeopardize her pregnancy. Chani seeks to kill Irulan, but Paul forbids it. He is secretly somewhat grateful to Irulan, as he has seen through his prescience that childbirth will bring Chani&#x27;s death, and so Irulan has unwittingly extended Chani&#x27;s life. Chani dies giving birth to the twins Leto II and Ghanima, and a newly blinded Paul follows Fremen custom and wanders alone into the desert to die. Realizing her love for Paul, Irulan breaks ties with the Bene Gesserit and dedicates herself to his children.

Nine years later in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Irulan&#x27;s sister Wensicia plots to assassinate Leto and Ghanima to reclaim power for House Corrino through her son, Farad&#x27;n. Irulan also serves as chief advisor to Paul&#x27;s sister Alia, who reigns as Holy Regent for the twins. Irulan attempts to serve as a guide and confidante to Ghanima, but is often flustered by the adult consciousness the twins possess as a result of being pre-born and having access to Other Memory. Ghanima cares for Irulan, but Alia never trusts the princess, due to Irulan&#x27;s Corrino heritage and Alia&#x27;s own increasing paranoia. Irulan flees into the desert with Ghanima and Stilgar during the Fremen rebellion against Alia&#x27;s tyranny. Though the other rebels are massacred, Irulan and Stilgar are imprisoned upon their capture, and presumably freed when Leto deposes Alia.

Irulan is portrayed by Virginia Madsen in the 1984 film, and by Julie Cox in the 2000 miniseries and its 2003 sequel. The character does not appear in the 2021 film, but is played by Florence Pugh in its 2024 sequel.

=== Shaddam IV ===
Shaddam IV of House Corrino is the Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe, whose power is secured by his armies of fierce Sardaukar warriors and control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the all-important spice melange. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Shaddam has granted Duke Leto Atreides control of the lucrative spice mining operations on Arrakis, previously managed by House Harkonnen, longtime enemies of the Atreides. Leto is aware that this assignment is some kind of trap, but is unable to refuse. Shaddam is threatened by Leto&#x27;s growing influence among the Landsraad assembly of noble families, and uses the centuries-old feud between the Atreides and Harkonnens to disguise his moves against Leto. The forces of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, secretly bolstered by Shaddam&#x27;s Sardaukar and aided by a traitor in Leto&#x27;s household, launch an attack that devastates the Atreides forces. Leto is killed, and his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, and heir Paul, flee into the desert and are presumed dead in a sandstorm.

Years later, a rebellion of the native Fremen on Arrakis creates a disruption in the production of the all-important spice melange, bringing Shaddam and his court to the planet to impose order. Paul Atreides is alive, and has risen as a military and religious leader among the Fremen. He leads them in an overwhelming victory over the combined Harkonnen and Imperial forces and seizes control of Arrakis. Paul demands that Shaddam relinquish the Imperial throne to him or he will destroy all spice production and plunge the universe into chaos. Shaddam resists, but is forced to capitulate after Paul defeats Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen in single combat, and Count Fenring refuses Shaddam&#x27;s order to kill Paul. Paul intends to take Shaddam&#x27;s daughter, Princess Irulan, as his consort, and exile Shaddam.

Shaddam is described as &quot;red-haired&quot; by Irulan via epigraph in &quot;Dune&quot;, and noted to be 72 years old yet looking no older than 35. He is the son of Elrood IX and the 81st member of House Corrino to occupy the Golden Lion Throne. Shaddam has five daughters—the Princesses Irulan, Chalice, Wensicia, Josifa, and Rugi—and no legal sons by his wife Anirul, a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank. His closest friend is the assassin Count Fenring, a cousin and childhood companion.

Shaddam is portrayed by José Ferrer in the 1984 film, and by Giancarlo Giannini in the 2000 miniseries. Giannini also dubbed himself in the Italian version of the miniseries. The character does not appear in the 2021 film, but is played by Christopher Walken in its 2024 sequel.

Shaddam also appears in multiple prequel series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson: &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot;, &quot;Heroes of Dune&quot; and &quot;The Caladan Trilogy&quot;. In the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; trilogy, Shaddam is eager to succeed his father Elrood IX as Padishah Emperor, but despite his advanced age Elrood shows no signs of ill health. Shaddam finally tasks his longtime friend and minion Fenring to administer Elrood with an undetectable, slow-acting poison. Shaddam had previously been complicit in the murder of his elder brother, the Crown Prince Fafnir, and had secretly administered contraceptives to his own mother, Habla, so she could not conceive another son to rival him. Elrood finally dies, and Shaddam secures his throne by paying the Spacing Guild with a supply of the spice and by arranging his own marriage to a Bene Gesserit. This union with the Lady Anirul Sadow-Tonkin results in five daughters, but no sons.
=== Gurney Halleck ===

Gurney Halleck is the Warmaster of Duke Leto Atreides, trained by &quot;the best fighters in the universe&quot;, who has in turn trained Leto&#x27;s son and heir Paul in hand-to-hand combat. Gurney, Duncan Idaho and the Mentat Thufir Hawat serve Leto as a war council unparalleled in the Imperium. Gurney is also a talented troubadour. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Gurney and 73 of his men survive the Harkonnen attack that devastates the Atreides forces, and they fall in with local spice smugglers to survive. Gurney and his team fall for a Fremen trap—a fake hoard of spice—and are almost killed before Paul, now the Fremen leader &quot;Muad&#x27;Dib&quot;, recognizes him. Gurney nearly kills Jessica, mistakenly believing she betrayed Leto, but later becomes her loyal chief officer. In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Gurney returns to Arrakis with Jessica and coordinates a purging of dissidents with Fremen leader Stilgar. Gurney follows what he believes are Jessica&#x27;s orders to test Paul&#x27;s son Leto II to be sure he has not been overcome by his ancestral memories. Learning that the testing was actually ordered by Paul&#x27;s sister Alia, Gurney escapes, sending a message to Duncan to initiate their plan to force Stilgar to join the rebellion against Alia. Gurney flees to a rebel sietch and joins Leto II and the mysterious Preacher, who is actually a blinded Paul. After Leto II returns to Arrakeen and reclaims the throne from Alia, Gurney is assigned to Sietch Tabr as part of Stilgar&#x27;s council.

Gurney is portrayed by Patrick Stewart in the 1984 film, and by P. H. Moriarty in the 2000 miniseries and its 2003 sequel. The character is played by Josh Brolin in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, the Harkonnens, secretly aided by the Shaddam&#x27;s fierce Sardaukar warriors, destroy the Atreides forces and reclaim control of Arrakis. Fenring and Margot visit the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime, where the Count informs Baron Harkonnen that Shaddam is displeased with the way the invasion of Arrakis was handled, and is frustrated by The Baron&#x27;s failure to suppress the disruptive native Fremen population. Fenring is also there on the Emperor&#x27;s behalf to assess the Harkonnen heir, Feyd, which irks the Baron. Margot is also observing Feyd for the Bene Gesserit, who count him as an important part of their breeding program. Fenring is impressed with Feyd, but laments his upbringing among the brutal Harkonnens. Later, Paul Atreides leads the Fremen in an overwhelming victory over the combined Harkonnen and Imperial forces and seizes control of Arrakis. Paul demands that Shaddam relinquish the Imperial throne to him or he will destroy all spice production and plunge the universe into chaos. Shaddam resists, and Fenring, a deadly fighter and rumored assassin, is summoned and ordered to kill Paul. He refuses, aware that Paul represents the success of the Bene Gesserit breeding program of which Fenring himself is a failure. Paul deposes Shaddam, and the Fenrings join the former emperor in exile.

Fenring does not appear in the 1984 film, but is portrayed by Miroslav Táborský in the 2000 miniseries.

=== Margot Fenring ===

Margot, Lady Fenring, is the Bene Gesserit wife of Count Hasimir Fenring. Though the Count is the close friend and advisor of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, Margot&#x27;s primary loyalty is to the Sisterhood. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Duke Leto Atreides is lured to the desert planet Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the lucrative spice mining operation there, but the assignment is part of a plot by Shaddam and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen to destroy the Atreides. Margot leaves a coded message for Leto&#x27;s Bene Gesserit concubine, Lady Jessica, warning her that the Atreides, especially Leto and Jessica&#x27;s son Paul, are in imminent danger from the Harkonnens, and alerts her to the existence of a traitor in the Atreides household. Paul evades a trap set for him, but a devastating attack by the Harkonnens leaves Leto dead, and forces Paul and Jessica to flee into the desert. Due to the harsh conditions and an oncoming sandstorm, they are soon presumed dead. Margot is sent by the Bene Gesserit to seduce Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen and to &quot;preserve the bloodline&quot; by retrieving his genetic material, through conception, for their breeding program. She later bears Feyd&#x27;s daughter. Margot also uses an imprinting technique to condition Feyd to be vulnerable to Bene Gesserit control in the future. Paul and Feyd later duel to the death, and Paul is victorious without using Margot&#x27;s implanted command. Having seized control of the all-important Arrakis, Paul deposes Shaddam, and the Fenrings join the former emperor in exile.

Margot does not appear in the 1984 film, 2000 miniseries or 2021 film, but is portrayed by Léa Seydoux in the 2024 sequel film.

=== Thufir Hawat ===

In &quot;Dune&quot;, the Atreides are lured to Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the lucrative spice mining operation there, but soon fall prey to a catastrophic attack by their longtime enemies the Harkonnens, whose forces are secretly bolstered by the fierce Sardaukar warriors of the emperor, Shaddam IV. Thufir is captured, and the calculating Baron Vladimir Harkonnen takes him as a replacement for his own twisted Mentat Piter De Vries, who was killed in the aftermath of the attack. The Baron hopes to channel Thufir&#x27;s desire for revenge away from House Harkonnen, and keeps his abilities in check by feeding him false data, specifically, permitting him to believe that Leto&#x27;s concubine Lady Jessica had been the traitor responsible for the Atreides&#x27; destruction. Thufir is also secretly administered a residual poison which requires regular doses of an antidote to prevent death.

In spite of these obstacles, Thufir attempts to bring down the Harkonnens from within. He gains the trust of the Baron&#x27;s nephew and heir Feyd-Rautha by assisting him with a plot to discredit the Harkonnen slavemaster and replace him with someone loyal to Feyd. Thufir encourages the ambitions of Feyd against the Baron, which leads him to attempt to assassinate his uncle. The Baron, warned by Thufir, eludes the attempt and punishes Feyd for his failure. Later, Thufir is coerced to assassinate Leto&#x27;s son, Paul Atreides. Paul suspects this, but out of gratitude for Thufir&#x27;s exceptional loyalty, Paul gives him the opportunity to take anything Thufir wishes of him, even his life. Hawat chooses death from the poison rather than to betray Paul.

Thufir is portrayed by Freddie Jones in the 1984 film, and by in the 2000 miniseries. The character is played by Stephen McKinley Henderson in the 2021 film and he filmed scenes for its 2024 sequel. However, his scenes were not included in the final cut.

Alia pretends to be a child as she grows up among the Fremen. At four years old, she kills her grandfather, the Baron Harkonnen, as Paul seizes control of Arrakis. As Paul&#x27;s sister, Alia is worshipped in her own right in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;. She and Hayt, who is the swordmaster Duncan Idaho brought back from the dead as a ghola by Tleilaxu means, work together to unravel the conspiracy against the Atreides. Alia is named regent for Paul and Chani&#x27;s children, Leto II and Ghanima, and Duncan&#x27;s memories are restored.

The Fremen begin to believe that Paul is their prophesied messiah, who is foretold to be accompanied by his Bene Gesserit mother, and when talking to Mapes, Jessica uses phrases that are part of the legend. Mapes gives Jessica a crysknife, a weapon made from the tooth of a giant sandworm that is considered holy by the Fremen and rarely seen by outsiders. Paul later saves Mapes from a deadly hunter-seeker intended to kill him, and she warns of a traitor in the Atreides household.

Escorted by the planet&#x27;s native Fremen, Kynes is the liaison between them and the Imperials. Kynes takes personal note of Leto&#x27;s son Paul, who seems to know Fremen ways intuitively, and shows signs of being a prophesied Fremen messiah. The Atreides later hear of a person or deity named &quot;Liet&quot; to whom all the Fremen communities give allegiance.

It is only after Leto is killed, and Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica, take refuge among the Fremen that Liet and Kynes are revealed to be the same person. He is the son of Pardot Kynes, the first Imperial Planetologist of Arrakis, and a Fremen woman, and is Chani&#x27;s father. Captured by the Harkonnens and left to die in the desert without a stillsuit or water, Kynes is killed by a spice blow, an explosive eruption that is part of the melange cycle.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Piter is the architect of the plan to destroy House Atreides, longtime enemy of the Harkonnens, while restoring the Baron&#x27;s stewardship over the planet Arrakis. Though the personal physician of Duke Leto Atreides, Wellington Yueh, has undergone Suk conditioning which renders him incapable of inflicting harm on his patients, Piter subverts it by kidnapping and torturing Yueh&#x27;s wife. Hoping to free her, Yueh betrays the Atreides, enabling a catastrophic attack by the Harkonnens and delivering Leto to the Baron. Yueh learns that his wife is already dead and is killed by Piter. Yueh, however, has given the captive Leto a false tooth filled with poison gas with which to assassinate the Baron. The Baron evades the assassination but Leto and Piter die. Piter is the creator of residual poison, a toxin which requires regular doses of an antidote to prevent death. The Baron secretly administers it to the captured Atreides Mentat Thufir Hawat as coercion to make him the replacement for Piter.

In the novel, Piter is described as &quot;tall, though slender, and something about him suggested effeminacy&quot;. He is addicted to the drug melange, and also has the ruby red lips characteristic of those who consume sapho juice, an addictive drug which enhances Mentat capabilities.

The ferocious Sardaukar soldier-fanatics are considered unstoppable, but the Fremen overcome them thanks to Paul&#x27;s military strategy, their own ferocity and their ability to use sandstorms and the giant sandworms of Arrakis to their advantage. Paul uses the Bene Gesserit compulsion technique called the Voice to compel the Aramsham to humiliate himself by surrendering. However, Aramsham&#x27;s Sardaukar stoicism is so great that he will not even give his name until Paul uses the Voice again. The defeat of the Sardaukar allows Paul to seize control of Arrakis and depose Shaddam.

== Introduced in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969) ==

=== Scytale ===

Scytale is a Tleilaxu Face Dancer who executes a plot to dethrone Paul Atriedes in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;. Scytale&#x27;s conspiracy includes Spacing Guild Navigator Edric, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam, and the Princess Irulan, Paul&#x27;s consort. Unlike Face Dancers depicted later in the series, Scytale appears autonomous, and his high-level dealings with the other conspirators suggest a certain rank and level of trust among the Tleilaxu. Scytale notes of Face Dancers, &quot;We are Jadacha hermaphrodites ... either sex at will.&quot; He subsequently kills and assumes the appearance of Lichna, the daughter of the trusted Fremen commando Otheym, in order to lure Paul from the Atreides Keep to Otheym&#x27;s house, where Scytale has planted an atomic weapon. The attack fails to kill Paul, but the atomic blast blinds him. Scytale soon makes an attempt to force Paul&#x27;s allegiance. With the Tleilaxu ghola of Duncan Idaho having regained the memories of the deceased original, Scytale has proven that the Tleilaxu can resurrect a human being. He offers Paul a ghola of his concubine Chani, who has just died giving birth to their twin children, in exchange for Paul surrendering his empire to Tleilaxu control. Though tempted, Paul refuses. Scytale holds a knife over the newborn twins, threatening to kill them instantly unless Paul accepts. Paul instead kills Scytale with a thrown crysknife, guided by a vision sent by his infant son.

In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, 5000 years after the events of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, a ghola of Scytale is a Tleilaxu Master and one of Tleilaxu leader Tylwyth Waff&#x27;s nine councillors. The novel establishes that after learning how to restore a ghola&#x27;s memories in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, the Masters use this knowledge as a form of immortality, creating clones from their living cells which can be reawakened upon their deaths. Face Dancers are still Tleilaxu servants rather than emissaries, and Herbert does not explain how the Scytale of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;—a Face Dancer, though autonomous—could ascend to become a Master, or how the Master/Face Dancer relationship may have evolved over the millennia.

In &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot; (1985), the fearsome Honored Matres have destroyed all of the Tleilaxu worlds in retaliation for the Tleilaxu role in programming the latest Duncan Idaho ghola with knowledge of how to sexually enslave Honored Matres. Scytale, likely the last surviving Tleilaxu Master, barely escapes the attack while leaving his homeworld and is given sanctuary by the Bene Gesserit. Essentially a prisoner, he is kept in a no-ship grounded on the secret Bene Gesserit planet Chapterhouse. In exchange for their protection, Scytale has given the Bene Gesserit the knowledge to create axlotl tanks to grow their own gholas. Desiring his own Face Dancer servants, axlotl tanks, and access to the ship&#x27;s systems, Scytale has held back the secret to creating artificial melange for future negotiations. His secret bargaining chip is a nullentropy capsule containing cells carefully and covertly collected by the Tleilaxu for millennia, including those of Tleilaxu Masters and Face Dancers, Paul, Chani, the original Duncan Idaho, Thufir Hawat, Gurney Halleck and Stilgar.

The character &quot;The Baron&#x27;s Doctor&quot; in the 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, portrayed by Leonardo Cimino, was intended to be revealed as Scytale in &quot;Dune II&quot;, a planned sequel film adapting &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; which was never made. Posing as Baron Harkonnen&#x27;s physician, Scytale would have absconded with Duncan Idaho&#x27;s corpse and spent years reviving it. Scytale is portrayed by Martin McDougall in the 2003 miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;, which is an adaptation of both &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and its sequel &quot;Children of Dune&quot;.

Scytale also appears in the sequel novels &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, Scytale is desperate, as his current body is slowly dying, and he does not have another to replace it. Needing to grow a new ghola clone of himself, his only bargaining tool is the secret nullentropy capsule. Other cells in Scytale&#x27;s possession include those of Leto I, Lady Jessica, Leto II and other legendary figures dating back to Serena Butler and Xavier Harkonnen from the Butlerian Jihad. The Bene Gesserit debate whether to create gholas of any of these historical figures, and despite the controversy, gholas are created a few at a time. Scytale is allowed to have his own once the first few have been born. In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, Scytale finally reawakens his own ghola&#x27;s memories using the trauma of watching the elder Scytale die in front of his younger self. Along with gholas of the Tleilaxu Masters, Scytale grows Tleilaxu females from newly discovered cells, vowing to never again allow the Masters to corrupt the recovering Tleilaxu people.

=== Edric ===

Edric is a Spacing Guild Navigator and the Guild&#x27;s ambassador on Arrakis. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Edric engages in a conspiracy to dethrone Emperor Paul Atreides, joined by the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam, and Paul&#x27;s embittered consort, Princess Irulan. As its Navigators require immense quantities of melange to navigate foldspace, the Spacing Guild has a vested interest in breaking Paul&#x27;s stranglehold over the spice supply. Edric&#x27;s involvement also protects the conspirators from discovery, as his prescience hides the activities of himself and those around him from other prescients, like Paul. The plot ultimately fails, and Edric and Mohiam are executed by Fremen naib Stilgar on orders from Paul&#x27;s sister, Alia Atreides.

In &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot;, a &quot;very powerful&quot; Navigator is described as &quot;one of the Edrics&quot;, suggesting a possible breeding plan or use of gholas.

=== Bijaz ===
Bijaz is a Tleilaxu dwarf in the employ of Otheym, one of the former Fedaykin death commandos of Paul Atreides. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Otheym reveals to Paul evidence of a Fremen conspiracy against him. Otheym gives Paul his dwarf Tleilaxu servant Bijaz, who has the ability to remember faces, names and details like a recording machine. Paul accepts reluctantly, seeing the strands of a Tleilaxu plot. Bijaz, actually an agent of the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale, uses a specific humming intonation to implant a command that will compel the Duncan Idaho ghola, Hayt, to kill Paul under certain circumstances. Paul&#x27;s concubine Chani dies in childbirth, and Paul&#x27;s reaction to her death triggers Hayt&#x27;s assassination attempt. Hayt&#x27;s ghola body reacts against its own programming and Duncan&#x27;s full consciousness is recovered, simultaneously making him independent of Tleilaxu control. Having proven that a ghola&#x27;s memories of its originator can be restored, Scytale offers Paul a ghola of Chani in exchange for Paul surrendering his empire to Tleilaxu control. Paul refuses, and Scytale is killed. Later, Bijaz approaches Paul and repeats Scytale&#x27;s offer, but is killed by Duncan on Paul&#x27;s order.

Bijaz is portrayed by Gee Williams in the 2003 miniseries.

=== Lichna ===
Lichna is the daughter of Otheym, one of Paul&#x27;s former Fedaykin death commandos. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, she is killed and impersonated by the shapeshifting Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale as a means to infiltrate Paul&#x27;s household. Paul can see through the deception, but wants to see where the plot leads. Aware it is part of the conspiracy against him, Paul allows himself to be lured to Otheym&#x27;s home in the city.

Lichna is portrayed by Klára Issová in the 2003 miniseries.

=== Farok ===
Farok is another of Paul&#x27;s former Fedaykin. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, he is one of many Fremen disillusioned by the changes Paul&#x27;s regime brings to their culture, and joins the conspiracy to unseat Paul.

Farok is portrayed by Ivo Novák in the 2003 miniseries.

== Introduced in &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976) ==

=== Princess Wensicia ===

Princess Wensicia is the third daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and the Bene Gesserit Anirul, and the younger sister of Princess Irulan. In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Shaddam is dead and Wensicia plots from exile to restore House Corrino to its former glory by wresting control of the Imperial throne from the usurper, Paul Atreides, for her son, Farad&#x27;n. She attempts to assassinate Leto II and Ghanima Atreides, Paul&#x27;s twin heirs, by sending mechanically controlled Laza tigers to hunt them in the desert. Leto&#x27;s growing prescience allows him to thwart the attack on himself and his sister, and he pretends to be dead to escape the increasingly murderous ambitions of his father&#x27;s sister Alia. Later, Farad&#x27;n, newly trained in the Bene Gesserit ways by Paul and Alia&#x27;s mother Lady Jessica, accepts an arrangement brokered by Jessica for him to marry Ghanima and share the throne. His part of the deal is to &quot;denounce and banish&quot; Wensicia for Leto&#x27;s murder, which he does. Leto later returns and ascends the throne himself.

Wensicia is described as &quot;fair-haired&quot; with a &quot;heart-shaped face,&quot; and is said to have learned &quot;shifty trickiness&quot; from her sister Irulan but not herself been trained by the Bene Gesserit. Shaddam IV&#x27;s heir is Wensicia&#x27;s son Farad&#x27;n, whose deceased father, Dalak, is related to Count Fenring.

Wensicia is portrayed by Susan Sarandon in the 2003 miniseries. Sarandon told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;One of the reasons I always loved the books was because they were driven by strong women, living outside the rules.&quot; She added that the &quot;Dune&quot; series &quot;is very apropos to some of what&#x27;s going on in the world today. It&#x27;s about the dangers of fundamentalism and the idea that absolute power corrupts.&quot; The actress said of Wensicia, &quot;She&#x27;s just evil, evil, evil. I&#x27;m practically unrecognizable. It was a blast.&quot; Laura Fries of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;it’s Susan Sarandon and Alice Krige [as Lady Jessica] who steal the thunder as opposing matriarchs of the great royal houses. Although the two never catfight, their ongoing struggle to rule the &quot;Dune&quot; dynasty gives this mini a real kick.&quot; Observing that Sarandon and Krige were &quot;clearly relishing their roles&quot;, Fries added that &quot;Sarandon makes a formidable enemy&quot;. Melanie McFarland of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; noted, &quot;[Sarandon&#x27;s] exiled princess may be the villain, cooking up deadly schemes, but we&#x27;re right along with her in having a good time.&quot; Sarandon herself said, &quot;it&#x27;s always fun to play a smart villain.&quot; Not impressed overall with the acting in the miniseries, Ron Wertheimer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:
In the miniseries, Wensicia orchestrates the &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; conspiracy to assassinate Paul using a pre-programmed Tleilaxu ghola of his deceased friend Duncan Idaho, a plotline in which she is not involved in the novel. Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; wrote:
Wensicia also appears in the novel &quot;Paul of Dune&quot; by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.

=== Leto II Atreides ===

Leto II Atreides is the son of Paul Atreides and his Fremen concubine Chani, and the twin brother of Ghanima. Born at the end of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Leto is orphaned soon after, as his mother dies in childbirth and his blinded father, following Fremen custom, walks out into the open desert to die. Paul&#x27;s sister Alia subsequently serves as regent for the twins in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, and Princess Irulan steps into the role of surrogate mother. Like Alia, Leto and Ghanima are &quot;pre-born&quot;, having been awakened to adult consciousness and their genetic memories in the womb. The danger to individuals born this way, called Abomination by the Bene Gesserit, is that they are susceptible to being overtaken by their ancestral personas. Leto solves this problem by constructing his own personality out of an executive committee of his ancestors. Influenced by all the important ones, he cannot be possessed by an individual. Alia, however, is increasingly falling under the control of her late grandfather, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whose hatred of the Atreides puts the twins in danger and threatens to topple Paul&#x27;s empire. Deposed Emperor Shaddam IV&#x27;s daughter Wensicia, Irulan&#x27;s younger sister, plots from exile to place her son Farad&#x27;n on the throne and executes an assassination attempt on nine-year-old Leto and Ghanima. The twins anticipate and survive the plot. Leto leaves to seek out the mysterious Preacher, who some believe is Paul himself, and Ghanima hypnotizes herself to believe that Leto is dead. Like his father Paul before him, Leto enters a spice trance induced by an overdose of melange. His visions show him myriad possible futures where humanity becomes extinct, and only one where it survives. He names this future &quot;The Golden Path&quot; and resolves to bring it to fruition—something that his father, who had already glimpsed this future, refused to do. Leto sacrifices his humanity to become a symbiont with the sandworm, beginning the transformation by allowing sandtrout, the larval stage of sandworms, to cover his body. The oversaturation of spice, and Leto&#x27;s ability to adjust his body chemistry, fool the creatures into bonding with him, creating a membrane of &quot;new skin&quot; that bestows on him superhuman speed, strength and near-invulnerability. In addition, he will live for thousands of years, enough time to see his Golden Path to its completion. Leto returns to the capital where everyone has assembled for the wedding of Ghanima and Farad&#x27;n. Confronted by Leto and overcome by the Baron, Alia has a fleeting moment of self-control and leaps to her death. Leto declares himself Emperor, asserts control over the Fremen and restores Ghanima&#x27;s genuine memories with a predetermined command. Farad&#x27;n pledges himself to Leto and delivers control of the remaining Sardaukar armies. Leto marries Ghanima to consolidate power, but Farad&#x27;n is her true consort so the Atreides line can continue.

Thirty-five hundred years later in &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, the God Emperor Leto II is now almost fully transformed into a sandworm, retaining only his human face and arms. He is seemingly immortal and invulnerable to harm, but also prone to instinct-driven bouts of violence when provoked to anger. As a result, Leto&#x27;s oppressive rule is one of religious awe and despotic fear. Widely known as the Tyrant, he has killed all other sandworms by terraforming Arrakis into a verdant planet, and his control of the remaining supply of melange guarantees his stranglehold on civilization. All of the former major powers, like the Bene Gesserit and Spacing Guild, have capitulated. Following his Golden Path, Leto has forced the human population into a state of trans-galactic stagnation: space travel is non-existent to most people in his Empire, which he has deliberately kept to a near-medieval level of technological sophistication. A string of Duncan Idaho gholas have served Leto over the millennia, though they are prone to eventually rebel against him. Ghanima&#x27;s descendant Moneo Atreides is Leto&#x27;s majordomo and closest confidant, while Moneo&#x27;s daughter Siona has become the leader of a local rebellion against Leto. The Ixians send a new ambassador named Hwi Noree, and though Leto realizes that she has been specifically designed and trained to ensnare him, he cannot resist falling in love with her. Exposure to concentrated spice essence awakens Siona to Leto&#x27;s Golden Path, and though she sees its importance, she remains dedicated to his destruction. Siona and the current Duncan Idaho overcome a searing mutual hatred of each other to plan Leto&#x27;s assassination, of which the God Emperor is aware and has made possible. As Leto&#x27;s wedding procession moves across a high bridge, the conspirators destroy the support beams, and Leto&#x27;s entourage, including Hwi, plunge to their deaths into the river below. Leto&#x27;s body rends apart in the water, the outer layer of sandtrout encysting the water and scurrying off, while the rest burns and disintegrates on the shore. A dying Leto reveals to Siona a secret aspect of his Golden Path: she is the result of a breeding scheme to produce a human who is invisible to prescient vision. Siona and her descendants will possess this ability, and Leto explains that humanity is now free from the domination of oracles, free to scatter throughout the universe, never again to face complete domination or complete destruction. After revealing the location of his secret spice hoard, Leto dies, leaving Duncan and Siona to face the task of managing the empire.

Leto is portrayed by James McAvoy in the 2003 miniseries.

=== Ghanima Atreides ===

Ghanima Atreides is the daughter of Paul Atreides and his Fremen concubine Chani, and the twin sister of Leto II. Born at the end of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Ghanima is orphaned soon after, as her mother dies in childbirth and her blinded father, following Fremen custom, walks out into the open desert to die. Paul&#x27;s sister Alia subsequently serves as regent for the twins in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, and Princess Irulan steps into the role of surrogate mother. Like Alia, Leto and Ghanima are &quot;pre-born&quot;, having been awakened to adult consciousness and their genetic memories in the womb. The danger to individuals born this way, called Abomination by the Bene Gesserit, is that they are susceptible to being overtaken by their ancestral personas. Leto solves this problem by constructing his own personality out of an executive committee of his ancestors. Influenced by all the important ones, he cannot be possessed by an individual. Alia, however, is increasingly falling under the control of her late grandfather, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whose hatred of the Atreides puts the twins in danger and threatens to topple Paul&#x27;s empire. Deposed Emperor Shaddam IV&#x27;s daughter Wensicia, Irulan&#x27;s younger sister, plots from exile to place her son Farad&#x27;n on the throne and executes an assassination attempt on nine-year-old Leto and Ghanima. The twins anticipate and survive the plot. Leto leaves to seek out the mysterious Preacher, who some believe is Paul himself, and Ghanima hypnotizes herself to believe that Leto is dead. The intense mental discipline needed for this self-deception builds a safe haven in Ghanima&#x27;s mind for her own personality to safely develop, with the persona of Chani acting as a guardian. Recognizing Alia as worsening threat, Fremen naib Stilgar takes Ghanima into hiding. Farad&#x27;n denounces his mother, and Alia, having retaken Ghanima, arranges a marriage between them. Knowing that Ghanima has sworn to kill him on their wedding night in revenge for Leto&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;, Alia intends to exploit the resulting chaos to weaken her enemies. Leto, having seen a prescient vision of humanity&#x27;s only path to survival, has vowed to bring it to fruition and begun the necessary transformation to a human-sandworm hybrid. He returns to the capital where everyone has assembled for the wedding of Ghanima and Farad&#x27;n. Confronted by Leto and overcome by the Baron, Alia has a fleeting moment of self-control and leaps to her death. Leto declares himself Emperor, asserts control over the Fremen and restores Ghanima&#x27;s genuine memories with a predetermined command. Farad&#x27;n pledges himself to Leto and delivers control of the remaining Sardaukar armies. Leto marries Ghanima to consolidate power, but Farad&#x27;n is her true consort so the Atreides line can continue.

Ghanima is portrayed by Jessica Brooks in the 2003 miniseries. Laura Fries of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;the mini picks up a great deal of charisma when [James] McAvoy [as Leto] and Brooks come aboard as the next generation of the house of Atreides.&quot; The characters Leto and Ghanima were aged from ten-year-olds to teens for the miniseries, which Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; called &quot;a smart move here, as finding two ten year old kids who had the ability to behave as though they had millennia of ancestral memory bubbling up inside of them was always going to be an impossibility.&quot; Asher-Perrin also called the rapport between Brooks and McAvoy &quot;dazzling&quot;.

=== Tyekanik ===
Tyekanik is a Sardaukar officer who serves Princess Wensicia in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;. He is instrumental in her plot to assassinate the Atreides twins, Leto II and Ghanima, using mechanically controlled Laza tigers.

Tyekanik is portrayed by Marek Vašut in the 2003 miniseries.

=== Namri ===
Namri is the Fremen naib of Sietch Fondak, formerly known as Sietch Jacurutu, in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;. The Fremen of Fondak are called Iduali, or &quot;water stealers&quot;, and shunned for a past transgression. Believing he is acting on orders from Lady Jessica, Gurney Halleck abducts a nine-year-old Leto II and brings him to Fondak, where Namri assists him in administering an overdose of the spice to Leto as a test. However, the test has actually been ordered by Leto&#x27;s aunt Alia, possessed by the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and Namri has been told to kill Leto no matter the result. Leto escapes and Namri attempts to kill Gurney, who kills him instead.

Namri is portrayed by Predrag Bjelac in the 2003 miniseries.

=== Javid ===
Ziarenko Javid is the son of Namri and a High Priest of the Qizarate, the leaders of the religion which has risen around Paul Atreides. Possessed by the persona of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Paul&#x27;s sister Alia takes Javid as her lover, infuriating her husband, Duncan Idaho. Duncan later kills Javid publicly in Sietch Tabr, partly out of revenge and partly to manipulate Stilgar into killing Duncan as a means to force Stilgar to join the rebellion against Alia.

Javid is portrayed by Rik Young in the 2003 miniseries.

=== Farad&#x27;n ===

Farad&#x27;n is the son of Princess Wensicia, and the grandson of Shaddam IV. In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Shaddam is dead and Wensicia plots from exile to restore House Corrino to its former glory by wresting control of the Imperial throne from the usurper, Paul Atreides, for Farad&#x27;n. She attempts to assassinate Leto II and Ghanima Atreides, Paul&#x27;s twin heirs, and though she fails, Leto pretends to be dead to escape the increasingly murderous ambitions of his father&#x27;s sister Alia. Paul and Alia&#x27;s mother, Lady Jessica, trains Farad&#x27;n in the Bene Gesserit ways as a preamble to an offer to marry Ghanima and share the throne. His part of the deal is to &quot;denounce and banish&quot; Wensicia for Leto&#x27;s murder, which he does, but Ghanima intends to murder Farad&#x27;n on their wedding night as revenge. Leto reappears, now beginning the transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid, and ascends the throne himself. Leto, who is now physically incapable of siring children, commands Farad&#x27;n to father the future Atreides line as Ghanima&#x27;s mate. Farad&#x27;n is also appointed as the Royal Scribe and renamed &quot;Harq al&#x27;Ada&quot; (the &quot;breaker of habit&quot;), and relinquishes his control of the remaining Sardaukar to Leto, effectively surrendering House Corrino&#x27;s claim to the Imperial throne. Many of the chapter epigraphs in the novel are from the later writings of Farad&#x27;n (as Harq al&#x27;Ada) in his role as chronicler of the reign of Leto II.

Farad&#x27;n is portrayed by Jonathan Brüün in the 2003 miniseries.

She uses a hidden tracker in Agarves&#x27; boots to raid the secret meeting, and Stilgar kills Agarves, as she planned.

== Introduced in &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981) ==

=== Siona Atreides ===
Siona Atreides is the daughter of God Emperor Leto II&#x27;s attendant and confidant Moneo, and a direct descendant of Leto&#x27;s twin sister Ghanima and Farad&#x27;n Corrino. In &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, Siona objects to Leto&#x27;s tyrannical stranglehold on civilization, and leads a group of like-minded dissidents determined to depose Leto by any means necessary. Leto allows her to steal secret records from his archives, and she loses ten of her cohorts to Leto&#x27;s D-wolves, barely escaping with her own life. Forced to join the Fish Speakers, an all-female army who obey Leto without question, Siona is further bristled by Leto&#x27;s obvious desire to breed her with the latest Duncan Idaho ghola. Leto, who over the millennia has become a human-sandworm hybrid thanks to his fusion with sandtrout, the larval stage of sandworms, tests Siona by taking her out to the middle of the desert. She is careless in the use of her stillsuit to preserve moisture, and dehydration forces her to accept Leto&#x27;s offer of spice essence from his body to replenish her. Awakened to Leto&#x27;s Golden Path, the prophetic vision he follows to avert humanity&#x27;s complete destruction, Siona is convinced of its importance, and better understands why he has ruled so harshly. But she remains dedicated to Leto&#x27;s destruction, and an errant rainstorm demonstrates for her his mortal vulnerability to water. Leto has planned a Royal Procession to travel to his wedding to the Ixian ambassador Hwi Noree, and Siona and Idaho overcome a searing mutual hatred of each other to plan his assassination. As the procession moves across a high bridge over the Idaho River, Siona&#x27;s associate, the Fish Speaker Nayla, destroys the support beams with a lasgun. The bridge collapses and Leto&#x27;s entourage, including Moneo and Hwi, plunge to their deaths into the river below. Leto&#x27;s body rends apart in the water, the outer layer of sandtrout encysting the water and scurrying off, while the rest burns and disintegrates on the shore. A dying Leto reveals a secret aspect of his Golden Path: Siona is the result of a breeding scheme to produce a human who is invisible to prescient vision. Siona and her descendants will possess this ability, and Leto explains that humanity is now free from the domination of oracles, free to scatter throughout the universe, never again to face complete domination or complete destruction. After revealing the location of his secret spice hoard, Leto dies, leaving Duncan and Siona to face the task of managing the empire.

=== Hwi Noree ===
Hwi Noree is the Ixian ambassador to Arrakis, and the niece of Malky, a previous Ixian ambassador who had been close to Leto II. In &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, Leto is enchanted by the beautiful and charismatic Hwi, and though he realizes she has been specifically designed and trained to ensnare him, he cannot resist falling in love with her. Raised in secret in a no-chamber, she has been bred to appeal to what remains of Leto&#x27;s humanity, a process guided by Malky himself. Though his transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid makes him incapable of physical intimacy, Leto proposes marriage and Hwi agrees. Duncan Idaho also falls in love with Hwi, and they fall into bed together. The resulting rivalry only worsens the rift between Leto and Duncan, who is driven to join Siona in her assassination plot against Leto. Hwi dies with Leto when their wedding procession crosses a sabotaged bridge, which collapses into the Idaho River below.

=== Anteac ===
Bene Gesserit Truthsayer Tertius Eileen Anteac comes to Arrakis with Luyseyal in &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; for an audience with the God Emperor Leto II that coincides with the Royal Festival held every ten years. They receive a message from Othwi Yake, Assistant to the Ixian ambassador, that Face Dancers have infiltrated the Ixian embassy, and are planning to assassinate Leto II. They try to warn Leto, but the message does not reach his convoy in time, though the plot fails, as Anteac and Luyseyal knew it would. They achieve little in their meeting with Leto II, and he takes the priceless vial of spice-essence with which they hoped to test his mortality. Leto reminds Luyseyal of the lesson learned from past over-machined societies: &quot;The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines.&quot; Later, Leto enlists Anteac&#x27;s aid in detecting the Face Dancers, who by that time have replaced everyone in the Ixian embassy except the new ambassador, Hwi Noree. In particular, Anteac identifies the duplicate of Yake, who has been killed and replicated since the original sent his warning to Anteac. Leto&#x27;s chief minister Moneo Atreides suggests to the God Emperor that Anteac is a secret Mentat, a skill prohibited in the Empire by Leto himself. Leto agrees but says that it amuses him. Hwi shares her knowledge of the environment in which she was brought up with Anteac, who has been conscripted by Leto to lead a Fish Speaker assault on Ix to wrest the secret of Hwi&#x27;s origins. Anteac is shocked at the knowledge that Hwi is to marry Leto, and at the same time annoyed that The Bene Gesserit had allowed so talented a woman as Hwi to pass through their training program without turning her into one of them. With Anteac&#x27;s faithful assistance, Leto&#x27;s forces successfully invade Ix and capture Malky, Hwi&#x27;s uncle and Leto&#x27;s former friend, but Anteac is killed.

Some 1,500 years later in &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot; the Duncan Idaho ghola recalls his past incarnation from the time of Leto II, noting that he had met with Anteac on orders from the God Emperor to suppress the Mentat school the Bene Gesserit had hidden on Wallach IX. It is also revealed that Reverend Mother Bellonda is a descendant of Anteac&#x27;s.

=== Moneo Atreides ===
Moneo Atreides is Leto II&#x27;s longtime majordomo and close confidant, the descendant of one of the Duncan Idaho gholas, the father of Siona with the Fish Speaker Seyefa, and a direct descendant of Leto&#x27;s twin sister Ghanima and Farad&#x27;n Corrino. Like Siona, he was rebellious as a young man, leading a group of rebels dedicated to ending Leto&#x27;s oppressive reign. He recognized that eliminating Leto would cast the universe into chaos, but that it would prompt a beneficial rebirth for humanity. In &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, Moneo has long given up these efforts and now serves Leto with the utmost dedication, having seen the Golden Path for himself and recognized its importance in saving humanity from destruction. Moneo is killed during Leto&#x27;s assassination, orchestrated by Siona and Duncan, when the bridge that Leto&#x27;s procession is crossing is destroyed.

=== Nayla ===
Nayla is a fanatical Fish Speaker in the service of the God Emperor. Knowing of Siona Atreides and Duncan Idaho&#x27;s plot against him, Leto has instructed Nayla to follow any order Siona gives her. When Siona tasks Nayla to assist in Leto&#x27;s assassination by sabotaging the bridge he is traveling on, Nayla complies with fervor, damaging the supports with a lasgun. Leto, Hwi Noree and Moneo Atreides are among those killed in the collapse, and Duncan kills Nayla for her role in Hwi&#x27;s death.

=== Chenoeh ===
Quintinius Violet Chenoeh, specially trained as an oral recorder, is sent by Syaksa to Arrakis with Tawsuoko on a fact-gathering mission in the same year as Anteac, prior to the events &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;. She is invited to converse with the God Emperor himself, and he is uncharacteristically indulgent of her questions and somewhat generous with his own information, however cryptic. Leto tells Chenoeh that he plans to restore &quot;outward spiritual freedom&quot; for mankind, and then refers to Siona Atreides as his &quot;achievement&quot;, which the Sisterhood correctly interprets as being related to Leto&#x27;s own breeding program. Leto then says, &quot;You will return to your Superiors with my message, but these words keep secret for now. I will visit my rage upon your Sisterhood if you fail.&quot; Chenoeh complies, following Syaksa&#x27;s own warning: &quot;You must do nothing which will bring down his wrath upon us.&quot; Leto relates how he and his sister Ghanima were able to escape the disaster of Abomination, and also makes one of the earliest references to his secret journals, later found at Dar-es-Balat. He knows he will ultimately be perceived as a tyrant, and wishes to preserve his &quot;feelings and motives... lest history distort them too much.&quot; At the same time, he warns &quot;Beware of &quot;the&quot; truth,&quot; and shares what he calls &quot;the greatest mystery of all time&quot; by which he composes his life: &quot;The only past which endures lies wordlessly within you.&quot; Leto tells Chenoeh that by virtue of his taking her into his confidence, &quot;You will become here an integral part of my myth. Our distant cousins will pray to you for intercession with me!&quot; He also foretells her later death during her attempt at becoming a Reverend Mother through the spice agony. Chenoeh&#x27;s account of their secret conversation is found after her death, and it is later noted that &quot;the persistent Cult of Sister Chenoeh assumes new significance because of the journals&#x27; disclosures.&quot; Chenoeh and Tawsuoko also bring back to Chapterhouse proof (in the form of a written eyewitness account of Leto&#x27;s statement) that, as rumored, Leto executed nine historians four centuries prior.

=== Other ===
* is the Ixian ambassador to Arrakis prior to the events of &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;. In this capacity he becomes a close confidant to Leto, discussing controversial subjects and challenging the God Emperor as a subtle attempt at manipulation. Malky is recalled to Ix, and replaced by Iyo Kobat. In the novel, Malky&#x27;s niece, Hwi Noree, is installed as the new Ixian ambassador. Leto soon learns that she has been designed and trained to ensnare him, and that Malky was complicit in the process. Leto sends a Fish Speaker force to Ix to capture Malky, who is brought back to Arrakis and murdered by Moneo.
* is a Bene Gesserit Truthsayer who comes to Arrakis with Anteac in &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; for an audience with the God Emperor Leto II that coincides with the Royal Festival held every ten years. They receive a message from Othwi Yake, assistant to the Ixian ambassador, that Face Dancers have infiltrated the Ixian embassy, and are planning to assassinate Leto II. Anteac and Luyseyal try to warn Leto, but the message does not reach his convoy in time, though the plot fails, as Anteac and Luyseyal knew it would. They achieve little in their meeting with Leto II, and he takes the priceless vial of spice-essence with which they hoped to test his mortality. Leto reminds Luyseyal of the lesson learned from past over-machined societies: &quot;The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines.&quot;
* is a Bene Gesserit sent by Syaksa to Arrakis with Chenoeh on a fact-gathering mission the same year as Anteac, prior to the events &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;. In addition to the record of Chenoeh&#x27;s somewhat enlightening conversations with the God Emperor, she and Chenoeh bring back to Chapterhouse proof (in the form of a written eyewitness account of Leto&#x27;s statement) that, as rumored, Leto executed nine historians four centuries prior.
* is a Bene Gesserit who sends Chenoeh and Tawsuoko to Arrakis on a fact-gathering mission the same year as Anteac, prior to the events &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;. Syaksa&#x27;s warning to Chenoeh that &quot;You must do nothing which will bring down his wrath upon us&quot; encourages Chenoeh to obey the God Emperor&#x27;s command to withhold certain of his statements from the Sisterhood. Syaksa and four other Reverend Mothers (Yitob, Mamulut, Eknekosk and Akeli) incorporate information gleaned from this mission into an &quot;assessment of the state of the Empire&quot; for that year. Syaksa believes that the religious character of the Fish Speakers is slowly being devolved under Leto II. She further attributes to him a motive based on the concept of hydraulic despotism, in which a government structure maintains power and control through exclusive control over a basic resource needed to live (in this case, melange), proposing that he is building the Empire toward an even greater dependence on the spice.

== Introduced in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984) ==

=== Lucilla ===

Lucilla is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and Imprinter. In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Taraza sends the young and attractive Lucilla to Gammu, formerly the Harkonnen homeworld Giedi Prime, to teach the teenage Duncan Idaho ghola whom the Sisterhood is raising there. Lucilla is also tasked with binding his loyalty to her, and thus the Bene Gesserit, through imprinting, while also protecting him from the negative influence—and possible peril—presented by dissenting Bene Gesserit who believe the ghola is a danger to the Sisterhood. Extremely precocious and already having divined the fact that he is a ghola, the young Duncan nurses hatred for the Bene Gesserit, hoping to escape their control of his life. He soon blossoms, however, under the training of Lucilla and Miles Teg, a male military commander of the Bene Gesserit brought out of retirement in part to protect the ghola. An attempt is made on Duncan&#x27;s life, and Teg and Lucilla flee with Duncan into the countryside. They hide in a forgotten Harkonnen no-globe, during which time Teg is able to awaken Duncan to his original memories. This occurs before Lucilla has imprinted the ghola, and his new self-awareness now makes it impossible for her to attempt it. Teg arranges an extraction by his protégé Burzmali, but they are ambushed, and Teg sacrifices himself to capture while Lucilla and Duncan escape. Duncan attempts to get off Gammu undetected in the guise of a diminutive Tleilaxu Master, but is taken hostage. Lucilla and Burzmali arrive at a Bene Gesserit safehouse, but discover that it has been taken over by the fearsome Honored Matres, a violent matriarchal order from the farthest reaches of the universe who have been wreaking havoc and destruction on Tleilaxu worlds. Lucilla manages to impersonate an Honored Matre as one of their number, escaping with Duncan and an Honored Matre prisoner, Murbella. Teg commandeers an Honored Matre no-ship and flees with Lucilla, Duncan and a captive Murbella.

In &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;, Lucilla has been transferred to the planet Lampadas to oversee a Bene Gesserit education center located there. She manages to escape before the Honored Matres destroy the planet, carrying the shared memories of its millions of Reverend Mothers. Her ship is damaged by a mine and she is forced to land on Gammu, where she takes refuge with a hidden colony of Jews, knowing that they will be sympathetic to her. The Jews had fled Earth thousands of years earlier in order to escape relentless persecution, and they now practice their religion in secret to maintain their ties to ancient history. The Bene Gesserit, with their own method of connecting to their past, have cultivated a relationship with the Jews. The leader of this settlement gives Lucilla shelter, but ultimately has to turn her over to the Honored Matres in order to save his people from destruction at their hands. Before doing so, however, he introduces Lucilla to Rebecca, a &quot;wild&quot; Reverend Mother who has gained her Other Memories without Bene Gesserit training. Lucilla shares minds with Rebecca, who promises to take the memories of Lampadas safely back to the Sisterhood. The Honored Matres capture Lucilla and bring her before the Great Honored Matre Dama, who surprises everyone present by declining to kill her outright. Dama tries to persuade Lucilla to join the Honored Matres, preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. Dama is especially interested in the Bene Gesserit ability to modify their biochemistry and render toxins harmless, prompting Lucilla to speculate that the Honored Matres were driven out of the Scattering by an enemy who used biological weapons. These conversations with Lucilla continue for weeks, and she reveals to Dama that, although the Bene Gesserit know how to manipulate and control the populace, they practice and believe in democracy. Dama&#x27;s desire to destroy the Sisterhood is redoubled when she discovers that the Bene Gesserit teach this dangerous knowledge, and she kills Lucilla.

Lucilla is described as a near copy of the elite Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade, from her physical appearance to the sound of her voice. The two women are not directly related, but are instead the products of parallel breeding lines.

=== Miles Teg ===

Miles Teg is a Mentat and the former Supreme Bashar of the Bene Gesserit, their leading military commander. In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Taraza summons Teg out of retirement to take over the weapons training of the newest Duncan Idaho ghola, still a teenager, on Gammu. Teg, Duncan and Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Lucilla flee an attempt on Duncan&#x27;s life, and hide in a long-forgotten Harkonnen no-globe discovered by Teg&#x27;s aide, Patrin. Teg uses his strong resemblance to his ancestor Duke Leto Atreides, to whom the original Idaho was fiercely loyal, and a variety of relentless physical and mental attacks to awaken Duncan to his original memories. Teg arranges an extraction by his protégé Burzmali, but they are ambushed, and Teg sacrifices himself to capture by the Honored Matres to allow Lucilla and Duncan to escape. Teg is tortured using a T-Probe, and under the severe stress and agony produced by the probe&#x27;s attempts to gain control of his body and his knowledge, his Mentat abilities and Atreides genes elevate him to a higher level of being. He is able to move faster than the eye can see by accelerating his metabolism, and he gains mild prescience, which he describes as a doubled vision which gives him intimations of danger. His accelerated speed comes at the cost of incredible energy expenditure, requiring him to consume enormous amounts of food. After escaping his captors, he finds that his safehouse had been taken over by Honored Matres, who attempt to gain his allegiance. Seeing the terrible state their constant drive for power and contempt for the masses has lowered them to, he uses his incredible speed to slaughter them and escape once more. Teg gathers a force of veterans who had served under him on previous campaigns from the bars of Ysai and captures an Honored Matre no-ship using his tactical genius and new abilities. He flees the planet with Lucilla, Duncan and a captive Honored Matre, Murbella. Journeying to Rakis, Teg hands off Duncan and Lucilla to the Bene Gesserits Sheeana and Darwi Odrade, the latter of which is revealed to be his daughter. As the others escape, Teg goads the Honored Matres, who incinerate the entire planet with their Obliterator weapons to be sure Teg is killed.

A ghola of Teg is birthed in &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot; on orders from Odrade, who is now Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit after Taraza&#x27;s death in the battle at Rakis. Odrade needs Teg&#x27;s military abilities to thwart the worsening threat of the Honored Matres. The Bene Gesserit later reawaken him to his full memories prematurely by using Sheeana to imprint him. As the original Teg has been trained by his mother to resist such manipulation, the attempt subjects the Teg ghola to a heightened amount of stress which also unlocks the superhuman abilities previously acquired by Teg under Honored Matre torture. A reawakened Teg leads the final assault upon the Honored Matres, but is captured when the Matres pretend to surrender. Murbella, a captive Honored Matre indoctrinated into the Bene Gesserit, kills the Honored Matre leader Logno at the same time Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Odrade is killed, and Murbella manages to secure the leadership of both groups. Teg is released, later joining Sheeana and Duncan Idaho when they escape Bene Gesserit control in a no-ship.

The adult Teg is described as 296 years old but still vital, and has a striking resemblance to his ancestor, Leto Atreides. The son of the Bene Gesserit Lady Janet Roxbrough (a Fish Speaker descendant) and Loschy Teg, a &quot;CHOAM station factor&quot; who was chosen for breeding by the Sisterhood for his &quot;gene potential,&quot; Miles had been instructed in the Bene Gesserit ways by his mother before being sent to Lampadas to train as a Mentat. Teg is a military genius, having a very strong sense of honor, loyalty, and many of the characteristics of House Atreides, his ancestors. He is well known for doing the unexpected. Teg is also not a spice addict, as is common with most other people, not even resorting to the spice at old age when most others might wish to use it to extend their lives. By the time of &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, Teg&#x27;s wife had been dead for 38 years, his grown children living elsewhere except for his eldest daughter Dimela. She and her husband Firus take control of Teg&#x27;s farm when he leaves his homeworld Lernaeus, and the couple have three children. Teg had a younger brother, Sabine, who had been poisoned on Romo. In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, it is revealed that Teg had fathered other children during his younger years, one of whom is Odrade.

Teg also appears in the sequel novels &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, Duncan and Teg run the affairs on the no-ship, being the only two passengers with experience in military leadership. Teg considers himself responsible for the security of the ship and its vital cargo of historical gholas, produced in transit from genetic material possessed by captive passenger Scytale, purportedly the last Tleilaxu Master. In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, mysterious saboteurs conduct crippling attacks on the no-ship&#x27;s systems. Teg and Duncan discover that Face Dancers have infiltrated the ship, but not before they are led directly to the &quot;Unknown Enemy&quot; who have been stalking the ship for years: Daniel and Marty, incarnations of the ancient thinking machines Omnius and Erasmus. The critically damaged no-ship is caught in the thinking machine tachyon net, and Teg uses his accelerated metabolism to both repair the ship and launch countermeasures against the attacking machines. Though he has consumed vast quantities of melange and carbohydrates from the ship&#x27;s stores to complete his task, Teg dies from massive cellular exhaustion. Duncan is unable to free the ship, and it is taken to the machine world Synchrony. En route, Duncan and Sheeana release the husk that is left of Teg&#x27;s body into space, vowing that the Bashar will never be captured by the Enemy. Later, after the machines are defeated, Duncan asks Scytale for a new ghola of Teg, whom he will need at his side in his new position as the bridge between both mankind and machines.

=== Murbella ===

Murbella is a young Honored Matre who defects to the Bene Gesserit. In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, the violent Honored Matres capture the teenage Duncan Idaho ghola, who is loyal to their enemies, the Bene Gesserit. Young Honored Matre Murbella is tasked to use her sexual imprinting talents to enslave Duncan to force his allegiance to them. The Tleilaxu have secretly programmed the ghola with the male equivalent to the Honored Matres&#x27; imprinting power, which is unlocked by Murbella&#x27;s attempt. Duncan and Murbella imprint each other, and in her weakened condition Murbella is easily captured by the Bene Gesserit. Her new addiction to Duncan keeps Murbella subdued, and Bene Gesserit soon begin to train her as one of them, though they do not completely trust her. In &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;, Duncan and Murbella&#x27;s mutual imprinting has made them reluctant lovers. Murbella collapses under the pressure of training and her pregnancy, but realizes that she admires and wants to be Bene Gesserit. Murbella submits to the spice agony to become a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, and survives. During a Bene Gesserit attack on the Honored Matres, Murbella kills the Great Honored Matre Logno with her Bene Gesserit-enhanced fighting skills, and the Honored Matres are awed by her physical prowess. The Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Darwi Odrade is also killed, and Murbella secures the leadership of both groups, per Odrade&#x27;s plan. Murbella intends to merge the two orders into a New Sisterhood, which displeases some of the Bene Gesserit. The dissenters flee Chapterhouse with Duncan, Miles Teg, and Sheeana in a no-ship, and Murbella realizes their plan too late to stop them.

Murbella also appears in the sequel novels &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, Murbella takes the title Mother Commander. She has four daughters by Duncan: Rinya, Janess, Tanidia and Gianne. Murbella searches her Other Memory for the origin of the Honored Matres. She discovers that they are descendants of rogue Bene Gesserits and Tleilaxu females, originally used as axlotl tanks and freed by Fish Speakers, who allied in the Scattering. Murbella also discovers that the Honored Matres&#x27; &quot;outside enemy&quot; are thinking machines, provoked when the Honored Matres stole technologically advanced weapons, including Obliterators, from them. In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, Murbella now knows that the sentient computer network Omnius and his thinking machine forces are coming, and attempts to rally humankind for a last stand against the thinking machines. She commissions the scientists of Ix to copy the destructive Obliterators for use on the fleet of warships she has ordered from the Spacing Guild. However, Ix is now secretly controlled by Face Dancer leader Khrone. When Murbella is ready to launch her fleet, the Obliterators and Ixian navigation devices all suddenly fail, which Murbella realizes is sabotage. The Oracle of Time appears, destroying Omnius and the thinking machines with her own armada. Murbella is reunited with Duncan, who intends to end the divide between humans and thinking machines, allowing the two to co-exist.

=== Darwi Odrade ===
Darwi Odrade is an elite Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and Atreides descendant. In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, the &quot;wild talents&quot; of the Atreides bloodline that Odrade displays intermittently are what the Bene Gesserit both fear and desperately need. The suspicious Reverend Mother Bellonda scrutinizes Odrade continually, looking for reasons to terminate her, while Mother Superior Taraza senses that the Sisterhood needs Odrade&#x27;s limited Atreides prescience to avert imminent destruction at the hands of the Honored Matres. Taraza tasks Odrade to take over the Bene Gesserit Keep on the planet Arrakis, and take under her protection the foundling girl Sheeana, who has the natural ability to control the giant sandworms. Recognizing Sheeana&#x27;s value to the Sisterhood, Odrade begins training her as a Bene Gesserit acolyte. Meanwhile, an anonymous document referred to as the Atreides Manifesto surfaces, attacking all religions in the known universe except for that of the Bene Tleilax. This creates a furor with the intensely religious Tleilaxu, who have long nursed dreams of hegemony, dominating the universe with their religion. The Tleilaxu council decides to treat the Manifesto as a gift from God, and they spread it far and wide. It is later revealed that the Manifesto was in fact written by Odrade. When Taraza is killed after a showdown with the Honored Matres on Arrakis, Odrade becomes Mother Superior.

In &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot; (1985), Odrade is accompanied by Tamalane, Dortujla and the acolyte Suipol to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction, as retired Bene Gesserit Supreme Bashar Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu. With the planet about to fall, the Honored Matres activate their &quot;weapon of last resort&quot;, turning victory into defeat and holding Odrade captive. Tamalane, Dortujla, and Suipol are killed. As planned with Odrade previously, Honored Matre-turned-Bene Gesserit Murbella travels to Junction alone, pretending to have escaped the Bene Gesserit with their unique abilities and the location of their hidden homeworld, Chapterhouse. Murbella is brought before the new Great Honored Matre Logno, who has just killed her predecessor Dama and has Odrade standing nearby, unrestrained in a gesture of contempt. Murbella provokes and kills Logno, while simultaneously the Honored Matre Elpek kills Odrade. With both of these deaths, Murbella becomes the new Mother Superior as well as Great Honored Matre, fulfilling Odrade&#x27;s intentions.

Odrade is secretly the daughter of military commander Teg, and her &quot;care with details&quot; makes her, like Teg, most suited for duties related to security. The younger Reverend Mother and Imprinter Lucilla is described a near copy of Odrade, from her physical appearance to the sound of her voice. The two women are not directly related, but are instead the products of parallel breeding lines. As the Bene Gesserit are wary of the historical unpredictability of Atreides genes, it is noted in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; that her offspring receive &quot;careful examination&quot;, and that &quot;two of those offspring had been quietly put to death.&quot;

=== Sheeana ===
Sheeana Brugh is a young girl native to Rakis (formerly Arrakis) who possesses the unique ability to control the giant sandworms that roam the desert planet. In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, Sheeana&#x27;s talent is revealed after her impoverished village is wiped out by a sandworm which refuses to harm her, and then whisks her to the capital city of Keen (formerly Arrakeen) when she climbs on to its back in the long-forbidden Fremen tradition. Sheeana is soon recognized as the &quot;sandrider&quot; predicted by the Leto II, and worshipped by the priesthood of Rakis. As she matures to adulthood, Sheeana effectively assumes control of the priesthood. Her popularity and religious aura have increased both on and off Rakis, and the priests, believing her a prophet, are compelled to follow even her most unorthodox commands. The Bene Gesserit, who have their own plans for Sheeana and have secretly guided her education, thwart an assassination attempt on her, and unofficially take control of Sheeana, the priesthood and Rakis. Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade begins Sheeana&#x27;s formal Bene Gesserit training. Mother Superior Taraza is soon pleased with Sheeana&#x27;s progress, and considers a secondary plan of seeding other planets with sandworms with Sheeana&#x27;s help. Rakis itself is destroyed by the vengeful Honored Matres. In &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;, Sheeana is now in charge of the project to breed sandworms on the secret Bene Gesserit world, Chapterhouse. She becomes a full Reverend Mother but remains very independent, with mysterious depths. Disagreeing with the plans of new Bene Gesserit leader Murbella, Sheeana chooses to escape Chapterhouse on an untraceable no-ship with the like-minded Duncan Idaho ghola and a number of other passengers.

Sheeana also appears in the sequel novels &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.
In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, Sheeana and Duncan lead the no-ship in their journey to flee the Unknown Enemy that pursues them. Sheeana decides that they need to make new gholas of former heroes using the genetic material carried by the last Tleilaxu Master, Scytale.

=== Tylwyth Waff ===

Tylwyth Waff is a Tleilaxu Master and the leader of the Bene Tleilax, a secretive race of genetic manipulators who traffic in biological products such as artificial eyes, gholas, and &quot;twisted&quot; Mentats. Waff is described as &quot;an elfin figure barely a meter and a half tall. Eyes, hair, and skin were shades of gray, all a stage for the oval face with its tiny mouth and line of sharp teeth&quot;. In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, Waff successfully replaces High Priest Hedley Tuek with a Face Dancer duplicate loyal to the Tleilaxi, but loses control of the impostor due to its eventual complete assimilation into its new form. Traveling to Rakis, Waff decides to ally with the Bene Gesserit after he is tricked into believing that they share the secret religious beliefs of the Tleilaxu. He is killed along with the entire population of Rakis when the Honored Matres destroy the planet in revenge for Miles Teg&#x27;s slaughter of their members. Meanwhile, he has a replacement ghola growing for himself in Bandalong, the capital city of the Tleilaxu homeworld, Tleilax.

Waff also appears in the sequel novels &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, the Honored Matres who conquered Tleilax have kept several of Waff&#x27;s gholas alive, but in vegetative states. In order to recover the supposedly &quot;lost&quot; secret to producing melange in axlotl tanks, the Lost Tleilaxu scribe Uxtal is tasked to create new gholas from Waff&#x27;s genetic material. Uxtal accelerates the process artificially, and of the first batch of eight Waff gholas, seven fail to regain their memories and are viciously killed. The massacre shocks the last ghola into regaining some of Waff&#x27;s memories, but not enough to recreate the melange process. Later, the Waff ghola escapes the Bene Gesserit attack on Tleilax, finding refuge with the Spacing Guild by offering Guild Navigator Edrik the genetic knowledge for the Guild to create their own, optimized sandworms to produce melange. In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, Waff alters the DNA of the sandworm&#x27;s larval sandtrout stage to create an aquatic form of the worms, which are then released into the oceans of Buzzell. Adapting to their new environment, these &quot;seaworms&quot; quickly flourish, eventually producing a highly concentrated form of melange, dubbed &quot;ultraspice&quot;. Waff makes a pilgrimage to Rakis, original homeworld of the sandworms, and sacrifices himself to a worm, which to him is an embodiment of God.

=== Bellonda ===
Bellonda is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and the chief Mentat-Archivist counselor to Mother Superior Taraza in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;. After Taraza&#x27;s death, Bellonda serves new Mother Superior Darwi Odrade in the same function in &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;. During a conversation with the Duncan Idaho ghola it is revealed that Bellonda is a descendant of Anteac, an important Reverend Mother from the time of the God Emperor Leto II.

Bellonda also appears in the sequel novel &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In the novel, Bellonda is one of the few Bene Gesserit with access to the Bene Gesserit&#x27;s sensitive breeding records, and one of even fewer possessing the memories of all the Mothers Superior. Bellonda suspects that the Honored Matres had originally been Reverend Mothers sent out in the Scattering, and calculates that melange withdrawal and hypnosis had caused them to deny their origins. Bellonda is later killed in a duel by her Spice Operations Director partner and nemesis, the former Honored Matre Doria. An outraged Mother Commander Murbella, leader of the merged New Sisterhood of Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres, forces Doria to share minds with Bellonda before her memories are lost forever.

=== Taraza ===
Alma Mavis Taraza is the Bene Gesserit Mother Superior in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; who brings former Supreme Bashar Miles Teg reluctantly out of retirement to guard the latest Duncan Idaho ghola. Taraza blackmails Tleilaxu Master Waff to find out all he knows about the invading Honored Matres, as well as the fact that the Bene Tleilax have programmed their own agenda within the ghola. She also manages to divine that Waff is a secret Zensufi, which finally gives the Sisterhood a way to manipulate the Tleilaxu. Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade subsequently uses this knowledge of Waff&#x27;s religious beliefs to form an alliance with him. As Tleilaxu axlotl tanks are the only other source of melange besides Rakis, this alliance will be essential when Taraza executes her ultimate plan: to destroy Rakis and free humanity from Leto II&#x27;s own plan. The discovery of a girl with the ability to control sandworms prompts Taraza to consider a secondary plan of seeding other planets with them. The Honored Matres are goaded into attacking Rakis and Taraza is killed, but not before she is able to share Other Memory with Odrade, who escapes.

=== Burzmali ===
Alef Burzmali is Miles Teg&#x27;s protégé in the Bene Gesserit military who became Supreme Bashar after Teg&#x27;s retirement. In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, he aids Teg in extracting the Duncan Idaho ghola and Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Lucilla from their hiding place on Gammu. When Duncan is captured by the Honored Matres, Lucilla impersonates one of them, with Burzmali playing her sexual slave, to access the building where Duncan is being held. Burzmali dies attempting to protect the planet Lampadas from a catastrophic attack by Honored Matres in &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot;.

=== Hedley Tuek ===
Hedley Tuek is the High Priest of the Rakian Priesthood, and a descendant of the melange smuggler Esmar Tuek. Tleilaxu Master Waff has Tuek killed and replaced by a Face Dancer, a genetically engineered mimic, but loses control of the duplicate due to its eventual complete assimilation into its new form.

=== Other ===
* is the Bene Gesserit in charge of the Duncan Idaho ghola project on Gammu in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;. As the leader of a faction of the Sisterhood who believe that such gholas are a danger to the order and its goals, she has been subtly encouraging the ghola&#x27;s failure. By the time Lucilla arrives to teach Duncan and bind his loyalty to the Sisterhood with sexual imprinting, he has already been tarnished by Schwangyu, and nurses hatred for the Bene Gesserit and a desire to escape their control. Despite Schwangyu&#x27;s efforts to seduce Lucilla to her side, Duncan blossoms under the training of Lucilla and Miles Teg, and Schwangyu begins to realize that she has much underestimated Lucilla. Schwangyu betrays Teg, Lucilla, and Duncan to the Tleilaxu, allowing them to attack the keep on Gammu where Duncan is being trained, but the Tleilaxu forces kill her during the strike.
* is a Bene Gesserit who is one of the Duncan Idaho ghola&#x27;s first chief instructors on Gammu in the events before &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;. Tamalane is one of Mother Superior Odrade&#x27;s advisors in &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;, and accompanies Odrade, Dortujla and the acolyte Suipol to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction as Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu. Tamalane and her party are eventually slain by the Honored Matres, but the Bene Gesserit conquest proves successful with Murbella left as leader to both the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres.
* is the Bene Gesserit Archivist counselor and advisor to Mother Superior Taraza in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;. She is one of very few sisters with access to sensitive breeding records, and is the first advisor to correctly suggest that the Tleilaxu ambition is to produce a complete prana-bindu mimic.
* is the Bene Gesserit mother of Supreme Bashar Miles Teg, who teaches him the Bene Gesserit ways in his youth, prior to &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;.
* is a young Bene Gesserit acolyte whom Miles Teg meets as a child. While the Honored Matres interrogate an adult Miles with a T-Probe in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, he recalls a visit from the Sisterhood to his Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Janet Roxbrough. Miles is left talking with one of the visitor&#x27;s young acolytes, Carlana, who unsuccessfully tries her &quot;fledging skills&quot; on the eleven-year-old Teg. Miles, who has been well-instructed by his mother, can easily see through Carlana and manipulates her in return. Carlana is described as having red-blond hair, a doll&#x27;s face with green-gray eyes and upturned nose, and an &quot;inflated view of her own attractions.&quot;
* is a Bene Gesserit who had been the Duncan Idaho ghola&#x27;s first chief instructor prior to the events of &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;. She had become very attached to him, but had been sent away after allowing him to discover (at age eight) that he is a ghola.

== Introduced in &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot; (1985) ==

=== Rebecca ===
Rebecca is a &quot;wild&quot; Reverend Mother who lives among a secret community of Jews on Gammu. In &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;, Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Lucilla is fleeing the destruction of the planet Lampadas by the Honored Matres and is forced to land on Gammu. Once there, she seeks out a hidden settlement of Jews, whom she knows will give her sanctuary. They are obligated to turn her over to the Honored Matres to assure their own survival, but Lucilla, who is carrying the priceless shared-minds of all the Reverend Mothers of Lampadas, is able to share minds with Rebecca and pass on this knowledge before being captured by the Honored Matres. Rebecca and the Jews eventually escape Gammu with the Bene Gesserit forces, and Rebecca is able to pass on the 7,622,014 Lampadas shared-minds to the Sisterhood.

In the sequel novel &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, Rebecca is aboard the untraceable no-ship which Sheeana and Duncan Idaho use to flee the Bene Gesserit planet Chapterhouse. Rebecca later offers herself as a volunteer to become one of the axlotl tanks used to produce the important gholas of Paul Atreides, Leto II and others.

=== Daniel and Marty ===
Daniel and Marty are a pair of mysterious observers with advanced technological powers introduced in &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;. Duncan Idaho sees the duo in a vision and determines that they are likely Face Dancers, the shapeshifting minions of the Tleilaxu, though atypically autonomous ones. In the final chapter of the novel, Daniel and Marty observe the escape of the no-ship from Chapterhouse and confirm that they are independent Face Dancers. They acknowledge that Tleilaxu Masters created them and express some deference, but also assert their independence and indicate that their ability to absorb the memories and experiences of other people made their autonomy inevitable. Daniel and Marty hint that they observe and are familiar with various groups in the universe, and allude to their desire to capture and study the passengers of the no-ship.

Herbert&#x27;s 1986 death &quot;left fans with an über-cliffhanger&quot; for twenty years, until his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson published two sequels to the original series, &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;.

In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, Daniel and Marty are in constant pursuit of the escaped no-ship, on which they believe is the Kwisatz Haderach they require to be victorious in the imminent and long-foretold &quot;battle at the end of the universe&quot; known as kralizec. Their Face Dancer minion Khrone is executing a parallel plan to create their own Kwisatz Haderach, using a Paul Atreides ghola that will be conditioned by a ghola of the Baron Harkonnen. Daniel and Marty themselves have the ability to create illusions, and to inflict pain on any human. It is eventually revealed that Daniel and Marty are not, in fact, Face Dancers: they are actually incarnations of the thinking machines Omnius (Daniel) and Erasmus (Marty), introduced in the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Anderson. In the third &quot;Legends&quot; novel &quot;&quot;, Omnius had sent out a last blast of information before being destroyed in the Battle of Corrin. This signal had eventually connected with one of the probes disseminated from Giedi Prime several years earlier, uploading versions of Erasmus and Omnius.

In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, Omnius and Erasmus finally capture the no-ship and pit the Paul ghola on board against their own twisted version, Paolo, in a duel to the death that will leave them with the strongest of the two. Paul survives, but realizes that Duncan is actually the &quot;ultimate Kwisatz Haderach&quot; that Omnius has been seeking. The Oracle of Time, the immortal founder of the Spacing Guild, transports every aspect of the Omnius network into another dimension forever. Erasmus offers Duncan the choice between continuing their war or ending it. Duncan chooses peace over victory, and he and Erasmus merge minds. Erasmus imparts Duncan with all the codes required to run the Synchronized Worlds, as well as all of Erasmus&#x27; knowledge, setting Duncan as the bridge between humans and machines to permanently end the divide and ensure that the two may co-exist. With little left for him, Erasmus again expresses his desire to learn everything possible about what it is to be human—and asks Duncan to deactivate him so that he may experience &quot;death&quot;.

William F. Touponce states unequivocally that Daniel and Marty are Face Dancers in his 1988 book &quot;Frank Herbert&quot;, explaining &quot;Herbert gives us a segment narrated from their point of view only at the very end of the novel. They are offshoots of the Tleilaxu Face Dancers sent out in The Scattering and have become almost godlike because of their capacity to assume the persona of whoever they kill—and they have been doing this for centuries, capturing Mentats and Tleilaxu Masters and whatever else they could assimilate, until now they play with whole planets and civilizations. They are weirdly benign when they first appear in the visions of Duncan Idaho as a calm elderly couple working in a flower garden, trying to capture him in their net&quot;. In an August 2007 review of &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, John C. Snider of SciFiDimensions.com argues that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t fit&quot; or &quot;add up&quot; that Frank Herbert&#x27;s Daniel and Marty are the &quot;malevolent&quot; thinking machines Brian Herbert and Anderson created in their &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; prequel novels. He further wonders why &quot;Omnius, long established as puzzled by and averse to human unpredictability, would want to breed that ultimate ungovernable—a Kwisatz Haderach&quot;.

=== Dama ===
Great Honored Matre Dama is the Honored Matre leader on Junction in &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot;, and is called the &quot;Spider Queen&quot; by the Bene Gesserit leader Darwi Odrade. Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Lucilla flees the destruction of Lampadas by the Honored Matres, but is forced to land on Gammu. She is captured and brought before Dama, but not killed outright. Dama tries to persuade Lucilla to join the Honored Matres, preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. Dama does not try to hide the fact that the Matres dearly want to learn to modify their biochemistry as the Bene Gesserit do. These conversations with Lucilla continue for weeks. When she reveals to Dama that, although the Bene Gesserit know how to manipulate and control the populace, they practice and believe in democracy, Dama&#x27;s desire to destroy the Sisterhood is redoubled when she discovers the Bene Gesserit teach this dangerous knowledge. Dama kills Lucilla, and then meets with Mother Superior Odrade. Dama at first seems surprisingly cooperative, but Odrade soon realizes that Dama intends no reasonable negotiation. Under cover of Odrade&#x27;s diplomacy, the Bene Gesserit forces under Miles Teg attack Junction with tremendous force. Dama&#x27;s chief advisor Logno assassinates Dama with poison, and assumes control of the Honored Matres.

=== Logno ===
Logno is the chief advisor to Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction. In &quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot;, Logno assassinates Dama with poison while the Bene Gesserit forces are attacking Junction. Logno assumes control of the Honored Matres and immediately surrenders. Bene Gesserit leader Odrade is surprised, but she and Miles Teg soon realize they have fallen into a trap. The Honored Matres use a weapon of mass destruction and turn defeat into victory. Murbella saves as much of the Bene Gesserit force as she can, and they begin to withdraw to Chapterhouse. Odrade, however, had planned for the possible failure of the Bene Gesserit attack and left Murbella instructions for a last desperate gamble. Murbella pilots a small craft down to the surface, announcing herself as an Honored Matre who, in the confusion, has managed to escape the Bene Gesserit with all their secrets. She arrives on the planet and immediately announces her intentions by killing an overeager Honored Matre with blinding speed enhanced by Bene Gesserit training that makes her faster than any Honored Matre before her. Murbella is taken to Logno, and immediately declares herself hostile. Logno cannot help herself and attacks, and Murbella handily kills her and some of her allies. Murbella takes charge of the Honored Matres, who are awed by her physical prowess.

=== Dortujla ===
Dortujla is the head of the Bene Gesserit keep on the cold aquatic planet Buzzell, having been sent there as punishment for the so-called &quot;Jessica crime&quot;—a love affair, forbidden by the Bene Gesserit as a weakness that could compromise their performance. In &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;, Dortujla comes to Odrade on Chapterhouse to report that humanoid Handlers and their half-man/half-cat enslaved Futars have offered alliance against the Honored Matres, who have yet to make a move on Buzzell. Dortujla&#x27;s Mentat analysis, however, suggests that the Handlers somehow intend dominance, and that the Matres intend to colonize Buzzell. Odrade sees an opportunity, and orders Dortujla to return to Buzzell and make contact with the Honored Matres, brokering a meeting between Odrade and their leader in which the Bene Gesserit will supposedly surrender. Dortujla is tortured by the Honored Matres and forced to watch her party be murdered and fed to captive Futars. However, she witnesses a Futar using its immobilizing scream, which has &quot;qualities of Voice&quot;, against the Honored Matres. Later, Dortujla accompanies Odrade, Tamalane and the acolyte Suipol to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction, the old Spacing Guild complex above Gammu, as Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu. Dortujla and her party are eventually slain by the Honored Matres.

=== Other ===
* is a Bene Gesserit acolyte in &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;. She is chosen to serve and accompany Odrade on her voyage with Tamalane and Dortujla to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction, as Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu. Odrade describes her as a &quot;dark little thing with a round, calm face and manners to match. Not one of our brightest but guaranteed efficient.&quot; However, after interaction with Suipol, Odrade realizes that she is much more capable than anticipated and judges her ready to undertake the spice agony and become a full Reverend Mother. Suipol and her party are eventually slain by the Honored Matres. Odrade is upset by the Suipol&#x27;s death, lamenting the fact that the young acolyte died without being able to share her memories with another sister.
* is a young Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother in &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot; who is captured and interrogated by Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction. Sabanda dies without revealing anything to the Honored Matres, except the fact that Sheeana is alive and, to Sabanda&#x27;s amusement, the fact that Mother Superior Odrade calls the Honored Matre leader &quot;Spider Queen.&quot;

==Novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson==
Since 1999, Herbert&#x27;s son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson have published 15 prequel novels, collected in the series &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; (1999–2001), &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; (2002–2004), &quot;Heroes of Dune&quot; (2008–2023), &quot;Great Schools of Dune&quot; (2012–2016), and &quot;The Caladan Trilogy&quot; (2020–2022). They have also released two sequel novels—&quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007)—which complete the original series.

===Introduced in &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; (1999–2001)===

==== Anirul ====
Anirul is a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank, wife of the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and the mother of his five daughters, the Princesses Irulan, Chalice, Wensicia, Josifa and Rugi. Anirul is referred to only three times in Herbert&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot;, and only once by name, but is a major character in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy. In &quot;&quot; (1999), Anirul is described as having &quot;short bronze-brown hair,&quot; and that her &quot;features were long and narrow, giving her a doelike face, but her large eyes had a depth of millennia in them.&quot; In the novel, she is the Bene Gesserit Kwisatz Mother, the Reverend Mother chosen every generation to guide the Bene Gesserit breeding program. She calculates that the culmination of the program, the creation of a male superbeing called the Kwisatz Haderach, is imminent. This eventuality is contingent on a daughter of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen being bred with an Atreides male. The resulting daughter would then be bred with another Harkonnen heir, to produce the male Kwisatz Haderach. The Bene Gesserit Margot Fenring arranges for Anirul to marry Shaddam as a means for the Sisterhood to gain influence over the Imperial throne by ensuring that Shaddam will never have a son. During the events of &quot;&quot; (2001), Anirul is murdered by the Harkonnen Mentat Piter De Vries while trying to save the young Paul Atreides from being kidnapped.

==== Elrood IX ====
Elrood IX of House Corrino is the Padishah Emperor, and father of Shaddam IV. He is mentioned twice in Appendix IV of &quot;Dune&quot;, where it is noted that he &quot;succumbed to chaumurky&quot; (poison), rumored to have been administered by Count Hasimir Fenring. In &quot;Dune: House Atreides&quot;, Elrood shows interest in Project Amal, an early attempt by the Bene Tleilax to create synthetic melange and eliminate dependence upon Arrakis. Success would guarantee Elrood total control over spice production. To further this goal, Elrood allows the Tleilaxu to invade and occupy the industrial planet Ix, with the help of Elrood&#x27;s Sardaukar army, and remake it into a laboratory station for the project. Elrood&#x27;s other motivation is revenge against Earl Dominic Vernius, the ruler of Ix, whose wife Shando had been one of Elrood&#x27;s concublines. Shaddam is eager to become emperor, but despite Elrood&#x27;s advanced age, he shows no signs of ill health. Shaddam finally tasks his longtime friend and minion Fenring to administer Elrood with an undetectable, slow-acting poison. Elrood finally dies, and Shaddam secures his throne by paying off the Spacing Guild with a supply of melange and by arranging his own marriage to a Bene Gesserit.

==== Other ====
* is the Bene Gesserit mother of Count Hasimir Fenring. Before the events of the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; trilogy, Chaola (also known as Cirni) is lady-in-waiting to Habla, the fourth wife of Elrood IX, and serves as wet nurse to both her son and Crown Prince Shaddam (later Shaddam IV). It is also hinted that Chaola may secretly be Elrood&#x27;s sister. Chaola&#x27;s son Hasimir proves to be a failure for the Bene Gesserit breeding program. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Paul Atreides notes, &quot;Fenring was one of the might-have-beens, an almost Kwisatz Haderach, crippled by a flaw in the genetic pattern — a eunuch, his talent concentrated into furtiveness and inner seclusion.&quot; Nonetheless, the bloodline manipulations of the Bene Gesserit produce a supremely intelligent and perceptive killer in Fenring, who later serves as Emperor Shaddam&#x27;s chief counselor.
* is the Bene Gesserit Mother Superior during the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; trilogy, as the Sisterhood nears the fruition of its breeding program.
* is the Bene Gesserit wife of Prince Rhombur Vernius of Ix in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; trilogy.

===Introduced in &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; (2002–2004)===

==== Serena Butler ====
Serena Butler is a prominent politician and voice of the human rebellion who becomes the namesake of the Butlerian Jihad against the oppressive rule of the thinking machines in the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; prequel trilogy. The daughter of League of Nobles Viceroy Manion Butler and his wife Livia, Serena is romantically involved with Xavier Harkonnen, who leads the military force on the League capital world of Salusa Secundus. The universe is under threat of total domination by the thinking machine empire, which consists of the evermind Omnius, the independent robot Erasmus and their army cymeks, fearsome weaponized machines controlled by disembodied human brains. The thinking machines control many worlds, and continue to conquer more, enslaving or exterminating any humans they encounter.

In &quot;&quot; (2002), Serena is captured by the thinking machines and studied by Erasmus, who seeks to understand humans completely so that the thinking machines can be truly superior. Though his methods of study often entail human vivisection and torture, Erasmus takes a liking to Serena, as does the young Vorian Atreides, a human trustee who serves the thinking machines. Serena realizes she is pregnant with Xavier&#x27;s child, and later gives birth to a baby boy she names Manion. Eventually finding this distraction inconvenient, Erasmus not only removes Serena&#x27;s uterus, but kills her young son in front of her and his slaves by dropping the child from a high balcony. This event, broadcast across the universe, incites a formal jihad against the thinking machines. Seeing Serena subsequently attack and destroy a sentinel robot with her bare hands encourages Erasmus&#x27; slaves, already groomed for rebellion by slave leader Iblis Ginjo, to rise up. Vorian, witnessing the murder and realizing the lie he lives as a machine trustee, flees with Serena and Ginjo.

In &quot;&quot; (2003), Ginjo (now Grand Patriarch of the Holy Jihad) and Serena (Priestess of the Jihad) have become the religious leaders of the human rebellion, now known the Butlerian Jihad, which elevates young Manion to a martyr. Serena is named interim Viceroy upon her father&#x27;s retirement, but is later relegated to a figurehead by Ginjo as he consolidates his power. The humans begin to tire of war, but Serena and Ginjo know that true peace is not possible, and that the thinking machines must be destroyed. Serena visits Omnius as an emissary of the Jihad under the pretense of negotiating peace, but secretly intends to provoke Omnius into killing her, thereby making her a martyr and reenergizing the Jihad. Although Erasmus stops Omnius from murdering Serena, one of her Seraphim bodyguards, on orders from Ginjo, kills her instead. Ginjo manufactures images of Serena being tortured at length and murdered by the thinking machines, silencing anti-war dissenters and galvanizing the Jihad back into action.

==== Xavier Harkonnen ====
Xavier Harkonnen is the courageous and honorable leader of the military force on the League of Nobles capital world of Salusa Secundus in the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; prequel trilogy. In &quot;Dune: The Butlerian Jihad&quot;, Xavier is romantically involved with Serena Butler until she is presumably killed in an attack by the thinking machines, who seek to conquer the universe and enslave or exterminate all humans. Xavier marries Serena&#x27;s sister Octa and starts a family. Serena, actually a prisoner of the thinking machines, reappears after Manion, Serena and Xavier&#x27;s infant son, is martyred by the independent robot Erasmus and sparks a jihad against the machines. In &quot;Dune: The Machine Crusade&quot;, Serena and the formerly enslaved Iblis Ginjo have become the religious leaders of the human rebellion, with Xavier and Vorian Atreides its two generals. A hero of the Jihad, Xavier achieves many military victories over the machines. When he realizes the extent of Ginjo&#x27;s corruption, Xavier sacrifices his own life and reputation by steering the ship carrying himself and Ginjo into a sun. His secrets dying with him, Ginjo becomes a martyred saint, and Xavier a traitor to humanity.

==== Vorian Atreides ====
Vorian Atreides is the human son of the Titan Agamemnon, and later the founder of House Atreides, in the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; trilogy. In &quot;Dune: The Butlerian Jihad&quot;, he serves the thinking machines as a human trustee, his primary function being to deliver updates of the thinking machine ruler, the evermind Omnius, to machine-controlled worlds alongside his robot co-pilot, Seurat. Vorian falls in love with Serena Butler, a human captured by the independent robot Erasmus, and is horrified when Erasmus murders her child. Vorian betrays the thinking machines and flees with Serena and the human former slave leader Iblis Ginjo. In &quot;Dune: The Machine Crusade&quot;, Serena and Ginjo have become the religious leaders of the human rebellion, with Vorian and Xavier Harkonnen as its two generals. A hero of the Jihad, Vorian achieves many military victories over the machines. Having become a close friend to Xavier, Vorian tries to clear Harkonnen&#x27;s name after Xavier is branded a traitor for assassinating the corrupt Ginjo in a suicide flight into a sun. In &quot;&quot; (2004), Vorian commands the final assault on Omnius. Trapped on Corrin, the thinking machines have surrounded the planet with a human shield of slave ships, and Xavier&#x27;s grandson Abulurd Harkonnen defies Vorian&#x27;s orders to reactivate their weapons and attack. Abulurd is ultimately relieved of duty and charged with treason and cowardice, for which he is exiled, igniting the Atreides-Harkonnen feud which will last for millennia.

Having previously begun a family on Caladan which would become House Atreides, and fathering children on many worlds, Vorian is settled on the backwater world Kepler in &quot;Sisterhood of Dune&quot; (2012). His father Agamemnon&#x27;s life-extension treatments have kept Vorian in his prime for generations, and he foils a group of slavers targeting his village. Vorian meets with Padishah Emperor Salvador Corrino, and is welcomed as a hero of the Jihad. The populace ask that he take the throne from the Corrinos, and though he declines to do so, Salvador and his brother Roderick worry that Vorian&#x27;s presence may incite a revolution. In exchange for Vorian retreating into deeper exile, Salvador agrees to protect Kepler with Imperial forces. Vorian travels to Arrakis and is confronted by a vengeful Griffin Harkonnen, Abulurd&#x27;s grandson, whose family ekes out a meager existence but hopes to improve its fortunes. Vorian and Griffin reconcile, but Griffin is later killed by the assassins Hyla and Andros, Vorian&#x27;s twin half-siblings who are still loyal to the vanquished thinking machines. Vorian sends a message of condolence to Griffin&#x27;s sister, Valya Harkonnen, who spurns the offer and plans her own revenge. In &quot;Mentats of Dune&quot; (2014), Vorian is wracked with guilt over Griffin&#x27;s death, and tries to help his struggling family with a secret infusion of funds to their whaling business on Lankiveil. On Caladan, Vorian&#x27;s descendant Orry Atreides is murdered on his wedding night by his new bride, who is secretly Tula Harkonnen, Griffin and Valya&#x27;s younger sister. Vorian and Orry&#x27;s brother, Willem, confront Valya and a remorseful Tula in &quot;Navigators of Dune&quot; (2016). Willem spares Tula&#x27;s life when he learns that she is pregnant with Orry&#x27;s child. Valya believes Vorian is dead when his ship explodes, but he survives.

==== Iblis Ginjo ====
Iblis Ginjo is a human trustee, the enslaved head of a legion of other slaves, for the thinking machines in &quot;Dune: The Butlerian Jihad&quot;. Initially loyal to machine leader Omnius and hoping to eventually secure his immortality by becoming a cymek, Ginjo is manipulated into fostering ideas of rebellion as part of a psychological experiment by the independent robot Erasmus. Ginjo begins to see the extent to which the thinking machines do not value human life, and when Erasmus murders the child of human captive Serena Butler, Ginjo spurs the slaves to revolt. He flees with Serena and fellow disillusioned trustee Vorian Atreides. In &quot;Dune: The Machine Crusade&quot;, Ginjo (now Grand Patriarch of the Holy Jihad) and Serena (Priestess of the Jihad) have become the religious leaders of the human rebellion, now known as the Butlerian Jihad, with Vorian and Xavier Harkonnen as its two generals. Ginjo marries noblewoman Camie Boro, and fathers a daughter, Ticia Cenva with Zufa Cenva, the powerful leader of the telekinetic Sorceresses of Rossak. Serena is named interim Viceroy upon her father&#x27;s retirement, but is later relegated to a figurehead by Ginjo as he consolidates his power.

The humans begin to tire of war, but Serena and Ginjo know that true peace is not possible, and that the thinking machines must be destroyed. Serena visits Omnius as an emissary of the Jihad under the pretense of negotiating peace, but secretly intends to provoke Omnius into killing her, thereby making her a martyr and reenergizing the Jihad. Although Erasmus stops Omnius from murdering Serena, one of her Seraphim bodyguards, on orders from Ginjo, kills her instead. Ginjo manufactures images of Serena being tortured at length and murdered by the thinking machines, silencing anti-war dissenters and galvanizing the Jihad back into action. As the war against the thinking machines continues, Ginjo becomes more and more corrupt, and focused more on his own power and legacy. He creates the Jipol (Jihad Police) to eliminate his political enemies, and orders organ raids on other League Worlds, casting blame on the thinking machines, to meet the demand for replacement human organs for injured Jihad troops. When Xavier realizes the extent of Ginjo&#x27;s corruption, he sacrifices his own life and reputation by steering the ship carrying himself and Ginjo into a sun. His secrets dying with him, Ginjo becomes a martyred saint, and Xavier a traitor to humanity.

==== Norma Cenva ====
Norma Cenva is the inventor of foldspace technology, first mentioned in &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;. In the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; trilogy, she is the daughter of Zufa Cenva, the powerful leader of the telekinetic Sorceresses of Rossak. Norma is short and unattractive as compared to her tall, beautiful mother, and though her lack of telekinetic abilities disappoints Zufa, Norma is a mathematical genius who is excited to assist the famed Tio Holtzman, discoverer of the Holtzman effect, which makes Holtzman shields possible. These force shields, capable of scrambling the gel-circuitry of thinking machines, are employed in &quot;Dune: The Butlerian Jihad&quot; to protect entire planets from invasion. However, the machines soon realize that their human-machine hybrid cymeks can slip through the field to destroy the transmitters because they possessed human brains which were unaffected by the scrambler fields. Norma then has the idea to use the field as an offensive weapon, projecting it with portable transmitters to knock out machines and their installations. During this time, she also uses the Holtzman effect to invent suspensors and glowglobes, for which Holtzman takes credit.

In &quot;Dune: The Machine Crusade&quot;, Holtzman calculates that the field could be modified to prevent penetration from physical projectiles, and Norma agrees, correcting the flaws in his concept but noting that objects could still pass through the shield at a slow enough speed. She also predicts that when hit by a laser, the shield would react violently, resulting in an explosion with the same effect as a nuclear weapon. Norma next studies Holtzman&#x27;s original field equations to find a way to fold space, soon inventing the theory of space-folding and building a prototype space-folding ship. She is sent away by Holtzman, who is threatened by her genius, shortly before he is killed by an explosive lasgun-shield interaction during a slave revolt. Norma&#x27;s ship is then used to fold space successfully by Zensunni slaves fleeing the violent rebellion. 

Norma is captured and tortured by the Titan Xerxes in &quot;Dune: The Battle of Corrin&quot;, which unleashes her latent psychic abilities. She destroys Xerxes and six cymeks, and then uses these powers to rework her own body into a more beautiful, appealing one based on the many women of her ancestry. The next year she and her mother&#x27;s former lover, industrialist Aurelius Venport, establish a shipyard on Kolhar to produce space-folding ships, which will come to be known as heighliners. Ever uncaring about her own fame, Norma credits the invention to Aurelius as a gift to him. Aurelius puts the space-folding technology and shipyards at the disposal of the Jihad forces. Initially, navigation for foldspace travel is fundamentally inexact, and only about nine out of every ten heighliners arrive at their intended destination safety. Realizing that the spice melange amplifies her psychic and calculative abilities, Norma pioneers the use of massive concentrated doses to employ prescience to safely navigate foldspace. Aurelius and Norma&#x27;s son, Adrien Venport, establishes the Foldspace Shipping Company, and finds the first ten volunteers to undergo, like Norma before them, the process to become Navigators. The Foldspace Shipping Company later becomes the Spacing Guild, monopolizing space commerce, transport, and interplanetary banking.

In the &quot;Great Schools of Dune&quot; trilogy, the highly evolved Norma periodically advises her great-grandson, Josef Venport, a ruthless businessman and the head of Venport Holdings. Her prescience allows her to envision long-term plans for her Navigators, and she manipulates Josef into evolving the company toward her goals. She is also able to fold space without a Holtzman drive. When Josef assassinates Emperor Salvador Corrino to protect his business interests, Norma intervenes to protect Josef from the wrath of Salvador&#x27;s brother and successor, Roderick. She eventually negotiates with Roderick: Norma will leave Josef and his research facility unprotected against Roderick&#x27;s avenging forces in exchange for sparing all current and future Navigators, the creation of an independent Spacing Guild and a guarantee that the flow of spice will continue. He agrees, but Norma saves Josef&#x27;s life by beginning the process of making him a Navigator, exploiting the loophole she created in her deal with Roderick.

Norma reappears as the Oracle of Time in the sequel novels &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, which conclude the original series. She warns the Guild Navigators that the &quot;final battle&quot; is upon them, and they must locate the wandering no-ship &quot;Ithaca&quot;, which is fleeing both the Bene Gesserit and the mysterious observers Daniel and Marty. The ship contains the ultimate Kwisatz Haderach, whom both sides in the great war between humanity and thinking machines want for their victory. Daniel and Marty are in fact reincarnations of thinking machine leaders Omnius and Erasmus, poised to finally conquer humanity and seize control of the universe. In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, the Spacing Guild has begun replacing its Navigators with Ixian navigation devices at the prompting of Face Dancer infiltrators with their own plot to take over the universe. Their supply of melange cut off, the obsolete Navigators are dying one by one. As Navigator Edrik pursues alternate sources of the spice, he and the remaining Navigators seek the Oracle&#x27;s assistance, but she is occupied with finding the &quot;Ithaca&quot;. As the forces of humanity make a last stand against the thinking machine forces and the ultimate Kwisatz Haderach, Duncan Idaho, faces Omnius, the Oracle gathers the last of the Navigators. The weaponry and navigation of the human ships fail due to Face Dancer manipulations, but the Navigators intervene and are able to hold back the first wave of the machine attack. The Oracle emerges on the capital of the new Synchronized Empire, and takes all traces of Omnius with her to an alternate dimension. This paves the way for Duncan to bridge the gap between the humans and machines and guide the two into a peaceful coexistence.

==== Raquella Berto-Anirul ====
Raquella Berto-Anirul is the founder of the Bene Gesserit, and the granddaughter of Vorian Atreides. In &quot;Dune: The Battle of Corrin&quot;, Raquella and fellow doctor Mohandas Suk assist the Sorceresses of Rossak with a new outbreak of the plague deployed by the thinking machines to decimate humanity. After being infected herself, Raquella is miraculously cured by &quot;healing water&quot; found on the planet. Paranoid and fearing the doctor might somehow usurp her power as leader of the Sorceresses, Ticia Cenva poisons Raquella with the Rossak drug. Raquella&#x27;s recovery has unlocked the genetic ability to render the poison harmless using her body chemistry, and she experiences the first iteration of what will ultimately be known as the spice agony. Raquella is awakened to her genetic memories, becoming the first Reverend Mother. Soon she also discovers the new ability to command others with Voice. Raquella conceives a daughter with Suk, but remains on Rossak to continue her work as he pursues his goal to form the greatest medical school ever seen (later known as the Suk School). Ticia dies, and Raquella assumes authority over the Sorceresses and their breeding programs, forming the Sisterhood.

In &quot;Sisterhood of Dune&quot;, Raquella thwarts Butlerian sympathizers within her own ranks, including her own granddaughter, Dorotea. They correctly suspect that Raquella and her inner circle, including Valya Harkonnen, are using forbidden computers to manage their breeding index, which contains an immense amount of family data from across the Imperium. Dorotea takes the Rossak drug, and survives to become the second Reverend Mother. She learns of the secret computers and alerts Emperor Salvador Corrino, who invades Rossak. Raquella and Valya remove the computers in advance, but a petulant Salvador disbands the Sisterhood School on Rossak. Dorotea establishes an Orthodox Sisterhood sanctioned by Salvador, and Raquella and her followers find refuge on Wallach IX. Valya becomes the third Reverend Mother. In &quot;Mentats of Dune&quot;, Raquella believes that the only hope for the Sisterhood to survive is for the Wallach IX sisters to reconcile with Dorotea&#x27;s Orthodox faction. Her health failing, Raquella summons Dorotea and forces her and Valya to put their differences aside and agree to work together for the good of the Sisterhood. Naming them co-leaders, Raquella dies. Valya however, still bitter about Dorotea&#x27;s betrayal, uses her newly discovered power of Voice to force Dorotea to commit suicide. Valya declares herself to be the sole Mother Superior, and ingratiates herself to the new Emperor, Salvador&#x27;s brother Roderick.

Raquella is portrayed by Cathy Tyson in the 2024 HBO television series &quot;&quot;. As the founder and leader of the Sisterhood, she has created a network of influence by placing her Truthsayers, loyal to the Sisterhood, as trusted advisors to the Great Houses. Raquella has also initiated a secret breeding program intended to guide noble bloodlines to cultivate better, more easily controlled leaders. In &quot;The Hidden Hand&quot;, a dying Raquella tells young Valya Harkonnen that she must grow, protect and strengthen the Sisterhood, and that Valya &quot;will be the one to see the burning truth, and know.&quot; Raquella&#x27;s granddaughter Dorotea intends to destroy the breeding program as something heretical and impure, so Valya uses the Voice to force Dorotea to kill herself. Thirty years later, Valya is Mother Superior and has grown the Sisterhood in size and power, but her carefully orchestrated plans are thwarted by mysterious Imperial soldier Desmond Hart, who perceives the Sisterhood as a growing threat to the autonomy of the Imperium. Desmond uses a &quot;great power&quot; granted to him by his near-death experience on Arrakis to psychically immolate Imperial Truthsayer Kasha Jinjo, whose burned body reminds Valya of Raquella&#x27;s dying prediction.

In &quot;Two Wolves&quot;, Sister Lila is revealed to be Raquella&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter. With the Sisterhood desperate for more information about the dangerous prophecy which is now unfolding, Lila undergoes the dangerous Agony ritual to unlock her Other Memory and access Raquella&#x27;s consciousness. Raquella speaks through her, providing more details about the prophecy that point to Desmond as the key to a coming reckoning. &quot;Sisterhood Above All&quot; depicts Raquella meeting and taking Valya under her wing, eventually sharing with her the secret of the forbidden technology used to maintain her vast DNA database. Recognizing that her life is waning, Raquella intends to put Valya and Dorotea through the Agony to succeed her as leaders of the Sisterhood. Valya at first refuses, and Raquella issues the ultimatum that she take care of her family issues and return as a Reverend Mother, or not at all. Once Valya is sure that her brother Griffin&#x27;s death has been avenged, she self-administers the Rossak drug and survives.

Doria is an ambitious Honored Matre who reluctantly joins the Bene Gesserit as Murbella hopes to unite the opposing factions in &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;. Though Doria seeks to learn the impressive skills of the Bene Gesserit, her Honored Matre impulsiveness and resistance to authority are difficult to shake. A chief advisor to Murbella, Doria is one of the few assimilated Honored Matres with access to sensitive Bene Gesserit breeding records. Doria and Bellonda are on opposite sides from the beginning. Hoping to force them to at least respect each other&#x27;s differences, Murbella makes them partners managing the spice operations on Chapterhouse. Years later, Doria kills Bellonda in a final confrontation. An outraged Murbella forces Doria to share minds with Bellonda, and makes her the sole Spice Operations Director. Six years later, driven to the brink of insanity by Bellonda&#x27;s incessant chatter within her mind, Doria is devoured by a sandworm.

==== Hellica ====
Hellica is the self-declared Matre Superior of the largest renegade Honored Matre force, based on the conquered planet Tleilax in the former capital Bandalong. In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, Hellica forces captive Lost Tleilaxu Uxtal to employ the secret of the Tleilaxu axlotl tanks to produce increased quantities of the orange spice substitute used by the Honored Matres. When Guild Navigator Edrik seeks Uxtal&#x27;s knowledge of producing melange in the tanks, Hellica&#x27;s price for his expertise is Edrik&#x27;s help transporting a certain cargo. He agrees, delivering by heighliner the Obliterators that destroy the planet Richese, where the Bene Gesserit are mass-producing weapons and armed battleships. Later, Hellica attempts an Obliterator attack on Chapterhouse itself, but the plan fails. Murbella&#x27;s forces conquer Tleilax, and Hellica is killed, but Murbella realizes that the Matre Superior and some of her elite guard had actually been Face Dancer duplicates.

==== Other ====

In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot;, Rinya and Janess are prodigies: ambitious, impatient, and unquestionably talented, but Janess possesses just a hint more caution.

Rinya always has to be first for everything, and she demands to be allowed to undergo the spice agony, wanting to become a Reverend Mother at the age of 14, just like Sheeana had done.

Rinya always has to be first for everything, and she demands to be allowed to undergo the spice agony, wanting to become a Reverend Mother at the age of 14, just like Sheeana had done. Though Janess tries to stop the ritual, Rinya insists, and dies in the ordeal. Janess later undergoes the agony herself at age 17, and is successful. Ranked as a lieutenant in the forces of the combined Bene Gesserit/Honored Matre New Sisterhood, her first military assignment is to exterminate a renegade Honored Matre group who control a portion of the planet Gammu.

=== Introduced in &quot;Great Schools of Dune&quot; (2012–2016) ===
==== Valya Harkonnen ====

Valya Harkonnen and her brother Griffin are the newest generation of a once-mighty family who were brought to ruin, and exiled to the ice planet Lankiveil. Their ambition is to both reclaim their family&#x27;s rightful place, and avenge themselves on the Atreides, who caused their downfall. In the &quot;Great Schools of Dune&quot; series, Valya plots to rise within, and ultimately take control of, the fledgling Bene Gesserit, while galvanizing her siblings to help her visit Harkonnen vengeance on the bloodline of Vorian Atreides.

Emily Watson portrays Valya in the 2024 HBO series &quot;&quot;, and Jessica Barden plays a younger version of the character in flashbacks.

==== Griffin Harkonnen ====
Griffin Harkonnen is a young nobleman hoping to restore his family&#x27;s fortunes through service to the Landsraad. In &quot;Sisterhood of Dune&quot; (2012), his sister Valya learns that the man to blame for the downfall of the Harkonnens decades before, Vorian Atreides, has been made seemingly immortal by the thinking machines and is still alive. Bent on revenge, Griffin tracks Vorian to the desert planet Arrakis. Vorian saves Griffin from a giant sandworm, and Griffin subsequently defeats Vorian in a duel, but spares his life. Though they come to an understanding to end the Atreides-Harkonnen feud, Griffin is executed by Vorian&#x27;s sister Hyla, an assassin loyal to the vanquished thinking machines. Vorian returns Griffin&#x27;s body to Lankiveil with a letter of condolence, and Valya refuses to believe he did not kill her brother himself.

Earl Cave portrays Griffin in the 2024 HBO series &quot;Dune: Prophecy&quot;. In the episode &quot;Sisterhood Above All&quot;, Griffin shares Valya&#x27;s desire to regain their family&#x27;s status, and seeks to advance in the Landsraad. He is later killed, and though Valya curses that he was murdered by Vorian Atreides, the elder Harkonnens blame Valya.

==== Dorotea ====
Dorotea is Valya Harkonnen&#x27;s nemesis and the leader of an anti-technology faction within the Sisterhood. In &quot;Sisterhood of Dune&quot;, Valya is a trusted aide to Mother Superior Raquella Berto-Anirul, who has shared with Valya the secret that she has flouted the Butlerian prohibitions on thinking machines by using computers to maintain the extensive records of the Sisterhood&#x27;s breeding program. Dorotea, a Butlerian sympathizer and Raquella&#x27;s granddaughter, discovers the existence of the computers and reports it to Emperor Salvador Corrino. Valya helps Raquella remove them in advance of the Emperor&#x27;s invasion, but a petulant Salvador disbands the Sisterhood School on Rossak. Dorotea returns to the capital world of Salusa Secundus with the Emperor as his Truthsayer, and forms an orthodox faction of sisters. In &quot;Mentats of Dune&quot; (2014), Valya retrieves the hidden computers from Rossak and hopes to succeed Raquella as Mother Superior. Nearing the end of her life, Raquella believes that the only hope for the Sisterhood to survive is for the Wallach IX sisters to reconcile with Dorotea&#x27;s faction. She forces Valya and Dorotea to put their differences aside and agree to work together for the good of the Sisterhood. Naming them co-leaders, Raquella dies. Valya however, still bitter about Dorotea&#x27;s betrayal, has recently mastered the Voice, and uses it to force Dorotea to commit suicide. 

Dorotea is portrayed by Camilla Beeput in the 2024 HBO television series &quot;Dune: Prophecy&quot;. She is young Valya Harkonnen&#x27;s rival in the Sisterhood, and the granddaughter and heir apparent of Mother Superior Raquella. Dorotea is described as &quot;pious and determined to return the Sisterhood to what she believes are its core values.&quot; In &quot;The Hidden Hand&quot;, Dorotea and Valya are at a dying Raquella&#x27;s bedside to hear her final words, urging them to &quot;use every tool&quot; to grow, protect and strengthen the Sisterhood after her death. Valya urges the gathered Sisters to carry on Raquella&#x27;s legacy by expanding their reach and influence, and by pushing the boundaries of their abilities. Dorotea, however, preaches humility, and indirect power. Raquella has devised a secret breeding program, intended to guide noble bloodlines to cultivate better, more easily controlled leaders. With Raquella dead, Dorotea rushes to destroy it, believing it to be sinful. Valya uses the Voice to stop her, and when Dorotea refuses to bend to Valya&#x27;s will, she commands Dorotea to commit suicide.

In &quot;Two Wolves&quot;, Sister Lila is revealed to be Dorotea&#x27;s granddaughter. With the Sisterhood desperate for more information about the dangerous prophecy which is now unfolding, Lila undergoes the dangerous Agony ritual to unlock her Other Memory and access Raquella&#x27;s consciousness. Raquella speaks through her, but then the vengeful persona of Dorotea overwhelms Lila, who appears to die. &quot;Sisterhood Above All&quot; depicts Dorotea looking on as Raquella meets and takes Valya under her wing. Recognizing that her life is waning, Raquella intends to put Valya and Dorotea through the Agony to succeed her as leaders of the Sisterhood. Valya at first refuses, while Dorotea accepts and survives the ordeal.

==== Tula Harkonnen ====
Tula Harkonnen is the youngest Harkonnen sibling, and has been groomed to share Valya and Griffin&#x27;s hatred for the Atreides, and desire for revenge against them. In &quot;Mentats of Dune&quot;, she has joined the Sisterhood, and dutifully follows Valya&#x27;s instructions to marry young Orry Atreides, and murder him on their wedding night. Tula is overcome with guilt over Orry in &quot;Navigators of Dune&quot; (2016), and Orry&#x27;s vengeful brother, Willem Atreides, spares her life when she reveals that she is pregnant with Orry&#x27;s child.

<text>Baron Vladimir Harkonnen () is a fictional character in the &quot;Dune&quot; franchise created by Frank Herbert. He is primarily featured in the 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot; and is also a prominent character in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (1999–2001) by Herbert&#x27;s son Brian and Kevin J. Anderson. The character is brought back as a ghola in the Herbert/Anderson sequels which conclude the original series, &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007).

Baron Harkonnen is portrayed by Kenneth McMillan in David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;. Ian McNeice plays the role in the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; and its sequel, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Children of Dune&quot;. Harkonnen is portrayed by Stellan Skarsgård in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film &quot;Dune&quot; and its 2024 sequel &quot;&quot;.

==Conception==
Frank Herbert wanted a harsh-sounding name for the antagonistic family opposing House Atreides in &quot;Dune&quot;. He came across the name &quot;Härkönen&quot; in a California telephone book and thought that it sounded &quot;Soviet&quot;, though it is in fact Finnish. In earlier drafts of &quot;Dune&quot;, the character was called &quot;Valdemar Hoskanner&quot;.

==Description==
Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Appendix IV: The Almanak en-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses)&quot; in &quot;Dune&quot; says of Harkonnen (in part):
The character is usually described as the main antagonist of the novel. Herbert writes in &quot;Dune&quot; that the Baron possesses a &quot;basso voice&quot; and is so &quot;grossly and immensely fat&quot; that he requires anti-gravity devices known as suspensors to support his weight. He is one of the wealthiest members of the Landsraad and a bitter rival of Leto Atreides, and the Baron&#x27;s &quot;legendary evil and intellect&quot; are unmatched by anyone else from House Harkonnen. In the novel, the Baron feigns outrage over losing control of Arrakis to Leto, but is actually conspiring to use the situation as an opportunity to destroy House Atreides once and for all. 

William Hughes of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; describes the Baron as &quot;a decadent, monstrous gasbag of depravity and evil&quot;. As ruthless and cruel as he is intelligent and cunning, the Baron is &quot;crafty and power-hungry&quot; and has a talent for manipulating others and exploiting their weaknesses as well as a propensity for torture and blackmail. &quot;IGN&quot; describes the character as &quot;cruel, sadistic, and hedonistic&quot;. Travis Johnson of Flicks.com.au says that Harkonnen is written as &quot;a predatory homosexual given to pederasty and incest, an unrepentant rapist and murderer.&quot; The Baron&#x27;s sexual preference for young men is implied in &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot;. It is noted, however, that he &quot;once permitted himself to be seduced&quot; by a Bene Gesserit in the liaison which produced his secret daughter.

== Plotlines ==
=== &quot;Dune&quot; ===
As &quot;Dune&quot; begins, a longstanding feud exists between the Harkonnens of Giedi Prime and the Atreides of Caladan. The Baron&#x27;s intent to exterminate the Atreides line seems close to fruition, as Duke Leto Atreides is lured to the desert planet Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the valuable melange operation there. The Baron has an agent in the Atreides household: Leto&#x27;s own physician, the trusted Suk doctor Wellington Yueh. Though Suk Imperial Conditioning supposedly makes the subject incapable of inflicting harm, the Baron&#x27;s twisted Mentat Piter De Vries has managed to break it using the threat of interminable torture on Yueh&#x27;s captive wife Wanna. 

Harkonnen also distracts Leto&#x27;s Mentat Thufir Hawat from discovering Yueh by guiding Hawat toward another suspect: Leto&#x27;s Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, of whom Hawat is already distrustful. The Atreides are soon attacked by Harkonnen forces, secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial Sardaukar, as Yueh disables the protective shields around the Atreides palace on Arrakis. Yueh takes Leto prisoner as instructed, but provides him with a fake tooth filled with poisonous gas as a means to assassinate the Baron. De Vries kills Yueh, Leto and De Vries die from the gas, but Harkonnen survives. The Baron then manipulates Hawat into his service, by convincing Hawat that Jessica was the traitor and using Hawat&#x27;s desire for revenge on her and the Emperor as motivation to assist House Harkonnen.

Jessica flees into the desert with her and Leto&#x27;s son Paul Atreides, and both are presumed dead. Paul&#x27;s prescience helps him determine the identity of Jessica&#x27;s father, the &quot;maternal grandfather who cannot be named&quot;—the Baron himself. Over the next two years, Harkonnen learns that his nephews Glossu Rabban and Feyd-Rautha are conspiring against him to usurp his throne. He lets them continue to do so, reasoning that they have to somehow learn to organize a conspiracy. As punishment for a failed assassination attempt against him, Harkonnen forces Feyd to single-handedly slaughter all the female slaves who serve as Feyd&#x27;s lovers. He explains that Feyd has to learn the price of failure.

The Baron&#x27;s plan to assure Feyd&#x27;s power is to install him as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people. However, a crisis on Arrakis begins when the mysterious Muad&#x27;Dib emerges as a leader of the native Fremen tribes, uniting them against the rule of the Harkonnens. Eventually, a series of Fremen victories against Beast Rabban threaten to disrupt the trade of the spice, inciting the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to intervene personally, leading several legions of Sardaukar. After the emperor&#x27;s arrival on Arrakis, both Corrino and Harkonnen are shocked to learn that rather than a native Fremen warlord, their opponent Muad&#x27;Dib is the still-living Paul Atreides, and the Emperor&#x27;s intervention was part of his plan. 

The Imperial forces fall prey to a surprise attack by the Fremen, who let a sandstorm short out the force field shields of the transport ships, and then disable them with projectile weapons, subsequently mounting a mass assault using sandworms as siege-breakers. Their enemies are left trapped on the planet, outnumbered by the many tribes and outgunned by the sandworms. The Harkonnens&#x27; past ruthlessness further causes the enraged Fremen to give them little to no quarter. Over the course of the battle their entire army is exterminated.

The Harkonnen leadership are also all killed in the course of this battle. Rabban dies first, in the early stages of the battle. Baron Harkonnen himself is poisoned with a gom jabbar by Paul&#x27;s sister Alia Atreides, a two-year-old born as a fully aware Fremen Reverend Mother, who reveals that she is his granddaughter to him just before his death. His remaining heir Feyd-Rautha is killed in ritual combat by Paul Atreides. House Harkonnen as a political entity is left virtually defunct - permanently excluded from galactic power - though Harkonnen &quot;blood&quot; is technically ascendant since Imperial House Atreides is composed entirely of Vladimir Harkonnen&#x27;s descendants.

=== &quot;Children of Dune&quot; ===
Alia had been born with her ancestral memories in the womb, a circumstance the Bene Gesserit refer to as Abomination, because in their experience it is inevitable that the individual will become possessed by the personality of one of their ancestors. In &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Alia falls victim to this prediction when she shares control of her body with the ego-memory of the Baron Harkonnen, and eventually falls under his power. Alia eventually commits suicide, realizing that Harkonnen&#x27;s consciousness has surpassed her abilities to contain him.

=== &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; ===
In the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel series by Brian Herbert and Anderson, it is established that Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is the son and heir of Dmitri Harkonnen and his wife Victoria. Harkonnen&#x27;s father had been the head of House Harkonnen and ruled the planet Giedi Prime. Trained since youth as a possible successor, Vladimir had been eventually chosen over his half-brother Abulurd, namesake of the original. Unhappy with his brother&#x27;s doings, Abulurd eventually marries Emmi Rabban and renounces the family name and his rights to the title. 

Under the name Abulurd Rabban, he reigns as governor of the secondary Harkonnen planet Lankiveil. Abulurd and his wife have two sons: Glossu Rabban, later nicknamed &quot;Beast Rabban&quot; after he murders his own father, and Feyd-Rautha. Vladimir later adopts the boys back into House Harkonnen, and Feyd becomes his designated heir. The Baron&#x27;s most prominent political rival is Duke Leto Atreides. The Harkonnens and the Atreides have been bitter enemies for millennia, since the Battle of Corrin that ended the Butlerian Jihad. When Emperor Shaddam IV orchestrates a plot to destroy the &quot;Red Duke&quot; Leto, the Baron eagerly lends his aid.

The young Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is described as an exceedingly handsome man, possessing red hair and a near-perfect physique. The Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is instructed by the Sisterhood to collect his genetic material, through conception, for their breeding program. As the Baron&#x27;s homosexuality is something of an open secret, Mohiam blackmails him into having sexual relations with her, and conceives his child. When that daughter proves genetically undesirable, Mohiam kills her and returns to Harkonnen for a second try. At this point, he drugs and rapes her. She exacts her retribution by infecting him with a rare, incurable disease that later causes his obesity. Mohiam&#x27;s second child with the Baron is Jessica. 

In &quot;&quot;, the deteriorating Baron at first walks with the assistance of a cane, then relies on belt-mounted suspensors to retain mobility. He consults numerous doctors in the expanse of time between the &quot;&quot; and &quot;Dune: House Harkonnen&quot;, up to and including his future instrument Dr. Yueh, all of whom are ultimately no help. To conceal this debilitation, he pretends that his obesity is due to intentional overindulgence, lest the Landsraad remove him from power. When he determines that Mohiam inflicted him with the disease, he attempts to coerce her into revealing the cure, but soon discovers that there is none. The Baron, Duke Leto, and Jessica are unaware that Jessica is secretly the Baron&#x27;s daughter, or that he has even fathered one. In the year 10,176, the Baron&#x27;s grandson Paul is born to Leto and Jessica.

=== &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; ===
In &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006), the continuation of the original series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the Baron is resurrected as a ghola (5,029 years after the death of Alia) by the Lost Tleilaxu Uxtal, acting on orders from the Face Dancer Khrone. Khrone intends to use the Baron ghola to manipulate a ghola of Paul Atreides, named Paolo. Khrone tries various torture techniques for three years to awaken the 12-year-old Baron&#x27;s genetic memories; these methods fail due to the Baron&#x27;s sadomasochistic nature. Khrone is successful when he imprisons the Baron in a sensory deprivation tank for a prolonged period; the Baron&#x27;s memories of his former life return. The reincarnated Baron is soon haunted by the voice of Alia in his mind; the source of this inner Alia is never explained.

==In adaptations==

=== Cancelled 1970s film ===
In 1975, Orson Welles agreed to play the Baron in Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful adaptation. The film&#x27;s concept art by Jean &quot;Mœbius&quot; Giraud depicts the Baron, as well as Feyd-Rautha and Rabban, in multiple drag appearances. In the documentary &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot;, the director discussed the casting:

===1984 film===

Baron Harkonnen is portrayed by Kenneth McMillan in David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film. The obese and disheveled Baron is overtly unstable, and covered in oozing pustules. William Hughes of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; deemed McMillan&#x27;s facial prosthetics &quot;very memorable&quot;. Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; wrote that &quot;Lynch&#x27;s attempt is infamous for really leaning on [the] codified aspects of the Baron, to the point where his sore-ridden appearance has been called out as a likely connection to the AIDS epidemic, which was a prevalent health crisis while the film was in production.&quot; Travis Johnson of Flicks.com.au noted that the Lynch film embraced &quot;the archetype of the depraved gay sadist&quot;, which would not be acceptable in 2019. Asher-Perrin added, &quot;Lynch also makes a point of connecting the Baron&#x27;s desire for men to deviancy and violence, deliberately juxtaposing his assault of a young man with a tender love-scene between Duke Leto and Lady Jessica Atreides.&quot;

===2000 miniseries===

Ian McNeice plays the Baron in the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;, and its sequel, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Children of Dune&quot;. Asher-Perrin notes that the miniseries played down the negative aspects emphasized by the Lynch film, and writes, &quot;[The Baron&#x27;s] appearance was not altered to make him seem ill, he never physically attacks anyone, and the miniseries paid more attention to the fact that the Baron was a rapist, his preference for men being incidental.&quot; He praises McNeice as a standout among the cast, writing that he &quot;manages to make the Baron Harkonnen—easily one of the most despicable characters in science fiction literature—every bit as conniving and vicious as he needs to be...and every bit as fascinating. McNeice has a superb sense of how to make the baron mesmerizing to watch no matter how odiously he behaves&quot;. Austin Jones of &quot;Paste&quot; writes, &quot;McNeice commands his role as Baron Harkonnen, capturing the vile indulgence and vanity of a feudal lord&quot;.

===2021 and 2024 films===

Baron Harkonnen is portrayed by Stellan Skarsgård in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film &quot;Dune&quot; and its 2024 sequel &quot;&quot;. Skarsgård called the role &quot;small but important&quot;, and noted, &quot;I had seven hours in make-up every day because I had to be really fat.&quot; Villeneuve said:
==Merchandising and influence==
A line of &quot;Dune&quot; action figures from toy company LJN was released to lackluster sales in 1984. Styled after David Lynch&#x27;s film, the collection featured a figure of Baron Harkonnen, as well as other characters. In 2006, SOTA Toys produced a Baron Harkonnen action figure for their &quot;Now Playing Presents&quot; line.

H. R. Giger&#x27;s Harkonnen Chair is a chair originally designed by the artist as set dressing for an unrealized 1970s adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot; by Alejandro Jodorowsky.

==Analysis==
Thomas West of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; writes that &quot;there are few science fiction villains quite as compelling and darkly charismatic as the Baron&quot;. William Hughes of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; calls the Baron &quot;one of the most iconically awful villains in all of science fiction&quot;. Stuart Conover of ScienceFiction.com describes him as &quot;one of the most insidious villains&quot;. Maude Campbell of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; writes that the Baron is &quot;one of the most evil characters ever put to paper (including Darth Vader)&quot;, and Jon Michaud of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; compares &quot;Herbert&#x27;s scheming, backstabbing villain, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen&quot; to the villainous Lannister family of George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series. 

Emmet Asher-Perrin suggests that &quot;what makes the Baron truly monstrous [is] the fact that he spends all of his time plotting murder, sowing discord, and destroying populations of people to get his way&quot;. Hughes writes that the evil Harkonnen is &quot;specifically designed to make the noble Atreides family seem that extra bit more dignified and pure&quot;. Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; agrees that the Baron is &quot;as cruel and vindictive as Leto is noble and just.&quot; Hughes says that Herbert &quot;successfully made [the Baron] so vampirically vile that he casts a (sometimes literal) shadow over the entire series.&quot; Sandy Schaefer of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; calls the Baron &quot;a deliciously despicable antagonist&quot;.

While the novel suggests that the Baron&#x27;s obesity might be the result of a genetic disease, the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson explains that Harkonnen was once a fit, attractive but vain man who is given the incurable disease intentionally by the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam after he drugs and rapes her. Asher-Perrin suggests that in this narrative, &quot;The Baron&#x27;s corpulence is meant to be comeuppance for doing something reprehensible, a physical punishment meant to hurt his vanity by taking away the attractiveness he so prized in himself.&quot;

<text>Diffie–Hellman (DH) key exchange is a mathematical method of securely generating a symmetric cryptographic key over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as conceived by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography. Published in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman, this is the earliest publicly known work that proposed the idea of a private key and a corresponding public key.

Traditionally, secure encrypted communication between two parties required that they first exchange keys by some secure physical means, such as paper key lists transported by a trusted courier. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher.

Diffie–Hellman is used to secure a variety of Internet services. However, research published in October 2015 suggests that the parameters in use for many DH Internet applications at that time are not strong enough to prevent compromise by very well-funded attackers, such as the security services of some countries.

The scheme was published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976, but in 1997 it was revealed that James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm J. Williamson of GCHQ, the British signals intelligence agency, had previously shown in 1969 how public-key cryptography could be achieved.

Although Diffie–Hellman key exchange itself is a non-authenticated key-agreement protocol, it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols, and is used to provide forward secrecy in Transport Layer Security&#x27;s ephemeral modes (referred to as EDH or DHE depending on the cipher suite).

The method was followed shortly afterwards by RSA, an implementation of public-key cryptography using asymmetric algorithms.

Expired US patent 4200770 from 1977 describes the now public-domain algorithm. It credits Hellman, Diffie, and Merkle as inventors.

== Name ==
In 2006, Hellman suggested the algorithm be called Diffie–Hellman–Merkle key exchange in recognition of Ralph Merkle&#x27;s contribution to the invention of public-key cryptography (Hellman, 2006), writing:

== Description ==

=== General overview ===

Diffie–Hellman key exchange establishes a shared secret between two parties that can be used for secret communication for exchanging data over a public network. An analogy illustrates the concept of public key exchange by using colors instead of very large numbers:

The process begins by having the two parties, Alice and Bob, publicly agree on an arbitrary starting color that does not need to be kept secret. In this example, the color is yellow. Each person also selects a secret color that they keep to themselves – in this case, red and cyan. The crucial part of the process is that Alice and Bob each mix their own secret color together with their mutually shared color, resulting in orange-tan and light-blue mixtures respectively, and then publicly exchange the two mixed colors. Finally, each of them mixes the color they received from the partner with their own private color. The result is a final color mixture (yellow-brown in this case) that is identical to their partner&#x27;s final color mixture.

If a third party listened to the exchange, they would only know the common color (yellow) and the first mixed colors (orange-tan and light-blue), but it would be very hard for them to find out the final secret color (yellow-brown). Bringing the analogy back to a real-life exchange using large numbers rather than colors, this determination is computationally expensive. It is impossible to compute in a practical amount of time even for modern supercomputers.

=== Cryptographic explanation ===
The simplest and the original implementation, later formalized as Finite Field Diffie–Hellman in RFC 7919, of the protocol uses the multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;p&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; is prime, and &quot;g&quot; is a primitive root modulo &quot;p&quot;. To guard against potential vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use prime numbers of at least 2048 bits in length. This increases the difficulty for an adversary attempting to compute the discrete logarithm and compromise the shared secret. These two values are chosen in this way to ensure that the resulting shared secret can take on any value from 1 to . Here is an example of the protocol, with non-secret values in , and secret values in .
# Alice and Bob publicly agree to use a modulus &#x27; = and base &#x27; = (which is a primitive root modulo 23).
# Alice chooses a secret integer = 4, then sends Bob &#x27; = &quot;&quot; mod &#x27;
#* &#x27; = &#x27; mod = (in this example both &#x27; and &quot;&quot;&#x27; have the same value 4, but this is usually not the case) 
# Bob chooses a secret integer = 3, then sends Alice &#x27; = &quot;&quot; mod &#x27;
#* &#x27; = mod = 
# Alice computes = &quot;&quot; mod &quot;&quot;
#* = &#x27; mod = &#x27;
# Bob computes = &quot;&quot; mod &quot;&quot;
#* = &#x27; mod = &#x27;
# Alice and Bob now share a secret (the number 18).

Both Alice and Bob have arrived at the same values because under mod &quot;p&quot;,
: formula_1

More specifically,
: formula_2

Only &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are kept secret. All the other values – &quot;p&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;ga&quot; mod &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;gb&quot; mod &quot;p&quot; – are sent in the clear. The strength of the scheme comes from the fact that &quot;gab&quot; mod &quot;p&quot; = &quot;gba&quot; mod &quot;p&quot; take extremely long times to compute by any known algorithm just from the knowledge of &quot;p&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;ga&quot; mod &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;gb&quot; mod &quot;p&quot;. Such a function that is easy to compute but hard to invert is called a one-way function. Once Alice and Bob compute the shared secret they can use it as an encryption key, known only to them, for sending messages across the same open communications channel.

Of course, much larger values of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;p&quot; would be needed to make this example secure, since there are only 23 possible results of &quot;n&quot; mod 23. However, if &quot;p&quot; is a prime of at least 600 digits, then even the fastest modern computers using the fastest known algorithm cannot find &quot;a&quot; given only &quot;g&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;ga&quot; mod &quot;p&quot;. Such a problem is called the discrete logarithm problem. The computation of &quot;ga&quot; mod &quot;p&quot; is known as modular exponentiation and can be done efficiently even for large numbers.
Note that &quot;g&quot; need not be large at all, and in practice is usually a small integer (like 2, 3, ...).

=== Secrecy chart ===
The chart below depicts who knows what, again with non-secret values in , and secret values in . Here Eve is an eavesdropper – she watches what is sent between Alice and Bob, but she does not alter the contents of their communications.
* &quot;g&quot;, public (primitive root) base, known to Alice, Bob, and Eve. &quot;g&quot; = 5
* &quot;p&quot;, public (prime) modulus, known to Alice, Bob, and Eve. &quot;p&quot; = 23
* a, Alice&#x27;s private key, known only to Alice. a = 6
* b, Bob&#x27;s private key known only to Bob. b = 15
* &quot;A&quot;, Alice&#x27;s public key, known to Alice, Bob, and Eve. &quot;A&quot; = &quot;ga&quot; mod &quot;p&quot; = 8
* &quot;B&quot;, Bob&#x27;s public key, known to Alice, Bob, and Eve. &quot;B&quot; = &quot;gb&quot; mod &quot;p&quot; = 19

Now s is the shared secret key and it is known to both Alice and Bob, but &quot;not&quot; to Eve. Note that it is not helpful for Eve to compute &quot;AB&quot;, which equals &quot;g&quot;a+b mod p.

Note: It should be difficult for Alice to solve for Bob&#x27;s private key or for Bob to solve for Alice&#x27;s private key. If it is not difficult for Alice to solve for Bob&#x27;s private key (or vice versa), then an eavesdropper, Eve, may simply substitute her own private / public key pair, plug Bob&#x27;s public key into her private key, produce a fake shared secret key, and solve for Bob&#x27;s private key (and use that to solve for the shared secret key). Eve may attempt to choose a public / private key pair that will make it easy for her to solve for Bob&#x27;s private key.

=== Generalization to finite cyclic groups ===
Here is a more general description of the protocol:
# Alice and Bob agree on a natural number &quot;n&quot; and a generating element &quot;g&quot; in the finite cyclic group &quot;G&quot; of order &quot;n&quot;. (This is usually done long before the rest of the protocol; &quot;g&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are assumed to be known by all attackers.) The group &quot;G&quot; is written multiplicatively.
# Alice picks a random natural number &quot;a&quot; with 1 &lt; &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, and sends the element &quot;ga&quot; of &quot;G&quot; to Bob.
# Bob picks a random natural number &quot;b&quot; with 1 &lt; &quot;b&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, and sends the element &quot;gb&quot; of &quot;G&quot; to Alice.
# Alice computes the element of G.
# Bob computes the element of G.

Both Alice and Bob are now in possession of the group element &quot;gab&quot; = &quot;gba&quot;, which can serve as the shared secret key. The group &quot;G&quot; satisfies the requisite condition for secure communication as long as there is no efficient algorithm for determining &quot;gab&quot; given &quot;g&quot;, &quot;ga&quot;, and &quot;gb&quot;.

For example, the elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman protocol is a variant that represents an element of G as a point on an elliptic curve instead of as an integer modulo n. Variants using hyperelliptic curves have also been proposed. The supersingular isogeny key exchange is a Diffie–Hellman variant that was designed to be secure against quantum computers, but it was broken in July 2022.

== Ephemeral and/or static keys ==
The used keys can either be ephemeral or static (long term) key, but could even be mixed, so called semi-static DH. These variants have different properties and hence different use cases. An overview over many variants and some also discussions can for example be found in NIST SP 800-56A. A basic list:
# ephemeral, ephemeral: Usually used for key agreement. Provides forward secrecy, but no authenticity.
# static, static: Would generate a long term shared secret. Does not provide forward secrecy, but implicit authenticity. Since the keys are static it would for example not protect against replay-attacks.
# ephemeral, static: For example, used in ElGamal encryption or Integrated Encryption Scheme (IES). If used in key agreement it could provide implicit one-sided authenticity (the ephemeral side could verify the authenticity of the static side). No forward secrecy is provided.

It is possible to use ephemeral and static keys in one key agreement to provide more security as for example shown in NIST SP 800-56A, but it is also possible to combine those in a single DH key exchange, which is then called triple DH (3-DH).

=== Triple Diffie–Hellman (3-DH) ===
In 1997 a kind of triple DH was proposed by Simon Blake-Wilson, Don Johnson, Alfred Menezes in 1997, which was improved by C. Kudla and K. G. Paterson in 2005 and shown to be secure.

The long term secret keys of Alice and Bob are denoted by &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; respectively, with public keys &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, as well as the ephemeral key pairs (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;X&quot;) and (&quot;y&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;). Then protocol is:

The long term public keys need to be transferred somehow. That can be done beforehand in a separate, trusted channel, or the public keys can be encrypted using some partial key agreement to preserve anonymity. For more of such details as well as other improvements like side channel protection or explicit key confirmation, as well as early messages and additional password authentication, see e.g. US patent &quot;Advanced modular handshake for key agreement and optional authentication&quot;.

=== Extended Triple Diffie–Hellman (X3DH) ===
X3DH was initially proposed as part of the Double Ratchet Algorithm used in the Signal Protocol. The protocol offers forward secrecy and cryptographic deniability. It operates on an elliptic curve.

The protocol uses five public keys. Alice has an identity key IKA and an ephemeral key EKA. Bob has an identity key IKB, a signed prekey SPKB, and a one-time prekey OPKB. Bob first publishes his three keys to a server, which Alice downloads and verifies the signature on. Alice then initiates the exchange to Bob. The OPK is optional.

== Operation with more than two parties ==
Diffie–Hellman key agreement is not limited to negotiating a key shared by only two participants. Any number of users can take part in an agreement by performing iterations of the agreement protocol and exchanging intermediate data (which does not itself need to be kept secret). For example, Alice, Bob, and Carol could participate in a Diffie–Hellman agreement as follows, with all operations taken to be modulo &quot;p&quot;:
# The parties agree on the algorithm parameters &quot;p&quot; and &quot;g&quot;.
# The parties generate their private keys, named &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;.
# Alice computes and sends it to Bob.
# Bob computes and sends it to Carol.
# Carol computes and uses it as her secret.
# Bob computes and sends it to Carol.
# Carol computes and sends it to Alice.
# Alice computes and uses it as her secret.
# Carol computes and sends it to Alice.
# Alice computes and sends it to Bob.
# Bob computes and uses it as his secret.

An eavesdropper has been able to see , , , , , and , but cannot use any combination of these to efficiently reproduce .

To extend this mechanism to larger groups, two basic principles must be followed:
* Starting with an &quot;empty&quot; key consisting only of &quot;g&quot;, the secret is made by raising the current value to every participant&#x27;s private exponent once, in any order (the first such exponentiation yields the participant&#x27;s own public key).
* Any intermediate value (having up to &quot;N&quot;−1 exponents applied, where &quot;N&quot; is the number of participants in the group) may be revealed publicly, but the final value (having had all &quot;N&quot; exponents applied) constitutes the shared secret and hence must never be revealed publicly. Thus, each user must obtain their copy of the secret by applying their own private key last (otherwise there would be no way for the last contributor to communicate the final key to its recipient, as that last contributor would have turned the key into the very secret the group wished to protect).

These principles leave open various options for choosing in which order participants contribute to keys. The simplest and most obvious solution is to arrange the &quot;N&quot; participants in a circle and have &quot;N&quot; keys rotate around the circle, until eventually every key has been contributed to by all &quot;N&quot; participants (ending with its owner) and each participant has contributed to &quot;N&quot; keys (ending with their own). However, this requires that every participant perform &quot;N&quot; modular exponentiations.

By choosing a more desirable order, and relying on the fact that keys can be duplicated, it is possible to reduce the number of modular exponentiations performed by each participant to using a divide-and-conquer-style approach, given here for eight participants:
# Participants A, B, C, and D each perform one exponentiation, yielding ; this value is sent to E, F, G, and H. In return, participants A, B, C, and D receive .
# Participants A and B each perform one exponentiation, yielding , which they send to C and D, while C and D do the same, yielding , which they send to A and B.
# Participant A performs an exponentiation, yielding , which it sends to B; similarly, B sends to A. C and D do similarly.
# Participant A performs one final exponentiation, yielding the secret = , while B does the same to get = ; again, C and D do similarly.
# Participants E through H simultaneously perform the same operations using as their starting point.

Once this operation has been completed all participants will possess the secret , but each participant will have performed only four modular exponentiations, rather than the eight implied by a simple circular arrangement.

== Security and practical considerations ==
The protocol is considered secure against eavesdroppers if &quot;G&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are chosen properly. In particular, the order of the group G must be large, particularly if the same group is used for large amounts of traffic. The eavesdropper has to solve the Diffie–Hellman problem to obtain &quot;g&quot;&quot;ab&quot;. This is currently considered difficult for groups whose order is large enough. An efficient algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem would make it easy to compute &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; and solve the Diffie–Hellman problem, making this and many other public key cryptosystems insecure. Fields of small characteristic may be less secure.

The order of &quot;G&quot; should have a large prime factor to prevent use of the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm to obtain &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;. For this reason, a Sophie Germain prime &quot;q&quot; is sometimes used to calculate , called a safe prime, since the order of &quot;G&quot; is then only divisible by 2 and &quot;q&quot;. Sometimes &quot;g&quot; is chosen to generate the order &quot;q&quot; subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, rather than &quot;G&quot;, so that the Legendre symbol of &quot;ga&quot; never reveals the low order bit of &quot;a&quot;. A protocol using such a choice is for example IKEv2.

The generator &quot;g&quot; is often a small integer such as 2. Because of the random self-reducibility of the discrete logarithm problem a small &quot;g&quot; is equally secure as any other generator of the same group.

If Alice and Bob use random number generators whose outputs are not completely random and can be predicted to some extent, then it is much easier to eavesdrop.

In the original description, the Diffie–Hellman exchange by itself does not provide authentication of the communicating parties and can be vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.
Mallory (an active attacker executing the man-in-the-middle attack) may establish two distinct key exchanges, one with Alice and the other with Bob, effectively masquerading as Alice to Bob, and vice versa, allowing her to decrypt, then re-encrypt, the messages passed between them. Note that Mallory must be in the middle from the beginning and continuing to be so, actively decrypting and re-encrypting messages every time Alice and Bob communicate. If she arrives after the keys have been generated and the encrypted conversation between Alice and Bob has already begun, the attack cannot succeed. If she is ever absent, her previous presence is then revealed to Alice and Bob. They will know that all of their private conversations had been intercepted and decoded by someone in the channel. In most cases it will not help them get Mallory&#x27;s private key, even if she used the same key for both exchanges.

A method to authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack. Variants of Diffie–Hellman, such as STS protocol, may be used instead to avoid these types of attacks.

=== Denial-of-service attack ===

A CVE released in 2021 (&quot;CVE-2002-20001&quot;) disclosed a denial-of-service attack (DoS) against the protocol variants use ephemeral keys, called D(HE)at attack. The attack exploits that the Diffie–Hellman key exchange allows attackers to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not public keys, triggering expensive modular exponentiation calculations on the victim&#x27;s side. Another CVEs released disclosed that the Diffie–Hellman key exchange implementations may use long private exponents (&quot;CVE-2022-40735&quot;) that arguably make modular exponentiation calculations unnecessarily expensive or may unnecessary check peer&#x27;s public key (&quot;CVE-2024-41996&quot;) has similar resource requirement as key calculation using a long exponent. An attacker can exploit both vulnerabilities together.

=== Practical attacks on Internet traffic ===
The number field sieve algorithm, which is generally the most effective in solving the discrete logarithm problem, consists of four computational steps. The first three steps only depend on the order of the group G, not on the specific number whose finite log is desired. It turns out that much Internet traffic uses one of a handful of groups that are of order 1024 bits or less. By precomputing the first three steps of the number field sieve for the most common groups, an attacker need only carry out the last step, which is much less computationally expensive than the first three steps, to obtain a specific logarithm. The Logjam attack used this vulnerability to compromise a variety of Internet services that allowed the use of groups whose order was a 512-bit prime number, so called export grade. The authors needed several thousand CPU cores for a week to precompute data for a single 512-bit prime. Once that was done, individual logarithms could be solved in about a minute using two 18-core Intel Xeon CPUs.

As estimated by the authors behind the Logjam attack, the much more difficult precomputation needed to solve the discrete log problem for a 1024-bit prime would cost on the order of $100 million, well within the budget of a large national intelligence agency such as the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The Logjam authors speculate that precomputation against widely reused 1024-bit DH primes is behind claims in leaked NSA documents that NSA is able to break much of current cryptography.

To avoid these vulnerabilities, the Logjam authors recommend use of elliptic curve cryptography, for which no similar attack is known. Failing that, they recommend that the order, &quot;p&quot;, of the Diffie–Hellman group should be at least 2048 bits. They estimate that the pre-computation required for a 2048-bit prime is 109 times more difficult than for 1024-bit primes.

=== Security against quantum computers ===
Quantum computers can break public-key cryptographic schemes, such as RSA, finite-field DH and elliptic-curve DH key-exchange protocols, using Shor&#x27;s algorithm for solving the factoring problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the period-finding problem. A post-quantum variant of Diffie-Hellman algorithm was proposed in 2023, and relies on a combination of the quantum-resistant CRYSTALS-Kyber protocol, as well as the old elliptic curve X25519 protocol. A quantum Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol that relies on a quantum one-way function, and its security relies on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics has also been proposed in the literature.

== Other uses ==

=== Encryption ===
Public key encryption schemes based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange have been proposed. The first such scheme is the ElGamal encryption. A more modern variant is the Integrated Encryption Scheme.

=== Forward secrecy ===
Protocols that achieve forward secrecy generate new key pairs for each session and discard them at the end of the session. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange is a frequent choice for such protocols, because of its fast key generation.

=== Password-authenticated key agreement ===
When Alice and Bob share a password, they may use a password-authenticated key agreement (PK) form of Diffie–Hellman to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. One simple scheme is to compare the hash of s concatenated with the password calculated independently on both ends of channel. A feature of these schemes is that an attacker can only test one specific password on each iteration with the other party, and so the system provides good security with relatively weak passwords. This approach is described in ITU-T Recommendation X.1035, which is used by the G.hn home networking standard.

An example of such a protocol is the Secure Remote Password protocol.

=== Public key ===
It is also possible to use Diffie–Hellman as part of a public key infrastructure, allowing Bob to encrypt a message so that only Alice will be able to decrypt it, with no prior communication between them other than Bob having trusted knowledge of Alice&#x27;s public key. Alice&#x27;s public key is formula_3. To send her a message, Bob chooses a random &quot;b&quot; and then sends Alice formula_4 (unencrypted) together with the message encrypted with symmetric key formula_5. Only Alice can determine the symmetric key and hence decrypt the message because only she has &quot;a&quot; (the private key). A pre-shared public key also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

In practice, Diffie–Hellman is not used in this way, with RSA being the dominant public key algorithm. This is largely for historical and commercial reasons, namely that RSA Security created a certificate authority for key signing that became Verisign. Diffie–Hellman, as elaborated above, cannot directly be used to sign certificates. However, the ElGamal and DSA signature algorithms are mathematically related to it, as well as MQV, STS and the IKE component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications.

<text>Destry Rides Again is a 1939 American Western comedy film directed by George Marshall and starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart. The supporting cast includes Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, Brian Donlevy, Allen Jenkins, Irene Hervey, Billy Gilbert, Bill Cody Jr., Lillian Yarbo, and Una Merkel.

The opening credits list the story as &quot;Suggested by Max Brand&#x27;s novel &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;&quot;, but the movie is almost completely different. It also bears no resemblance to the 1932 adaptation of the novel starring Tom Mix, which is often retitled as &quot;Justice Rides Again&quot;.
In 1996, &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

Saloon owner Kent, the unscrupulous boss of the fictional Western town of Bottleneck, has the town&#x27;s sheriff, Mr. Keogh, killed when Keogh asks one too many questions about a rigged poker game. Kent and Frenchy, a cheap saloon tramp who is his girlfriend, now have a stranglehold over the local cattle ranchers. The town&#x27;s crooked mayor, Hiram J. Slade, who is in collusion with Kent, appoints the town drunk, Washington Dimsdale, as the new sheriff, assuming that he will be easy to control and manipulate. However, Dimsdale, a deputy under the famous lawman Tom Destry, promptly swears off drinking, and is able to call upon the latter&#x27;s equally formidable son, Tom Destry Jr., to help him make Bottleneck a lawful, respectable town.

Destry arrives in Bottleneck with Jack Tyndall, a cattleman, and his sister, Janice. Destry initially confounds the townsfolk by refusing to strap on a gun and maintaining civility in dealing with everyone, including Kent and Frenchy. This quickly makes him a disappointment to Dimsdale and a laughingstock to the townspeople; he is mockingly asked to &quot;clean up&quot; Bottleneck by being given a mop and bucket. However, after a number of rowdy horsemen ride into town shooting their pistols in the air, he demonstrates uncanny expertise in marksmanship and threatens to jail them if they do it again, earning the respect of Bottleneck&#x27;s citizens.

Through the townsmen&#x27;s evasive answers regarding the whereabouts of Keogh, Destry gradually begins to suspect that Keogh was murdered. He confirms this by provoking Frenchy into admitting it, but without a location for the body, he lacks any proof. Destry therefore deputizes Boris, a Russian immigrant whom Frenchy had earlier humiliated, and implies to Kent that he had found the body outside of town &quot;in remarkably good condition&quot;. When Kent sends a member of his gang to check on Keogh&#x27;s burial site, Boris and Dimsdale follow, capture, and jail him.

Although the gang member is charged with Keogh&#x27;s murder (in the hope that he would implicate Kent in exchange for clemency), Mayor Slade appoints himself judge of the trial, making an innocent verdict a foregone conclusion. To prevent this, Destry calls in a judge from a larger city in secret, but the plan is ruined after Boris accidentally gives away the other judge&#x27;s name in the saloon. Kent orders Frenchy to invite the deputy to her house while other gang members storm the sheriff&#x27;s office and cause a breakout; now in love with Destry, she accepts. When shots are fired, he rushes back, to find the cell empty and Dimsdale mortally wounded. Destry returns to his room and puts on his gun belt, abandoning his previous commitment to nonviolence.

Under Destry&#x27;s command, the honest townsmen form a posse and prepare to attack the saloon, where Kent&#x27;s gang is fortified, while Destry enters through the roof and looks for Kent. At Frenchy&#x27;s urging, the townswomen march in between the groups, preventing further violence, before breaking into the saloon and subduing the gang. Kent narrowly escapes, and attempts to shoot Destry from the second floor; Frenchy takes the bullet for him, killing her, and Destry kills Kent.

Some time later, Destry is shown to be the sheriff of a now lawful Bottleneck, repeating to children the stories that Dimsdale told him of the town&#x27;s violent history. He jokingly tells a story about marriage to Janice, implying a marriage between them will soon follow.

==Songs==
Dietrich sings &quot;See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got That Look&quot;, written by Frank Loesser, set to music by Frederick Hollander, which have become classics, as well as a revised version of Little Joe the Wrangler.

==Production==

Western writer Max Brand contributed the novel, &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;, but the film also owes its origins to Brand&#x27;s serial &quot;Twelve Peers&quot;, published in a pulp magazine. In the original work, Harrison (or &quot;Harry&quot;) Destry was not a pacifist. As filmed in 1932, with Tom Mix in the starring role, the central character differed in that Destry did wear six-guns.

The film was James Stewart&#x27;s first Western (he would not return to the genre until 1950, with &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot;, followed by &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;). The story featured a ferocious cat-fight between Marlene Dietrich and Una Merkel, which apparently caused a mild censorship problem at the time of release.
The film also represented Dietrich&#x27;s return to Hollywood after a string of flops at Paramount (&quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;The Scarlet Empress&quot;, &quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot;) caused her, and a number of other stars, to be labelled &quot;box office poison&quot;. While vacationing at Cap d&#x27;Antibes with her family, her mentor Josef von Sternberg and her lover Erich Maria Remarque, she received an offer from Joe Pasternak to come to Universal at half the salary she had been receiving for most of the 1930s. Pasternak had previously tried to sign Dietrich to Universal while she was still in Berlin. Unsure of what to do she was advised by von Sternberg &quot;I made you into a Goddess. Now show them you have feet of clay&quot;.

According to writer/director Peter Bogdanovich, Marlene Dietrich told him during an aircraft flight that she and James Stewart had an affair during shooting and that she became pregnant but had a surreptitious abortion without telling Stewart.

Internationally, the film was released under the alternative titles &quot;Femme ou Démon&quot; in French and &quot;Arizona&quot; in Spanish.

==Reception==
&quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; was generally well accepted by the public, as well as critics. It was reviewed by Frank S. Nugent in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who observed that the film did not follow the usual Hollywood type-casting. On Dietrich&#x27;s role, he characterized: &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to reconcile Miss Dietrich&#x27;s Frenchy, the cabaret girl of the Bloody Gulch Saloon, with the posed and posturing Dietrich we last saw in Mr. Lubitsch&#x27;s &#x27;Angel&#x27;.&quot; Stewart&#x27;s contribution was similarly treated, &quot;turning in an easy, likable, pleasantly humored performance.&quot;

==Other versions==
* Universal Pictures released an earlier film, also titled &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1932), directed by Benjamin Stoloff and starring Tom Mix and ZaSu Pitts. Apart from the title, the story has no connection with the later film and is sometimes retitled as &quot;Justice Rides Again&quot;.
* A Lux Radio Theater version of the story was aired November 5, 1945, starred Jimmy Stewart and Joan Blondell, and can be heard on YouTube.
* An almost shot-for-shot remake of the 1939 production, &quot;Destry&quot; (1954), was also directed by George Marshall and stars Audie Murphy and Thomas Mitchell.
* A Broadway musical version of the story, &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;, opened in New York City at the Imperial Theatre on April 23, 1959, and played 472 performances. Produced by David Merrick, the show had a book by Leonard Gershe, music and lyrics by Harold Rome, and starred Andy Griffith as Destry and Dolores Gray as Frenchy.
* ABC aired a short-lived television series in 1964, &quot;Destry&quot;, based on the 1939 and 1954 films, starring John Gavin as the son of the movie&#x27;s title character.

==In popular culture==
Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s character, Frenchy, was the inspiration for the character of Lili Von Shtupp in the Western parody &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;. In the movie, &quot;Drag Me To Hell&quot;, the film can be seen playing on a TV behind the counter at the pawn shop.

<text>In mathematics, the derivative is a fundamental tool that quantifies the sensitivity to change of a function&#x27;s output with respect to its input. The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the instantaneous rate of change, the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.

There are multiple different notations for differentiation. &quot;Leibniz notation&quot;, named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, is represented as the ratio of two differentials, whereas &quot;prime notation&quot; is written by adding a prime mark. Higher order notations represent repeated differentiation, and they are usually denoted in Leibniz notation by adding superscripts to the differentials, and in prime notation by adding additional prime marks. The higher order derivatives can be applied in physics; for example, while the first derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object&#x27;s velocity, how the position changes as time advances, the second derivative is the object&#x27;s acceleration, how the velocity changes as time advances.

Derivatives can be generalized to functions of several real variables. In this case, the derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables. It can be calculated in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables. For a real-valued function of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the gradient vector.

== Definition ==
=== As a limit ===
A function of a real variable formula_1 is differentiable at a point formula_2 of its domain, if its domain contains an open interval containing , and the limit
formula_3
exists. This means that, for every positive real number , there exists a positive real number formula_4 such that, for every formula_5 such that formula_6 and formula_7 then formula_8 is defined, and 
formula_9
where the vertical bars denote the absolute value. This is an example of the (ε, δ)-definition of limit.

If the function formula_10 is differentiable at , that is if the limit formula_11 exists, then this limit is called the &quot;derivative&quot; of formula_10 at formula_2. Multiple notations for the derivative exist. The derivative of formula_10 at formula_2 can be denoted , read as &quot; prime of &quot;; or it can be denoted , read as &quot;the derivative of formula_10 with respect to formula_17 at &quot; or &quot; by (or over) formula_18 at &quot;. See &quot;&quot; below. If formula_10 is a function that has a derivative at every point in its domain, then a function can be defined by mapping every point formula_17 to the value of the derivative of formula_10 at formula_17. This function is written formula_23 and is called the &quot;derivative function&quot; or the &quot;derivative of&quot; . The function formula_10 sometimes has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain. The function whose value at formula_2 equals formula_26 whenever formula_26 is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of . It is still a function, but its domain may be smaller than the domain of formula_10.

For example, let formula_29 be the squaring function: formula_30. Then the quotient in the definition of the derivative is
formula_31
The division in the last step is valid as long as formula_32. The closer formula_33 is to , the closer this expression becomes to the value formula_34. The limit exists, and for every input formula_35 the limit is formula_34. So, the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function: .

The ratio in the definition of the derivative is the slope of the line through two points on the graph of the function , specifically the points formula_37 and formula_38. As formula_33 is made smaller, these points grow closer together, and the slope of this line approaches the limiting value, the slope of the tangent to the graph of formula_29 at formula_35. In other words, the derivative is the slope of the tangent.

===Using infinitesimals===
One way to think of the derivative formula_42 is as the ratio of an infinitesimal change in the output of the function formula_29 to an infinitesimal change in its input. In order to make this intuition rigorous, a system of rules for manipulating infinitesimal quantities is required. The system of hyperreal numbers is a way of treating infinite and infinitesimal quantities. The hyperreals are an extension of the real numbers that contain numbers greater than anything of the form formula_44 for any finite number of terms. Such numbers are infinite, and their reciprocals are infinitesimals. The application of hyperreal numbers to the foundations of calculus is called nonstandard analysis. This provides a way to define the basic concepts of calculus such as the derivative and integral in terms of infinitesimals, thereby giving a precise meaning to the formula_45 in the Leibniz notation. Thus, the derivative of formula_46 becomes formula_47 for an arbitrary infinitesimal , where formula_48 denotes the standard part function, which &quot;rounds off&quot; each finite hyperreal to the nearest real. Taking the squaring function formula_30 as an example again,
formula_50

== Continuity and differentiability ==
If formula_10 is differentiable at , then formula_10 must also be continuous at formula_2. As an example, choose a point formula_2 and let formula_10 be the step function that returns the value 1 for all formula_17 less than , and returns a different value 10 for all formula_17 greater than or equal to formula_2. The function formula_10 cannot have a derivative at formula_2. If formula_5 is negative, then formula_62 is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from formula_2 to formula_62 is very steep; as formula_5 tends to zero, the slope tends to infinity. If formula_5 is positive, then formula_62 is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from formula_2 to formula_62 has slope zero. Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist. However, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there. For example, the absolute value function given by formula_70 is continuous at , but it is not differentiable there. If formula_5 is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to formula_5 is one; if formula_5 is negative, then the slope of the secant line from formula_74 to formula_5 is . This can be seen graphically as a &quot;kink&quot; or a &quot;cusp&quot; in the graph at formula_76. Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its tangent is vertical: For instance, the function given by formula_77 is not differentiable at formula_78. In summary, a function that has a derivative is continuous, but there are continuous functions that do not have a derivative.

Most functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or almost every point. Early in the history of calculus, many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points. Under mild conditions (for example, if the function is a monotone or a Lipschitz function), this is true. However, in 1872, Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. This example is now known as the Weierstrass function. In 1931, Stefan Banach proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a meager set in the space of all continuous functions. Informally, this means that hardly any random continuous functions have a derivative at even one point.

== Notation ==

One common way of writing the derivative of a function is Leibniz notation, introduced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675, which denotes a derivative as the quotient of two differentials, such as formula_79 and . It is still commonly used when the equation formula_80 is viewed as a functional relationship between dependent and independent variables. The first derivative is denoted by , read as &quot;the derivative of formula_81 with respect to &quot;. This derivative can alternately be treated as the application of a differential operator to a function, formula_82 Higher derivatives are expressed using the notation formula_83 for the formula_84-th derivative of formula_85. These are abbreviations for multiple applications of the derivative operator; for example, formula_86 Unlike some alternatives, Leibniz notation involves explicit specification of the variable for differentiation, in the denominator, which removes ambiguity when working with multiple interrelated quantities. The derivative of a composed function can be expressed using the chain rule: if formula_87 and formula_88 then formula_89

Another common notation for differentiation is by using the prime mark in the symbol of a function . This notation, due to Joseph-Louis Lagrange, is now known as &quot;prime notation&quot;. The first derivative is written as , read as &quot; prime of , or , read as &quot; prime&quot;. Similarly, the second and the third derivatives can be written as formula_90 and , respectively. For denoting the number of higher derivatives beyond this point, some authors use Roman numerals in superscript, whereas others place the number in parentheses, such as formula_91 or . The latter notation generalizes to yield the notation formula_92 for the th derivative of .

In Newton&#x27;s notation or the &quot;dot notation,&quot; a dot is placed over a symbol to represent a time derivative. If formula_81 is a function of , then the first and second derivatives can be written as formula_94 and , respectively. This notation is used exclusively for derivatives with respect to time or arc length. It is typically used in differential equations in physics and differential geometry. However, the dot notation becomes unmanageable for high-order derivatives (of order 4 or more) and cannot deal with multiple independent variables.

Another notation is &quot;D-notation&quot;, which represents the differential operator by the symbol . The first derivative is written formula_95 and higher derivatives are written with a superscript, so the formula_84-th derivative is . This notation is sometimes called &quot;Euler notation&quot;, although it seems that Leonhard Euler did not use it, and the notation was introduced by Louis François Antoine Arbogast. To indicate a partial derivative, the variable differentiated by is indicated with a subscript, for example given the function , its partial derivative with respect to formula_97 can be written formula_98 or . Higher partial derivatives can be indicated by superscripts or multiple subscripts, e.g. formula_99 and .

== Rules of computation ==

In principle, the derivative of a function can be computed from the definition by considering the difference quotient and computing its limit. Once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using &quot;rules&quot; for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones. This process of finding a derivative is known as differentiation.

=== Rules for basic functions ===
The following are the rules for the derivatives of the most common basic functions. Here, formula_2 is a real number, and formula_101 is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately. 
* &quot;Derivatives of powers&quot;:
*: formula_102

* &quot;Functions of exponential, natural logarithm, and logarithm with general base&quot;:
*: formula_103
*: formula_104, for formula_105
*: formula_106, for formula_107
*: formula_108, for formula_109

* &quot;Trigonometric functions&quot;:
*: formula_110
*: formula_111
*: formula_112

* &quot;Inverse trigonometric functions&quot;:
*: formula_113, for formula_114
*: formula_115, for formula_114
*: formula_117
=== Rules for combined functions ===
Given that the formula_10 and formula_119 are the functions. The following are some of the most basic rules for deducing the derivative of functions from derivatives of basic functions.
* &quot;Constant rule&quot;: if formula_29 is constant, then for all ,
*: formula_121
* &quot;Sum rule&quot;:
*: formula_122 for all functions formula_29 and formula_124 and all real numbers formula_125 and .
* &quot;Product rule&quot;:
*: formula_126 for all functions formula_29 and . As a special case, this rule includes the fact formula_128 whenever formula_125 is a constant because formula_130 by the constant rule.
* &quot;Quotient rule&quot;:
*: formula_131 for all functions formula_29 and formula_124 at all inputs where .
* &quot;Chain rule&quot; for composite functions: If , then
*: formula_134

=== Computation example ===
The derivative of the function given by formula_135 is
formula_136
Here the second term was computed using the chain rule and the third term using the product rule. The known derivatives of the elementary functions formula_137, formula_138, formula_139, formula_140, and formula_141, as well as the constant formula_142, were also used.

== Higher-order derivatives ==
&quot;Higher order derivatives&quot; are the result of differentiating a function repeatedly. Given that formula_10 is a differentiable function, the derivative of formula_10 is the first derivative, denoted as . The derivative of formula_23 is the second derivative, denoted as , and the derivative of formula_90 is the third derivative, denoted as . By continuing this process, if it exists, the th derivative is the derivative of the th derivative or the &quot;derivative of order &quot;. As has been discussed above, the generalization of derivative of a function formula_10 may be denoted as . A function that has formula_148 successive derivatives is called &quot;formula_148 times differentiable&quot;. If the th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of differentiability class . A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called &quot;infinitely differentiable&quot; or &quot;smooth&quot;. Any polynomial function is infinitely differentiable; taking derivatives repeatedly will eventually result in a constant function, and all subsequent derivatives of that function are zero.

One application of higher-order derivatives is in physics. Suppose that a function represents the position of an object at the time. The first derivative of that function is the velocity of an object with respect to time, the second derivative of the function is the acceleration of an object with respect to time, and the third derivative is the jerk.

== In other dimensions ==
=== Vector-valued functions ===
A vector-valued function formula_150 of a real variable sends real numbers to vectors in some vector space formula_151. A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions formula_152, meaning that formula_153. This includes, for example, parametric curves in formula_154 or formula_155. The coordinate functions are real-valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them. The derivative of formula_156 is defined to be the vector, called the tangent vector, whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions. That is,
formula_157
if the limit exists. The subtraction in the numerator is the subtraction of vectors, not scalars. If the derivative of formula_150 exists for every value of , then formula_159 is another vector-valued function.

=== Partial derivatives ===

Functions can depend upon more than one variable. A partial derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant. Partial derivatives are used in vector calculus and differential geometry. As with ordinary derivatives, multiple notations exist: the partial derivative of a function formula_160 with respect to the variable formula_97 is variously denoted by

among other possibilities. It can be thought of as the rate of change of the function in the formula_97-direction. Here ∂ is a rounded &quot;d&quot; called the partial derivative symbol. To distinguish it from the letter &quot;d&quot;, ∂ is sometimes pronounced &quot;der&quot;, &quot;del&quot;, or &quot;partial&quot; instead of &quot;dee&quot;. For example, let , then the partial derivative of function formula_10 with respect to both variables formula_17 and formula_81 are, respectively:
formula_166
In general, the partial derivative of a function formula_167 in the direction formula_168 at the point formula_169 is defined to be:
formula_170

This is fundamental for the study of the functions of several real variables. Let formula_167 be such a real-valued function. If all partial derivatives formula_10 with respect to formula_173 are defined at the point , these partial derivatives define the vector
formula_174
which is called the gradient of formula_10 at formula_2. If formula_10 is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function formula_178 that maps the point formula_179 to the vector formula_180. Consequently, the gradient determines a vector field.

=== Directional derivatives ===
If formula_10 is a real-valued function on , then the partial derivatives of formula_10 measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes. For example, if formula_10 is a function of formula_17 and , then its partial derivatives measure the variation in formula_10 in the formula_17 and formula_81 direction. However, they do not directly measure the variation of formula_10 in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line . These are measured using directional derivatives. Given a vector , then the directional derivative of formula_10 in the direction of formula_190 at the point formula_191 is:
formula_192
If all the partial derivatives of formula_10 exist and are continuous at , then they determine the directional derivative of formula_10 in the direction formula_190 by the formula:
formula_196

=== Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix ===
When formula_10 is a function from an open subset of formula_151 to , then the directional derivative of formula_10 in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to formula_10 at that point and in that direction. However, when , no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of formula_10. The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once. That is, for any vector formula_190 starting at , the linear approximation formula holds:
formula_203
Similarly with the single-variable derivative, formula_204 is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible. The total derivative of formula_10 at formula_206 is the unique linear transformation formula_207 such that
formula_208
Here formula_209 is a vector in , so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on formula_151. However, formula_211 is a vector in , and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on formula_212. If formula_213 is a vector starting at , then formula_214 is called the pushforward of formula_190 by formula_10.

If the total derivative exists at , then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of formula_10 exist at , and for all , formula_218 is the directional derivative of formula_10 in the direction . If formula_10 is written using coordinate functions, so that , then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a matrix. This matrix is called the Jacobian matrix of formula_10 at formula_206:
formula_223
== Generalizations ==
The concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a linear approximation of the function at that point.
* An important generalization of the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers formula_224 to . The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If formula_224 is identified with formula_226 by writing a complex number formula_227 as then a differentiable function from formula_224 to formula_224 is certainly differentiable as a function from formula_226 to formula_226 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is &quot;complex linear&quot; and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.
* Another generalization concerns functions between differentiable or smooth manifolds. Intuitively speaking such a manifold formula_232 is a space that can be approximated near each point formula_97 by a vector space called its tangent space: the prototypical example is a smooth surface in . The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map formula_234 between manifolds, at a point formula_97 in , is then a linear map from the tangent space of formula_232 at formula_97 to the tangent space of formula_238 at . The derivative function becomes a map between the tangent bundles of formula_232 and . This definition is used in differential geometry.
* Differentiation can also be defined for maps between vector space, such as Banach space, in which those generalizations are the Gateaux derivative and the Fréchet derivative.
* One deficiency of the classical derivative is that very many functions are not differentiable. Nevertheless, there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all continuous functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the weak derivative. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of distributions and only require that a function is differentiable &quot;on average&quot;.
* Properties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology; an example is differential algebra. Here, it consists of the derivation of some topics in abstract algebra, such as rings, ideals, field, and so on.
* The discrete equivalent of differentiation is finite differences. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in time scale calculus.
* The arithmetic derivative involves the function that is defined for the integers by the prime factorization. This is an analogy with the product rule.

<doc id="7922" wikidata="Q33311" url="?curid=7922" title="Dravidian languages">
<text>The Dravidian languages are a family of languages spoken by 250 million people, mainly in South India, north-east Sri Lanka, and south-west Pakistan, with pockets elsewhere in South Asia.

The most commonly spoken Dravidian languages are (in descending order) Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam, all of which have long literary traditions.
Smaller literary languages are Tulu and Kodava.
Together with several smaller languages such as Gondi, these languages cover the southern part of India and the northeast of Sri Lanka, and account for the overwhelming majority of speakers of Dravidian languages.
Malto and Kurukh are spoken in isolated pockets in eastern India.
Kurukh is also spoken in parts of Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. Brahui is mostly spoken in the Balochistan region of Pakistan, Iranian Balochistan, Afghanistan and around the Marw oasis in Turkmenistan. 
During the British colonial period, Dravidian speakers were sent as indentured labourers to Southeast Asia, Mauritius, South Africa, Fiji, the Caribbean, and East Africa. There are more-recent Dravidian-speaking diaspora communities in the Middle East, Europe, North America and Oceania.

Dravidian is first attested in the 2nd century BCE, as inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi script on cave walls in the Madurai and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu.
Dravidian place names along the Arabian Sea coast and clear signs of Dravidian phonological and grammatical influence (e.g. retroflex consonants and clusivity) in the Indo-Aryan languages suggest that Dravidian languages were spoken more widely across the Indian subcontinent before the spread of the Indo-Aryan languages. Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations from the Iranian plateau in the fourth or third millennium BCE, or even earlier, the reconstructed vocabulary of proto-Dravidian suggests that the family is indigenous to India. Despite many attempts, the family has not been shown to be related to any other.

== Dravidian studies ==

The 14th-century Sanskrit text &quot;Lilatilakam&quot;, a grammar of Manipravalam, states that the spoken languages of present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu were similar, terming them as &quot;Dramiḍa&quot;. The author does not consider the &quot;Karṇṇāṭa&quot; (Kannada) and the &quot;Āndhra&quot; (Telugu) languages as &quot;Dramiḍa&quot;, because they were very different from the language of the &quot;Tamil Veda&quot; (&quot;Tiruvaymoli&quot;), but states that some people would include them in the &quot;Dramiḍa&quot; category.

In 1816, Francis Whyte Ellis argued that Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tulu and Kodava descended from a common, non-Indo-European ancestor. He supported his argument with a detailed comparison of non-Sanskrit vocabulary in Telugu, Kannada and Tamil, and also demonstrated that they shared grammatical structures. In 1844, Christian Lassen discovered that Brahui was related to these languages. In 1856, Robert Caldwell published his &quot;Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages&quot;, which considerably expanded the Dravidian umbrella and established Dravidian as one of the major language groups of the world.

In 1961, T. Burrow and M. B. Emeneau published the &quot;Dravidian Etymological Dictionary&quot;, with a major revision in 1984.

==Name==
Robert Caldwell coined the term &quot;Dravidian&quot; for this family of languages, based on the usage of the Sanskrit word in the work &quot;Tantravārttika&quot; by :
The origin of the Sanskrit word &#x27; is the Tamil word &#x27;. Kamil Zvelebil cites the forms such as &quot;dramila&quot; (in &#x27;s Sanskrit work &quot;Avantisundarīkathā&quot;) and &#x27; (found in the Sri Lankan (Ceylonese) chronicle &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;) and then goes on to say, &quot;The forms &quot;damiḷa&quot;/&quot;damila&quot; almost certainly provide a connection of &#x27;&quot; with the indigenous name of the Tamil language, the likely derivation being &quot;*&#x27; &gt; *&#x27; &gt; &#x27;- / &quot;damila&quot;- and further, with the intrusive, &#x27;hypercorrect&#x27; (or perhaps analogical) -&quot;r&quot;-, into &#x27;. The -&quot;m&quot;-/-&quot;v&quot;- alternation is a common enough phenomenon in Dravidian phonology&quot;.

Bhadriraju Krishnamurti states in his reference book &quot;The Dravidian languages&quot;: 

Based on what Krishnamurti states (referring to a scholarly paper published in the &quot;International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics&quot;), the Sanskrit word &#x27; itself appeared later than &#x27;, since the dates for the forms with -r- are centuries later than the dates for the forms without -r- (&#x27;, &#x27;-, &quot;damela&quot;- etc.).

==Classification==
The Dravidian languages form a close-knit family. Most scholars agree on four groups:
* South Dravidian (Tamil–Tulu, or South DravidianI)
** Tamil–Kannada
**** 
****** 
******** Tamil languages, including Tamil
******** Malayalam languages, including Malayalam
******* Irula
****** Kodava
***** Toda
**** Kota
*** Kannada languages, including Kannada and Badaga
*** Koraga
*** Tulu
*** Kudiya

* South-Central Dravidian (Telugu-Kui, or South DravidianII)
** Telugu languages, including Telugu
** Gondi-Kui
*** Gondi languages, including Gondi
**** Konda
***** 
****** Manda
****** Pengo
****** Kuvi
****** Kui

* Central Dravidian (Kolami–Parji)
*** Kolami
*** Naiki
*** Gadaba
**** Ollari
**** Kondekor
*** Duruwa (or Parji)

* North Dravidian (Brahui-Kurukh)
** Kurukh–Malto
*** Kurukh (Oraon, Kisan)
*** Malto (Kumarbhag Paharia, Sauria Paharia)
** Brahui

There are different proposals regarding the relationship between these groups. Earlier classifications grouped Central and South-Central Dravidian in a single branch. On the other hand, Krishnamurti groups South-Central and South Dravidian together. There are other disagreements, including whether there is a Toda-Kota branch or whether Kota diverged first and later Toda (claimed by Krishnamurti).

Some authors deny that North Dravidian forms a valid subgroup, splitting it into Northeast (Kurukh–Malto) and Northwest (Brahui). Their affiliation has been proposed based primarily on a small number of common phonetic developments, including:
* In some words, *k is retracted or spirantized, shifting to in Kurukh and Brahui, in Malto.
* In some words, *c is retracted to .
* Word-initial *v develops to . This development is, however, also found in several other Dravidian languages, including Kannada, Kodagu and Tulu.
McAlpin (2003) notes that no exact conditioning can be established for the first two changes, and proposes that distinct Proto-Dravidian *q and *kʲ should be reconstructed behind these correspondences, and that Brahui, Kurukh-Malto, and the rest of Dravidian may be three coordinate branches, possibly with Brahui being the earliest language to split off. A few morphological parallels between Brahui and Kurukh-Malto are also known, but according to McAlpin they are analysable as shared archaisms rather than shared innovations.

In addition, &quot;Glottolog&quot; lists several unclassified Dravidian languages: Kumbaran, Kakkala (both of Tamil-Malayalam) and Khirwar.

A computational phylogenetic study of the Dravidian language family was undertaken by Kolipakam, et al. (2018). They support the internal coherence of the four Dravidian branches South (or South Dravidian I), South-Central (or South Dravidian II), Central, and North, but is uncertain about the precise relationships of these four branches to each other. The date of Dravidian is estimated to be 4,500 years old.

==Distribution==
Dravidian languages are mostly located in the southern and central parts of south Asia with 2 main outliers, Brahui having speakers in Balochistan and as far north are Merv, Turkmenistan and Kurukh to the east in Jharkhand and as far northeast as Bhutan, Nepal and Assam. Historically Maharashtra, Gujarat and Sindh also had Dravidian speaking populations from the evidence of place names (like &quot;-v(a)li, -koṭ&quot; from Dravidian &quot;paḷḷi, kōṭṭai&quot;), grammatical features in Marathi, Gujarati, and Sindhi and Dravidian like kinship systems in southern Indo–Aryan languages. Proto-Dravidian could have been spoken in a wider area, perhaps into Central India or the western Deccan which may have had other forms of early Dravidian/pre-Proto-Dravidian or other branches of Dravidian which are currently unknown.

Since 1981, the Census of India has reported only languages with more than 10,000 speakers, including 17 Dravidian languages. In 1981, these accounted for approximately 24% of India&#x27;s population.
In the 2001 census, they included 214 million people, about 21% of India&#x27;s total population of 1.02 billion. In addition, the largest Dravidian-speaking group outside India, Tamil speakers in Sri Lanka, number around 4.7 million. The total number of speakers of Dravidian languages is around 227 million people, around 13% of the population of the Indian subcontinent.

The largest group of the Dravidian languages is South Dravidian, with almost 150 million speakers. Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam make up around 98% of the speakers, with 75 million, 44 million and 37 million native speakers, respectively.

The next-largest is the South-Central branch, which has 78 million native speakers, the vast majority of whom speak Telugu. The total number of speakers of Telugu, including those whose first language is not Telugu, is around 85 million people. This branch also includes the tribal language Gondi spoken in central India.

The second-smallest branch is the Northern branch, with around 6.3 million speakers. This is the only sub-group to have a language spoken in Pakistan – Brahui.

The smallest branch is the Central branch, which has only around 200,000 speakers. These languages are mostly tribal, and spoken in central India.

Languages recognized as official languages of India appear here in boldface.




==Proposed relations with other families==
Researchers have tried but have been unable to prove a connection between the Dravidian languages with other language families, including Indo-European, Hurrian, Basque, Sumerian, Korean, and Japanese. Comparisons have been made not just with the other language families of the Indian subcontinent (Indo-European, Austroasiatic, Sino-Tibetan, and Nihali), but with all typologically similar language families of the Old World. Nonetheless, although there are no readily detectable genealogical connections, Dravidian shares several areal features with the Indo-Aryan languages, which have been attributed to the influence of a Dravidian substratum on Indo-Aryan.

Dravidian languages display typological similarities with the Uralic language group, and there have been several attempts to establish a genetic relationship in the past. This idea has been popular amongst Dravidian linguists, including Robert Caldwell, Thomas Burrow, Kamil Zvelebil, and Mikhail Andronov. The hypothesis is, however, rejected by most specialists in Uralic languages, and also in recent times by Dravidian linguists such as Bhadriraju Krishnamurti.

In the early 1970s, the linguist David McAlpin produced a detailed proposal of a genetic relationship between Dravidian and the extinct Elamite language of ancient Elam (present-day southwestern Iran). The Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis was supported in the late 1980s by the archaeologist Colin Renfrew and the geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, who suggested that Proto-Dravidian was brought to India by farmers from the Iranian part of the Fertile Crescent. (In his 2000 book, Cavalli-Sforza suggested western India, northern India and northern Iran as alternative starting points.) However, linguists have found McAlpin&#x27;s cognates unconvincing and criticized his proposed phonological rules as &quot;ad hoc&quot;. Elamite is generally believed by scholars to be a language isolate, and the theory has had no effect on studies of the language. In 2012, Southworth suggested a &quot;Zagrosian family&quot; of West Asian origin including Elamite, Brahui and Dravidian as its three branches.

Dravidian is one of the primary language families in the Nostratic proposal, which would link most languages in North Africa, Europe and Western Asia into a family with its origins in the Fertile Crescent sometime between the Last Glacial Period and the emergence of Proto-Indo-European 4,000–6,000 BCE. However, the general consensus is that such deep connections are not, or not yet, demonstrable.

==Prehistory==
The origins of the Dravidian languages, as well as their subsequent development and the period of their differentiation are unclear, partially due to the lack of comparative linguistic research into the Dravidian languages. It is thought that the Dravidian languages were the most widespread indigenous languages in the Indian subcontinent before the advance of the Indo-Aryan languages. Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations from the Iranian plateau in the fourth or third millennium BCE or even earlier, reconstructed proto-Dravidian vocabulary suggests that the family is indigenous to India.

===Proto-Dravidian and onset of diversification===
As a proto-language, the Proto-Dravidian language is not itself attested in the historical record. Its modern conception is based solely on reconstruction. It was suggested in the 1980s that the language was spoken in the 4th millennium BCE, and started disintegrating into various branches around the 3rd millennium BCE. According to Krishnamurti, Proto-Dravidian may have been spoken in the Indus civilization, suggesting a &quot;tentative date of Proto-Dravidian around the early part of the third millennium.&quot; Krishnamurti further states that South Dravidian I (including pre-Tamil) and South Dravidian II (including Pre-Telugu) split around the 11th century BCE, with the other major branches splitting off at around the same time. Kolipakam et al. (2018) give a similar estimate of 2,500 BCE for Proto-Dravidian.

Historically Maharashtra, Gujarat and Sindh also had Dravidian speaking populations from the evidence of place names (like &quot;-v(a)li, -koṭ&quot; from Dravidian &quot;paḷḷi, kōṭṭai&quot;), grammatical features in Marathi, Gujarati, and Sindhi and Dravidian like kinship systems in southern Indo–Aryan languages. Proto-Dravidian could have been spoken in a wider area, perhaps into Central India or the western Deccan which may have had other forms of early Dravidian/pre-Proto-Dravidian or other branches of Dravidian which are currently unknown.

Several geneticists have noted a strong correlation between Dravidian and the Ancestral South Indian (ASI) component of South Asian genetic makeup. Narasimhan et al. (2019) argue that the ASI component itself formed in the early 2nd millennium BCE from a mixture of a population associated with the Indus Valley civilization and a population resident in peninsular India. They conclude that one of these two groups may have been the source of proto-Dravidian. An Indus valley origin would be consistent with the location of Brahui and with attempts to interpret the Indus script as Dravidian. On the other hand, reconstructed Proto-Dravidian terms for flora and fauna provide support for a peninsular Indian origin.

===Indus Valley Civilisation===
The Indus Valley civilisation (3300–1900 BCE), located in the Indus Valley region, is sometimes suggested to have been Dravidian. Already in 1924, after discovering the Indus Valley Civilisation, John Marshall stated that one or more of the languages may have been Dravidic. Cultural and linguistic similarities have been cited by researchers Henry Heras, Kamil Zvelebil, Asko Parpola and Iravatham Mahadevan as being strong evidence for a proto-Dravidian origin of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation. The discovery in Tamil Nadu of a late Neolithic (early 2nd millennium BCE, i.e. post-dating Harappan decline) stone celt allegedly marked with Indus signs has been considered by some to be significant for the Dravidian identification.

Yuri Knorozov surmised that the symbols represent a logosyllabic script and suggested, based on computer analysis, an underlying agglutinative Dravidian language as the most likely candidate for the underlying language. Knorozov&#x27;s suggestion was preceded by the work of Henry Heras, who suggested several readings of signs based on a proto-Dravidian assumption.

Linguist Asko Parpola writes that the Indus script and Harappan language are &quot;most likely to have belonged to the Dravidian family&quot;. Parpola led a Finnish team in investigating the inscriptions using computer analysis. Based on a proto-Dravidian assumption, they proposed readings of many signs, some agreeing with the suggested readings of Heras and Knorozov (such as equating the &quot;fish&quot; sign with the Dravidian word for fish, &quot;min&quot;) but disagreeing on several other readings. A comprehensive description of Parpola&#x27;s work until 1994 is given in his book &quot;Deciphering the Indus Script&quot;.

===Northern Dravidian pockets===
Although in modern times speakers of the various Dravidian languages have mainly occupied the southern portion of India, in earlier times they probably were spoken in a larger area. After the Indo-Aryan migrations into north-western India, starting , and the establishment of the Kuru kingdom , a process of Sanskritisation of the masses started, which resulted in a language shift in northern India. Southern India has remained majority Dravidian, but pockets of Dravidian can be found in central India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.

The Kurukh and Malto are pockets of Dravidian languages in central India, spoken by people who may have migrated from south India. They do have myths about external origins. The Kurukh have traditionally claimed to be from the Deccan Peninsula, more specifically Karnataka. The same tradition has existed of the Brahui, who call themselves immigrants. Holding this same view of the Brahui are many scholars such as L.H. Horace Perera and M.Ratnasabapathy.

The Brahui population of Pakistan&#x27;s Balochistan province has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a relict population, perhaps indicating that Dravidian languages were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming Indo-Aryan languages. However, it has been argued that the absence of any Old Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui suggests that the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from central India less than 1,000 years ago. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western Iranian language like Kurdish, and arrived in the area from the west only around 1000 CE. Sound changes shared with Kurukh and Malto also suggest that Brahui was originally spoken near them in central India.

===Dravidian influence on Sanskrit===
Dravidian languages show extensive lexical (vocabulary) borrowing, but only a few traits of structural (either phonological or grammatical) borrowing from Indo-Aryan, whereas Indo-Aryan shows more structural than lexical borrowings from the Dravidian languages. Many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo-Aryan language, the language of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (c.1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian.

Vedic Sanskrit has retroflex consonants (/, ) with about 88 words in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; having unconditioned retroflexes. Some sample words are &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27;.
Since other Indo-European languages, including other Indo-Iranian languages, lack retroflex consonants, their presence in Indo-Aryan is often cited as evidence of substrate influence from close contact of the Vedic speakers with speakers of a foreign language family rich in retroflex consonants. The Dravidian family is a serious candidate since it is rich in retroflex phonemes reconstructible back to the Proto-Dravidian stage.

In addition, a number of grammatical features of Vedic Sanskrit not found in its sister Avestan language appear to have been borrowed from Dravidian languages. These include the gerund, which has the same function as in Dravidian. Some linguists explain this asymmetrical borrowing by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan languages were built on a Dravidian substratum. These scholars argue that the most plausible explanation for the presence of Dravidian structural features in Indic is language shift, that is, native Dravidian speakers learning and adopting Indic languages due to elite dominance. Although each of the innovative traits in Indic could be accounted for by internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once; moreover, it accounts for several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.

==Phonology==

Proto-Dravidian, unlike Sanskrit and other Indo-Iranian languages languages of South Asia, lacked both an aspiration and voicing contrast. The situation varies considerably amongst its daughter languages and often also between registers of any single language. The vast majority of modern Dravidian languages generally have some voicing distinctions amongst stops; as for aspiration, it appears in at least the formal varieties of the so-called &quot;literary&quot; Dravidian languages (except Tamil) today, but may be rare or entirely absent in less formal registers, as well as in the many &quot;non-literary&quot; Dravidian languages.

At one extreme, Tamil, like Proto-Dravidian, does not phonemically distinguish between voiced and voiceless or unaspirated and aspirated sounds, even in formal speech; in fact, the Tamil alphabet lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. At the other end, Brahui is exceptional among the Dravidian languages in possessing and commonly employing the entire inventory of aspirates employed in neighboring Sindhi. While aspirates are particularly concentrated in the Indo-Aryan element of the lexicon, some Brahui words with Dravidian roots have developed aspiration as well.

Most languages lie in between. Voicing contrasts are quite common in all registers of speech in most Dravidian languages. Aspiration contrasts are less common, but relatively well-established in the phonologies of the higher or more formal registers, as well as in the standard orthographies, of the &quot;literary&quot; languages (other than Tamil): Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. However, in colloquial or non-standard speech, aspiration often appears inconsistently or not at all, even if it occurs in the standard spelling of the word.

In the languages in which aspirates are found, they primarily occur in the large numbers of loanwords from Sanskrit and other Indo-Iranian languages, though some are found in etymologically native words as well, often as the result of plosive + laryngeal clusters being reanalysed as aspirates (e.g. Telugu , Kannada / , Adilabad Gondi ).

Dravidian languages are also historically characterized by a three-way distinction between dental, alveolar, and retroflex places of articulation as well as large numbers of liquids. Currently the three-way coronal distinction is only found in Malayalam, Sri Lankan Tamil, and the various languages of the Nilgiri Mountains, all of which belong to the Tamil–Kannada branch of the family.

All other Dravidian languages maintain only a two-way distinction between dentals and retroflexes, largely the result of merging the alveolars with the dentals or retroflexes, or via rhotacization. The latter is found primarily among the South and South Central languages, where many languages merged the singular proto-Dravidian alveolar plosive &quot;*ṯ&quot; with the alveolar trill ; subsequently, in some of these languages, the trill evolved into the alveolar tap or underwent other sound changes (Tulu has as reflexes, Manda-Kui has , and Hill-Maria Gondi has ).

===Proto-Dravidian===

Proto-Dravidian had five short and long vowels: &quot;*a&quot;, &quot;*ā&quot;, &quot;*i&quot;, &quot;*ī&quot;, &quot;*u&quot;, &quot;*ū&quot;, &quot;*e&quot;, &quot;*ē&quot;, &quot;*o&quot;, &quot;*ō&quot;. There were no diphthongs; &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;au&quot; are treated as *&quot;ay&quot; and *&quot;av&quot; (or *&quot;aw&quot;).
The five-vowel system with phonemic length is largely preserved in the descendant subgroups, but there are some notable exceptions. The Nilgiri languages (except Kota but including Kodagu) developing a series of central vowels which formed from vowels near retroflex and alveolar consonants. The short &quot;u&quot; phoneme (mostly word finally) became &quot;ŭ/ụ&quot; /ɯ~ɨ~ə/ and also became phonemic in Tulu and Malayalam, mostly caused by loaning words with rounded /u/. Brahui has slightly poorer vowel system, where short &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; merged with other vowels due to the influence of Indo-Aryan languages, leaving only long counterparts.

The following consonantal phonemes are reconstructed:
* The *ṯ developed into a trill (with *r being a tap) in South and South Central Dravidian.
* All non Tamil-Malayalam languages (including modern spoken Tamil) developed a voicing distinction for plosives, if loans are included, all of them have a voicing distinction.

==Grammar==
The most characteristic grammatical features of Dravidian languages are:
* Dravidian languages are agglutinative.
* Word order is subject–object–verb (SOV).
* Most Dravidian languages have a clusivity distinction.
* The major word classes are nouns (substantives, numerals, pronouns), adjectives, verbs, and indeclinables (particles, enclitics, adverbs, interjections, onomatopoetic words, echo words).
* Proto-Dravidian used only suffixes, never prefixes or infixes, in the construction of inflected forms. Hence, the roots of words always occurred at the beginning. Nouns, verbs, and indeclinable words constituted the original word classes.
* There are two numbers and four different gender systems, the ancestral system probably having &quot;male:non-male&quot; in the singular and &quot;person:non-person&quot; in the plural.
* In a sentence, however complex, only one finite verb occurs, normally at the end, preceded if necessary by a number of gerunds.
* Word order follows certain basic rules but is relatively free.
* The main (and probably original) dichotomy in tense is past:non-past. Present tense developed later and independently in each language or subgroup.
* Verbs are intransitive, transitive, and causative; there are also active and passive forms.
* All of the positive verb forms have their corresponding negative counterparts, negative verbs.

===Nominal morphology===
====Number and gender====
The Dravidian languages have two numbers, singular and plural. The singular is unmarked, the plural is expressed by a suffix. The plural suffixes are &quot;-(n)k(k)a&quot; (cf. Kui &#x27;cows&#x27;, Brahui &#x27;mouths&#x27;), *-ḷ (cf. Telugu &#x27;trees&#x27;, Ollari &#x27;hands&#x27;) and the combination of these two *-(n)k(k)aḷ common in SD (cf. Tamil &#x27;trees&#x27;, Kannada &#x27;trees&#x27;).

The individual Dravidian languages have different gender systems. What they have in common is that the grammatical gender (genus) always corresponds to the natural gender of the word. In addition to individual special developments, there are three main types in which the categories &quot;male&quot; or &quot;non-male&quot; as well as &quot;human&quot; and &quot;non-human&quot; play a central role:

# The South Dravidian languages distinguish between masculine (human, masculine), feminine (human, non-masculine) and neuter (non-human) in the singular, and only between human and non-human in the plural.
# The Central Dravidian and many South Central Dravidian languages distinguish only between masculine and non-masculine in both singular and plural.
# Telugu and the North Dravidian languages distinguish between masculine and non-masculine in the singular, and between human and non-human in the plural.
The three types are illustrated by the forms of the third-person demonstrative pronouns of the three languages:

There is no consensus as to which of these three types is the original.

The gender is not explicitly marked for all nouns. Thus in Telugu &#x27;elder brother&#x27; is masculine and &#x27;mother&#x27; non-masculine, without this being apparent from the pure form of the word. However, many nouns are formed with certain suffixes that express gender and number. For Proto-Dravidian, the suffixes *-an and *-anṯ could be used for the masculine singular (cf. Tamil &#x27;son&#x27;, Telugu &#x27;younger brother&#x27;), *-aḷ and *-i for the singular feminine (cf. Kannada &#x27;daughter&#x27;, Malto &#x27;girl&#x27;) and *-ar for human plurals (cf. Malayalam &#x27;two persons&#x27;, Kurukh &#x27;men&#x27;).

====Case====
Case is expressed by suffixes and more loosely connected postpositions. The number of cases varies between four (Telugu) and eleven (Brahui).

The nominative is always the unmarked base form of the word. The other cases, collectively called oblique, are formed by adding suffixes to a stem that can either be identical to the nominative or formed by certain suffixes (e.g. Tamil &#x27;tree&#x27;, oblique ). Several oblique suffixes can be reconstructed for Proto-Dravidian, which are composed of the minimal components *-i- , *-a- , *-n- and *-tt-. In many languages, the oblique is identical to the genitive.

Proto-Dravidian case suffixes can be reconstructed for the three cases accusative, dative and genitive. Other case suffixes only occur in individual branches of Dravidian.

* Accusative: *-ay (Tamil &#x27;elephant&#x27;, Malayalam &#x27;him&#x27;, Brahui &#x27;this village&#x27;); *-Vn (Telugu &#x27;wife&#x27;, Gondi &#x27;ox&#x27;, Ollari &#x27;panther&#x27;)
* Dative: *-(n)k(k)- (Tamil &#x27;you&#x27;; Telugu &#x27;for work&#x27;, Kolami &#x27;to the house&#x27;)
* Genitive: -*a/ā (Kannada &#x27;to be&#x27;, Gondi &#x27;of the thief&#x27;, Brahui &#x27;of the bull&#x27;); *-in (Tamil &#x27;of the king&#x27;, Toda &#x27;of the elder sister&#x27;, Ollari &#x27;of the girl&#x27;)

====Pronouns====
Personal pronouns occur in the 1st and 2nd person. In the 1st person plural there is an inclusive and exclusive form, that is, a distinction is made as to whether the person addressed is included. There is also a reflexive pronoun that refers to the subject of the sentence and is constructed in the same way as personal pronouns. The personal and reflexive pronouns reconstructed for Proto-Dravidian are listed in the table below. In addition, there are special developments in some languages: The south and south-central Dravidian languages have transferred the *ñ initial sound of the 1st person plural inclusive to the 1st person singular (cf. Malayalam &quot;ñān&quot;, but oblique &quot;en&quot; &lt; *yan). The differences between the forms for the inclusive and exclusive we are partly blurred; Kannada has completely abandoned this distinction. The languages of the Tamil-Kodagu group have formed a new exclusive &#x27;we&#x27; by adding the plural suffix (cf. Tamil &quot;nām&quot; &#x27;we (incl.)&#x27;, &quot;nāṅ-kaḷ&quot; &#x27;we (excl.)&#x27;).

The demonstrative pronouns also serve as personal pronouns of the 3rd person. They consist of an initial vowel expressing the distance and a suffix expressing number and gender. There are three levels of distance: the far distance is formed with the initial vowel *a-, the middle distance with *u- and the near distance with *i-. The same deictic elements also occur in local (&#x27;here&#x27;, &#x27;there&#x27;) and temporal adverbs (&#x27;now&#x27;, &#x27;then&#x27;). The original threefold distinction of the distance (e.g. Kota &quot;avn&quot; &#x27;he, that one&#x27;, &quot;ūn&quot; &#x27;he, this one&#x27;, &quot;ivn&quot; &#x27;he, this one&#x27;) has only survived in a few languages spoken today, the yonder distance u- has mostly become obsolete instead a- and i- are used. Interrogative pronouns are formed analogously to the demonstrative pronouns and are characterized by the initial syllable *ya- (e.g. Kota &quot;evn&quot; &#x27;which&#x27;).

Tamil-Telugu made another word &quot;*ñān&quot; for the 1SG pronoun back formed from 1P inclusive &quot;*ñām&quot;, in parallel to *yān; some languages like Tamil retain both forms, &quot;yāṉ, nāṉ&quot;.

====Verbal morphology====
The Dravidian verb is formed by adding tense, mood and personal suffixes to the root of the word. Thus the Tamil word &quot;varukiṟēṉ&quot; &#x27;I come&#x27; is composed of the verb stem &quot;varu-&quot;, the present suffix &quot;-kiṟ&quot; and the suffix of the 1st person singular &quot;-ēṉ&quot;.

In Proto-Dravidian there are only two tenses, past and not past, while many daughter languages have developed a more complex tense system.

The negation is expressed synthetically by a special negative verb form (cf. Konda &quot;kitan&quot; &#x27;he made&#x27;, &quot;kiʔetan&quot; &#x27;he did not&#x27;).

The verb stem can be modified by stem-forming suffixes in many Dravidian languages. Thus Malto derives from the stem &quot;nud-&quot; &#x27;to hide&#x27; the reflexive verb stem &quot;nudɣr-&quot; &#x27;to hide&#x27;.

Infinite verb forms depend on either a following verb or a following noun. They serve to form more complex syntactic constructions.

Verbal compounds can be formed in Dravidian, for example the Tamil &quot;konṭuvara&quot; &#x27;to bring&#x27; is composed of an infinite form of the verb &quot;koḷḷa&quot; &#x27;to hold&#x27; and the verb &quot;vara&quot; &#x27;to come&#x27;.

====Syntax====
Characteristic of the Dravidian languages is a fixed subject–object–verb word order (SOV). Accordingly, the subject comes first in the sentence (it can at most be preceded by circumstantial determinations of time and place) and the predicate always at the end of the sentence. As is characteristic of SOV languages, in the Dravidian languages, attributes always come before their noun, subordinate clauses before main clauses, main verbs before auxiliary verbs, and postpositions are used instead of prepositions. Only in the North Dravidian languages has the rigid SOV word order been relaxed.

A simple sentence consists of a subject and a predicate, which can be either a verb or a noun. There is no copula in Dravidian. The subject is usually in the nominative case, but in many Dravidian languages, in a sentence expressing a feeling, perception or possession, the subject is also in the dative case. In all Dravidian languages except Malayalam, a verbal predicate agrees with a nominative subject. Kui and Kuwi developed a system of congruence between object and verb. In some Dravidian languages (Old Tamil, Gondi) even a nominal predicate takes personal endings. Examples of simple sentences from Tamil:

: &quot;avar eṉṉaik kēṭṭār.&quot; (he me asked) &#x27;He asked me.&#x27; (subject in nominative, verbal predicate)
: &quot;avar eṉ appā.&quot; (he my father) &#x27;He is my father.&#x27; (subject in nominative, nominal predicate)
: &quot;avarukku kōpam vantatu.&quot; (to-him anger it-came) &#x27;He became angry.&#x27; (subject in dative, verbal predicate)
: &quot;avarukku oru makaṉ.&quot; (to-him a son) &#x27;He has a son.&#x27; (subject in dative, nominal predicate)

Complex sentences consist of a main clause and one or more subordinate clauses. In general, a sentence can contain only one finite verb. The Dravidian languages have no conjunctions; subordinate clauses are formed just like parataxes by infinite verb forms. These include the infinitive, the verbal participle, which expresses a sequence of actions, and the conditional, which expresses a conditionality. Relative clauses correspond to constructions with the so-called adnominal participles. Examples from Tamil:

: &quot;avarai varac col.&quot; (him to-come tell) &#x27;Tell him to come.&#x27; (infinitive)
: &quot;kaṭaikku pōyi muṭṭaikaḷ koṇṭuvā.&quot; (to-the-shop go-then eggs get-come) &#x27;Go to the shop and bring eggs.&#x27; (verb participle)
: &quot;avaṉ poy coṉṉāl ammā aṭippāḷ.&quot; (he lie if-saying mother will-beat) &#x27;If he lies, mother will beat him.&#x27; (Conditional)
: &quot;avaṉ coṉṉatu uṇmai.&quot; (he said truth) &#x27;What he says is true.&#x27; (adnominal participle)

These constructions are not possible for subordinate clauses with a nominal predicate, since no infinite forms can be formed for a noun. Here one gets by with the so-called quotative verb (usually an infinite form of &#x27;to say&#x27;), through which the nominal subordinate clause is embedded in the sentence structure. Example from Tamil:

: &quot;nāṉ avaṉ nallavaṉ eṉṟu niṉaikkiṟēṉ.&quot; (I he [good-man]-like-that thinking) &#x27;I think he&#x27;s a good man.&#x27;

==Vocabulary==

Word roots seem to have been monosyllabic in Proto-Dravidian as a rule. Proto-Dravidian words could be simple, derived, or compound. Iterative compounds could be formed by doubling a word, cf. Tamil &quot;avar&quot; &quot;he&quot; and &quot;avaravar&quot; &quot;everyone&quot; or &quot;vantu&quot; &quot;coming&quot; and &quot;vantu vantu&quot; &quot;always coming&quot;. A special form of reduplicated compounds are the so-called echo words, in which the first syllable of the second word is replaced by &quot;ki&quot;, cf. Tamil &quot;pustakam&quot; &quot;book&quot; and &quot;pustakam-kistakam&quot; &quot;books and the like&quot;.

Today&#x27;s Dravidian languages have, in addition to the inherited Dravidian vocabulary, a large number of words from Sanskrit or later Indo-Aryan languages. In Tamil, they make up a relatively small proportion, not least because of targeted linguistic puristic tendencies in the early 20th century, while in Telugu and Malayalam the number of Indo-Aryan loanwords is large. In Brahui, which was strongly influenced by its neighboring languages due to its distance from the other Dravidian languages, only a tenth of the vocabulary is of Dravidian origin. [16] More recently, like all the languages of India, the Dravidian languages also have words borrowed from English on a large scale; less numerous are the loanwords from Portuguese.

Dravidian words that have found their way into English are &quot;orange&quot; (via Sanskrit &quot;nāraṅga&quot;, cf. Tamil &quot;nāraṅkа̄y&quot; &lt; &quot;nāram-kа̄y&quot;), &quot;catamaran&quot; (Tamil &quot;kaṭṭumaram&quot; &quot;[boat made of] bound logs&quot;), &quot;mango&quot; (Tamil &quot;māṅkāy&quot;, Malayalam &quot;māṅṅa&quot;, via Portuguese &quot;manga&quot;), &quot;mongoose&quot; (Telugu &quot;muṅgisa&quot;, Kannada &quot;muṅgisi&quot;) and &quot;curry&quot; (Tamil &quot;kaṟi&quot;).

* Tamil-Telugu made another word &quot;*ñān&quot; for the 1SG pronoun back formed from 1P inclusive &quot;*ñām&quot;, in parallel to *yān; some languages like Tamil retain both forms, &quot;yāṉ, nāṉ&quot;.

===Numerals===

The numerals from 1 to 10 in various Dravidian and Indo-Iranian languages (here exemplified by Indo-Aryan language Sanskrit and Iranian language Persian).

# This is the same as the word for another form of the number one in Tamil and Malayalam, used as the indefinite article (&quot;a&quot;) and when the number is an attribute preceding a noun (as in &quot;one person&quot;), as opposed to when it is a noun (as in &quot;How many are there?&quot; &quot;One&quot;).
# The stem *īr is still found in compound words, and has taken on a meaning of &quot;double&quot; in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. For example, &quot;irupatu&quot; (20, literally meaning &quot;double-ten&quot;), &quot;iravai&quot; (20 in Telugu), &quot;iraṭṭi&quot; (&quot;double&quot;) or &quot;iruvar&quot; (&quot;two people&quot;, in Tamil) and &quot;ippattu&quot; (ipp-hattu, double ten&quot;, in Kannada).
# The Kolami numbers 5 to 10 are borrowed from Telugu.
# The word &quot;toṇṭu&quot; was also used to refer to the number nine in ancient Sangam texts but was later completely replaced by the word &quot;oṉpatu&quot;.
# These forms are derived from &quot;one (less than) ten&quot;. Proto-Dravidian *toḷ/*toṇ (which could mean 9 or 9/10) is still used in Tamil and Malayalam as the basis of numbers such as 90 and 900, &quot;toṇṇūṟu&quot; (*100 = 90) as well as the Kannada &quot;tombattu&quot; (9*10 = 90).
# Because of shared sound changes that have happened over the years in the majority of the Tamil dialects, the numbers 1–5 have different colloquial pronunciations, seen here to the right of their written, formal pronunciations.
# In languages with words for one starts with ok(k)- it was taken from *okk- which originally meant &quot;to be united&quot; and not a numeral.
* Words indicated (II) are borrowings from Indo-Iranian languages (in Brahui&#x27;s case, from Balochi).

==Literature==

Four Dravidian languages, viz. Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam, have lengthy literary traditions. Literature in Tulu and Kodava is more recent. Recently old literature in Gondi has been discovered as well.

The earliest known Dravidian inscriptions are 76 Old Tamil inscriptions on cave walls in Madurai and Tirunelveli districts in Tamil Nadu, dating from the 2nd century BCE. These inscriptions are written in a variant of the Brahmi script called Tamil Brahmi. In 2019, the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department released a report on excavations at Keeladi, near Madurai, Tamil Nadu, including a description of potsherds dated to the 6th century BCE inscribed with personal names in the Tamil-Brahmi script. However, the report lacks the detail of a full archaeological study, and other archaeologists have disputed whether the oldest dates obtained for the site can be assigned to these potsherds. The earliest long text in Old Tamil is the &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot;, a work on Tamil grammar and poetics preserved in a 5th-century CE redaction, whose oldest layers could date from the late 2nd century or 1st century BCE.

Kannada&#x27;s earliest known inscription is the lion balustrade (&quot;Simhakatanjana&quot;) inscription excavated at the Pranaveshwara temple complex at Talagunda near Shiralakoppa of Shivamogga district, dated to 370 CE which replaced the Halmidi inscription in Hassan district (450 CE). A 9th-century treatise on poetics, the &quot;Kavirajamarga&quot;, is the first known literary work. The earliest Telugu inscription, from Erragudipadu in Kadapa district, is dated 575. The first literary work is an 11th-century translation of part of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. The earliest Malayalam text is the Vazhappally copper plate (9th century). The first literary work is &quot;Rāmacaritam&quot; (12th century).

<doc id="7923" wikidata="Q41542" url="?curid=7923" title="Dracula">
<text>Dracula is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker. The narrative is related through letters, diary entries, and newspaper articles. It has no single protagonist and opens with solicitor Jonathan Harker taking a business trip to stay at the castle of a Transylvanian nobleman, Count Dracula. Harker flees after learning that Dracula is a vampire, and the Count moves to England and plagues the seaside town of Whitby. A small group, led by Abraham Van Helsing, hunts and kills him.

Mostly written in the 1890s, Stoker produced over a hundred pages of notes for the novel, drawing extensively from folklore and history. Scholars have suggested various figures as the inspiration for Dracula, including the Wallachian prince Vlad the Impaler and the Countess Elizabeth Báthory, but recent scholarship suggests otherwise. He probably found the name Dracula in Whitby&#x27;s public library while on holiday, selecting it because he thought it meant &quot;devil&quot; in Romanian.

Following its publication in May 1897, some reviewers praised the terrifying atmosphere while others thought Stoker included too much horror. Many noted a structural similarity with Wilkie Collins&#x27; &quot;The Woman in White&quot; (1859) and a resemblance to the work of Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe. In the 20th century, &quot;Dracula&quot; became regarded as a seminal work of Gothic fiction. Scholars explore the novel within the historical context of the Victorian era and regularly discuss its portrayal of race, religion, gender and sexuality.

&quot;Dracula&quot; is one of the most famous works of English literature. The character of Count Dracula deeply shaped the popular conception of vampires and influenced future representations. With over 700 appearances in virtually all forms of media, the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; named Dracula the most portrayed literary character. The novel itself has been adapted many times, with new adaptations sometimes being produced as often as every week.

== Plot ==
Jonathan Harker, a newly qualified English solicitor, visits Count Dracula at his castle in the Carpathian Mountains to help the Count purchase a house near London. Ignoring the Count&#x27;s warning, Harker wanders the castle at night and encounters three vampire women; Dracula rescues Harker, and gives the women a small child bound inside a bag. Six weeks later, Dracula leaves the castle, abandoning Harker to the women. Harker escapes and ends up delirious in a Budapest hospital. Dracula takes a ship called the &quot;Demeter&quot; for England with boxes of earth from his castle. The captain&#x27;s log narrates the crew&#x27;s disappearance until he alone remains, bound to the helm to maintain course. An animal resembling a large dog is seen leaping ashore when the ship runs aground at Whitby.

Lucy Westenra&#x27;s letter to her best friend, Harker&#x27;s fiancée Mina Murray, describes her marriage proposals from Dr. John Seward, Quincey Morris, and Arthur Holmwood. Lucy accepts Holmwood&#x27;s, but all remain friends. Mina joins Lucy on holiday in Whitby. Lucy begins to sleepwalk. After Dracula&#x27;s ship lands in Whitby, he begins to stalk Lucy. Mina receives a letter about her missing fiancé&#x27;s illness and goes to Budapest to nurse him. Lucy becomes very ill; Seward&#x27;s old teacher—Professor Abraham Van Helsing—determines the nature of her condition, but he refuses to disclose it, instead diagnosing it as acute blood-loss. Van Helsing places garlic flowers around her room and makes her a necklace of them. Lucy&#x27;s mother removes the garlic flowers, not knowing they repel vampires. While Seward and Van Helsing are absent, Lucy and her mother are terrified by a wolf and Mrs. Westenra dies of a heart attack; Lucy dies shortly thereafter. After her burial, newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a &quot;bloofer lady&quot; (beautiful lady), and Van Helsing deduces it is Lucy. Seward, Morris, Arthur and Van Helsing go to her tomb and see that she is a vampire. They stake her heart, behead her, and fill her mouth with garlic. Jonathan Harker and his new bride Mina return and join the campaign against Dracula.

Everyone stays at Seward&#x27;s asylum as the men begin to hunt Dracula. Van Helsing finally reveals that vampires can only rest on earth from their homeland. Dracula communicates with Seward&#x27;s patient, Renfield, an insane man who eats vermin to absorb their life force. After Dracula learns of the group&#x27;s plot against him, he uses Renfield to enter the asylum. He secretly attacks Mina three times, drinking her blood each time and forcing Mina to drink his blood on the final visit, cursing her to become a vampire after her death unless Dracula is killed. The men discover that Dracula has distributed his boxes of earth around various properties in London. After sterilizing most of the distributed boxes, the group fails to trap the Count in his Piccadilly house and learns that Dracula is fleeing to his castle in Transylvania with his last box. Using hypnosis, Van Helsing exploits Mina&#x27;s faint psychic connection to Dracula to track his movements and they pursue, guided by Mina.

In Galatz, Romania, the hunters split up. Van Helsing and Mina go to Dracula&#x27;s castle, where the professor destroys the vampire women. Harker and Holmwood pursue Dracula&#x27;s boat on the river, while Morris and Seward follow them on land. Dracula&#x27;s box is loaded onto a wagon by Romani men; the hunters attack and rout the Romani. Harker decapitates Dracula as Quincey stabs him in the heart. Dracula crumbles to dust, freeing Mina from her vampiric curse. Quincey is mortally wounded in the fight against the Romani. He dies, at peace knowing that Mina is saved. A note by Jonathan Harker seven years later states that the Harkers have a son, named Quincey.

== Background ==

=== Author ===
In a letter to American poet Walt Whitman, Bram Stoker described his own temperament as &quot;secretive to the world&quot;, but he nonetheless led a relatively public life. Before &quot;Dracula&quot; was published, Stoker was already well known in the theatrical world as the assistant manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London and personal assistant to the stage actor Henry Irving. Stoker supplemented his income from the theatre by writing romance and sensation novels, and he had published 18 books by his death in 1912. &quot;Dracula&quot; was Stoker&#x27;s seventh published book, following &quot;The Shoulder of Shasta&quot; (1895) and preceding &quot;Miss Betty&quot; (1898). Stoker&#x27;s grand-nephew, Daniel Farson, wrote that Stoker may have died from syphilis, but this is widely disputed by scholars. Hall Caine, a close friend of Stoker&#x27;s, wrote an obituary for him in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, saying that—besides his biography on Irving—Stoker wrote only &quot;to sell&quot; and &quot;had no higher aims&quot;.

=== Inspiration ===

Folkloric vampires predate Stoker&#x27;s Dracula by hundreds of years. Stoker adopted some characteristics of folkloric vampires for his own, such as their aversion to garlic and staking as a means of killing them. He invented other attributes—for example, Stoker&#x27;s vampires must be invited into one&#x27;s home, sleep on earth from their homeland and have no reflection in mirrors. Sunlight is not fatal to Dracula in the novel—this was an invention of the unauthorised &quot;Dracula&quot; film, &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922)—but it does weaken him. Some of Stoker&#x27;s inventions applied unrelated lore to vampires for the first time; for example, Dracula has no reflection because of a folkloric concept that mirrors show the human soul. Some Irish scholars have suggested Irish folklore as an inspiration for the novel, for example the revenant Abhartach, and the 11th-century High King of Ireland Brian Boru. &quot;Dracula&quot; scholar Elizabeth Miller notes that in his childhood Stoker was exposed to supernatural tales and Irish oral history involving premature burials and staked bodies.

Count Dracula has literary progenitors. John William Polidori&#x27;s &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819) includes an aristocratic vampire with powers of seduction. The lesbian vampire of Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;Carmilla&quot; (1872) can transform into a cat, as Dracula can transform into a dog. Dracula resembles earlier Gothic villains in appearance, with Miller comparing him to the villains of Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Italian&quot; (1796) and Matthew Gregory Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Monk&quot; (1796).

There is almost unanimous consensus that Dracula was inspired, in part, by Henry Irving. Scholars note the Count&#x27;s tall and lean physique and aquiline nose, with &quot;Dracula&quot; scholar William Hughes specifically citing the influence of Irving&#x27;s performance as Shylock in a Lyceum Theatre production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. Stoker&#x27;s contemporaries remarked upon the similarity. Stoker had praised a performance of Irving as &quot;a wonderful impression of a dead man fictitiously alive [with eyes like] cinders of glowing red from out the marble face&quot;. Louis S. Warren writes that &quot;Dracula&quot; was founded on &quot;the fear and animosity his employer inspired in him&quot;. Miller contests this, describing Stoker&#x27;s attitude towards him as &quot;adulation&quot;.

Historical figures have been suggested as inspirations for Count Dracula but there is no consensus. In a 1972 book, Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu popularised the idea that Ármin Vámbéry supplied Stoker with information about Vlad Dracula, commonly known as Vlad the Impaler. Their investigation, however, found nothing about &quot;Vlad, Dracula, or vampires&quot; within Vámbéry&#x27;s published papers, nor in Stoker&#x27;s notes about their meeting. Miller calls the link to Vlad III &quot;tenuous&quot;, indicating that Stoker incorporated a large amount of &quot;insignificant detail&quot; from his research, and rhetorically asking why he would omit Vlad III&#x27;s infamous cruelty. McNally additionally suggested in 1983 that the crimes of Elizabeth Báthory inspired Stoker. A book used by Stoker for research, &quot;The Book of Were-Wolves&quot;, does contain some information on Báthory, but Stoker never took notes from the short section devoted to her. Miller and her co-author Robert Eighteen-Bisang concur that there is no evidence Báthory inspired Stoker.

== Textual history ==
=== Composition ===

Prior to writing the novel, Stoker researched extensively, assembling over 100 pages of notes, including chapter summaries and plot outlines. Stoker undertook some of his research at a library at Whitby in the summer of 1890 but most was done at the London Library. The earliest dated notes are from 8 March 1890, comprising an outline of the novel&#x27;s opening. Joseph S. Beirman notes that it differs from the final novel &quot;in only a few details&quot;: The Count and Harker are not given names. The word &quot;vampire&quot; is not used explicitly, but it depicts the Count&#x27;s possessive fury over Harker and a female who attempts &quot;to kiss him not on lips but throat&quot;. In February 1892, Stoker wrote a 27-chapter outline of the novel; according to Miller, &quot;all the key pieces of the jigsaw were in place&quot;.

Stoker&#x27;s notes reveal other scrapped concepts. Bierman says that Stoker always intended to write an epistolary novel but originally set it in Styria instead of Transylvania. Other concepts from the notes include a German professor called Max Windshoeffel confronting a &quot;Count Wampyr&quot; and one of the vampire hunters would have been slain by a werewolf. Stoker biographer Barbara Belford notes evidence that Stoker intended to write a detective story, with a detective called Cotford and a psychical investigator called Singleton.

Stoker took the name Dracula from William Wilkinson&#x27;s history of Wallachia and Moldavia (1820), which he probably found in Whitby&#x27;s public library while holidaying there in 1890. Stoker copied the following footnote from the book: &quot;Dracula means devil. Wallachians were accustomed to give it as a surname to any person who rendered himself conspicuous by courage, cruel actions or cunning&quot;. 

Stoker stated that that it took him about three years to write the novel, and it is likely that he wrote most of the manuscript during his summer holidays in Cruden Bay, Scotland from 1893 to 1896. Stoker generally wrote in spare time from his duties as Irving&#x27;s business manager, and the long gestation of the novel is indicative of the importance he placed on it.

=== Publication ===

Early Stoker biographer Barbara Belford noted the novel looked &quot;shabby&quot; because of a last-minute title change; the printer&#x27;s copy of the typescript, with hand-written amendments, is titled &quot;The Un-Dead&quot;. The surviving typewritten publishing agreement was signed and dated 25 May 1897; Peter Beal of Sotheby&#x27;s suggests its signing one day before the official publication date indicates that it was a formality. To protect his copyright interest for adaptations, Stoker organised a reading of his stage adaptation of the novel in the week before publication in the Lyceum Theatre. A small group, primarily theatre staff, attended the reading, and Edith Craig played Mina.

Bound in yellow cloth and titled in red letters, &quot;Dracula&quot; was published in May 1897 by Archibald Constable and Company. It cost 6 shillings. Uncertainty exists around the exact date of publication, but it was probably published on 26 May 1897. Stoker wrote to William Gladstone that the novel would be released on the 26th. Eighteen-Bisang states it could have been published anywhere from late May to June 1897.

Stoker&#x27;s mother, Charlotte Stoker, enthused about the novel and predicted it would bring her son immense financial success. She was wrong: the novel, although reviewed well, failed to earn Stoker much money and did not establish his critical reputation until after his death. For the first thousand sales of &quot;Dracula&quot;, Stoker earned no royalties. Following serialisation by American newspapers, Doubleday &amp; McClure published an American edition in 1899 with some textual changes. A cheaper paperback version was published by Constable in 1901, but few copies have survived. The text is around 15% shorter than the original but it is not known if Stoker made the amendments. Since its publication, &quot;Dracula&quot; has never been out of print.

An edition of the novel edited by McNally and Florescu in 1979 was the first to include &quot;Dracula&quot;&#x27;s &quot;missing chapter&quot;, &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Guest&quot;. Bram&#x27;s widow Florence Stoker included the chapter as a short story in &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Guest and Other Weird Tales&quot; (1914), two years after his death. According to Clive Leatherdale in the &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot;, there is a &quot;widely held view&quot; that the prose is &quot;the excised first chapter of Dracula&quot;; he contests this, noting that the material was incorporated elsewhere in the novel.

== Style ==
=== Epistolary structure ===
&quot;Dracula&quot; is an epistolary novel. Compared to other elements of the novel, critic David Seed writes that its epistolary structure has been neglected in analyses. Critics note Stoker&#x27;s decision to structure the novel this way may relate to a 19th-century trend of publishing diaries and travelogue accounts, especially with Harker&#x27;s account of the journey to Transylvania. Seed writes that Harker&#x27;s initial four chapters function as a &quot;miniaturised-pastiche-Gothic novel&quot;—replacing Radcliffe&#x27;s use of the Apennine Mountains in &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; (1794) with the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania—and places this within the Gothic tradition of intertextuality.

David Seed argues that the structure only provides a narrative voice to Dracula&#x27;s opponents, while Miller writes that the &quot;collaborative narration&quot; reinforces the idea that Dracula must be defeated by the combined effort of his opponents. Allison Case says Seed views that Dracula&#x27;s absence generates tension by offering only &quot;tantalizing glimpses&quot; of his activities, while literary critic Franco Moretti writes that it highlights the power struggle between the vampire and his hunters. Similarly, Allison Case views the structure as representing a power struggle between Mina and the male protagonists for &quot;narrative mastery&quot;. Seed notes that the narrative&#x27;s style distances the reader from its plot. Dracula&#x27;s journey on the &quot;Demeter&quot; is captured by the captain on the logbook, then &quot;translated by the Russian consul, transcribed by a local journalist, and finally pasted by Mina into her journal&quot;.

=== Gothic genre ===
&quot;Dracula&quot; is an enduring work of Gothic literature, with some critics locating it within the traditions of Irish Gothic or Urban Gothic. John C. Tibbetts considers &quot;Dracula&quot; a prototype for later themes in the Gothic genre. The novel is characteristically Gothic in its depiction of the supernatural, preoccupation with the past, and embodying of the racial, gendered and sexual anxieties of fin de siècle England. Count Dracula generally represents these tensions: cultural critic Jack Halberstam notes that he is masculinised and feminised; Jerrold E. Hogle highlights his attraction to both Jonathan and Mina, and his appearance as racially western and eastern. Miller notes that the Count&#x27;s physical characteristics were typical of Gothic villains during Stoker&#x27;s lifetime, specifically citing his hooked nose, pallor, large moustache and thick eyebrows as influenced by his villainous predecessors. &quot;Dracula&quot; deviates from other Gothic tales before it by firmly establishing its time as the modern era, a point raised by one contemporary reviewer. Writers of the mode were drawn to the Eastern Europe setting because travelogues presented it as a land of primitive superstitions.

==Reception==
Modern critics frequently write that &quot;Dracula&quot; had a mixed critical reception upon publication. Carol Margaret Davison, for example, notes an &quot;uneven&quot; response from critics contemporary to Stoker. John Edgar Browning, a scholar whose research focuses on &quot;Dracula&quot; and literary vampires, conducted a review of the novel&#x27;s early criticism in 2012 and determined that &quot;Dracula&quot; had been &quot;a critically acclaimed novel&quot;. Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Dracula&quot; (1972) mentions the novel&#x27;s &quot;immediate success&quot;. Other works about &quot;Dracula&quot; also published in 1972 concur; Gabriel Ronay says the novel was &quot;recognised by fans and critics alike as a horror writer&#x27;s stroke of genius&quot;, and Anthony Masters mentions the novel&#x27;s &quot;enormous popular appeal&quot;. Since the 1970s, &quot;Dracula&quot; has been the subject of significant academic interest; the novel has spawned many nonfiction books and articles, and has a dedicated peer-reviewed journal. The novel&#x27;s complexity has permitted a flexibility of interpretation, with Anca Andriescu Garcia describing interest from scholars of psychoanalysis, postcolonialism, social class and the Gothic genre.
Reviewers frequently compared the novel to other Gothic writers. Comparisons to novelist Wilkie Collins and &quot;The Woman in White&quot; (1859) were especially common, owing to similarities in structure and style. A review appearing in &quot;The Bookseller&quot; notes that the novel could almost have been written by Collins, and an anonymous review in &quot;Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art&quot; wrote that &quot;Dracula&quot; improved upon the style of Gothic pioneer Ann Radcliffe; Radcliffe was also referenced by &quot;The Daily Mail,&quot; which also highlighted &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818), and &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; (1839). Another anonymous writer described Stoker as &quot;the Edgar Allan Poe of the nineties&quot;. Other favourable comparisons to other Gothic novelists included the Brontë sisters and Mary Shelley. Arthur Conan Doyle sent a letter to Stoker after reading &quot;Dracula&quot;, writing: &quot;The old Professor is most excellent and so are the two girls. I congratulate you with all my heart for having written so fine a book.&quot;

Many of these early reviews were charmed by Stoker&#x27;s treatment of the vampire myth. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called it the best vampire story ever written. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reviewer noted that while earlier Gothic works, like &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, had kept the supernatural far away from the novelists&#x27; home countries, &quot;Dracula&quot; horrors occurred in foreign lands and at home in Whitby and Hampstead Heath. An Australian paper, &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, regarded the novel as simultaneously sensational and domestic. One reviewer praised the &quot;considerable power&quot; of Stoker&#x27;s prose and described it as impressionistic. They were less fond of the parts set in England, finding the vampire suited better to tales set far away from home. The British magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; found Dracula&#x27;s disdain for garlic unintentionally funny.

&quot;Dracula&quot; was considered frightening. A review appearing in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; in 1897 praised its capacity to entertain, but concluded that Stoker erred in including so much horror. Likewise, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; opined that the novel was &quot;praiseworthy&quot; and absorbing, but could not recommend it to those who were not &quot;strong&quot;. Stoker&#x27;s prose was commended as effective in sustaining the novel&#x27;s horror by many publications. A reviewer for the &quot;San Francisco Wave&quot; called the novel a &quot;literary failure&quot;; they elaborated that coupling vampires with frightening imagery, such as insane asylums and &quot;unnatural appetites&quot;, made the horror too overt, and that other works in the genre, such as &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; (1886), had more restraint.

== Context and interpretation ==

=== Sexuality and gender ===
Sexuality and seduction are two of the novel&#x27;s most frequently discussed themes, and modern critical writings about vampirism widely acknowledge its link to sex and sexuality. Across the novel&#x27;s critical history, Miller writes that theorists have collectively argued that the Count breaks virtually &quot;every Victorian taboo&quot;, including non-procreative sex (including fellatio), transgressive sexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.

Transgressive or abnormal sexuality within &quot;Dracula&quot; is a broad topic. Some psychosexual critics focus on the disruption of Victorian gender roles; within the Victorian context, Christopher Craft writes males had &quot;the right and responsibility of vigorous appetite&quot; while women were required to &quot;suffer and be still&quot;. Critics highlight the many places in which the novel disrupts these social mores: Jonathan Harker&#x27;s excitement over the prospect of being penetrated; Dracula&#x27;s resulting anger and jealousy; and Lucy&#x27;s transformation into a sexually aggressive predator who drains &quot;vital fluid&quot;. Some critics, including professor Carol Senf, argue that the novel reflects anxiety about female sexual awakening as a threat to established norms.

&quot;Dracula&quot; contains no overt homosexual acts, but homosexuality or homoeroticism is a theme discussed by critics. Christopher Craft argues that the primary threat Dracula poses is that he will &quot;seduce, penetrate, [and] drain another male&quot;, and reads Harker&#x27;s excitement to submit as a proxy for &quot;an implicitly homoerotic desire&quot;. Victorian readers would have identified Dracula with sexual threat. Some critics note that changes made to the 1899 American version of the text reinforce this subtext, wherein Dracula states he will feed on Harker. Critics have variously linked these themes to homoerotic letters Stoker wrote to Walt Whitman, his friendship with Oscar Wilde, his intensely emotional relationship with Irving, and contemporary rumours of Stoker&#x27;s almost sexless marriage. David J. Skal acknowledged the letters&#x27; subtext but cautioned against applying anachronistic modern sexual labels to Stoker.

Many critics have suggested that the novel reveals a &quot;reactionary response&quot; to the New Woman phenomenon. This is a late-Victorian term used to describe an emerging class of women with increased social and economic control over their lives. Several critics describe the battle against Dracula as a fight for control over women&#x27;s bodies. Senf suggests that Stoker was ambivalent about the New Woman phenomenon, while Signorroti argues that the novel&#x27;s discomfort with female sexual autonomy reflects Stoker&#x27;s dislike for the movement. Both Lucy and Mina have characteristics associated with the New Woman; Mina, who plays an important role in Dracula&#x27;s defeat, repeatedly expresses contempt for the concept. Senf notes that Lucy is punished for expressing dissatisfaction with her social position as a woman. After her transformation into a vampire, her defeat by the vampire hunters symbolises the re-establishment of &quot;male supremacy&quot;.

===Race===
&quot;Dracula&quot;, and specifically the Count&#x27;s migration to Victorian England, is frequently read as emblematic of invasion literature, and a projection of fears about racial pollution. In an influential postcolonialist analysis, Stephen Arata describes the novel&#x27;s cultural context of mounting anxiety in Britain over the decline of the British Empire, the rise of other world powers, and a &quot;growing domestic unease&quot; over the morality of imperial colonisation. Arata regards the novel as an instance of &quot;reverse colonisation&quot;: fear of other races invading England and weakening its racial purity. Patricia McKee writes that Dracula represents a negation of white culture while Mina represents &quot;pure whiteness&quot;. Dracula can be said to both kill white bodies and turn them into the racial Other in death. Some critics connect the racialisation of Dracula to his depiction as a degenerate criminal.

Critics frequently identify antisemitic themes and imagery in the novel. Between 1891 and 1900, the number of Jews living in England increased sixfold, mainly due to antisemitic legislation and pogroms in eastern Europe. Examples cited by Jack Halberstam of antisemitic connections include Dracula&#x27;s appearance, wealth, parasitic bloodlust, and &quot;lack of allegiance&quot; to one country. Dracula&#x27;s appearance resembles some other cultural depictions of Jews, such as Fagin in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838), and Svengali of George du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Trilby&quot; (1895). Jewish people were frequently described as parasites in Victorian literature; Halberstam highlights fears that Jews would spread diseases of the blood, and one journalist&#x27;s description of Jews as &quot;Yiddish bloodsuckers&quot;. Daniel Renshaw writes that any antisemitism in the text is &quot;semi-subliminal&quot;; he writes that Dracula is not Jewish but does reflect the 19th-century conception of Jewish people. Renshaw frames the novel more broadly as a general suspicion of all foreigners.

The novel&#x27;s depiction of Slovaks and Romani people has attracted limited scholarly attention. In the novel, Harker describes the Slovaks as &quot;barbarians&quot; and their boats as &quot;primitive&quot;, reflecting his imperialistic condescension towards other cultures. Peter Arnds writes that the Count&#x27;s control over the Romani and his abduction of young children evoke folk superstitions about Romani people stealing children, and that his ability to transform into a wolf is related to xenophobic beliefs about the Romani as animalistic. Croley argues that Dracula&#x27;s association with the Romani made him suspect in the eyes of Victorian England, where they were stigmatised owing to beliefs that they ate &quot;unclean meat&quot; and lived among animals.

=== Religion, superstition and science ===
&quot;Dracula&quot; is saturated with religious imagery. Christopher Herbert regards the novel as a parable about conflict with an enemy who opposes Christ and Christianity. Scholars discuss the novel&#x27;s depiction of religion in relation to late Victorian anxieties about the threat which secularism, scientific rationalism and the occult posed to Christian beliefs and morality. Stoker himself had a lifelong interest in supernatural inquiry, and Herbert writes that he mixes the supernatural and superstitious beliefs with religious elements, resulting in metaphors about moral uncleanness becoming literal elements of the text&#x27;s &quot;occult reality&quot;. Herbert notes that the blood of Christ is important to Christian ritual and imagery, and Richard Noll notes that actual consumption of human blood is one of the oldest Judeo-Christian taboos.

The vampire hunters use many weapons—including Christian practices and symbols (prayer, crucifixes and consecrated hosts), folkloric practices (garlic, staking and decapitation) and contemporary technology (typewriters, phonographs, telegrams, blood transfusions and Winchester rifles)—in their battle against Dracula. Sanders argues that Stoker presents Christianity as a religion that can be instrumentalised and incorporated into scientific knowledge. Herbert describes Van Helsing&#x27;s &quot;Christian purification&quot; of Lucy as punitively addressing her promiscuity, and the resulting framing of Christianity as a means towards the &quot;eradication of deviancy&quot;.

=== Political and economic ===

Critics discuss the novel in relation to British rule in Ireland and Irish nationalism. Considerable debate exists over whether &quot;Dracula&quot; is an Irish novel; while it is largely set in England, Stoker was born in British-ruled Ireland and lived there for the first 30 years of his life. Though born into a Protestant family, he was distanced from the religion&#x27;s more conservative factions.

Ralph Ingelbien notes that &quot;recognizably nationalist&quot; critics like Terry Eagleton and Seamus Deane favoured readings of Dracula as &quot;a bloodthirsty caricature of the aristocratic landlord&quot; where the vampire represents the death of feudalism. Bruce Stewart changes the focus to the lower classes, suggesting Dracula and his Romani followers more likely represented violence by Irish National Land League activists. Michael Valdez Moses compares Dracula to the disgraced Charles Stewart Parnell, leader of the Irish Home Rule movement from 1880 to 1882. Robert Smart argues that Stoker&#x27;s experience during the Great Famine (1845–1852) influenced the novel, with Stewart also noting this as historical context.

Some critics discuss Count Dracula&#x27;s noble title. Literary critic Franco Moretti writes that he is an aristocrat &quot;only in a manner of speaking&quot;, citing his lack of servants, simple clothing, and lack of aristocratic hobbies. Moretti suggests that Dracula&#x27;s blood thirst represents capital&#x27;s desire to accumulate more capital. More generally, Moretti argues the novel evinces cultural anxiety about foreign capitalist monopolies functioning as a return of feudalism. Chris Baldick maintains this line of analysis, describing Dracula as an undead symbol of feudalism but concluding that the novel is more concerned with &quot;sexual and religious terrors&quot;. Mark Neocleous writes that Dracula symbolises the victory of the bourgeoisie over feudalism. In &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, Karl Marx compared the bourgeoisie&#x27;s exploitation of workers to a vampire draining blood. He uses vampires as a metaphor three times in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, but these predate the writing of &quot;Dracula.&quot;

=== Disease ===
Contagious disease was a topic of social and medical concern in late Victorian England. Vampirism can represent disease, being both an initial infection and the resulting illness. The novel characterises vampirism with terms from social degeneration theory, an 18th- and 19th-century social and biological concept arising from fear over the deterioration of the &quot;human condition&quot;; Victorian psychiatry, known then as &quot;alienism&quot;; and anthropology. Theories of degeneracy propagated Victorian-era beliefs about poor moral character being transmissible like a pathogen. Jack Halberstam writes that Dracula and Renfield&#x27;s relationship suggests that vampirism is &quot;a psychological disorder, an addictive activity&quot;. He notes that Renfield, and by association Dracula, is described by doctors using terminology more appropriate for describing animals. Brian Aldiss writes that Count Dracula represents the initial disease while Renfield&#x27;s madness is a symptom of advanced infection. Halbertstam highlights that disease was frequently associated with Jews during the period. Sexually transmitted infection, particularly syphilis, is a frequent topic. Literary critic Martin Willis writes that the novel depicts Victorian discourse over the origin, cause and treatment of disease, especially in the context of Lucy&#x27;s treatment and eventual death.

==Legacy==
=== Adaptations ===
&quot;Dracula&quot; has been adapted many times across virtually all forms of media. Scholars John Edgar Browning and Caroline Joan S. Picart note that the novel and its characters have been adapted for film, television, video games and animation over 700 times, with nearly 1000 additional appearances in comic books and on the stage; in 2015, the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; named Dracula the most portrayed literary character, noting he had appeared almost twice as much as Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes. Literary critic Roberto Fernández Retamar deemed Count Dracula—alongside Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, Mickey Mouse and Superman—to be a part of the &quot;hegemonic Anglo-Saxon world[&#x27;s] cinematic fodder&quot;. Across the world, new adaptations can be produced as often as every week.

Adaptations were produced during Stoker&#x27;s lifetime. Stoker&#x27;s first theatrical adaptation (&quot;Dracula, or The Undead&quot;); was read once at the Lyceum Theatre. The manuscript was believed lost, but the British Library possess extracts of the novel&#x27;s galley proof containing Stoker&#x27;s handwritten stage directions and dialogue attribution. A Swedish newspaper serialised an adaptation from June 1899 to February 1900 as &quot;Mörkrets Makter&quot; (&quot;Powers of Darkness&quot;). This version is almost twice as long as Stoker&#x27;s novel, containing elements included in Stoker&#x27;s notes but not in the published novel. The adaptation contains an author&#x27;s preface signed &quot;B. S&quot;, which Eighteen-Bisang and Miller conclude was not written by Stoker. Although believed lost, the Swedish adaptation was rediscovered and published in 2017. In 1901, Valdimar Ásmundsson translated a heavily abridged version of the Swedish adaptation into Icelandic under the title &quot;Makt Myrkranna&quot; (&quot;Powers of Darkness&quot;). The adaptation included an abridged author&#x27;s preface, purportedly by Stoker. Scholars knew the Icelandic version had existed since the 1980s because of Stoker&#x27;s preface. When the Swedish translation was rediscovered, scholars learned that the Icelandic version had been translated from it rather than Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;.

The first film to feature Count Dracula was a Hungarian silent film—Károly Lajthay&#x27;s &quot;Drakula halála&quot; (). The film allegedly premiered in 1921 but this release date has been questioned by some scholars. Very little of the film survives, and David J. Skal notes that the cover artist for the 1926 Hungarian edition of the novel was more influenced by the second adaptation of &quot;Dracula&quot;, F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922). Critic Wayne E. Hensley writes that the narrative of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; differs significantly from the novel, but that characters have clear counterparts. Bram Stoker&#x27;s widow, Florence, initiated legal action against Prana, the studio behind &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. The legal case lasted two or three years, with Prana agreeing to destroy all copies in May 1924.
Visual representations of the Count have changed significantly over time. Early treatments of Dracula&#x27;s appearance were established by theatrical productions in London and New York. Later prominent portrayals of the character by Béla Lugosi (in a 1931 adaptation) and Christopher Lee (firstly in the 1958 film and later its sequels) built upon earlier versions. Chiefly, Dracula&#x27;s early visual style involved a black-red colour scheme and slicked back hair. Lee&#x27;s portrayal was overtly sexual, and also popularised fangs on screen. Gary Oldman&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992), directed by Francis Ford Coppola and costumed by Eiko Ishioka, established a new default look for the character—a Romanian accent and long hair. The assortment of adaptations feature many different dispositions and characteristics of the Count.

===Influence===

&quot;Dracula&quot; is one of the most famous and influential works of English literature. Although not the first novel to depict vampires, the work dominates both popular and scholarly treatments of vampire fiction. For many people, Count Dracula is the first character to come to mind when discussing vampires. &quot;Dracula&quot; succeeded by drawing together folklore, legend, vampire fiction and the conventions of the Gothic novel. Humanities scholar Wendy Doniger described the novel as vampire literature&#x27;s &quot;centrepiece, rendering all other vampires BS [Before Stoker] or AS [After Stoker]&quot;.

It profoundly shaped the popular understanding of how vampires function, including their strengths, weaknesses, and other characteristics. Bats had been associated with vampires before &quot;Dracula&quot; as a result of the vampire bat&#x27;s existence—for example, &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; (1847) included an image of a bat on its cover illustration—but Stoker deepened the association by making Dracula able to transform into one. That was, in turn, quickly taken up by film studios looking for opportunities to use special effects. Novelist Patrick McGrath notes that many of the Count&#x27;s characteristics have been adopted by artists succeeding Stoker in depicting vampires, turning those fixtures into clichés. Aside from the Count&#x27;s ability to transform, McGrath specifically highlights his hatred of garlic and crucifixes. William Hughes writes critically of the Count&#x27;s cultural omnipresence, noting that the character of Dracula has &quot;seriously inhibited&quot; discussions of the undead in Gothic fiction.

Count Dracula&#x27;s cultural omnipresence is widely reported to have negatively impact academic analyses of the undead. He is &quot;&quot;the&quot; reference point&quot; to which all other vampires are compared. In the 1930s, Universal Studios initiated development on a &quot;Dracula&quot; film and it was revealed that Stoker failed to comply with United States copyright law. This prematurely placed the novel into the public domain in the United States. Stoker&#x27;s error may have contributed to the novel&#x27;s enduring status because writers and producers did not need to pay a licence fee to use the character.
