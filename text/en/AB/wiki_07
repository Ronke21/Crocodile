<text>Chicano (masculine form) or Chicana (feminine form) is an ethnic identity for Mexican Americans that emerged from the Chicano Movement. &quot;Chicano&quot; was originally a classist and racist slur used toward low-income Mexicans that was reclaimed in the 1940s among youth who belonged to the Pachuco and Pachuca subculture.

In the 1960s, &quot;Chicano&quot; was widely reclaimed among Hispanics in the building of a movement toward political empowerment, ethnic solidarity, and pride in being of Indigenous descent (with many using the Nahuatl language or names).

&quot;Chicano&quot; was used in a sense separate from &quot;Mexican American&quot; identity. Youth in &quot;barrios&quot; rejected cultural assimilation into mainstream American culture and embraced their own identity and worldview as a form of empowerment and resistance. The community forged an independent political and cultural movement, sometimes working alongside the Black power movement.

The Chicano Movement faltered by the mid-1970s as a result of external and internal pressures. It was under state surveillance, infiltration, and repression by U.S. government agencies, informants, and agent provocateurs, such as through the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO. The Chicano Movement also had a fixation on masculine pride and machismo that fractured the community through sexism toward Chicanas and homophobia toward queer Chicano/as.

In the 1980s, increased assimilation and economic mobility motivated many to embrace &quot;Hispanic&quot; identity in an era of conservatism. The term &quot;Hispanic&quot; emerged from consultation between the U.S. government and Mexican-American political elites in the Hispanic Caucus of Congress. They used the term to identify themselves and the community with mainstream American culture, depart from &quot;Chicanismo,&quot; and distance themselves from what they perceived as the &quot;militant&quot; Black Caucus.
At the grassroots level, Chicano/as continued to build the feminist, gay and lesbian, and anti-apartheid movements, which kept the identity politically relevant. After a decade of &quot;Hispanic&quot; dominance, Chicano student activism in the early 1990s recession and the anti-Gulf War movement revived the identity with a demand to expand Chicano studies programs. Chicanas were active at the forefront, despite facing critiques from &quot;movement loyalists&quot;, as they did in the Chicano Movement. Chicana feminists addressed employment discrimination, environmental racism, healthcare, sexual violence, and exploitation in their communities and in solidarity with the Third World. Chicanas worked to &quot;liberate her &quot;entire people&quot;&quot;; not to oppress men, but to be equal partners in the movement. &quot;Xicanisma&quot;, coined by Ana Castillo in 1994, called for Chicana/os to &quot;reinsert the forsaken feminine into our consciousness&quot;, to embrace one&#x27;s Indigenous roots, and support Indigenous sovereignty.

In the 2000s, earlier traditions of anti-imperialism in the Chicano Movement were expanded. Building solidarity with undocumented immigrants became more important, despite issues of legal status and economic competitiveness sometimes maintaining distance between groups. U.S. foreign interventions abroad were connected with domestic issues concerning the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States. Chicano/a consciousness increasingly became transnational and transcultural, thinking beyond and bridging with communities over political borders. The identity was renewed based on Indigenous and decolonial consciousness, cultural expression, resisting gentrification, defense of immigrants, and the rights of women and queer people. &quot;Xicanx&quot; identity also emerged in the 2010s, based on the Chicana feminist intervention of &quot;Xicanisma&quot;.

== Etymology ==

The etymology of the term &quot;Chicano&quot; is the subject of some debate by historians. Some believe &quot;Chicano&quot; is a Spanish language derivative of an older Nahuatl word &quot;Mexitli&quot; (&quot;Meh-shee-tlee&quot;). Mexitli formed part of the expression &quot;Huitzilopochtlil Mexitli&quot;—a reference to the historic migration of the Mexica people from their homeland of Aztlán to the Valley of Mexico. Mexitli is the root of the word &quot;Mexica&quot;, which refers to the Mexica people, and its singular form &quot;Mexihcatl&quot; (). The &quot;x&quot; in Mexihcatl represents an /ʃ/ or &quot;sh&quot; sound in both Nahuatl and early modern Spanish, while the glottal stop in the middle of the Nahuatl word disappeared.

The word &quot;Chicano&quot; may derive from the loss of the initial syllable of &quot;Mexicano&quot; (Mexican). According to Villanueva, &quot;given that the velar (x) is a palatal phoneme (S) with the spelling (sh),&quot; in accordance with the Indigenous phonological system of the Mexicas (&quot;Meshicas&quot;), it would become &quot;Meshicano&quot; or &quot;Mechicano.&quot; In this explanation, &quot;Chicano&quot; comes from the &quot;xicano&quot; in &quot;Mexicano.&quot; Some Chicanos replace the &quot;Ch&quot; with the letter &quot;X&quot;, or &quot;Xicano&quot;, to reclaim the Nahuatl &quot;sh&quot; sound. The first two syllables of &quot;Xicano&quot; are therefore in Nahuatl while the last syllable is Castilian.

In Mexico&#x27;s Indigenous regions, Indigenous people refer to members of the non-Indigenous majority as &quot;mexicanos&quot;, referring to the modern nation of Mexico. Among themselves, the speaker identifies by their &#x27; (village or tribal) identity, such as Mayan, Zapotec, Mixtec, Huastec, or any of the other hundreds of Indigenous groups. A newly emigrated Nahuatl speaker in an urban center might have referred to his cultural relatives in this country, different from himself, as &#x27;, shortened to &quot;Chicanos&quot; or &quot;Xicanos.&quot;

== Usage of terms ==

=== Early recorded use ===

The town of &quot;Chicana&quot; was shown on the Gutiérrez 1562 New World map near the mouth of the Colorado River, and is probably pre-Columbian in origin. The town was again included on , a 1566 French map by Paolo Forlani. Roberto Cintli Rodríguez places the location of &quot;Chicana&quot; at the mouth of the Colorado River, near present-day Yuma, Arizona. An 18th century map of the Nayarit Missions used the name &quot;Xicana&quot; for a town near the same location of &quot;Chicana&quot;, which is considered to be the oldest recorded usage of that term.

A gunboat, the &quot;Chicana&quot;, was sold in 1857 to Jose Maria Carvajal to ship arms on the Rio Grande. The King and Kenedy firm submitted a voucher to the Joint Claims Commission of the United States in 1870 to cover the costs of this gunboat&#x27;s conversion from a passenger steamer. No explanation for the boat&#x27;s name is known.

The Chicano poet and writer Tino Villanueva traced the first documented use of the term as an ethnonym to 1911, as referenced in a then-unpublished essay by University of Texas anthropologist José Limón. Linguists Edward R. Simmen and Richard F. Bauerle report the use of the term in an essay by Mexican-American writer, Mario Suárez, published in the &quot;Arizona Quarterly&quot; in 1947. There is ample literary evidence to substantiate that &quot;Chicano&quot; is a long-standing endonym, as a large body of Chicano literature pre-dates the 1950s.

=== Reclaiming the term ===
In the 1940s, &quot;Chicano&quot; was reclaimed by Pachuco youth as an expression of defiance to Anglo-American society. At the time, &quot;Chicano&quot; was used among English and Spanish speakers as a classist and racist slur to refer to working class Mexican Americans in Spanish-speaking neighborhoods. In Mexico, the term was used with &quot;Pocho&quot; &quot;to deride Mexicans living in the United States, and especially their U.S.-born children, for losing their culture, customs, and language.&quot; Mexican anthropologist Manuel Gamio reported in 1930 that &quot;Chicamo&quot; (with an &quot;m&quot;) was used as a derogatory term by Hispanic Texans for recently arrived Mexican immigrants displaced during the Mexican Revolution in the beginning of the early 20th century.

By the 1950s, &quot;Chicano&quot; referred to those who resisted total assimilation, while &quot;Pocho&quot; referred (often pejoratively) to those who strongly advocated for assimilation. In his essay &quot;Chicanismo&quot; in &quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures&quot; (2002), José Cuéllar, dates the transition from derisive to positive to the late 1950s, with increasing use by young Mexican-American high school students. These younger, politically aware Mexican Americans adopted the term &quot;as an act of political defiance and ethnic pride&quot;, similar to the reclaiming of &quot;Black&quot; by African Americans. The Chicano Movement during the 1960s and early 1970s played a significant role in reclaiming &quot;Chicano,&quot; challenging those who used it as a term of derision on both sides of the Mexico-U.S. border.

Demographic differences in the adoption of &quot;Chicano&quot; occurred at first. It was more likely to be used by males than females, and less likely to be used among those of higher socioeconomic status. Usage was also generational, with third-generation men more likely to use the word. This group was also younger, more political, and different from traditional Mexican cultural heritage. &quot;Chicana&quot; was a similar classist term to refer to &quot;[a] marginalized, brown woman who is treated as a foreigner and is expected to do menial labor and ask nothing of the society in which she lives.&quot; Among Mexican Americans, &quot;Chicano&quot; and &quot;Chicana&quot; began to be viewed as a positive identity of self-determination and political solidarity. In Mexico, &quot;Chicano&quot; may still be associated with a Mexican American person of low importance, class, and poor morals (similar to the terms &quot;Cholo&quot;, &quot;Chulo&quot; and &quot;Majo&quot;), indicating a difference in cultural views.

=== Chicano Movement ===
&quot;Chicano&quot; was widely reclaimed in the 1960s and 1970s during the Chicano Movement to assert a distinct ethnic, political, and cultural identity that resisted assimilation into the mainstream American culture, systematic racism and stereotypes, colonialism, and the American nation-state. Chicano identity formed around seven themes: unity, economy, education, institutions, self-defense, culture, and political liberation, in an effort to bridge regional and class divisions. The notion of Aztlán, a mythical homeland claimed to be located in the southwestern United States, mobilized Mexican Americans to take social and political action. &quot;Chicano&quot; became a unifying term for &quot;mestizos&quot;. &quot;Xicano&quot; was also used in the 1970s.

In the 1970s, Chicanos developed a reverence for machismo while also maintaining the values of their original platform. For instance, Oscar Zeta Acosta defined machismo as the source of Chicano identity, claiming that this &quot;instinctual and mystical source of manhood, honor and pride... alone justifies all behavior.&quot; Armando Rendón wrote in &quot;Chicano Manifesto&quot; (1971) that machismo was &quot;in fact an underlying drive of the gathering identification of Mexican Americans... the essence of &quot;machismo&quot;, of being &quot;macho&quot;, is as much a symbolic principle for the Chicano revolt as it is a guideline for family life.&quot;

From the beginning of the Chicano Movement, some Chicanas criticized the idea that machismo must guide the people and questioned if machismo was &quot;indeed a genuinely Mexican cultural value or a kind of distorted view of masculinity generated by the psychological need to compensate for the indignities suffered by Chicanos in a white supremacist society.&quot; Angie Chabram-Dernersesian found that most of the literature on the Chicano Movement focused on men and boys, while almost none focused on Chicanas. The omission of Chicanas and the machismo of the Chicano Movement led to a shift by the 1990s.

=== Xicanisma ===
&quot;Xicanisma&quot; was coined by Ana Castillo in &quot;Massacre of the Dreamers&quot; (1994) as a recognition of a shift in consciousness since the Chicano Movement and to reinvigorate Chicana feminism. The aim of Xicanisma is not to replace patriarchy with matriarchy, but to create &quot;a nonmaterialistic and nonexploitive society in which feminine principles of nurturing and community prevail&quot;; where the feminine is reinserted into our consciousness rather than subordinated by colonization. The &quot;X&quot; reflects the &quot;Sh&quot; sound in Mesoamerican languages (such as &quot;Tlaxcala&quot;, which is pronounced &quot;Tlash-KAH-lah&quot;), and so marked this sound with a letter X. More than a letter, the &quot;X&quot; in Xicanisma is also a symbol to represent being at a literal crossroads or otherwise embodying hybridity.

&quot;Xicanisma&quot; acknowledges Indigenous survival after hundreds of years of colonization and the need to reclaim one&#x27;s Indigenous roots while also being &quot;committed to the struggle for liberation of all oppressed people&quot;, wrote Francesca A. López. Activists like Guillermo Gómez-Peña, issued &quot;a call for a return to the Amerindian roots of most Latinos as well as a call for a strategic alliance to give agency to Native American groups.&quot; This can include one&#x27;s Indigenous roots from Mexico &quot;as well as those with roots centered in Central and South America,&quot; wrote Francisco Rios. Castillo argued that this shift in language was important because &quot;language is the vehicle by which we perceive ourselves in relation to the world&quot;.

Among a minority of Mexican Americans, the term &quot;Xicanx&quot; may be used to refer to gender non-conformity. Luis J. Rodriguez states that &quot;even though most US Mexicans may not use this term,&quot; that it can be important for gender non-conforming Mexican Americans. &quot;Xicanx&quot; may destabilize aspects of the coloniality of gender in Mexican American communities. Artist Roy Martinez states that it is not &quot;bound to the feminine or masculine aspects&quot; and that it may be &quot;inclusive to anyone who identifies with it&quot;. Some prefer the -e suffix &quot;Xicane&quot; in order to be more in-line with Spanish-speaking language constructs.

== Distinction from other terms ==
=== &quot;Mexican American&quot; ===

In the 1930s, &quot;community leaders promoted the term &quot;Mexican American&quot; to convey an assimilationist ideology stressing white identity,&quot; as noted by legal scholar Ian Haney López. Lisa Y. Ramos argues that &quot;this phenomenon demonstrates why no Black-Brown civil rights effort emerged prior to the 1960s.&quot; Chicano youth rejected the previous generation&#x27;s racial aspirations to assimilate into Anglo-American society and developed a &quot;Pachuco culture that fashioned itself neither as Mexican nor American.&quot;

In the Chicano Movement, possibilities for Black–brown unity arose: &quot;Chicanos defined themselves as proud members of a brown race, thereby rejecting, not only the previous generation&#x27;s assimilationist orientation, but their racial pretensions as well.&quot; Chicano leaders collaborated with Black Power movement leaders and activists. &quot;Mexican Americans&quot; insisted that Mexicans were white, while &quot;Chicanos&quot; embraced being non-white and the development of &quot;brown pride&quot;.

&quot;Mexican American&quot; continued to be used by a more assimilationist faction who wanted to define Mexican Americans &quot;as a white ethnic group that had little in common with African Americans.&quot; Carlos Muñoz argues that the desire to separate themselves from Blackness and political struggle was rooted in an attempt to minimize &quot;the existence of racism toward their own people, [believing] they could &quot;deflect&quot; anti-Mexican sentiment in society&quot; through affiliating with the mainstream American culture.

=== &quot;Hispanic&quot; ===
Etymologically deriving from the Spanish word &quot;Hispano&quot;, referring to the Latin word Hispania, which was used for the Iberian Peninsula under the Roman Republic, the term Hispanic is an Anglicized translation of the Spanish word &quot;Hispano&quot;. Hispano is commonly used in the Spanish speaking world when referring to &quot;Hispanohablantes&quot; (Spanish speakers), &quot;Hispanoamerica&quot; (Spanish-America) and &quot;Hispanos&quot; when referring to the greater social imaginary held by many people across the Americas who descend from Spanish families. The term Hispano is commonly used in the U.S. states of New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado, as well as used in Mexico and other Spanish-American countries when referring to the greater Spanish-speaking world, often referred to as &quot;Latin America&quot;.
Following the decline of the Chicano Movement, &quot;Hispanic&quot; was first defined by the U.S. Federal Office of Management and Budget&#x27;s (OMB) Directive No. 15 in 1977 as &quot;a person of Mexican, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South America or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.&quot; The term was promoted by Mexican American political elites to encourage cultural assimilation into the mainstream culture and move away from &quot;Chicanismo&quot;. The rise of Hispanic identity paralleled the emerging era of political and cultural conservatism in the United States during the 1980s.

Key members of the Mexican American political elite, all of whom were middle-aged men, helped popularize the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; among Mexican Americans. The term was picked up by electronic and print media. Laura E. Gómez conducted a series of interviews with these elites and found that one of the main reasons &quot;Hispanic&quot; was promoted was to move away from &quot;Chicano&quot;: &quot;The Chicano label reflected the more radical political agenda of Mexican-Americans in the 1960s and 1970s, and the politicians who call themselves Hispanic today are the harbingers of a more conservative, more accomadationist politics.&quot;

Gómez found that some of these elites promoted &quot;Hispanic&quot; to appeal to white American sensibilities, particularly in regard to separating themselves from Black political consciousness. Gómez records:Another respondent agreed with this position, contrasting his white colleagues&#x27; perceptions of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus with their perception of the Congressional Black Caucus. &#x27;We certainly haven&#x27;t been militant like the Black Caucus. We&#x27;re seen as a power bloc—an ethnic power bloc striving to deal with mainstream issues.&#x27;In 1980, &quot;Hispanic&quot; was first made available as a self-identification on U.S. census forms. While &quot;Chicano&quot; also appeared on the 1980 U.S. census, it was only permitted to be selected as a subcategory underneath &quot;Spanish/Hispanic descent&quot;, which erased the possibility of Afro-Chicanos, Chicanos of Indigenous descent, and other Chicanos of color. &quot;Chicano&quot; did not appear on any subsequent census forms and &quot;Hispanic&quot; has remained. Since then, &quot;Hispanic&quot; has widely been used by politicians and the media. For this reason, many Chicanos reject the term &quot;Hispanic&quot;.

=== Other terms ===
Instead of or in addition to identifying as Chicano or any of its variations, some may prefer:
* Latino/a, also anglicized as &quot;Latin.&quot; Some US Latinos use Latin as a gender neutral alternative.
* Latin American (especially if immigrant).
* Mexican; &quot;&quot;
* &quot;Brown&quot;
* Mestizo; [insert racial identity ] &#x27; (e.g. &#x27;); &quot;.
* &#x27; (or &#x27;) / &#x27;; &#x27;; &quot;.
* Part/member of &quot;&quot;. (Internal identifier, Spanish for &quot;the Race&quot;)
* American, solely.

== Identity ==

Chicano and Chicana identity reflects elements of ethnic, political, cultural and Indigenous hybridity. These qualities of what constitutes Chicano identity may be expressed by Chicanos differently. Armando Rendón wrote in the &quot;Chicano Manifesto&quot; (1971), &quot;I am Chicano. What it means to me may be different than what it means to you.&quot; Benjamin Alire Sáenz wrote &quot;There is no such thing as the Chicano voice: there are only Chicano and Chicana &quot;voices&quot;.&quot; The identity can be somewhat ambiguous (e.g. in the 1991 Culture Clash play &quot;A Bowl of Beings&quot;, in response to Che Guevara&#x27;s demand for a definition of &quot;Chicano&quot;, an &quot;armchair activist&quot; cries out, &quot;I still don&#x27;t know!&quot;).

Many Chicanos understand themselves as being &quot;neither from here, nor from there&quot;, as neither from the United States or Mexico. Juan Bruce-Novoa wrote in 1990: &quot;A Chicano lives in the space between the hyphen in Mexican-American.&quot; Being Chicano/a may represent the struggle of being institutionally acculturated to assimilate into the Anglo-dominated society of the United States, yet maintaining the cultural sense developed as a Latin-American cultured U.S.-born Mexican child. Rafael Pérez-Torres wrote, &quot;one can no longer assert the wholeness of a Chicano subject ... It is illusory to deny the nomadic quality of the Chicano community, a community in flux that yet survives and, through survival, affirms itself.&quot;

=== Ethnic identity ===

&quot;Chicano&quot; is a way for Mexican Americans to assert ethnic solidarity and &quot;Brown Pride.&quot; Boxer Rodolfo Gonzales was one of the first to reclaim the term in this way. This &quot;Brown Pride&quot; movement established itself alongside the &quot;Black is Beautiful&quot; movement. Chicano identity emerged as a symbol of pride in having a non-white and non-European image of oneself. It challenged the U.S. census designation &quot;Whites with Spanish Surnames&quot; that was used in the 1950s. Chicanos asserted ethnic pride at a time when Mexican assimilation into American culture was being promoted by the U.S. government. Ian Haney López argues that this was to &quot;serve Anglo self-interest&quot;, who claimed Mexicans were white to try to deny racism against them.

Alfred Arteaga argues that Chicano as an ethnic identity is born out of the European colonization of the Americas. He states that Chicano arose as hybrid ethnicity or race amidst colonial violence. This hybridity extends beyond a previously generalized &quot;Aztec&quot; ancestry, since the Indigenous peoples of Mexico are a diverse group of nations and peoples. A 2011 study found that 85 to 90% of maternal mtDNA lineages in Mexican Americans are Indigenous. Chicano ethnic identity may involve more than just Indigenous and Spanish ancestry. It may also include African ancestry (as a result of Spanish slavery or runaway slaves from Anglo-Americans). Arteaga concluded that &quot;the physical manifestation of the Chicano, is itself a product of hybridity.&quot;Robert Quintana Hopkins argues that Afro-Chicanos are sometimes erased from the ethnic identity &quot;because so many people uncritically apply the &#x27;one drop rule&#x27; in the U.S. [which] ignores the complexity of racial hybridity.&quot; Black and Chicano communities have engaged in close political movements and struggles for liberation, yet there have also been tensions between Black and Chicano communities. This has been attributed to racial capitalism and anti-Blackness in Chicano communities. Afro-Chicano rapper Choosey stated &quot;there&#x27;s a stigma that Black and Mexican cultures don&#x27;t get along, but I wanted to show the beauty in being a product of both.&quot;

=== Political identity ===
Chicano political identity developed from a reverence of Pachuco resistance in the 1940s. Luis Valdez wrote that &quot;Pachuco determination and pride grew through the 1950s and gave impetus to the Chicano Movement of the 1960s ... By then the political consciousness stirred by the 1943 Zoot Suit Riots had developed into a movement that would soon issue the Chicano Manifesto—a detailed platform of political activism.&quot; By the 1960s, the Pachuco figure &quot;emerged as an icon of resistance in Chicano cultural production.&quot; The Pachuca was not regarded with the same status. Catherine Ramírez credits this to the Pachuca being interpreted as a symbol of &quot;dissident femininity, female masculinity, and, in some instances, lesbian sexuality&quot;.

The political identity was founded on the principle that the U.S. nation-state had impoverished and exploited the Chicano people and communities. Alberto Varon argued that this brand of Chicano nationalism focused on the machismo subject in its calls for political resistance. Chicano machismo was both a unifying and fracturing force. Cherríe Moraga argued that it fostered homophobia and sexism, which became obstacles to the Movement. As the Chicano political consciousness developed, Chicanas, including Chicana lesbians of color brought attention to &quot;reproductive rights, especially sterilization abuse [sterilization of Latinas], battered women&#x27;s shelters, rape crisis centers, [and] welfare advocacy.&quot; Chicana texts like &quot;Essays on La Mujer&quot; (1977), &quot;Mexican Women in the United States&quot; (1980), and &quot;This Bridge Called My Back&quot; (1981) have been relatively ignored even in Chicano Studies. Sonia Saldívar-Hull argued that even when Chicanas have challenged sexism, their identities have been invalidated.
Chicano political activist groups like the Brown Berets (1967–1972; 1992–Present) gained support in their protests of educational inequalities and demanding an end to police brutality. They collaborated with the Black Panthers and Young Lords, which were founded in 1966 and 1968 respectively. Membership in the Brown Berets was estimated to have reached five thousand in over 80 chapters (mostly centered in California and Texas). The Brown Berets helped organize the Chicano Blowouts of 1968 and the national Chicano Moratorium, which protested the high rate of Chicano casualties in the Vietnam War. Police harassment, infiltration by federal agents provacateur via COINTELPRO, and internal disputes led to the decline and disbandment of the Berets in 1972. Sánchez, then a professor at East Los Angeles College, revived the Brown Berets in 1992 prompted by the high number of Chicano homicides in Los Angeles County, hoping to replace the gang life with the Brown Berets.

Reies Tijerina, who was a vocal claimant to the rights of Latin Americans and Mexican Americans and a major figure of the early Chicano Movement, wrote: &quot;The Anglo press degradized the word &#x27;Chicano.&#x27; They use it to divide us. We use it to unify ourselves with our people and with Latin America.&quot;

=== Cultural identity ===

&quot;Chicano&quot; represents a cultural identity that is neither fully &quot;American&quot; or &quot;Mexican.&quot; Chicano culture embodies the &quot;in-between&quot; nature of cultural hybridity. Central aspects of Chicano culture include lowriding, hip hop, rock, graffiti art, theater, muralism, visual art, literature, poetry, and more. Mexican American celebrities, artists, and actors/actresses help bring Chicano culture to light and contribute to the growing influence it has on American pop culture. In modern-day America you can now find Chicanos in all types of professions and trades. Notable subcultures include the Cholo, Pachuca, Pachuco, and Pinto subcultures. Chicano culture has had international influence in the form of lowrider car clubs in Brazil and England, music and youth culture in Japan, Māori youth enhancing lowrider bicycles and taking on cholo style, and intellectuals in France &quot;embracing the deterritorializing qualities of Chicano subjectivity.&quot;

As early as the 1930s, the precursors to Chicano cultural identity were developing in Los Angeles, California and the Southwestern United States. Former zoot suiter Salvador &quot;El Chava&quot; reflects on how racism and poverty forged a hostile social environment for Chicanos which led to the development of gangs: &quot;we had to protect ourselves&quot;. &quot;Barrios&quot; and &quot;colonias&quot; (rural &quot;barrios&quot;) emerged throughout southern California and elsewhere in neglected districts of cities and outlying areas with little infrastructure. Alienation from public institutions made some Chicano youth susceptible to gang channels, who became drawn to their rigid hierarchical structure and assigned social roles in a world of government-sanctioned disorder.

Pachuco culture, which probably originated in the El Paso-Juarez area, spread to the borderland areas of California and Texas as &quot;Pachuquismo&quot;, which would eventually evolve into &quot;Chicanismo&quot;. Chicano zoot suiters on the west coast were influenced by Black zoot suiters in the jazz and swing music scene on the East Coast. Chicano zoot suiters developed a unique cultural identity, as noted by Charles &quot;Chaz&quot; Bojórquez, &quot;with their hair done in big pompadours, and &quot;draped&quot; in tailor-made suits, they were swinging to their own styles. They spoke &quot;Cálo&quot;, their own language, a cool jive of half-English, half-Spanish rhythms. [...] Out of the zootsuiter experience came lowrider cars and culture, clothes, music, tag names, and, again, its own graffiti language.&quot; San Antonio–based Chicano artist Adan Hernandez regarded pachucos as &quot;the coolest thing to behold in fashion, manner, and speech.&quot; As described by artist Carlos Jackson, &quot;Pachuco culture remains a prominent theme in Chicano art because the contemporary urban &quot;cholo&quot; culture&quot; is seen as its heir.

Many aspects of Chicano culture like lowriding cars and bicycles have been stigmatized and policed by Anglo Americans who perceive Chicanos as &quot;juvenile delinquents or gang members&quot; for their embrace of nonwhite style and cultures, much as they did Pachucos. These negative societal perceptions of Chicanos were amplified by media outlets such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Luis Alvarez remarks how negative portrayals in the media served as a tool to advocate for increased policing of Black and Brown male bodies in particular: &quot;Popular discourse characterizing nonwhite youth as animal-like, hypersexual, and criminal marked their bodies as &quot;other&quot; and, when coming from city officials and the press, served to help construct for the public a social meaning of African Americans and Mexican American youth [as, in their minds, justifiably criminalized].&quot;
Chicano rave culture in southern California provided a space for Chicanos to partially escape criminalization in the 1990s. Artist and archivist Guadalupe Rosales states that &quot;a lot of teenagers were being criminalized or profiled as criminals or gangsters, so the party scene gave access for people to escape that&quot;. Numerous party crews, such as Aztek Nation, organized events and parties would frequently take place in neighborhood backyards, particularly in East and South Los Angeles, the surrounding valleys, and Orange County. By 1995, it was estimated that over 500 party crews were in existence. They laid the foundations for &quot;an influential but oft-overlooked Latin dance subculture that offered community for Chicano ravers, queer folk, and other marginalized youth.&quot; Ravers used map points techniques to derail police raids. Rosales states that a shift occurred around the late 1990s and increasing violence affected the Chicano party scene.

=== Indigenous identity ===

Chicano identity functions as a way to reclaim one&#x27;s Indigenous American, and often Indigenous Mexican, ancestry—to form an identity distinct from European identity, despite some Chicanos being of partial European descent—as a way to resist and subvert colonial domination. Rather than part of European American culture, Alicia Gasper de Alba referred to &quot;Chicanismo&quot; as an &quot;&quot;alter-Native&quot; culture, an Other American culture Indigenous to the land base now known as the West and Southwest of the United States.&quot; While influenced by settler-imposed systems and structures, Alba refers to Chicano culture as &quot;not immigrant but native, not foreign but colonized, not alien but different from the overarching hegemony of white America.&quot;

The Plan Espiritual de Aztlán (1969) drew from Frantz Fanon&#x27;s &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; (1961). In &quot;Wretched&quot;, Fanon stated: &quot;the past existence of an Aztec civilization does not change anything very much in the diet of the Mexican peasant today&quot;, elaborating that &quot;this passionate search for a national culture which existed before the colonial era finds its legitimate reason in the anxiety shared by native intellectuals to shrink away from that of Western culture in which they all risk being swamped ... the native intellectuals, since they could not stand wonderstruck before the history of today&#x27;s barbarity, decided to go back further and to delve deeper down; and, let us make no mistake, it was with the greatest delight that they discovered that there was nothing to be ashamed of in the past, but rather dignity, glory, and solemnity.&quot;

The Chicano Movement adopted this perspective through the notion of Aztlán—a mythic Aztec homeland which Chicanos used as a way to connect themselves to a precolonial past, before the time of the gringo&#x27; invasion of our lands.&quot; Chicano scholars have described how this functioned as a way for Chicanos to reclaim a diverse or imprecise Indigenous past; while recognizing how Aztlán promoted divisive forms of Chicano nationalism that &quot;did little to shake the walls and bring down the structures of power as its rhetoric so firmly proclaimed&quot;. As stated by Chicano historian Juan Gómez-Quiñones, the Plan Espiritual de Aztlán was &quot;stripped of what radical element it possessed by stressing its alleged romantic idealism, reducing the concept of Aztlán to a psychological ploy ... all of which became possible because of the Plan&#x27;s incomplete analysis which, in turn, allowed it ... to degenerate into reformism.&quot;

While acknowledging its romanticized and exclusionary foundations, Chicano scholars like Rafael Pérez-Torres state that Aztlán opened a subjectivity which stressed a connection to Indigenous peoples and cultures at a critical historical moment in which &quot;Mexican-Americans&quot; and Mexicans were &quot;under pressure to assimilate particular standards—of beauty, of identity, of aspiration. In a Mexican context, the pressure was to urbanize and Europeanize ... &quot;Mexican-Americans&quot; were expected to accept anti-indigenous discourses as their own.&quot; As Pérez-Torres concludes, Aztlán allowed &quot;for another way of aligning one&#x27;s interests and concerns with community and with history ... though hazy as to the precise means in which agency would emerge, Aztlán valorized a Chicanismo that rewove into the present previously devalued lines of descent.&quot; Romanticized notions of &quot;Aztlán&quot; have declined among some Chicanos, who argue for a need to reconstruct the place of Indigeneity in relation to Chicano identity.

Danza Azteca grew popular in the U.S. with the rise of the Chicano Movement, which inspired some &quot;Latinos to embrace their ethnic heritage and question the Eurocentric norms forced upon them.&quot; The use of pre-contact Aztec cultural elements has been critiqued by some Chicanos who stress a need to represent the diversity of Indigenous ancestry among Chicanos. Patrisia Gonzales portrays Chicanos as descendants of the Indigenous peoples of Mexico who have been displaced by colonial violence, positioning them as &quot;detribalized Indigenous peoples and communities.&quot; Roberto Cintli Rodríguez describes Chicanos as &quot;de-Indigenized,&quot; which he remarks occurred &quot;in part due to religious indoctrination and a violent uprooting from the land&quot;, detaching millions of people from maíz-based cultures throughout the greater Mesoamerican region. Rodríguez asks how and why &quot;peoples who are clearly red or brown and undeniably Indigenous to this continent have allowed ourselves, historically, to be framed by bureaucrats and the courts, by politicians, scholars, and the media as alien, illegal, and less than human.&quot;

Gloria E. Anzaldúa has addressed Chicano&#x27;s detribalization: &quot;In the case of Chicanos, being &#x27;Mexican&#x27; is not a tribe. So in a sense Chicanos and Mexicans are &#x27;detribalized&#x27;. We don&#x27;t have tribal affiliations but neither do we have to carry ID cards establishing tribal affiliation.&quot; Anzaldúa recognized that &quot;Chicanos, people of color, and &#x27;whites have often chosen &quot;to ignore the struggles of Native people even when it&#x27;s right in our &quot;caras&quot; (faces),&quot; expressing disdain for this &quot;willful ignorance&quot;. She concluded that &quot;though both &quot;detribalized urban mixed bloods&quot; and Chicanos are recovering and reclaiming, this society is killing off urban mixed bloods through cultural genocide, by not allowing them equal opportunities for better jobs, schooling, and health care.&quot; Inés Hernández-Ávila argued that Chicanos should recognize and reconnect with their roots &quot;respectfully and humbly&quot; while also validating &quot;those peoples who still maintain their identity as original peoples of this continent&quot; in order to create radical change capable of &quot;transforming our world, our universe, and our lives&quot;.

== Political aspects ==

=== Anti-imperialism and international solidarity ===
During World War II, Chicano youth were targeted by white servicemen, who despised their &quot;cool, measured indifference to the war, as well as an increasingly defiant posture toward whites in general&quot;. Historian Robin Kelley states that this &quot;annoyed white servicemen to no end&quot;. During the Zoot Suit Riots (1943), white rage erupted in Los Angeles, which &quot;became the site of racist attacks on Black and Chicano youth, during which white soldiers engaged in what amounted to a ritualized stripping of the zoot.&quot; Zoot suits were a symbol of collective resistance among Chicano and Black youth against city segregation and fighting in the war. Many Chicano and Black zoot-suiters engaged in draft evasion because they felt it was hypocritical for them to be expected to &quot;fight for democracy&quot; abroad yet face racism and oppression daily in the U.S.

This galvanized Chicano youth to focus on anti-war activism, &quot;especially influenced by the Third World movements of liberation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.&quot; Historian Mario T. García reflects that &quot;these anti-colonial and anti-Western movements for national liberation and self-awareness touched a historical nerve among Chicanos as they began to learn that they shared some similarities with these Third World struggles.&quot; Chicano poet Alurista argued that &quot;Chicanos cannot be truly free until they recognize that the struggle in the United States is intricately bound with the anti-imperialist struggle in other countries.&quot; The Cuban Revolution (1953–1959) led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara was particularly influential to Chicanos, as noted by García, who notes that Chicanos viewed the revolution as &quot;a nationalist revolt against &#x27;Yankee imperialism&#x27; and neo-colonialism.&quot;

In the 1960s, the Chicano Movement brought &quot;attention and commitment to local struggles with an analysis and understanding of international struggles&quot;. Chicano youth organized with Black, Latin American, and Filipino activists to form the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF), which fought for the creation of a Third World college. During the Third World Liberation Front strikes of 1968, Chicano artists created posters to express solidarity. Chicano poster artist Rupert García referred to the place of artists in the movement: &quot;I was critical of the police, of capitalist exploitation. I did posters of Che, of Zapata, of other Third World leaders. As artists, we climbed down from the ivory tower.&quot; Learning from Cuban poster makers of the post-revolutionary period, Chicano artists &quot;incorporated international struggles for freedom and self-determination, such as those of Angola, Chile, and South Africa&quot;, while also promoting the struggles of Indigenous people and other civil rights movements through Black-brown unity. Chicanas organized with women of color activists to create the Third World Women&#x27;s Alliance (1968–1980), representing &quot;visions of liberation in third world solidarity that inspired political projects among racially and economically marginalized communities&quot; against U.S. capitalism and imperialism.

The Chicano Moratorium (1969–1971) against the Vietnam War was one of the largest demonstrations of Mexican-Americans in history, drawing over 30,000 supporters in East L.A. Draft evasion was a form of resistance for Chicano anti-war activists such as Rosalio Muñoz, Ernesto Vigil, and Salomon Baldengro. They faced a felony charge—a minimum of five years prison time, $10,000, or both. In response, Munoz wrote &quot;I declare my independence of the Selective Service System. I accuse the government of the United States of America of genocide against the Mexican people. Specifically, I accuse the draft, the entire social, political, and economic system of the United States of America, of creating a funnel which shoots Mexican youth into Vietnam to be killed and to kill innocent men, women, and children...&quot; Rodolfo Corky Gonzales expressed a similar stance: &quot;My feelings and emotions are aroused by the complete disregard of our present society for the rights, dignity, and lives of not only people of other nations but of our own unfortunate young men who die for an abstract cause in a war that cannot be honestly justified by any of our present leaders.&quot;

Anthologies such as &quot;This Bridge Called My Back&quot;: &quot;Writings by Radical Women of Color&quot; (1981) were produced in the late 1970s and early 80s by writers who identified as lesbians of color, including Cherríe Moraga, Pat Parker, Toni Cade Bambara, Chrystos (self-identified claim of Menominee ancestry), Audre Lorde, Gloria E. Anzaldúa, Cheryl Clarke, Jewelle Gomez, Kitty Tsui, and Hattie Gossett, who developed a poetics of liberation. Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press and Third Woman Press, founded in 1979 by Chicana feminist Norma Alarcón, provided sites for the production of women of color and Chicana literatures and critical essays. While first world feminists focused &quot;on the liberal agenda of political rights&quot;, Third World feminists &quot;linked their agenda for women&#x27;s rights with economic and cultural rights&quot; and unified together &quot;under the banner of Third World solidarity&quot;. Maylei Blackwell identifies that this internationalist critique of capitalism and imperialism forged by women of color has yet to be fully historicized and is &quot;usually dropped out of the false historical narrative&quot;.

In the 1980s and 90s, Central American activists influenced Chicano leaders. The Mexican American Legislative Caucus (MALC) supported the Esquipulas Peace Agreement in 1987, standing in opposition to Contra aid. Al Luna criticized Reagan and American involvement while defending Nicaragua&#x27;s Sandinista-led government: &quot;President Reagan cannot credibly make public speeches for peace in Central America while at the same time advocating for a three-fold increase in funding to the Contras.&quot; The Southwest Voter Research Initiative (SVRI), launched by Chicano leader Willie Velásquez, intended to educate Chicano youth about Central and Latin American political issues. In 1988, &quot;there was no significant urban center in the Southwest where Chicano leaders and activists had not become involved in lobbying or organizing to change U.S. policy in Nicaragua.&quot; In the early 1990s, Cherríe Moraga urged Chicano activists to recognize that &quot;the Anglo invasion of Latin America [had] extended well beyond the Mexican/American border&quot; while Gloria E. Anzaldúa positioned Central America as the primary target of a U.S. interventionism that had murdered and displaced thousands. However, Chicano solidarity narratives of Central Americans in the 1990s tended to center themselves, stereotype Central Americans, and filter their struggles &quot;through Chicana/o struggles, histories, and imaginaries.&quot;

Chicano activists organized against the Gulf War (1990–91). Raul Ruiz of the Chicano Mexican Committee against the Gulf War stated that U.S. intervention was &quot;to support U.S. oil interests in the region.&quot; Ruiz expressed, &quot;we were the only Chicano group against the war. We did a lot of protesting in L.A. even though it was difficult because of the strong support for the war and the anti-Arab reaction that followed ... we experienced racist attacks [but] we held our ground.&quot; The end of the Gulf War, along with the Rodney King Riots, were crucial in inspiring a new wave of Chicano political activism. In 1994, one of the largest demonstrations of Mexican Americans in the history of the United States occurred when 70,000 people, largely Chicanos and Latinos, marched in Los Angeles and other cities to protest Proposition 187, which aimed to cut educational and welfare benefits for undocumented immigrants.

In 2004, Mujeres against Militarism and the Raza Unida Coalition sponsored a Day of the Dead vigil against militarism within the Latino community, addressing the War in Afghanistan (2001–) and the Iraq War (2003–2011) They held photos of the dead and chanted &quot;no blood for oil.&quot; The procession ended with a five-hour vigil at Tia Chucha&#x27;s Centro Cultural. They condemned &quot;the Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (JROTC) and other military recruitment programs that concentrate heavily in Latino and African American communities, noting that JROTC is rarely found in upper-income Anglo communities.&quot; Rubén Funkahuatl Guevara organized a benefit concert for Latin@s Against the War in Iraq and &quot;Mexamérica por la Paz&quot; at Self-Help Graphics against the Iraq War. Although the events were well-attended, Guevara stated that &quot;the Feds know how to manipulate fear to reach their ends: world military dominance and maintaining a foothold in an oil-rich region were their real goals.&quot;

=== Labor organizing against capitalist exploitation ===

Chicano and Mexican labor organizers played an active role in notable labor strikes since the early 20th century including the Oxnard strike of 1903, Pacific Electric Railway strike of 1903, 1919 Streetcar Strike of Los Angeles, Cantaloupe strike of 1928, California agricultural strikes (1931–1941), and the Ventura County agricultural strike of 1941, endured mass deportations as a form of strikebreaking in the Bisbee Deportation of 1917 and Mexican Repatriation (1929–1936), and experienced tensions with one another during the Bracero program (1942–1964). Although organizing laborers were harassed, sabotaged, and repressed, sometimes through warlike tactics from capitalist owners who engaged in coervice labor relations and collaborated with and received support from local police and community organizations, Chicano and Mexican workers, particularly in agriculture, have been engaged in widespread unionization activities since the 1930s.

Prior to unionization, agricultural workers, many of whom were undocumented aliens, worked in dismal conditions. Historian F. Arturo Rosales recorded a Federal Project Writer of the period, who stated: &quot;It is sad, yet true, commentary that to the average landowner and grower in California the Mexican was to be placed in much the same category with ranch cattle, with this exception–the cattle were for the most part provided with comparatively better food and water and immeasurably better living accommodations.&quot; Growers used cheap Mexican labor to reap bigger profits and, until the 1930s, perceived Mexicans as docile and compliant with their subjugated status because they &quot;did not organize troublesome labor unions, and it was held that he was not educated to the level of unionism&quot;. As one grower described, &quot;We want the Mexican because we can treat them as we cannot treat any other living man ... We can control them by keeping them at night behind bolted gates, within a stockade eight feet high, surrounded by barbed wire ... We can make them work under armed guards in the fields.&quot;

Unionization efforts were initiated by the Confederación de Uniones Obreras (Federation of Labor Unions) in Los Angeles, with twenty-one chapters quickly extending throughout southern California, and La Unión de Trabajadores del Valle Imperial (Imperial Valley Workers&#x27; Union). The latter organized the Cantaloupe strike of 1928, in which workers demanded better working conditions and higher wages, but &quot;the growers refused to budge and, as became a pattern, local authorities sided with the farmers and through harassment broke the strike&quot;. Communist-led organizations such as the Cannery and Agricultural Workers&#x27; Industrial Union (CAWIU) supported Mexican workers, renting spaces for cotton pickers during the cotton strikes of 1933 after they were thrown out of company housing by growers. Capitalist owners used &quot;red-baiting&quot; techniques to discredit the strikes through associating them with communists. Chicana and Mexican working women showed the greatest tendency to organize, particularly in the Los Angeles garment industry with the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union, led by anarchist Rose Pesotta.

During World War II, the government-funded Bracero program (1942–1964) hindered unionization efforts. In response to the California agricultural strikes and the 1941 Ventura County strike of Chicano and Mexican, as well as Filipino, lemon pickers/packers, growers organized the Ventura County Citrus Growers Committee (VCCGC) and launched a lobbying campaign to pressure the U.S. government to pass laws to prohibit labor organizing. VCCGC joined with other grower associations, forming a powerful lobbying bloc in Congress, and worked to legislate for (1) a Mexican guest workers program, which would become the Bracero program, (2) laws prohibiting strike activity, and (3) military deferments for pickers. Their lobbying efforts were successful: unionization among farmworkers was made illegal, farmworkers were excluded from minimum wage laws, and the usage of child labor by growers was ignored. In formerly active areas, such as Santa Paula, union activity stopped for over thirty years as a result.

When World War II ended, the Bracero program continued. Legal anthropologist Martha Menchaca states that this was &quot;regardless of the fact that massive quantities of crops were no longer needed for the war effort ... after the war, the braceros were used for the benefit of the large-scale growers and not for the nation&#x27;s interest.&quot; The program was extended for an indefinite period in 1951. In the mid-1940s, labor organizer Ernesto Galarza founded the National Farm Workers Union (NFWU) in opposition to the Bracero Program, organizing a large-scale 1947 strike against the Di Giorgio Fruit Company in Arvin, California. Hundreds of Mexican, Filipino, and white workers walked out and demanded higher wages. The strike was broken by the usual tactics, with law enforcement on the side of the owners, evicting strikers and bringing in undocumented workers as strikebreakers. The NFWU folded, but served as a precursor to the United Farm Workers Union led by César Chávez. By the 1950s, opposition to the Bracero program had grown considerably, as unions, churches, and Mexican-American political activists raised awareness about the effects it had on American labor standards. On December 31, 1964, the U.S. government conceded and terminated the program.

Following the closure of the Bracero program, domestic farmworkers began to organize again because &quot;growers could not longer maintain the peonage system&quot; with the end of imported laborers from Mexico. Labor organizing formed part of the Chicano Movement via the struggle of farmworkers against depressed wages and working conditions. César Chávez began organizing Chicano farmworkers in the early 1960s, first through the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) and then merging the association with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), an organization of mainly Filipino workers, to form the United Farm Workers. The labor organizing of Chávez was central to the expansion of unionization throughout the United States and inspired the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC), under the leadership of Baldemar Velásquez, which continues today. Farmworkers collaborated with local Chicano organizations, such as in Santa Paula, California, where farmworkers attended Brown Berets meetings in the 1970s and Chicano youth organized to improve working conditions and initiate an urban renewal project on the eastside of the city.

Although Mexican and Chicano workers, organizers, and activists organized for decades to improve working conditions and increase wages, some scholars characterize these gains as minimal. As described by Ronald Mize and Alicia Swords, &quot;piecemeal gains in the interests of workers have had very little impact on the capitalist agricultural labor process, so picking grapes, strawberries, and oranges in 1948 is not so different from picking those same crops in 2008.&quot; U.S. agriculture today remains totally reliant on Mexican labor, with Mexican-born individuals now constituting about 90% of the labor force.

=== Struggles in the education system ===
Chicanos often endure struggles in the U.S. education system, such as being erased in curriculums and devalued as students. Some Chicanos identify schools as colonial institutions that exercise control over colonized students by teaching Chicanos to idolize the American culture and develop a negative self-image of themselves and their worldviews. School segregation between Mexican and white students was not legally ended until the late 1940s. In Orange County, California, 80% of Mexican students could only attend schools that taught Mexican children manual education, or gardening, bootmaking, blacksmithing, and carpentry for Mexican boys and sewing and homemaking for Mexican girls. White schools taught academic preparation. When Sylvia Mendez was told to attend a Mexican school, her parents brought suit against the court in Mendez vs. Westminster (1947) and won.

Although legal segregation had been successfully challenged, &quot;de facto&quot; or segregation-in-practice continued in many areas. Schools with primarily Mexican American enrollment were still treated as &quot;Mexican schools&quot; much as before the legal overturning of segregation. Mexican American students were still treated poorly in schools. Continued bias in the education system motivated Chicanos to protest and use direct action, such as walkouts, in the 1960s. On March 5, 1968, the Chicano Blowouts at East Los Angeles High School occurred as a response to the racist treatment of Chicano students, an unresponsive school board, and a high dropout rate. It became known as &quot;the first major mass protest against racism undertaken by Mexican-Americans in the history of the United States.&quot; 

Sal Castro, a Chicano social science teacher at the school was arrested and fired for inspiring the walkouts. It was led by Harry Gamboa Jr. who was named &quot;one of the hundred most dangerous and violent subversives in the United States&quot; for organizing the student walkouts. The day prior, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover sent out a memo to law enforcement to place top priority on &quot;political intelligence work to prevent the development of nationalist movements in minority communities&quot;. Chicana activist Alicia Escalante protested Castro&#x27;s dismissal: &quot;We in the Movement will at least be able to hold our heads up and say that we haven&#x27;t submitted to the gringo or to the pressures of the system. We are brown and we are proud. I am at least raising my children to be proud of their heritage, to demand their rights, and as they become parents they too will pass this on until justice is done.&quot;

In 1969, Plan de Santa Bárbara was drafted as a 155-page document that outlined the foundation of Chicano Studies programs in higher education. It called for students, faculty, employees and the community to come together as &quot;central and decisive designers and administrators of these programs&quot;. Chicano students and activists asserted that universities should exist to serve the community. However, by the mid-1970s, much of the radicalism of earlier Chicano studies became deflated by the education system, aimed to alter Chicano Studies programs from within. Mario García argued that one &quot;encountered a deradicalization of the radicals&quot;. Some opportunistic faculty avoided their political responsibilities to the community. University administrators co-opted oppositional forces within Chicano Studies programs and encouraged tendencies that led &quot;to the loss of autonomy of Chicano Studies programs.&quot; At the same time, &quot;a domesticated Chicano Studies provided the university with the facade of being tolerant, liberal, and progressive.&quot;

Some Chicanos argued that the solution was to create &quot;publishing outlets that would challenge Anglo control of academic print culture with its rules on peer review and thereby publish alternative research,&quot; arguing that a Chicano space in the colonial academy could &quot;avoid colonization in higher education&quot;. In an attempt to establish educational autonomy, they worked with institutions like the Ford Foundation, but found that &quot;these organizations presented a paradox&quot;. Rodolfo Acuña argued that such institutions &quot;quickly became content to only acquire funding for research and thereby determine the success or failure of faculty&quot;. Chicano Studies became &quot;much closer [to] the mainstream than its practitioners wanted to acknowledge.&quot; Others argued that Chicano Studies at UCLA shifted from its earlier interests in serving the Chicano community to gaining status within the colonial institution through a focus on academic publishing, which alienated it from the community.In 2012, the Mexican American Studies Department Programs (MAS) in Tucson Unified School District were banned after a campaign led by Anglo-American politician Tom Horne accused it of working to &quot;promote the overthrow of the U.S. government, promote resentment toward a race or class of people, are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group or advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.&quot; Classes on Latino literature, American history/Mexican-American perspectives, Chicano art, and an American government/social justice education project course were banned. Readings of In Lak&#x27;ech from Luis Valdez&#x27;s poem &quot;Pensamiento Serpentino&quot; were also banned.

Seven books, including Paulo Friere&#x27;s &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot; and works covering Chicano history and critical race theory, were banned, taken from students, and stored away. The ban was overturned in 2017 by Judge A. Wallace Tashima, who ruled that it was unconstitutional and motivated by racism by depriving Chicano students of knowledge, thereby violating their Fourteenth Amendment right. The Xicanx Institute for Teaching &amp; Organizing (XITO) emerged to carry on the legacy of the MAS programs. Chicanos continue to support the institution of Chicano studies programs. In 2021, students at Southwestern College, the closest college to the Mexico-United States Border urged for the creation of a Chicanx Studies Program to service the predominately Latino student body.

=== Rejection of borders ===

The Chicano concept of &quot;sin fronteras&quot; rejects the idea of borders. Some argued that the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo transformed the Rio Grande region from a rich cultural center to a rigid border poorly enforced by the United States government. At the end of the Mexican-American War, 80,000 Spanish-Mexican-Indian people were forced into sudden U.S. habitation. Some Chicanos identified with the idea of Aztlán as a result, which celebrated a time preceding land division and rejected the &quot;immigrant/foreigner&quot; categorization by Anglo society. Chicano activists have called for unionism between both Mexicans and Chicanos on both sides of the border.

In the early 20th century, the border crossing had become a site of dehumanization for Mexicans. Protests in 1910 arose along the Santa Fe Bridge from abuses committed against Mexican workers while crossing the border. The 1917 Bath riots erupted after Mexicans crossing the border were required to strip naked and be disinfected with chemical agents like gasoline, kerosene, sulfuric acid, and Zyklon B, the latter of which was the fumigation of choice and would later notoriously be used in the gas chambers of Nazi Germany. Chemical dousing continued into the 1950s. During the early 20th century, Chicanos used &quot;corridos&quot; &quot;to counter Anglocentric hegemony.&quot; Ramón Saldivar stated that &quot;&quot;corridos&quot; served the symbolic function of empirical events and for creating counterfactual worlds of lived experience (functioning as a substitute for fiction writing).&quot;Newspaper &quot;Sin Fronteras&quot; (1976–1979) openly rejected the Mexico-United States border. The newspaper considered it &quot;to be only an artificial creation that in time would be destroyed by the struggles of Mexicans on both sides of the border&quot; and recognized that &quot;Yankee political, economic, and cultural colonialism victimized all Mexicans, whether in the U.S. or in Mexico.&quot; Similarly, the General Brotherhood of Workers (CASA), important to the development of young Chicano intellectuals and activists, identified that, as &quot;victims of oppression, &quot;Mexicanos&quot; could achieve liberation and self-determination only by engaging in a borderless struggle to defeat American international capitalism.&quot;

Chicana theorist Gloria E. Anzaldúa notably emphasized the border as a &quot;1,950 mile-long wound that does not heal&quot;. In referring to the border as a wound, writer Catherine Leen suggests that Anzaldúa recognizes &quot;the trauma and indeed physical violence very often associated with crossing the border from Mexico to the US, but also underlies the fact that the cyclical nature of this immigration means that this process will continue and find little resolution.&quot; Anzaldúa writes that &quot;la frontera&quot; signals &quot;the coming together of two self-consistent but habitually incompatible frames of reference [which] cause &quot;un choque&quot;, a cultural collision&quot; because &quot;the U.S.-Mexican border &quot;es una herida abierta&quot; where the Third World grates against the first and bleeds.&quot; Chicano and Mexican artists and filmmakers continue to address &quot;the contentious issues of exploitation, exclusion, and conflict at the border and attempt to overturn border stereotypes&quot; through their work. Luis Alberto Urrea writes &quot;the border runs down the middle of me. I have a barbed wire fence neatly bisecting my heart.&quot;

== Sociological aspects ==

=== Criminalization ===
The 19th-century and early-20th-century image of the Mexican in the U.S. was &quot;that of the greasy Mexican bandit or &quot;bandito,&quot;&quot; who was perceived as criminal because of Mestizo ancestry and &quot;Indian blood.&quot; This rhetoric fueled anti-Mexican sentiment among whites, which led to many lynchings of Mexicans in the period as an act of racist violence. One of the largest massacres of Mexicans was known as &quot;La Matanza&quot; in Texas, where hundreds of Mexicans were lynched by white mobs. Many whites viewed Mexicans as inherently criminal, which they connected to their Indigenous ancestry. White historian Walter P. Webb wrote in 1935, &quot;there is a cruel streak in the Mexican nature ... this cruelty may be a heritage from the Spanish and of the Inquisition; it may, and doubtless should be, attributed partly to Indian blood.&quot; The &quot;greasy bandito&quot; stereotype of the old West evolved into images of &quot;crazed Zoot-Suiters and pachuco killers in the 1940s, to contemporary &quot;cholos&quot;, gangsters, and gang members.&quot; Pachucos were portrayed as violent criminals in American mainstream media, which fueled the Zoot Suit Riots; initiated by off-duty policemen conducting a vigilante-hunt, the riots targeted Chicano youth who wore the zoot suit as a symbol of empowerment. On-duty police supported the violence against Chicano zoot suiters; they &quot;escorted the servicemen to safety and arrested their Chicano victims.&quot; Arrest rates of Chicano youth rose during these decades, fueled by the &quot;criminal&quot; image portrayed in the media, by politicians, and by the police. Not aspiring to assimilate in Anglo-American society, Chicano youth were criminalized for their defiance to cultural assimilation: &quot;When many of the same youth began wearing what the larger society considered outlandish clothing, sporting distinctive hairstyles, speaking in their own language (&quot;Caló&quot;), and dripping with attitude, law enforcement redoubled their efforts to rid [them from] the streets.&quot;
In the 1970s and subsequent decades, there was a wave of police killings of Chicanos. One of the most prominent cases was Luis &quot;Tato&quot; Rivera, who was a 20-year-old Chicano shot in the back by officer Craig Short in 1975. 2,000 Chicano demonstrators showed up to the city hall of National City, California in protest. Short was indicted for manslaughter by district attorney Ed Miller and was acquitted of all charges. Short was later appointed acting chief of police of National City in 2003. Another high-profile case was the murder of Ricardo Falcón, a student at the University of Colorado and leader of the United Latin American Students (UMAS), by Perry Brunson, a member of the far-right American Independent Party, at a gas station. Bruson was tried for manslaughter and was &quot;acquitted by an all-White jury&quot;. Falcón became a martyr for the Chicano Movement as police violence increased in the subsequent decades. Similar cases led sociologist Alfredo Mirandé to refer to the U.S. criminal justice system as &quot;gringo justice&quot;, because &quot;it reflected one standard for Anglos and another for Chicanos.&quot;

The criminalization of Chicano youth in the &quot;barrio&quot; remains omnipresent. Chicano youth who adopt a &quot;cholo&quot; or &quot;chola&quot; identity endure hyper-criminalization in what has been described by Victor Rios as the youth control complex. While older residents initially &quot;embraced the idea of a &quot;chola&quot; or &quot;cholo&quot; as a larger subculture not necessarily associated with crime and violence (but rather with a youthful temporary identity), law enforcement agents, ignorant or disdainful of &quot;barrio&quot; life, labeled youth who wore clean white tennis shoes, shaved their heads, or long socks, as deviant.&quot; Community members were convinced by the police of cholo criminality, which led to criminalization and surveillance &quot;reminiscent of the criminalization of Chicana and Chicano youth during the Zoot-Suit era in the 1940s.&quot;

Sociologist José S. Plascencia-Castillo refers to the &quot;barrio&quot; as a panopticon that leads to intense self-regulation, as Cholo youth are both scrutinized by law enforcement to &quot;stay in their side of town&quot; and by the community who in some cases &quot;call the police to have the youngsters removed from the premises&quot;. The intense governance of Chicano youth, especially of cholo identity, has deep implications on youth experience, affecting their physical and mental health as well as their outlook on the future. Some youth feel they &quot;can either comply with the demands of authority figures, and become obedient and compliant, and suffer the accompanying loss of identity and self-esteem, or, adopt a resistant stance and contest social invisibility to command respect in the public sphere.&quot;

=== Gender and sexuality ===

==== Chicanas ====

Chicanas often confront objectification in Anglo society, being perceived as &quot;exotic&quot;, &quot;lascivious&quot;, and &quot;hot&quot; at a very young age while also facing denigration as &quot;barefoot&quot;, &quot;pregnant&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, and &quot;low-class&quot;. These perceptions in society create numerous negative sociological and psychological effects, such as excessive dieting and eating disorders. Social media may enhance these stereotypes of Chicana women and girls. Numerous studies have found that Chicanas experience elevated levels of stress as a result of sexual expectations by society, as well as their parents and families.

Although many Chicana youth desire open conversation of these gender roles and sexuality, as well as mental health, these issues are often not discussed openly in Chicano families, which perpetuates unsafe and destructive practices. While young Chicanas are objectified, middle-aged Chicanas discuss feelings of being invisible, saying they feel trapped in balancing family obligations to their parents and children while attempting to create a space for their own sexual desires. The expectation that Chicanas should be &quot;protected&quot; by Chicanos may also constrict the agency and mobility of Chicanas.

Chicanas are often relegated to a secondary and subordinate status in families. Cherrie Moraga argues that this issue of patriarchal ideology in Chicano and Latino communities runs deep, as the great majority of Chicano and Latino men believe in and uphold male supremacy. Moraga argues that this ideology is not only upheld by men in Chicano families, but also by mothers in their relationship to their children: &quot;the daughter must constantly earn the mother&#x27;s love, prove her fidelity to her. The son—he gets her love for free.&quot;

==== Chicanos ====
Chicanos develop their manhood within a context of marginalization in white society. Some argue that &quot;Mexican men and their Chicano brothers suffer from an inferiority complex due to the conquest and genocide inflicted upon their Indigenous ancestors,&quot; which leaves Chicano men feeling trapped between identifying with the so-called &quot;superior&quot; European and the so-called &quot;inferior&quot; Indigenous sense of self. This conflict may manifest itself in the form of hypermasculinity or machismo, in which a &quot;quest for power and control over others in order to feel better&quot; about oneself is undertaken. This may result in men developing abusive behaviors, the development of an impenetrable &quot;cold&quot; persona, alcohol abuse, and other destructive and self-isolating behaviors.

The lack of discussion of what it means to be a Chicano man between Chicano male youth and their fathers or their mothers creates a search for identity that often leads to self-destructive behaviors. Chicano male youth tend to learn about sex from their peers as well as older male family members who perpetuate the idea that as men they have &quot;a right to engage in sexual activity without commitment&quot;. The looming threat of being labeled a &quot;joto&quot; (gay) for not engaging in sexual activity also conditions many Chicanos to &quot;use&quot; women for their own sexual desires. Gabriel S. Estrada argues that the criminalization of Chicanos proliferates further homophobia among Chicano boys and men who may adopt hypermasculine personas to escape such association.

==== Heteronormativity ====
Heteronormative gender roles are typically enforced in Chicano families. Any deviation from gender and sexual conformity, such as effeminacy in Chicanos or lesbianism in Chicanas, is commonly perceived as a weakening or attack of &quot;la familia&quot;. However, Chicano men who retain a masculine or machismo performance are afforded some mobility to discreetly engage in homosexual behaviors, as long as it remains on the fringes.

Queer Chicana/os may seek refuge in their families, if possible, because it is difficult for them to find spaces where they feel safe in the dominant and hostile white gay culture. Chicano machismo, religious traditionalism, and homophobia creates challenges for them to feel accepted by their families. Gabriel S. Estrada argues that upholding &quot;Judeo-Christian mandates against homosexuality that are not native to Indigenous Mexico],&quot; exiles queer Chicana/o youth.

=== Mental health ===

Chicanos may seek out both Western biomedical healthcare and Indigenous health practices when dealing with trauma or illness. The effects of colonization are proven to produce psychological distress among Indigenous communities. Intergenerational trauma, along with racism and institutionalized systems of oppression, have been shown to adversely impact the mental health of Chicanos and Latinos. Mexican Americans are three times more likely than European Americans to live in poverty. Chicano adolescent youth experience high rates of depression and anxiety. Chicana adolescents have higher rates of depression and suicidal ideation than their European-American and African-American peers. Chicano adolescents experience high rates of homicide, and suicide. Chicanos ages ten to seventeen are at a greater risk for mood and anxiety disorders than their European-American and African-American peers. Scholars have determined that the reasons for this are unclear due to the scarcity of studies on Chicano youth, but that intergenerational trauma, acculturative stress, and family factors are believed to contribute.

Among Mexican immigrants who have lived in the United States for less than thirteen years, lower rates of mental health disorders were found in comparison to Mexican-Americans and Chicanos born in the United States. Scholar Yvette G. Flores concludes that these studies demonstrate that &quot;factors associated with living in the United States are related to an increased risk of mental disorders.&quot; Risk factors for negative mental health include historical and contemporary trauma stemming from colonization, marginalization, discrimination, and devaluation. The disconnection of Chicanos from their Indigeneity has been cited as a cause of trauma and negative mental health:Loss of language, cultural rituals, and spiritual practices creates shame and despair. The loss of culture and language often goes unmourned, because it is silenced and denied by those who occupy, conquer, or dominate. Such losses and their psychological and spiritual impact are passed down across generations, resulting in depression, disconnection, and spiritual distress in subsequent generations, which are manifestations of historical or intergenerational trauma.Psychological distress may emerge from Chicanos being &quot;othered&quot; in society since childhood and is linked to psychiatric disorders and symptoms which are culturally bound—&quot;susto&quot; (fright), &quot;nervios&quot; (nerves), &quot;mal de ojo&quot; (evil eye), and &quot;ataque de nervios&quot; (an attack of nerves resembling a panic attack). Manuel X. Zamarripa discusses how mental health and spirituality are often seen as disconnected subjects in Western perspectives. Zamarripa states &quot;in our community, spirituality is key for many of us in our overall wellbeing and in restoring and giving balance to our lives&quot;. For Chicanos, Zamarripa recognizes that identity, community, and spirituality are three core aspects which are essential to maintaining good mental health.

=== Spirituality ===

Chicano spirituality has been described as a process of engaging in a journey to unite one&#x27;s consciousness for the purposes of cultural unity and social justice. It brings together many elements and is therefore hybrid in nature. Scholar Regina M Marchi states that Chicano spirituality &quot;emphasizes elements of struggle, process, and politics, with the goal of creating a unity of consciousness to aid social development and political action&quot;. Lara Medina and Martha R. Gonzales explain that &quot;reclaiming and reconstructing our spirituality based on non-Western epistemologies is central to our process of decolonization, particularly in these most troubling times of incessant Eurocentric, heteronormative patriarchy, misogyny, racial injustice, global capitalist greed, and disastrous global climate change.&quot; As a result, some scholars state that Chicano spirituality must involve a study of Indigenous Ways of Knowing (IWOK). The &quot;Circulo de Hombres&quot; group in San Diego, California spiritually heals Chicano, Latino, and Indigenous men &quot;by exposing them to Indigenous-based frameworks, men of this cultural group heal and rehumanize themselves through Maya-Nahua Indigenous-based concepts and teachings&quot;, helping them process intergenerational trauma and dehumanization that has resulted from colonization. A study on the group reported that reconnecting with Indigenous worldviews was overwhelmingly successful in helping Chicano, Latino, and Indigenous men heal. As stated by Jesus Mendoza, &quot;our bodies remember our indigenous roots and demand that we open our mind, hearts, and souls to our reality&quot;.

Chicano spirituality is a way for Chicanos to listen, reclaim, and survive while disrupting coloniality. While historically Catholicism was the primary way for Chicanos to express their spirituality, this is changing rapidly. According to a Pew Research Center report in 2015, &quot;the primary role of Catholicism as a conduit to spirituality has declined and some Chicanos have changed their affiliation to other Christian religions and many more have stopped attending church altogether.&quot; Increasingly, Chicanos are considering themselves spiritual rather than religious or part of an organized religion. A study on spirituality and Chicano men in 2020 found that many Chicanos indicated the benefits of spirituality through connecting with Indigenous spiritual beliefs and worldviews instead of Christian or Catholic organized religion in their lives. Dr. Lara Medina defines spirituality as (1) Knowledge of oneself—one&#x27;s gifts and one&#x27;s challenges, (2) Co-creation or a relationship with communities (others), and (3) A relationship with sacred sources of life and death &#x27;the Great Mystery&#x27; or Creator. Jesus Mendoza writes that, for Chicanos, &quot;spirituality is our connection to the earth, our pre-Hispanic history, our ancestors, the mixture of pre-Hispanic religion with Christianity ... a return to a non-Western worldview that understands all life as sacred.&quot; In her writing on Gloria Anzaldua&#x27;s idea of &quot;spiritual activism&quot;, AnaLouise Keating states that spirituality is distinct from organized religion and New Age thinking. Leela Fernandes defines spirituality as follows:When I speak of spirituality, at the most basic level I am referring to an understanding of the self as encompassing body and mind, as well as spirit. I am also referring to a transcendent sense of interconnection that moves beyond the knowable, visible material world. This sense of interconnection has been described variously as divinity, the sacred, spirit, or simply the universe. My understanding is also grounded in a form of lived spirituality, which is directly accessible to all and which does not need to be mediated by religious experts, institutions or theological texts; this is what is often referred to as the mystical side of spirituality... Spirituality can be as much about practices of compassion, love, ethics, and truth defined in nonreligious terms as it can be related to the mystical reinterpretations of existing religious traditions.

David Carrasco states that Mesoamerican spiritual or religious beliefs have historically always been evolving in response to the conditions of the world around them: &quot;These ritual and mythic traditions were not mere repetitions of ancient ways. New rituals and mythic stories were produced to respond to ecological, social, and economic changes and crises.&quot; This was represented through the art of the Olmecs, Maya, and Mexica. European colonizers sought and worked to destroy Mesoamerican worldviews regarding spirituality and replace these with a Christian model. The colonizers used syncreticism in art and culture, exemplified through practices such as the idea presented in the Testerian Codices that &quot;Jesus ate tortillas with his disciples at the last supper&quot; or the creation of the Virgen de Guadalupe (mirroring the Christian Mary) in order to force Christianity into Mesoamerican cosmology.

Chicanos can create new spiritual traditions by recognizing this history or &quot;by observing the past and creating a new reality&quot;. Gloria Anzaldua states that this can be achieved through nepantla spirituality or a space where, as stated by Jesus Mendoza, &quot;all religious knowledge can coexist and create a new spirituality ... where no one is above the other ... a place where all is useful and none is rejected.&quot; Anzaldua and other scholars acknowledge that this is a difficult process that involves navigating many internal contradictions in order to find a path towards spiritual liberation. Cherrie Moraga calls for a deeper self-exploration of who Chicanos are in order to reach &quot;a place of deeper inquiry into ourselves as a people ... possibly, we must turn our eyes away from racist America and take stock at the damages done to us. Possibly, the greatest risks yet to be taken are entre nosotros, where we write, paint, dance, and draw the wound for one another to build a stronger pueblo. The women artist seemed disposed to do this, their work often mediating the delicate area between cultural affirmation and criticism.&quot; Laura E. Pérez states in her study of Chicana art that &quot;the artwork itself [is] altar-like, a site where the disembodied—divine, emotional, or social—[is] acknowledged, invoked, meditated upon, and released as a shared offering.&quot;

== Cultural aspects ==

The diversity of Chicano cultural production is vast. Guillermo Gómez-Peña wrote that the complexity and diversity of the Chicano community includes influences from Central American, Caribbean, Africans, and Asian Americans who have moved into Chicano communities as well as queer people of color. Many Chicano artists continue to question &quot;conventional, static notions of &quot;Chicanismo&quot;,&quot; while others conform to more conventional cultural traditions.

=== Film ===
Chicano film has been marginalized since its inception and was established in the 1960s. The generally marginal status of Chicanos in the film industry has meant that many Chicano films are not released with wide theatrical distribution. Chicano film emerged from the creation of political plays and documentaries. This included El Teatro Campesino&#x27;s &quot;Yo Soy Joaquín&quot; (1969), Luis Valdez&#x27;s &quot;El Corrido&quot; (1976), and Efraín Gutiérrez&#x27;s &quot;Please, Don&#x27;t Bury Me Alive!&quot; (1976), the latter of which is referred to as the first full-length Chicano film.

Docudramas then emerged like Esperanza Vasquez&#x27;s &quot;Agueda Martínez&quot; (1977), Jesús Salvador Treviño&#x27;s &quot;Raíces de Sangre&quot; (1977), and Robert M. Young&#x27;s &quot;¡Alambrista!&quot; (1977). Luis Valdez&#x27;s &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; (1981), Young&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez&quot; (1982), Gregory Nava&#x27;s, &quot;My Family/Mi familia&quot; (1995) and &quot;Selena&quot; (1997), and Josefina López&#x27;s &quot;Real Women Have Curves&quot; (2002). Chicana/o films continue to be regarded as a small niche in the film industry that has yet to receive mainstream commercial success. However, Chicana/o films have been influential in shaping how Chicana/os see themselves.

=== Literature ===
Chicano literature tends to focus on challenging the dominant narrative, while embracing notions of hybridity, including the use of Spanglish, as well as the blending of genre forms, such as fiction and autobiography. José Antonio Villarreal&#x27;s &quot;Pocho&quot; (1959) is widely recognized as the first major Chicano novel. Poet Alurista wrote that Chicano literature served an important role to push back against narratives by white Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture that sought to &quot;keep Mexicans in their place.&quot;

Rodolfo &quot;Corky&quot; Gonzales&#x27;s &quot;Yo Soy Joaquin&quot; is one of the first examples of explicitly Chicano poetry. Other early influential poems included &quot;El Louie&quot; by José Montoya and Abelardo &quot;Lalo&quot; Delgado&#x27;s poem &quot;Stupid America.&quot; In 1967, Octavio Romano founded Tonatiuh-Quinto Sol Publications, which was the first dedicated Chicano publication houses. The novel &quot;Chicano&quot; (1970) by Richard Vasquez, was the first novel about Mexican Americans to be released by a major publisher. It was widely read in high schools and universities during the 1970s and is now recognized as a breakthrough novel.

Chicana feminist writers have tended to focus on themes of identity, questioning how identity is constructed, who constructs it, and for what purpose in a racist, classist, and patriarchal structure. Characters in books such as &quot;Victuum&quot; (1976) by Isabella Ríos, &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot; (1983) by Sandra Cisneros, &quot;Loving in the War Years: lo que nunca pasó por sus labios&quot; (1983) by Cherríe Moraga, &quot;The Last of the Menu Girls&quot; (1986) by Denise Chávez, &quot;Margins&quot; (1992) by Terri de la Peña, and &quot;Gulf Dreams&quot; (1996) by Emma Pérez have also been read regarding how they intersect with themes of gender and sexuality. Catrióna Rueda Esquibel performs a queer reading of Chicana literature in &quot;With Her Machete in Her Hand&quot; (2006) to demonstrate how some of the intimate relationships between girls and women contributed to a discourse on homoeroticism and queer sexuality in Chicana/o literature.

Chicano characters who were gay tended to be removed from the &quot;barrio&quot; and were typically portrayed with negative attributes, such as the character of &quot;Joe Pete&quot; in &quot;Pocho&quot; and the unnamed protagonist of John Rechy&#x27;s &quot;City of Night&quot; (1963). Other characters in the Chicano canon may also be read as queer, including the unnamed protagonist of Tomás Rivera&#x27;s &quot;...y no se lo tragó la tierra&quot; (1971), and &quot;Antonio Márez&quot; in Rudolfo Anaya&#x27;s &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; (1972). Juan Bruce-Novoa wrote that homosexuality was &quot;far from being ignored during the 1960s and 1970s,&quot; despite homophobia restricting representations: &quot;our community is less sexually repressive than we might expect&quot;.

=== Music ===
Lalo Guerrero has been lauded as the &quot;father of Chicano music.&quot; Beginning in the 1930s, he wrote songs in the big band and swing genres and expanded into traditional genres of Mexican music. During the farmworkers&#x27; rights campaign, he wrote music in support of César Chávez and the United Farm Workers. Other notable musicians include Selena, who sang a mixture of Mexican, Tejano, and American popular music, and died in 1995 at the age of 23; Zack de la Rocha, social activist and lead vocalist of Rage Against the Machine; and Los Lonely Boys, a Texas-style country rock band.

==== Chicano electro ====

Chicano techno and electronic music artists DJ Rolando, Santiago Salazar, DJ Tranzo, and Esteban Adame have released music through independent labels like Underground Resistance, Planet E, Krown Entertainment, and Rush Hour. In the 1990s, house music artists such as DJ Juanito (Johnny Loopz), Rudy &quot;Rude Dog&quot; Gonzalez, and Juan V. released numerous tracks through Los Angeles–based house labels Groove Daddy Records and Bust A Groove.

DJ Rolando&#x27;s techno track &quot;Knights of the Jaguar,&quot; released on the UR label in 1999, became the most well-known Chicano techno track after charting at #43 in the UK in 2000. Mixmag commented: &quot;after it was released, it spread like wildfire all over the world. It&#x27;s one of those rare tracks that feels like it can play for an eternity without anyone batting an eyelash.&quot; It&#x27;s consistently placed on Best Songs lists. The official video for the track features various portraits of Chicana/os in Detroit among several Chicano murals, lowrider cars and lowrider bicycles, and lifestyle.

Salazar and Adame are also affiliated with Underground Resistance and have collaborated with Nomadico. Salazar founded music labels Major People, Ican (as in &quot;Mex-Ican&quot;, with Esteban Adame) and Historia y Violencia (with Juan Mendez a.k.a. Silent Servant) and released his debut album &quot;Chicanismo&quot; in 2015 to positive reviews. Nomadico&#x27;s label Yaxteq, founded in 2015, has released tracks by veteran Los Angeles techno producer Xavier De Enciso and Honduran producer Ritmos.

==== Chicano folk ====
A growing Tex-Mex polka band trend influenced by the &#x27; and &#x27; music of Mexican immigrants, has in turn influenced much new Chicano folk music, especially on large-market Spanish language radio stations and on television music video programs in the U.S. Some of these artists, like the band Quetzal, are known for the political content of political songs.

==== Chicano rap ====
Hip hop culture, which is cited as having formed in the 1980s street culture of African American, West Indian (especially Jamaican), and Puerto Rican New York City Bronx youth and characterized by DJing, rap music, graffiti, and breakdancing, was adopted by many Chicano youth by the 1980s as its influence moved westward across the United States. Chicano artists were beginning to develop their own style of hip hop. Rappers such as Ice-T and Eazy-E shared their music and commercial insights with Chicano rappers in the late 1980s. Chicano rapper Kid Frost, who is often cited as &quot;the godfather of Chicano rap&quot; was highly influenced by Ice-T and was even cited as his protégé. Chicano rap is a unique style of hip hop music which started with Kid Frost, who saw some mainstream exposure in the early 1990s. While Mellow Man Ace was the first mainstream rapper to use Spanglish, Frost&#x27;s song &quot;La Raza&quot; paved the way for its use in American hip hop. Chicano rap tends to discuss themes of importance to young urban Chicanos. Some of the most prominent Chicano artists include A.L.T., Lil Rob, Psycho Realm, Baby Bash, Serio, Proper Dos, Conejo, A Lighter Shade of Brown, and Funky Aztecs. Chicano rap artists with less mainstream exposure, yet with popular underground followings include Cali Life Style, Ese 40&#x27;z, Sleepy Loka, Ms. Sancha, Mac Rockelle, Sir Dyno.

Chicano R&amp;B artists include Paula DeAnda, Amanda Perez, Frankie J, and Victor Ivan Santos (early member of the Kumbia Kings and associated with Baby Bash).

==== Chicano jazz ====
Although Latin jazz is most popularly associated with artists from the Caribbean (particularly Cuba) and Brazil, young Mexican Americans have played a role in its development over the years, going back to the 1930s and early 1940s, the era of the zoot suit, when young Mexican-American musicians in Los Angeles and San Jose, such as Jenni Rivera, began to experiment with &quot;&quot;, a jazz-like fusion genre that has grown recently in popularity among Mexican Americans

==== Chicano rock ====
In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, a wave of Chicano pop music surfaced through innovative musicians Carlos Santana, Johnny Rodriguez, Ritchie Valens and Linda Ronstadt. Joan Baez, who is also of Mexican-American descent, included Hispanic themes in some of her protest folk songs. Chicano rock is rock music performed by Chicano groups or music with themes derived from Chicano culture.

There are two undercurrents in Chicano rock. One is a devotion to the original rhythm and blues roots of Rock and roll including Ritchie Valens, Sunny and the Sunglows, and ? and the Mysterians. Groups inspired by this include Sir Douglas Quintet, Thee Midniters, Los Lobos, War, Tierra, and El Chicano, and, of course, the Chicano Blues Man himself, the late Randy Garribay. The second theme is the openness to Latin American sounds and influences. Trini Lopez, Santana, Malo, Azteca, Toro, Ozomatli and other Chicano Latin rock groups follow this approach. Chicano rock crossed paths of other Latin rock genres (Rock en español) by Cubans, Puerto Ricans, such as Joe Bataan and Ralphi Pagan and South America (Nueva canción). Rock band The Mars Volta combines elements of progressive rock with traditional Mexican folk music and Latin rhythms along with Cedric Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s Spanglish lyrics.

Chicano punk is a branch of Chicano rock. There were many bands that emerged from the California punk scene, including The Zeros, Bags, Los Illegals, The Brat, The Plugz, Manic Hispanic, and the Cruzados; as well as others from outside of California including Mydolls from Houston, Texas and Los Crudos from Chicago, Illinois. The rock band ? and the Mysterians, which was composed primarily of Mexican-American musicians, was the first band to be described as punk rock. The term was reportedly coined in 1971 by rock critic Dave Marsh in a review of their show for &quot;Creem&quot; magazine.

=== Performance arts ===

El Teatro Campesino (The Farmworkers&#x27; Theater) was founded by Luis Valdez and Agustin Lira in 1965 as the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers (UFW) as a result of the Great Delano Grape Strike in 1965. All of the actors were farmworkers and involved in organizing for farmworkers&#x27; rights. Its first performances sought to recruit members for the UFW and dissuade strikebreakers. Many early performances were not scripted and were rather conceived through the direction of Valdez and others through &quot;actos&quot;, in which a scenario would be proposed for a scene and then dialogue would simply be improvised.Chicano performance art continued with the work of Los Angeles&#x27; comedy troupe Culture Clash, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, and Nao Bustamante, known internationally for her conceptual art pieces and as a participant in &quot;Work of Art: The Next Great Artist&quot;. Chicano performance art became popular in the 1970s, blending humor and pathos for tragicomic effect. Groups such as Asco and the Royal Chicano Air Force illustrated this aspect of performance art through their work. Asco (Spanish for &quot;naseau&quot; or &quot;disgust&quot;), composed of Willie Herón, Gronk, Harry Gamboa Jr., and Patssi Valdez, created performance pieces such as the &quot;Walking Mural&quot;, walking down Whittier Boulevard dressed as &quot;a multifaceted mural, a Christmas tree, and the Virgin of Guadalupe. Asco continued its conceptual performance piece until 1987.

In the 1990s, San Diego–based artist cooperative of David Avalos, Louis Hock, and Elizabeth Sisco used their National Endowment for the Arts $5,000 fellowship subversively, deciding to circulate money back to the community: &quot;handing 10-dollar bills to undocumented workers to spend as they please.&quot; Their piece Arte Reembolsa (Art Rebate) created controversy among the art establishment, with the documentation of the piece featuring &quot;footage of U.S. House and Senate members questioning whether the project was, in fact, art.&quot;

One of the most well-known performance art troupes is La Pocha Nostra, which has been covered in numerous articles for various performance art pieces. The troupe has been active since 1993 yet has remained relevant into the 2010s and 2020s due to its political commentary, including anti-corporate stances. The troupe regularly uses parody and humor in their performances to make complex commentary on various social issues. Creating thought-provoking performances that challenge the audience to think differently is often their intention with each performance piece.

=== Visual arts ===
The Chicano visual art tradition, like the identity, is grounded in community empowerment and resisting assimilation and oppression. Prior to the introduction of spray cans, paint brushes were used by Chicano &quot;shoeshine boys [who] marked their names on the walls with their daubers to stake out their spots on the sidewalk&quot; in the early 20th century. Pachuco graffiti culture in Los Angeles was already &quot;in full bloom&quot; by the 1930s and 1940s, pachucos developed their &quot;placa&quot;, &quot;a distinctive calligraphic writing style&quot; which went on to influence contemporary graffiti tagging. Paño, a form of &quot;pinto arte&quot; (a &quot;caló&quot; term for male prisoner) using pen and pencil, developed in the 1930s, first using bed sheets and pillowcases as canvases. Paño has been described as &quot;rasquachismo&quot;, a Chicano worldview and artmaking method which makes the most from the least.

Graffiti artists, such as Charles &quot;Chaz&quot; Bojórquez, developed an original style of graffiti art known as West Coast Cholo style influenced by Mexican murals and pachuco &quot;placas&quot; (tags which indicate territorial boundaries) in the mid-20th century. In the 1960s, Chicano graffiti artists from San Antonio to L.A. (especially in East LA, Whittier, and Boyle Heights) used the art form to challenge authority, tagging police cars, buildings, and subways as &quot;a demonstration of their bravado and anger&quot;, understanding their work as &quot;individual acts of pride or protest, gang declarations of territory or challenge, and weapons in a class war.&quot; Chicano graffiti artists wrote C/S as an abbreviation for &quot;con safos&quot; or the variant &quot;con safo&quot; (loosely meaning &quot;don&#x27;t touch this&quot; and expressing a &quot;the same to you&quot; attitude)—a common expression among Chicanos on the eastside of Los Angeles and throughout the Southwest.

The Chicano Movement and political identity had heavily influenced Chicano artists by the 1970s. Alongside the Black arts movement, this led to the development of institutions such as Self-Help Graphics, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, and Plaza de la Raza. Artists such as Harry Gamboa Jr., Gronk, and Judith Baca created art which &quot;stood in opposition to the commercial galleries, museums, and civic institutional mainstream&quot;. This was exemplified with Asco&#x27;s tagging of LACMA after &quot;a curator refused to even entertain the idea of a Chicano art show within its walls&quot; in 1972. Chicano art collectives such as the Royal Chicano Air Force, founded in 1970 by Ricardo Favela, José Montoya and Esteban Villa, supported the United Farm Workers movement through art activism, using art to create and inspire social change. Favela believed that it was important to keep the culture alive through their artwork. Favela stated &quot;I was dealing with art forms very foreign to me, always trying to do western art, but there was always something lacking... it was very simple: it was just my Chicano heart wanting to do Chicano art.&quot; Other Chicano visual art collectives included Con Safo in San Antonio, which included Felipe Reyes, José Esquivel, Roberto Ríos, Jesse Almazán, Jesse &quot;Chista&quot; Cantú, Jose Garza, Mel Casas, Rudy Treviño, César Martínez, Kathy Vargas, Amado Peña Jr., Robando Briseño, and Roberto Gonzalez. The Mujeres Muralistas in the Mission District, San Francisco included Patricia Rodriguez, Graciela Carrillo, Consuelo Mendez, and Irene Perez.

Chicano muralism, which began in the 1960s, became a state-sanctioned artform in the 1970s as an attempt by outsiders to &quot;prevent gang violence and dissuade graffiti practices&quot;. This led to the creation of murals at Estrada Courts and other sites throughout Chicano communities. In some instances, these murals were covered with the &quot;placas&quot; they were instituted by the state to prevent. Marcos Sanchez-Tranquilino states that &quot;rather than vandalism, the tagging of one&#x27;s own murals points toward a complex sense of wall ownership and a social tension created by the uncomfortable yet approving attentions of official cultural authority.&quot; This created a division between established Chicano artists who celebrated inclusion and acceptance by the dominant culture and younger Chicano artists who &quot;saw greater power in renegade muralism and &quot;barrio&quot; calligraphy than in state-sanctioned pieces.&quot; Chicano poster art became prominent in the 1970s as a way to challenge political authority, with pieces such as Rupert García&#x27;s &quot;Save Our Sister&quot; (1972), depicting Angela Davis, and Yolanda M. López&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s the Illegal Alien, Pilgrim?&quot; (1978) addressing settler colonialism.

The oppositional current of Chicano art was bolstered in the 1980s by a rising hip hop culture. The Olympic freeway murals, including Frank Romero&#x27;s &quot;Going to the Olympics&quot;, created for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles became another site of contestation, as Chicano and other graffiti artists tagged the state-sanctioned public artwork. Government officials, muralists, and some residents were unable to understand the motivations for this, described it &quot;as &quot;mindless&quot;, &quot;animalistic&quot; vandalism perpetrated by &quot;kids&quot; who simply lack respect.&quot; L.A. had developed a distinct graffiti culture by the 1990s and, with the rise of drugs and violence, Chicano youth culture gravitated towards graffiti to express themselves and to mark their territory amidst state-sanctioned disorder. Following the Rodney King riots and the murder of Latasha Harlins, which exemplified an explosion of racial tensions bubbling under in American society, racialized youth in L.A., &quot;feeling forgotten, angry, or marginalized, [embraced] graffiti&#x27;s expressive power [as] a tool to push back.&quot;

Chicano art, although accepted into some institutional art spaces in shows like Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, was still largely excluded from many mainstream art institutions in the 1990s. By the 2000s, attitudes towards graffiti by white hipster culture were changing, as it became known as &quot;street art&quot;. In academic circles, &quot;street art&quot; was termed &quot;post-graffiti&quot;. By the 2000s, where the LAPD once deployed CRASH (Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums) units in traditionally Chicano neighborhoods like Echo Park and &quot;often brutalized suspected taggers and gang members&quot;, &quot;street art&quot; was now being mainstreamed by the white art world in those same neighborhoods.Despite this shift, Chicano artists continued to challenge what was acceptable to both insiders and outsiders of their communities. Controversy surrounding Chicana artist Alma López&#x27;s &quot;Our Lady&quot; at the Museum of International Folk Art in 2001 erupted when &quot;local demonstrators demanded the image be removed from the state-run museum&quot;. Previously, López&#x27;s digital mural &quot;Heaven&quot; (2000), which depicted two Latina women embracing, had been vandalized. López received homophobic slurs, threats of physical violence, and over 800 hate mail inquiries for &quot;Our Lady.&quot; Santa Fe Archbishop Michael J Sheehan referred to the woman in López&#x27;s piece as &quot;a tart or a street woman&quot;. López stated that the response came from the conservative Catholic Church, &quot;which finds women&#x27;s bodies inherently sinful, and thereby promot[es] hatred of women&#x27;s bodies.&quot; The art was again protested in 2011.

Manuel Paul&#x27;s mural &quot;Por Vida&quot; (2015) at Galeria de la Raza in Mission District, San Francisco, which depicted queer and trans Chicanos, was targeted multiple times after its unveiling. Paul, a queer DJ and artist of the Maricón Collective, received online threats for the work. Ani Rivera, director of Galeria de la Raza, attributed the anger towards the mural to gentrification, which has led &quot;some people [to] associate LGBT people with non-Latino communities.&quot; The mural was meant to challenge &quot;long-held assumptions regarding the traditional exclusivity of heterosexuality in lowrider culture&quot;. Some credited the negative response to the mural&#x27;s direct challenging of machismo and heteronormativity in the community.

Xandra Ibarra&#x27;s video art &quot;Spictacle II: La Tortillera&quot; (2004) was censored by San Antonio&#x27;s Department of Arts and Culture in 2020 from &quot;XicanX: New Visions&quot;, a show which aimed to challenge &quot;previous and existing surveys of Chicano and Latino identity-based exhibitions&quot; through highlighting &quot;the womxn, queer, immigrant, indigenous and activist artists who are at the forefront of the movement&quot;. Ibarra stated &quot;the video is designed to challenge normative ideals of Mexican womanhood and is in alignment with the historical lineage of LGBTQAI+ artists&#x27; strategies to intervene in homophobic and sexist violence.&quot;

=== International influence ===

Chicano culture has become popular in some areas internationally, most prominently in Japan, Brazil, and Thailand. Chicano ideas such as Chicano hybridity and borderlands theory have found influence as well, such as in decoloniality. In São Paulo, Chicano cultural influence has formed the &quot;Cho-Low&quot; (combination of &quot;Cholo&quot; and Lowrider) subculture that has formed a sense of cultural pride among youth.

Chicano cultural influence is strong in Japan, where Chicano culture took hold in the 1980s and continued to grow with contributions from Shin Miyata, Junichi Shimodaira, Miki Style, Night Tha Funksta, and MoNa (Sad Girl). Miyata owns a record label, Gold Barrio Records, that re-releases Chicano music. Chicano fashion and other cultural aspects have also been adopted in Japan. There has been debate over whether this is cultural appropriation, with most arguing that it is appreciation rather than appropriation. In an interview asking why Chicano culture is popular in Japan, two long-time proponents of Chicano culture in Japan agreed that &quot;it&#x27;s not about Mexico or about America: it&#x27;s an alluring quality unique to the hybrid nature of Chicano and imprinted in all its resulting art forms, from lowriders in the &#x27;80s to TikTok videos today, that people relate to and appreciate, not only in Japan but around the world.&quot;

Most recently, Chicano culture has found influence in Thailand among working-class men and women that is called &quot;Thaino&quot; culture. They state that they have disassociated the violence that Hollywood portrays of Chicanos from the Chicano people themselves. They have adopted rules of no cocaine or amphetamines, and only marijuana, which is legal in Thailand. The leader of one group stated that he was inspired by how Chicanos created a culture out of defiance &quot;to fight against people who were racist toward them&quot; and that this inspired him, since he was born in a slum in Thailand. He also stated &quot;if you look closely at [Chicano] culture, you&#x27;ll notice how gentle it is. You can see this in their Latin music, dances, clothes, and how they iron their clothes. It&#x27;s both neat and gentle.&quot;

<text>The Canary Islands (, , ), also known informally as the Canaries, are a Spanish region, autonomous community and archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean. At their closest point to the African mainland, they are west of Morocco. They are the southernmost of the autonomous communities of Spain. The islands have a population of 2.2 million people and are the most populous special territory of the European Union.

The seven main islands are from largest to smallest in area, Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, La Gomera, and El Hierro. The only other populated island is La Graciosa, which administratively is dependent on Lanzarote. The archipelago includes many smaller islands and islets, including Alegranza, Isla de Lobos, Montaña Clara, Roque del Oeste, and Roque del Este. It includes a number of rocks, including Garachico and Anaga. In ancient times, the island chain was often referred to as &quot;the Fortunate Isles&quot;. The Canary Islands are the southernmost region of Spain, and the largest and most populous archipelago of Macaronesia. It is also the largest and most populated archipelago in Spain. Because of their location, the Canary Islands have historically been considered a link between Africa, Europe, and the Americas.

In 2024, the Canary Islands had a population of 2,247,927, with a density of 302 inhabitants per km2, making it the seventh most populous autonomous community of Spain. The population is mostly concentrated in the two capital islands: around 43% on the island of Tenerife and 40% on the island of Gran Canaria.

The Canary Islands, especially Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, and Lanzarote, are a major tourist destination, with over 14.1 million visitors in 2023. This is due to their beaches, subtropical climate, and important natural attractions, especially Maspalomas in Gran Canaria and Mount Teide, a World Heritage Site in Tenerife. Mount Teide is the highest peak in Spain and the 3rd tallest volcano in the world, measured from its base on the ocean floor. The islands have warm summers and winters warm enough for the climate to be technically tropical at sea level. The amount of precipitation and the level of maritime moderation vary depending on location and elevation. The archipelago includes green areas as well as semi-desert. The islands&#x27; high mountains are ideal for astronomical observation, because they lie above the temperature inversion layer. As a result, the archipelago has two professional astronomical observatories: the Teide Observatory on Tenerife, and Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma.

In 1927, the Province of Canary Islands was split into two provinces, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas. In 1982, the autonomous community of the Canary Islands was established. The cities of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria are, jointly, the capitals of the islands. Those cities are also, respectively, the capitals of the provinces of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria has been the largest city in the Canaries since 1768, except for a brief period in the 1910s. Between the 1833 territorial division of Spain and 1927, Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands. In 1927, it was ordered by decree that the capital of the Canary Islands would be shared between two cities, and this arrangement persists to the present day. The third largest city in the Canary Islands is San Cristóbal de La Laguna, another World Heritage Site on Tenerife.

During the Age of Sail, the islands were the main stopover for Spanish galleons during the Spanish colonisation of the Americas, which sailed that far south in order to catch the prevailing northeasterly trade winds.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Islas Canarias&quot; is likely derived from the Latin name &quot;Canariae Insulae&quot;, meaning &quot;Islands of the Dogs&quot;, perhaps because monk seals or sea dogs were abundant, a name that was evidently generalized from the ancient name of one of these islands, &quot;Canaria&quot; – presumably Gran Canaria. According to the historian Pliny the Elder, the island &quot;Canaria&quot; contained &quot;vast multitudes of dogs of very large size&quot;. The connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands&#x27; coat-of-arms.

Other theories speculate that the name comes from the Nukkari Berber tribe living in the Moroccan Atlas, named in Roman sources as &quot;Canarii&quot;, though Pliny again mentions the relation of this term with dogs.

The name of the islands is not derived from the canary bird; rather, the birds are named after the islands.

== Islands ==
From west to east, the Canary Islands are El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, and La Graciosa. North of Lanzarote are the islets of Montaña Clara, Alegranza, Roque del Este and Roque del Oeste, belonging to the Chinijo Archipelago. Northeast of Fuerteventura is the islet of Lobos. There are a series of small adjacent rocks in the Canary Islands: the Roques de Anaga, Garachico and Fasnia in Tenerife, and Salmor and Bonanza in El Hierro.
=== El Hierro ===
El Hierro, the westernmost island, covers . It is the second smallest of the major islands, and the least populous with 10,798 inhabitants. The whole island was declared a Reserve of the Biosphere in 2000. Its capital is Valverde. Also known as Ferro, it was once the westernmost known land in the world. Ancient European geographers such as Ptolemy recognised the island as the prime meridian of longitude. That remained so until the 19th century, when it was displaced by the one passing through Greenwich.

=== Fuerteventura ===
Fuerteventura, with a surface of , is the second largest island of the archipelago. It has been declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO. It is the oldest of the islands being more eroded. Its highest point is the Pico de la Zarza, at a height of . Its capital is Puerto del Rosario.

=== Gran Canaria ===
Gran Canaria has 846,717 inhabitants. The capital, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, with 377,203 inhabitants, is the most populous city and shares the status of capital of the Canaries with Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Gran Canaria&#x27;s surface area is . Roque Nublo and Pico de las Nieves (&quot;Peak of Snow&quot;) are located in the center of the island. On the south of the island are the Maspalomas Dunes (Gran Canaria).

=== La Gomera ===
La Gomera (informally known as &#x27;Isla Colombina&#x27;) has an area of and is the second least populous island with 21,136 inhabitants. It has been declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO. Geologically it is one of the oldest of the archipelago. The insular capital is San Sebastian de La Gomera. Garajonay National Park is located on the island.

=== Lanzarote ===
Lanzarote is the easternmost island and one of the oldest of the archipelago, and it has shown evidence of recent volcanic activity. It has a surface of , and a population of 149,183 inhabitants, including the adjacent islets of the Chinijo Archipelago. The capital is Arrecife, with 56,834 inhabitants.

==== Chinijo Archipelago ====
The Chinijo Archipelago includes the islands La Graciosa, Alegranza, Montaña Clara, Roque del Este and Roque del Oeste. It has a surface of , and only La Graciosa is populated, with 658 inhabitants. With , La Graciosa is the largest island of the Chinijo Archipelago and the smallest inhabited island of the Canaries.

===== La Graciosa =====
Graciosa Island or commonly La Graciosa is a volcanic island in the Canary Islands of Spain, located north of the island of Lanzarote across the Strait of El Río. It was formed by the Canary hotspot. The island is part of the Chinijo Archipelago and the Chinijo Archipelago Natural Park (Parque Natural del Archipiélago Chinijo). It is administered by the municipality of Teguise. In 2018, La Graciosa was declared as &quot;the eighth Canary Island&quot; by the Spanish Senate, though it is not recognized as such by the Canarian administration. It is administratively dependent on the island of Lanzarote. It is the smallest and least populated of the main islands, with about 700 people.

=== La Palma ===
La Palma, with 81,863 inhabitants covering an area of , is in its entirety a biosphere reserve. For long it showed no signs of volcanic activity, even though the volcano Teneguía entered into eruption last in 1971. On 19 September 2021, the volcanic Cumbre Vieja on the island erupted. It is the second-highest island of the Canaries, with the Roque de los Muchachos at as its highest point. Santa Cruz de La Palma, known to those on the island as simply &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;, is its capital.

=== Tenerife ===
Tenerife is, with its area of , the most extensive island of the Canary Islands. With 904,713 inhabitants, it is the most populated island of the archipelago and Spain. Two of the islands&#x27; principal cities are located on it: the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and San Cristóbal de La Laguna, a World Heritage Site. San Cristóbal de La Laguna, the second city of the island, is home to the oldest university in the Canary Islands, the University of La Laguna. Teide, with its is the highest peak of Spain and a World Heritage Site. Tenerife is the site of the worst air disaster in the history of aviation, in which 583 people were killed in the collision of two Boeing 747s on 27 March 1977.

== Data ==
== Physical geography ==


Tenerife is the largest and most populous island of the archipelago. Gran Canaria, with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands&#x27; second most populous island, and the third most populous one in Spain after Tenerife (966,354 inhabitants) and Majorca (896,038 inhabitants). The island of Fuerteventura is the second largest in the archipelago and located from the African coast.

The islands form the Macaronesia ecoregion with the Azores, Cape Verde, Madeira, and the Savage Isles. The Canary Islands is the largest and most populated archipelago of the Macaronesia region. The archipelago has seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin.

According to the position of the islands with respect to the north-east trade winds, the climate can be mild and wet or very dry. Several native species form laurisilva forests.

The individual islands in the Canary archipelago tend to have distinct microclimates. Those islands such as El Hierro, La Palma and La Gomera lying to the west of the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist Canary Current. They are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical laurisilva forest. Travelling east toward the African coast, the influence of the current diminishes, and the islands become increasingly arid. Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, the islands which are closest to the African mainland, are effectively desert or semi-desert.

Gran Canaria is known as a &quot;continent in miniature&quot; for its diverse landscapes like Maspalomas and Roque Nublo. The north of Tenerife lies under the influence of the moist Atlantic winds and is well vegetated. The south of the island around the tourist resorts of Playa de las Américas and Los Cristianos is arid. The island rises to almost above sea level. At altitude, in the cool relatively wet climate, forests of the endemic pine &quot;Pinus canariensis&quot; thrive. Many of the plant species in the Canary Islands, like the Canary Island pine and the dragon tree, &quot;Dracaena draco&quot; are endemic, as noted by Sabin Berthelot and Philip Barker Webb in their work, &quot;L&#x27;Histoire Naturelle des Îles Canaries&quot; (1835–50).

=== Climate ===
The climate is warm subtropical/tropical and generally arid, moderated by the sea and in summer by the trade winds. There are a number of microclimates and the classifications range mainly from semi-desert to desert. The majority of the Canary Islands have a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) and a hot semi-desert climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) within the Köppen system, caused partly due to the cool Canary Current. A subtropical humid climate, which is very influenced by the ocean, is in the middle of the islands of La Gomera, Tenerife and La Palma, where laurisilva cloud forests grow.



=== Geology ===
The seven major islands, one minor island, and several small islets were originally volcanic islands, formed by the Canary hotspot. The Canary Islands is the only place in Spain where volcanic eruptions have been recorded during the Modern Era, with some volcanoes still active (El Hierro, 2011).
Volcanic islands such as those in the Canary chain often have steep ocean cliffs caused by catastrophic debris avalanches and landslides. The island chain&#x27;s most recent eruption occurred at Cumbre Vieja, a volcanic ridge on La Palma, in 2021.

The Teide volcano on Tenerife is the highest mountain in Spain, and the third tallest volcano on Earth on a volcanic ocean island. All the islands except La Gomera have been active in the last million years. Four of them, Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro, have historical records of eruptions since European discovery. The islands rise from Jurassic oceanic crust associated with the opening of the Atlantic. Underwater magmatism began during the Cretaceous, and has continued to the present day. The islands were once considered as a distinct physiographic section of the Atlas Mountains province, which is part of the larger African Alpine System division, but are now recognized as being related to a magmatic hot spot.

In the summer of 2011, a series of low-magnitude earthquakes occurred beneath El Hierro. These had a linear trend of northeast–southwest. In October a submarine eruption occurred about south of Restinga. This eruption produced gases and pumice, but no explosive activity was reported.

The following table shows the highest mountains in each of the islands:

=== Natural symbols ===

The official natural symbols associated with Canary Islands are the bird &quot;Serinus canaria&quot; (canary) and the &quot;Phoenix canariensis&quot; palm.
=== National parks ===
Four of Spain&#x27;s thirteen national parks are located in the Canary Islands, more than any other autonomous community. Two of these have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites and the other two are part of Biosphere Reserves. The parks are:

Teide National Park is the oldest and largest national park in the Canary Islands and one of the oldest in Spain. Located in the geographic centre of the island of Tenerife, it is the most visited national park in Spain. In 2010, it became the most visited national park in Europe and second worldwide. The park&#x27;s highlight is the Teide volcano. Standing at an altitude of , it is the highest elevation in Spain and the third largest volcano on Earth from its base. In 2007, the Teide National Park was declared one of the 12 Treasures of Spain.

==Politics==

===Governance===
The regional executive body, the Parliament of the Canary Islands, is presided over by Fernando Clavijo Batlle (Canarian Coalition), the current President of the Canary Islands. The members of the regional legislature, the Parliament of the Canary Islands, has 70 elected legislators. The last regional election took place in May 2023.

The islands have 14 seats in the Spanish Senate. Of these, 11 seats are directly elected, 3 for Gran Canaria, 3 for Tenerife, and 1 each for Lanzarote (including La Graciosa), Fuerteventura, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro. The other 3 are appointed by the regional legislature.

=== Political geography ===
The Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands has two provinces (), Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, whose capitals, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, are capitals of the autonomous community. Each of the seven major islands are ruled by an island council named a &quot;Cabildo Insular&quot;. Each island is subdivided into smaller municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;). Las Palmas is divided into 34 municipalities, and Santa Cruz de Tenerife is divided into 54 municipalities.

The international boundary of the Canaries is disputed in Morocco-Spain relations. In 2022 the UN declared the Canary Island&#x27;s territorial waters as being Moroccan coast and Morocco has authorised gas and oil exploration in what the Canary Islands states to be Canarian territorial waters and Western Sahara waters. Morocco&#x27;s official position is that international laws regarding territorial limits do not authorise Spain to claim seabed boundaries based on the territory of the Canaries, since the Canary Islands enjoy a large degree of autonomy. In fact, the islands do not enjoy any special degree of autonomy, as each one of the Spanish regions is considered an autonomous community, with equal status to the European ones. Under the Law of the Sea, the only islands not granted territorial waters or an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are those that are not fit for human habitation, or do not have an economic life of their own, which is not the case of the Canary Islands.

===Canarian nationalism===

There are some pro-independence political parties, like the National Congress of the Canaries (CNC) and the Popular Front of the Canary Islands. Their popular support is almost insignificant, with no presence in either the autonomous parliament or the &quot;cabildos insulares&quot;. In a 2012 study by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas, when asked about national identity, the majority of respondents from the Canary Islands (53.8%) considered themselves Spanish and Canarian in equal measures, followed by 24% who consider themselves more Canarian than Spanish. 6.1% of the respondents considered themselves only Canarian, and 7% considered themselves only Spanish.

===Defense===

The defense of the territory is the responsibility of the Spanish Armed Forces. Components of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Civil Guard are based in the territory.

== History ==

=== Ancient and pre-Hispanic times ===

Before the arrival of humans, the Canaries were inhabited by prehistoric animals including the giant lizard (&quot;Gallotia goliath&quot;), the Tenerife and Gran Canaria giant rats, and giant tortoises, &quot;Geochelone burchardi&quot; and &quot;Geochelone vulcanica&quot;.

Although the original settlement of what are now called the Canary Islands is not entirely clear, linguistic, genetic, and archaeological analyses indicate that indigenous peoples were living on the Canary Islands at least 2,000 years ago, possibly 3,000, and that they shared a common origin with the Berbers on the nearby North African coast. Reaching the islands may have taken place using several small boats, landing on the easternmost islands Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. These groups came to be known collectively as the Guanches, although &quot;Guanches&quot; had been the name for only the indigenous inhabitants of Tenerife.

According to a 2024 study by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, there is archaeological evidence that the Romans were the first to colonise the islands, during the period from the 1st century BCE to the 1st century CE. There was no overlap with the occupation by the people who were inhabiting the islands at the time of the Spanish conquest, who had first arrived sometime between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE.

As José Farrujia describes, &#x27;The indigenous Canarians lived mainly in natural caves, usually near the coast, above sea level. These caves were sometimes isolated but more commonly formed settlements, with burial caves nearby&#x27;. Archaeological work has uncovered a rich culture visible through artefacts of ceramics, human figures, fishing, hunting and farming tools, plant fibre clothing and vessels, as well as cave paintings. At Lomo de los Gatos on Gran Canaria, a site occupied from 1,600 years ago up until the 1960s, round stone houses, complex burial sites, and associated artefacts have been found. Across the islands are thousands of Libyco-Berber alphabet inscriptions scattered and they have been extensively documented by many linguists.

The social structure of indigenous Canarians encompassed &quot;a system of matrilineal descent in most of the islands, in which inheritance was passed on via the female line. Social status and wealth were hereditary and determined the individual&#x27;s position in the social pyramid, which consisted of the king, the relatives of the king, the lower nobility, villeins, plebeians, and finally executioners, butchers, embalmers, and prisoners&quot;. Their religion was animist, centring on the sun and moon, as well as natural features such as mountains.

===Exploration===

The islands may have been visited by the Phoenicians, the Greeks, and the Carthaginians. King Juba II, Caesar Augustus&#x27;s Numidian protégé, is credited with discovering the islands for the Western world. According to Pliny the Elder, Juba found the islands uninhabited, but found &quot;a small temple of stone&quot; and &quot;some traces of buildings&quot;. Juba dispatched a naval contingent to re-open the dye production facility at Mogador in what is now western Morocco in the early first century AD. That same naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, using Mogador as their mission base.

The names given by Romans to the individual islands were &quot;Ninguaria&quot; or &quot;Nivaria&quot; (Tenerife), &quot;Canaria&quot; (Gran Canaria), &quot;Pluvialia&quot; or &quot;Invale&quot; (Lanzarote), &quot;Ombrion&quot; (La Palma), &quot;Planasia&quot; (Fuerteventura), &quot;Iunonia&quot; or &quot;Junonia&quot; (El Hierro) and &quot;Capraria&quot; (La Gomera).

From the 14th century onward, numerous visits were made by sailors from Majorca, Portugal, and Genoa. Lancelotto Malocello settled on Lanzarote in 1312. The Majorcans established a mission with a bishop in the islands that lasted from 1350 to 1400.

=== Castilian conquest ===

In 1402, the Castilian colonisation of the islands began with the expedition of the French explorers Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle, nobles and vassals of Henry III of Castile, to Lanzarote. From there, they went on to conquer Fuerteventura (1405) and El Hierro. These invasions were &quot;brutal cultural and military clashes between the indigenous population and the Castilians&quot; lasting over a century due to formidable resistance by indigenous Canarians. Professor Mohamed Adhikari has defined the conquest of the islands as a genocide of the Guanches.

Béthencourt received the title King of the Canary Islands, but still recognised King Henry III as his overlord. It was not a simple military enterprise, given the aboriginal resistance on some islands. Neither was it politically, since the particular interests of the nobility (determined to strengthen their economic and political power through the acquisition of the islands) conflicted with those of the states, particularly Castile, which were in the midst of territorial expansion and in a process of strengthening of the crown against the nobility.
Historians distinguish two periods in the conquest of the Canary Islands:

Aristocratic conquest (): This refers to the early conquests carried out by the nobility, for their own benefit and without the direct participation of the Crown of Castile, which merely granted rights of conquest in exchange for pacts of vassalage between the noble conqueror and the Crown. One can identify within this period an early phase known as the Betancurian or Norman conquest, carried out by Jean de Bethencourt (who was originally from Normandy) and Gadifer de la Salle between 1402 and 1405, which involved the islands of Lanzarote, El Hierro, and Fuerteventura. The subsequent phase is known as the Castilian conquest, carried out by Castilian nobles who acquired, through purchases, assignments and marriages, the previously conquered islands and also incorporated the island of La Gomera around 1450.

Royal conquest (): This defines the conquest between 1478 and 1496, carried out directly by the Crown of Castile, during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, who armed and partly financed the conquest of those islands which were still unconquered: Gran Canaria, La Palma and Tenerife. This phase of the conquest came to an end in the year 1496, with the dominion of the island of Tenerife, bringing the entire Canarian Archipelago under the control of the Crown of Castile.
Béthencourt also established a base on the island of La Gomera, but it would be many years before the island was fully conquered. The natives of La Gomera, and of Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and La Palma, resisted the Castilian invaders for almost a century. In 1448, Maciot de Béthencourt sold the lordship of Lanzarote to Portugal&#x27;s Prince Henry the Navigator, an action that was accepted by neither the natives nor the Castilians. Despite Pope Nicholas V ruling that the Canary Islands were under Portuguese control, the crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the Portuguese. In 1479, Portugal and Castile signed the Treaty of Alcáçovas, which settled disputes between Castile and Portugal over the control of the Atlantic. This treaty recognized Castilian control of the Canary Islands but also confirmed Portuguese possession of the Azores, Madeira, and the Cape Verde islands, and gave the Portuguese rights to any further islands or lands in the Atlantic that might be discovered.

The Castilians continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native Guanches, they did not achieve complete control until 1496, when Tenerife and La Palma were finally subdued by Alonso Fernández de Lugo. As a result of this &quot;the native pre-Hispanic population declined quickly due to war, epidemics, and slavery&quot;. The Canaries were incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile. 

=== After the conquest and the introduction of slavery ===
After the conquest, the Castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first sugarcane; then wine, an important item of trade with England. Gran Canaria was conquered by the Crown of Castile on 6 March 1480, and Tenerife was conquered in 1496, and each had its own governor. There has been speculation that the abundance of &quot;Roccella tinctoria&quot; on the Canary Islands offered a profit motive for Jean de Béthencourt during his conquest of the islands. Lichen has been used for centuries to make dyes. This includes royal purple colors derived from &quot;R. tinctoria&quot;, also known as orseille.

The objective of the Spanish Crown to convert the islands into a powerhouse of cultivation required a much larger labour force. This was attained through a brutal practice of enslavement, not only of indigenous Canarians but large numbers of Africans who were forcibly taken from North and Sub-Saharan Africa. Whilst the first slave plantations in the Atlantic region were across Madeira, Cape Verde, and the Canary Islands, it was only the Canary Islands which had an indigenous population and were therefore invaded rather than newly occupied.

This agriculture industry was largely based on sugarcane and the Castilians converted large swaths of the landscape for sugarcane production, and the processing and manufacturing of sugar, facilitated by enslaved labourers. The cities of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria became a stopping point for the Spanish traders, as well as conquistadors, and missionaries on their way to the New World. This trade route brought great wealth to the Castilian social sectors of the islands and soon were attracting merchants and adventurers from all over Europe. As the wealth grew, enslaved African workers were also forced into demeaning domestic roles for the rich Castilians on the islands such as servants in their houses.

Research on the skeletons of some of these enslaved workers from the burial site of Finca Clavijo on Gran Canaria have showed that &#x27;all of the adults buried in Finca Clavijo undertook extensive physical activity that involved significant stress on the spine and appendicular skeleton&#x27; that result from relentless hard labour, akin to the physical abnormalities found with enslaved peoples from other sugarcane plantations around the world. These findings of the physical strain that the enslaved at Finca Clavijo were subjected to in order to provide wealth for the Spanish elite has inspired a poem by British writer Ralph Hoyte, entitled &quot;Close to the Bone&quot;.

As a result of the huge wealth generated, magnificent palaces and churches were built on La Palma during this busy, prosperous period. The Church of El Salvador survives as one of the island&#x27;s finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century. Civilian architecture survives in forms such as Casas de los Sánchez-Ochando or Casa Quintana.

The Canaries&#x27; wealth invited attacks by pirates and privateers. Ottoman Turkish admiral and privateer Kemal Reis ventured into the Canaries in 1501, while Murat Reis the Elder captured Lanzarote in 1585.

The most severe attack took place in 1599, during the Dutch Revolt. A Dutch fleet of 74 ships and 12,000 men, commanded by Pieter van der Does, attacked the capital Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (the city had 3,500 of Gran Canaria&#x27;s 8,545 inhabitants). The Dutch attacked the Castillo de la Luz, which guarded the harbor. The Canarians evacuated civilians from the city, and the Castillo surrendered (but not the city). The Dutch moved inland, but Canarian cavalry drove them back to Tamaraceite, near the city.

The Dutch then laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of all its wealth. They received 12 sheep and 3 calves. Furious, the Dutch sent 4,000 soldiers to attack the Council of the Canaries, who were sheltering in the village of Santa Brígida. Three hundred Canarian soldiers ambushed the Dutch in the village of Monte Lentiscal, killing 150 and forcing the rest to retreat. The Dutch concentrated on Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, attempting to burn it down. The Dutch pillaged Maspalomas, on the southern coast of Gran Canaria, San Sebastián on La Gomera, and Santa Cruz on La Palma, but eventually gave up the siege of Las Palmas and withdrew.

In 1618 the Barbary pirates from North Africa attacked Lanzarote and La Gomera taking 1000 captives to be sold as slaves. Another noteworthy attack occurred in 1797, when Santa Cruz de Tenerife was attacked by a British fleet under Horatio Nelson on 25 July. The British were repulsed, losing almost 400 men. It was during this battle that Nelson lost his right arm.

Apart from the passage of Christopher Columbus, the Canary Islands were the site of some of the most important fleets in Western history. Such as the fleet of the Virginia Company in 1606, which marked the foundation of Fort Jamestown -the first permanent English settlement in what is now the United States- and the passage of the First Fleet through Tenerife, which marked the first European settlement in Australia in Botany Bay.

=== 18th to 19th century ===

The sugar-based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from Spain&#x27;s Caribbean colonies. Low sugar prices in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands. A new cash crop, cochineal (&quot;cochinilla&quot;), came into cultivation during this time, reinvigorating the islands&#x27; economy. During this time the Canarian-American trade was developed, in which Canarian products such as cochineal, sugarcane and rum were sold in American ports such as Veracruz, Campeche, La Guaira and Havana, among others.

By the end of the 18th century, Canary Islanders had already emigrated to Spanish American territories, such as Havana, Veracruz, and Santo Domingo, San Antonio, Texas and St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. These economic difficulties spurred mass emigration during the 19th and first half of the 20th century, primarily to the Americas. Between 1840 and 1890 as many as 40,000 Canary Islanders emigrated to Venezuela. Also, thousands of Canarians moved to Puerto Rico where the Spanish monarchy felt that Canarians would adapt to island life better than other immigrants from the mainland of Spain. Deeply entrenched traditions, such as the Mascaras Festival in the town of Hatillo, Puerto Rico, are an example of Canarian culture still preserved in Puerto Rico. Similarly, many thousands of Canarians emigrated to the shores of Cuba. During the Spanish–American War of 1898, the Spanish fortified the islands against a possible American attack, but no such event took place.

=== Romantic period and scientific expeditions ===
Sirera and Renn (2004) distinguish two different types of expeditions, or voyages, during the period 1770–1830, which they term &quot;the Romantic period&quot;:

First are &quot;expeditions financed by the States, closely related with the official scientific Institutions. characterised by having strict scientific objectives (and inspired by) the spirit of Illustration and progress&quot;. In this type of expedition, Sirera and Renn include the following travellers:
* J. Edens, whose 1715 ascent and observations of Mt. Teide influenced many subsequent expeditions.
* Louis Feuillée (1724), who was sent to measure the meridian of El Hierro and to map the islands.
* Jean-Charles de Borda (1771, 1776) who more accurately measured the longitudes of the islands and the height of Mount Teide
* the Baudin-Ledru expedition (1796) which aimed to recover a valuable collection of natural history objects.

The second type of expedition identified by Sirera and Renn is one that took place starting from more or less private initiatives. Among these, the key exponents were the following:
* Alexander von Humboldt (1799)
* Buch and Smith (1815)
* Broussonet
* Webb
* Sabin Berthelot.

Sirera and Renn identify the period 1770–1830 as one in which &quot;In a panorama dominated until that moment by France and England enters with strength and brio Germany of the Romantic period whose presence in the islands will increase&quot;.

=== Early 20th century ===

At the beginning of the 20th century, the British introduced a new cash-crop, the banana, the export of which was controlled by companies such as Fyffes.

30 November 1833 the Province of Canary Islands had been created with the capital being declared as Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The rivalry between the cities of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife for the capital of the islands led to the division of the archipelago into two provinces on 23 September 1927.

During the time of the Second Spanish Republic, Marxist and anarchist workers&#x27; movements began to develop, led by figures such as Jose Miguel Perez and Guillermo Ascanio. However, outside of a few municipalities, these organisations were a minority and fell easily to Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War.

=== Franco regime ===

In 1936, Francisco Franco was appointed General Commandant of the Canaries. He joined the military revolt of 17 July which began the Spanish Civil War. Franco quickly took control of the archipelago, except for a few points of resistance on La Palma and in the town of Vallehermoso, on La Gomera. Though there was never a war in the islands, the post-war suppression of political dissent on the Canaries was most severe.

During the Second World War, Winston Churchill prepared plans for the British seizure of the Canary Islands as a naval base, in the event of Gibraltar being invaded from the Spanish mainland. The planned operation was known as Operation Pilgrim.

Opposition to Franco&#x27;s regime did not begin to organise until the late 1950s, which experienced an upheaval of parties such as the Communist Party of Spain and the formation of various nationalist, leftist parties.

During the Ifni War, the Franco regime set up concentration camps on the islands to extrajudicially imprison those in Western Sahara suspected of disloyalty to Spain, many of whom were colonial troops recruited on the spot but were later deemed to be potential fifth columnists and deported to the Canary Islands. These camps were characterised by the use of forced labour for infrastructure projects and highly unsanitary conditions resulting in the widespread occurrence of tuberculosis.

=== Self-governance ===

After the death of Franco, there was a pro-independence armed movement based in Algeria, the Movement for the Independence and Self-determination of the Canaries Archipelago (MAIAC). In 1968, the Organisation of African Unity recognized the MAIAC as a legitimate African independence movement, and declared the Canary Islands as an African territory still under foreign rule.

After the establishment of a democratic constitutional monarchy in Spain, autonomy was granted to the Canaries via a law passed in 1982, with a newly established autonomous devolved government and parliament. In 1983, the first autonomous elections were held. The Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) won.

=== Capitals ===
At present, the Canary Islands is the only autonomous community in Spain that has two capitals: Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, since the was created in 1982.

The political capital of the archipelago did not exist as such until the nineteenth century. The first cities founded by the Europeans at the time of the conquest of the Canary Islands in the 15th century were: Telde (in Gran Canaria), San Marcial del Rubicón (in Lanzarote) and Betancuria (in Fuerteventura). These cities boasted the first European institutions present in the archipelago, including Catholic bishoprics. Although, because the period of splendor of these cities developed before the total conquest of the archipelago and its incorporation into the Crown of Castile never had a political and real control of the entire Canary archipelago.

The function of a Canarian city with full jurisdiction for the entire archipelago only exists after the conquest of the Canary Islands, although originally &quot;de facto&quot;, that is, without legal and real meaning and linked to the headquarters of the Canary Islands General Captaincy.

Las Palmas de Gran Canaria was the first city that exercised this function. This is because the residence of the Captain General of the Canary Islands was in this city during part of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In May 1661, the Captain General of the Canary Islands, Jerónimo de Benavente y Quiñones, moved the headquarters of the captaincy to the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna on the island of Tenerife. This was due to the fact that this island since the conquest was the most populated, productive and with the highest economic expectations. La Laguna would be considered the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the archipelago until the official status of the capital of Canary Islands in the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife was confirmed in the 19th century, due in part to the constant controversies and rivalries between the bourgeoisies of San Cristóbal de La Laguna and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria for the economic, political and institutional hegemony of the archipelago.

Already in 1723, the Captain General of the Canary Islands Lorenzo Fernandez de Villavicencio had moved the headquarters of the General Captaincy of the Canary Islands from San Cristóbal de La Laguna to Santa Cruz de Tenerife. This decision continued without pleasing the society of the island of Gran Canaria. It would be after the creation of the Province of Canary Islands in November 1833 in which Santa Cruz would become the first fully official capital of the Canary Islands (&quot;De jure&quot; and not of &quot;de facto&quot; as happened previously). Santa Cruz de Tenerife would be the capital of the Canary archipelago until during the Government of General Primo de Rivera in 1927 the Province of Canary Islands was split in two provinces: Las Palmas with capital in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, and Santa Cruz de Tenerife with capital in the homonymous city.

Finally, with the Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands in 1982 and the creation of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands, the capital of the archipelago between Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife is fixed, which is how it remains today.

== Demographics ==

The Canary Islands have a population of 2,153,389 inhabitants (2019), making it the eighth most populous of Spain&#x27;s autonomous communities. The total area of the archipelago is , resulting in a population density of 287.4 inhabitants per square kilometre.

The population of the islands according to the 2019 data are:
* Tenerife – 917,841
* Gran Canaria – 851,231
* Lanzarote – 152,289 (including the population of La Graciosa)
* Fuerteventura – 116,886
* La Palma – 82,671
* La Gomera – 21,503
* El Hierro – 10,968
The Canary Islands have become home to many European residents, mainly coming from Italy, Germany and the UK. Because of the vast immigration to Venezuela and Cuba during the second half of the 20th century and the later return to the Canary Islands of these people along with their families, there are many residents whose country of origin was Venezuela (66,593) or Cuba (41,807). Since the 1990s, many illegal migrants have reached the Canary Islands, Melilla and Ceuta, using them as entry points to the EU. A record number of 46,843 migrants, mostly from Senegal, Mali and Morocco, arrived illegally in the Canary Islands in 2024, up from 39,910 in 2023.
=== Religion ===
The Catholic Church has been the majority religion in the archipelago for more than five centuries, ever since the Conquest of the Canary Islands. There are also several other religious communities.

==== Roman Catholic Church ====

The overwhelming majority of native Canarians are Roman Catholic (76.7%) with various smaller foreign-born populations of other Christian beliefs such as Protestants.

The appearance of the Virgin of Candelaria (Patron of Canary Islands) was credited with moving the Canary Islands toward Christianity. Two Catholic saints were born in the Canary Islands: Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur and José de Anchieta. Both born on the island of Tenerife, they were respectively missionaries in Guatemala and Brazil.

The Canary Islands are divided into two Catholic dioceses, each governed by a bishop:
* Diócesis Canariense: Includes the islands of the Eastern Province: Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Its capital was San Marcial El Rubicón (1404) and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (1483–present). There was a previous bishopric which was based in Telde, but it was later abolished.
* Diócesis Nivariense: Includes the islands of the western province: Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro. Its capital is San Cristóbal de La Laguna (1819–present).

==== Other religions ====
Separate from the overwhelming Catholic majority are a minority of Muslims. Among the followers of Islam, the Islamic Federation of the Canary Islands exists to represent the Islamic community in the Canary Islands as well as to provide practical support to members of the Islamic community. For its part, there is also the Evangelical Council of the Canary Islands in the archipelago.

Other religious faiths represented include Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as Hinduism. Minority religions are also present such as the Church of the Guanche People which is classified as a neo-pagan native religion. Also present are Buddhism, Judaism, Baháʼí, African religion, and Chinese religions.

==== Statistics ====
The distribution of beliefs in 2012 according to the CIS Barometer Autonomy was as follows:
* Catholic 84.9%
* Atheist/Agnostic/Unbeliever 12.3%
* Other religions 1.7%

=== Population genetics ===
The native inhabitants of the Canary Islands hold a gene pool that is predominantly European and native Guanche. It was found that Guanche males contributed less to the gene pool of modern Canary Islanders than Guanche females. Haplogroups typical among the Guanche have been found at high frequencies in Latin America, suggesting that descendants of the Guanche played an active role in the Spanish colonization of the Americas.

In 2017, the first genome-wide data from the Guanches confirmed a North African origin and that they were genetically most similar to ancient North African Berber peoples of the nearby North African mainland. It also showed that modern inhabitants of Gran Canaria carry an estimated 16%–31% Guanche autosomal ancestry. A 2018 genetic study found that the Canarian population is, on average at an autosomal level, 75% European, 22% North African and 3% Sub-saharan.

== Economy and environment ==


The economy is based primarily on tourism, which makes up 32% of the GDP. The Canaries receive about 12 million tourists per year. Construction makes up nearly 20% of the GDP and tropical agriculture, primarily bananas and tobacco, are grown for export to Europe and the Americas. Ecologists are concerned that the resources, especially in the more arid islands, are being overexploited but there are still many agricultural resources like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cochineal, sugarcane, grapes, vines, dates, oranges, lemons, figs, wheat, barley, maize, apricots, peaches and almonds.

Water resources are also being overexploited, due to the high water usage by tourists. Also, some islands (such as Gran Canaria and Tenerife) overexploit the ground water. This is done in such degree that, according to European and Spanish legal regulations, the current situation is not acceptable. To address the problems, good governance and a change in the water use paradigm have been proposed. These solutions depend largely on controlling water use and on demand management. As this is administratively difficult and politically unpalatable, most action is currently directed at increasing the public offer of water through import from outside; a decision which is economically, politically and environmentally questionable.

To bring in revenue for environmental protection, innovation, training and water sanitation a tourist tax was considered in 2018, along with a doubling of the ecotax and restrictions on holiday rents in the zones with the greatest pressure of demand.

The economy is € 25 billion (2001 GDP figures). The islands experienced continuous growth during a 20-year period, up until 2001, at a rate of approximately 5% annually. This growth was fueled mainly by huge amounts of foreign direct investment, mostly to develop tourism real estate (hotels and apartments), and European Funds (near €11 billion in the period from 2000 to 2007), since the Canary Islands are labelled Region Objective 1 (eligible for euro structural funds). Additionally, the EU allows the Canary Islands Government to offer special tax concessions for investors who incorporate under the Zona Especial Canaria (ZEC) regime and create more than five jobs.

Spain gave permission in August 2014 for Repsol and its partners to explore oil and natural gas prospects off the Canary Islands, involving an investment of €7.5 billion over four years, to commence at the end of 2016. Repsol at the time said the area could ultimately produce 100,000 barrels of oil a day, which would meet 10 percent of Spain&#x27;s energy needs. However, the analysis of samples obtained did not show the necessary volume nor quality to consider future extraction, and the project was scrapped.

Despite currently having very high dependence on fossil fuels, research on the renewable energy potential concluded that a high potential for renewable energy technologies exists on the archipelago. This, in such extent even that a scenario pathway to 100% renewable energy supply by 2050 has been put forward.

The Canary Islands have great natural attractions, climate and beaches make the islands a major tourist destination, being visited each year by about 12 million people (11,986,059 in 2007, noting 29% of Britons, 22% of Spanish (from outside the Canaries), and 21% of Germans). Among the islands, Tenerife has the largest number of tourists received annually, followed by Gran Canaria and Lanzarote. The archipelago&#x27;s principal tourist attraction is the Teide National Park (in Tenerife) where the highest mountain in Spain and third largest volcano in the world (Mount Teide), receives over 2.8 million visitors annually.

The combination of high mountains, proximity to Europe, and clean air has made the Roque de los Muchachos peak (on La Palma island) a leading location for telescopes like the Grantecan.

The islands, as an autonomous region of Spain, are in the European Union and the Schengen Area. They are in the European Union Customs Union but outside the VAT area. Instead of VAT there is a local Sales Tax (IGIC) which has a general rate of 7%, an increased tax rate of 13.5%, a reduced tax rate of 3% and a zero tax rate for certain basic need products and services. Consequently, some products are subject to additional VAT if being exported from the islands into mainland Spain or the rest of the EU.

Canarian time is Western European Time (WET), or GMT. In summer, one hour ahead of GMT. Canarian time is one hour behind mainland Spain, and the same time as the UK, Ireland and mainland Portugal all year round.

=== Tourism statistics ===
The number of tourists who visited the Canary Islands in 2022 was 14,617,383. In 2023, there were 16,210,911 arrivals.


=== GDP statistics ===
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the Canary Islands in 2015 was , per capita. The figures by island are as follows:

== Transport ==

The Canary Islands have eight airports altogether, two of the main ports of Spain, and an extensive network of autopistas (highways) and other roads. For a road map see multimap. Traffic congestion is sometimes a problem in Tenerife and on Grand Canaria.

Large ferry boats and fast ferries link most of the islands. Both types can transport large numbers of passengers, cargo, and vehicles. Fast ferries are made of aluminium and powered by modern and efficient diesel engines, while conventional ferries have a steel hull and are powered by heavy oil. Fast ferries travel in excess of ; conventional ferries travel in excess of , but are slower than fast ferries. A typical ferry ride between La Palma and Tenerife may take up to eight hours or more while a fast ferry takes about two and a half hours and between Tenerife and Gran Canaria can be about one hour.

The largest airport is the Gran Canaria Airport. Tenerife has two airports, Tenerife North Airport and Tenerife South Airport. The island of Tenerife gathers the highest passenger movement of all the Canary Islands through its two airports. The two main islands (Tenerife and Gran Canaria) receive the greatest number of passengers. Tenerife 6,204,499 passengers and Gran Canaria 5,011,176 passengers.

The port of Las Palmas is first in freight traffic in the islands, while the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the first fishing port with approximately 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the Spanish government publication Statistical Yearbook of State Ports. Similarly, it is the second port in Spain as regards ship traffic, only surpassed by the Port of Algeciras Bay. The port&#x27;s facilities include a border inspection post (BIP) approved by the European Union, which is responsible for inspecting all types of imports from third countries or exports to countries outside the European Economic Area. The port of Los Cristianos (Tenerife) has the greatest number of passengers recorded in the Canary Islands, followed by the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The Port of Las Palmas is the third port in the islands in passengers and first in number of vehicles transported.

The SS America was beached at the Canary islands on 18 January 1994. However, the ocean liner broke apart after the course of several years and eventually sank beneath the surface.

=== Rail transport ===
The Tenerife Tram opened in 2007 and is currently the only one in the Canary Islands, travelling between the cities of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and San Cristóbal de La Laguna.

Three more railway lines are being planned for the Canary Islands:

* Hospital General de Fuerteventura – Fuerteventura

== Wildlife ==
=== Fauna ===
The bird life includes European and African species, such as the black-bellied sandgrouse, canary, graja – a subspecies of red-billed chough endemic to La Palma, Gran Canaria blue chaffinch, Tenerife blue chaffinch, Canary Islands chiffchaff, Fuerteventura chat, Tenerife goldcrest, La Palma chaffinch, Canarian Egyptian vulture, Bolle&#x27;s pigeon, laurel pigeon, plain swift, and houbara bustard.

Terrestrial fauna includes the El Hierro giant lizard, Tachina canariensis, La Gomera giant lizard, and the La Palma giant lizard. Mammals include the Canarian shrew, Canary big-eared bat, the Algerian hedgehog, and the more recently introduced mouflon.

==== Extinct fauna ====

The Canary Islands were previously inhabited by a variety of endemic animals, such as extinct giant lizards (&quot;Gallotia goliath&quot;), giant tortoises (&quot;Centrochelys burchardi&quot; and &quot;C. vulcanica&quot;), and Tenerife and Gran Canaria giant rats (&quot;Canariomys bravoi&quot; and &quot;C. tamarani&quot;), among others. Extinct birds known only from Pleistocene and Holocene age bones include the Canary Islands quail (&quot;Coturnix gomerae&quot;), dune shearwater (&quot;Puffinus holeae&quot;), lava shearwater (&quot;P. olsoni&quot;), Trias greenfinch (&quot;Chloris triasi&quot;), slender-billed greenfinch (&quot;C. aurelioi&quot;) and the long-legged bunting (&quot;Emberiza alcoveri&quot;).

=== Marine life ===
The marine life found in the Canary Islands is also varied, being a combination of North Atlantic, Mediterranean and endemic species. In recent years, the increasing popularity of both scuba diving and underwater photography have provided biologists with much new information on the marine life of the islands.

Fish species found in the islands include many species of shark, ray, moray eel, bream, jack, grunt, scorpionfish, triggerfish, grouper, goby, and blenny. In addition, there are many invertebrate species, including sponge, jellyfish, anemone, crab, mollusc, sea urchin, starfish, sea cucumber and coral.

There are five species of marine turtle that are sighted periodically in the islands, the most common of these being the endangered loggerhead sea turtle. The other four are the green, hawksbill, leatherback and Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtles. Currently, there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands, and so those seen in the water are usually migrating. However, it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past, and there are records of several sightings of leatherback sea turtle on beaches in Fuerteventura, adding credibility to the theory.

Marine mammals include the large varieties of cetaceans including rare and not well-known species (see more details in the Marine life of the Canary Islands). Hooded seals have also been known to be vagrant in the Canary Islands every now and then. The Canary Islands were also formerly home to a population of the rarest pinniped in the world, the Mediterranean monk seal.

== Holidays ==

Some holidays of those celebrated in the Canary Islands are international and national, others are regional holidays and others are of insular character. The official day of the autonomous community is Canary Islands Day on 30 May. The anniversary of the first session of the Parliament of the Canary Islands, based in the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, held on 30 May 1983, is commemorated with this day.

The common festive calendar throughout the Canary Islands is as follows:

In addition, each of the islands has an island festival, in which it is a holiday only on that specific island. These are the festivities of island patrons saints of each island. Organized chronologically are:

The most famous festivals of the Canary Islands is the carnival. It is the most famous and international festival of the archipelago. The carnival is celebrated in all the islands and all its municipalities, perhaps the two busiest are those of the two Canarian capitals; the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (&quot;Tourist Festival of International Interest&quot;) and the Carnival of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. It is celebrated on the streets between the months of February and March. But the rest of the islands of the archipelago have their carnivals with their own traditions among which stand out: The Festival of the Carneros of El Hierro, the Festival of the Diabletes of Teguise in Lanzarote, Los Indianos de La Palma, the Carnival of San Sebastián de La Gomera and the Carnival of Puerto del Rosario in Fuerteventura.

==Science and technology==

In the 1960s, Gran Canaria was selected as the location for one of the 14 ground stations in the Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN) to support the NASA space program. Maspalomas Station, located in the south of the island, took part in a number of space missions including the Apollo 11 Moon landings and Skylab. Today it continues to support satellite communications as part of the ESA network.

Because of the remote location, a number of astronomical observatories are located in the archipelago, including the Teide Observatory on Tenerife, the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, and the Temisas Astronomical Observatory on Gran Canaria.

Tenerife is the home of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries). There is also an Instituto de Bio-Orgánica Antonio González (Antonio González Bio-Organic Institute) at the University of La Laguna. Also at that university are the Instituto de Lingüística Andrés Bello (Andrés Bello Institute of Linguistics), the Centro de Estudios Medievales y Renacentistas (Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies), the Instituto Universitario de la Empresa (University Institute of Business), the Instituto de Derecho Regional (Regional Institute of Law), the Instituto Universitario de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales (University Institute of Political and Social Sciences) and the Instituto de Enfermedades Tropicales (Institute of Tropical Diseases). The latter is one of the seven institutions of the Red de Investigación de Centros de Enfermedades Tropicales (RICET, &quot;Network of Research of Centers of Tropical Diseases&quot;), located in various parts of Spain. The Instituto Volcanológico de Canarias (Volcanological Institute of the Canary Islands) is based in Tenerife.

== Sports ==
A unique form of wrestling known as Canarian wrestling (&quot;lucha canaria&quot;) has opponents stand in a special area called a &quot;terrero&quot; and try to throw each other to the ground using strength and quick movements.

Another sport is the &quot;game of the sticks&quot; (palo canario) where opponents fence with long sticks. This may have come about from the shepherds of the islands who would challenge each other using their long walking sticks.

Furthermore, there is the shepherd&#x27;s jump (&quot;salto del pastor&quot;). This involves using a long stick to vault over an open area. This sport possibly evolved from the shepherd&#x27;s need to occasionally get over an open area in the hills as they were tending their sheep.

The two main football teams in the archipelago are: the CD Tenerife (founded in 1912) and UD Las Palmas (founded in 1949). As of the 2023/2024 season, UD Las Palmas plays in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. CD Tenerife however plays in The Segunda División. When in the same division, the clubs contest the Canary Islands derby. There are smaller clubs also playing in the mainland Spanish football league system, most notably UD Lanzarote and CD Laguna, although no other Canarian clubs have played in the top flight.

The mountainous terrain of the Canary Islands also caters to the growing popularity of ultra running and ultramarathons as host of annual competitive long-distance events including CajaMar Tenerife Bluetrail on Tenerife, Transvulcania on La Palma, Transgrancanaria on Gran Canaria, and the Half Marathon des Sables on Fuerteventura. A yearly Ironman Triathlon has been taking place on Lanzarote since 1992.

<text>Carlton Douglas Ridenhour (born August 1, 1960), known professionally as Chuck D, is an American rapper, best known as the leader and frontman of the hip hop group Public Enemy, which he co-founded in 1985 with Flavor Flav. Chuck D is also a member of the rock supergroup Prophets of Rage. He has released several solo albums, most notably &quot;Autobiography of Mistachuck&quot; (1996).

His work with Public Enemy helped create politically and socially conscious hip hop music in the mid-1980s. &quot;The Source&quot; ranked him at No. 12 on its list of the Top 50 Hip-Hop Lyricists of All Time. Chuck D has been nominated for six Grammys throughout his career, and has received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award as a member of Public Enemy. He was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013 as a member of Public Enemy.

==Early life==
Ridenhour was born on August 1, 1960, on Long Island, New York. When he was a child, his mother played Motown and showtunes in the home and his father belonged to the Columbia Record Club. He began writing lyrics after the New York City blackout of 1977. He attended W. Tresper Clarke High School, where he was offered no formal education in music. He then went to Adelphi University on Long Island to study graphic design, where he met William Drayton (Flavor Flav). He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Adelphi in 1984 and later received an honorary doctorate from Adelphi in 2013.

While at Adelphi, Ridenhour co-hosted hip hop radio show the &quot;Super Spectrum Mix Hour&quot; as Chuck D on Saturday nights at Long Island rock radio station WLIR, designed flyers for local hip-hop events, and drew a cartoon called &quot;Tales of the Skind&quot; for Adelphi student newspaper &quot;The Delphian&quot;.

==Career==

Ridenhour (using the nickname Chuck D) formed Public Enemy in 1985 with Flavor Flav. Upon hearing Ridenhour&#x27;s demo track &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot;, fledgling producer/upcoming music-mogul Rick Rubin insisted on signing him to his Def Jam Records. Their major label releases were &quot;Yo! Bum Rush the Show&quot; (1987), &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot; (1988), &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; (1990), &quot;Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black&quot; (1991), the compilation album &quot;Greatest Misses&quot; (1992), and &quot;Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age&quot; (1994). They also released a full-length album soundtrack for the film &quot;He Got Game&quot; in 1998.

Ridenhour also contributed (as Chuck D) to several episodes of the documentary series &quot;The Blues&quot;. He has appeared as a featured artist on many other songs and albums, having collaborated with artists such as Janet Jackson, Kool Moe Dee, The Dope Poet Society, Run–D.M.C., Ice Cube, Boom Boom Satellites, Rage Against the Machine, Anthrax, John Mellencamp and many others. In 1990, he appeared on &quot;Kool Thing&quot;, a song by the alternative rock band Sonic Youth, and along with Flavor Flav, he sang on George Clinton&#x27;s song &quot;Tweakin&#x27;&quot;, which appears on his 1989 album &quot;The Cinderella Theory&quot;. In 1993, he was the executive producer for &quot;Got &#x27;Em Running Scared&quot;, an album by Ichiban Records group Chief Groovy Loo and the Chosen Tribe.

===Later career===
In 1996, Ridenhour released &quot;Autobiography of Mistachuck&quot; on Mercury Records. Chuck D made a rare appearance at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards, presenting the Video Vanguard Award to the Beastie Boys, commending their musicianship. In November 1998, he settled out of court with Christopher &quot;The Notorious B.I.G.&quot; Wallace&#x27;s estate over the latter&#x27;s sampling of his voice in the song &quot;Ten Crack Commandments&quot;. The specific sampling is Ridenhour counting off the numbers one to nine on the track &quot;Shut &#x27;Em Down&quot;. He later described the decision to sue as &quot;stupid&quot;.

In September 1999, he launched a multi-format &quot;supersite&quot; on the web site Rapstation.com. The site includes a TV and radio station with original programming, prominent hip hop DJs, celebrity interviews, free MP3 downloads (the first was contributed by rapper Coolio), downloadable ringtones by ToneThis, social commentary, current events, and regular features on turning rap careers into a viable living. Since 2000, he has been one of the most vocal supporters of peer-to-peer file sharing in the music industry.

He loaned his voice to &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; as DJ Forth Right MC for the radio station Playback FM. In 2000, he collaborated with Public Enemy&#x27;s Gary G-Whiz and MC Lyte on the theme music to the television show &quot;Dark Angel&quot;. He appeared with Henry Rollins in a cover of Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;Rise Above&quot; for the album &quot;Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three&quot;. In 2003, he was featured in the PBS documentary &quot;Godfathers and Sons&quot; in which he recorded a version of Muddy Waters&#x27; song &quot;Mannish Boy&quot; with Common, Electrik Mud Cats, and Kyle Jason. He was also featured on Z-Trip&#x27;s album &quot;Shifting Gears&quot; on a track called &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;; a 12-inch of the track was released featuring artwork by Shepard Fairey. In 2008 he contributed a chapter to &quot;Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture&quot; (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. DJ Spooky, and also turned up on The Go! Team&#x27;s album &quot;Proof of Youth&quot; on the track &quot;Flashlight Fight.&quot; He also fulfilled his childhood dreams of being a sports announcer by performing the play-by-play commentary in the video game &quot;NBA Ballers: Chosen One&quot; on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

In 2009, Ridenhour wrote the foreword to the book &quot;The Love Ethic: The Reason Why You Can&#x27;t Find and Keep Beautiful Black Love&quot; by Kamau and Akilah Butler. He also appeared on Brother Ali&#x27;s album &quot;Us&quot;.

In March 2011, Chuck D re-recorded vocals with The Dillinger Escape Plan for a cover of &quot;Fight the Power&quot;.
Chuck D duetted with Rock singer Meat Loaf on his 2011 album &quot;Hell in a Handbasket&quot; on the song &quot;Mad Mad World/The Good God Is a Woman and She Don&#x27;t Like Ugly&quot;.

In 2016 Chuck D joined the band Prophets of Rage along with B-Real and former members of Rage Against the Machine.

In July 2019, Ridenhour sued Terrordome Music Publishing and Reach Music Publishing for $1 million for withholding royalties.

In 2023, Chuck D released a four-part documentary on PBS entitled &quot;Fight the Power: How Hip Hop Changed the World.&quot;

Chuck D had narrated several podcasts, including the hip-hop origin documentary &quot;Can You Dig It?&quot;

==Rapping technique and creative process==

Chuck D is known for his powerful rapping. &quot;How to Rap&quot; says he &quot;has a powerful, resonant voice that is often acclaimed as one of the most distinct and impressive in hip-hop&quot;. Chuck says this was based on listening to Melle Mel and sportscasters such as Marv Albert.

Chuck often comes up with a title for a song first. He writes on paper, though sometimes edits using a computer. He prefers to not punch in or overdub vocals.

Chuck listed his favourite rap albums in &quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot; in March 2000:

#&lt;li value=10&gt; N.W.A, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; 
#&lt;li value=9&gt; Boogie Down Productions, &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; 
#&lt;li value=8&gt; Run-DMC, &quot;Tougher Than Leather&quot; 
#&lt;li value=7&gt; Big Daddy Kane, &quot;Looks Like a Job For...&quot; 
#&lt;li value=6&gt; Stetsasonic, &quot;In Full Gear&quot;
#&lt;li value=5&gt; Ice Cube, &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;
#&lt;li value=4&gt; Dr. Dre, &quot;The Chronic&quot; 
#&lt;li value=3&gt; De La Soul, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; 
#&lt;li value=2&gt; Eric B. &amp; Rakim, &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; 
#&lt;li value=1&gt; Run-DMC, &quot;Raising Hell&quot; (&quot;It was the first record that made me realise this was an album-oriented genre&quot;)

==Politics==
Chuck D identifies as Black, as opposed to African or African-American. In a 1993 issue of DIRT Magazine covering a taping of &quot;In the Mix&quot; hosted by Alimi Ballard at the Apollo, Dan Field writes, At one point, Chuck bristles a bit at the term &quot;African-American.&quot; He thinks of himself as Black and sees nothing wrong with the term. Besides, he says, having been born in the United States and lived his whole life here, he doesn&#x27;t consider himself African. Being in Public Enemy has given him the chance to travel around the world, an experience that really opened his eyes and his mind. He says visiting Africa and experiencing life on a continent where the majority of people are Black gave him a new perspective and helped him get in touch with his own history. He also credits a trip to the ancient Egyptian pyramids at Giza with helping him appreciate the relative smallness of man.
Ridenhour is politically active; he co-hosted &quot;Unfiltered&quot; on Air America Radio, testified before the United States Congress in support of peer-to-peer MP3 sharing, and was involved in a 2004 rap political convention. He has continued to be an activist, publisher, lecturer, and producer.

Addressing the negative views associated with rap music, he co-wrote the essay book &quot;Fight the Power: Rap, Race, and Reality&quot; with Yusuf Jah. He argues that &quot;music and art and culture is escapism, and escapism sometimes is healthy for people to get away from reality&quot;, but sometimes the distinction is blurred and that&#x27;s when &quot;things could lead a young mind in a direction.&quot; He also founded the record company Slam Jamz and acted as narrator in Kareem Adouard&#x27;s short film &quot;Bling: Consequences and Repercussions&quot;, which examines the role of conflict diamonds in bling fashion. Despite Chuck D and Public Enemy&#x27;s success, Chuck D claims that popularity or public approval was never a driving motivation behind their work. He is admittedly skeptical of celebrity status, revealing in a 1999 interview with &quot;BOMB Magazine&quot; that &quot;The key for the record companies is to just keep making more and more stars, and make the ones who actually challenge our way of life irrelevant. The creation of celebrity has clouded the minds of most people in America, Europe and Asia. It gets people off the path they need to be on as individuals.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Le Monde&quot;, published January 29, 2008, Chuck D stated that rap is devolving so much into a commercial enterprise, that the relationship between the rapper and the record label is that of slave to a master. He believes that nothing has changed for African-Americans since the debut of Public Enemy and, although he thinks that an Obama-Clinton alliance is great, he does not feel that the establishment will allow anything of substance to be accomplished. He stated that French President Nicolas Sarkozy is like any other European elite: he has profited through the murder, rape, and pillaging of those less fortunate and he refuses to allow equal opportunity for those men and women from Africa. In this article, he defended a comment made by Professor Griff in the past that he says was taken out of context by the media. The real statement was a critique of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinian people. Chuck D stated that it is Public Enemy&#x27;s belief that all human beings are equal.

In an interview with the magazine &quot;N&#x27;Digo&quot; published in June 2008, he spoke of today&#x27;s mainstream urban music seemingly relishing the addictive euphoria of materialism and sexism, perhaps being the primary cause of many people harboring resentment towards the genre and its future. However, he has expressed hope for its resurrection, saying &quot;It&#x27;s only going to be dead if it doesn&#x27;t talk about the messages of life as much as the messages of death and non-movement&quot;, citing artists such as NYOil, M.I.A. and The Roots as socially conscious artists who push the envelope creatively. &quot;A lot of cats are out there doing it, on the Web and all over. They&#x27;re just not placing their career in the hands of some major corporation.&quot;

In 2010, Chuck D released the track &quot;Tear Down That Wall.&quot; He said &quot;I talked about the wall not only just dividing the U.S. and Mexico but the states of California, New Mexico and Texas. But Arizona, it&#x27;s like, come on. Now they&#x27;re going to enforce a law that talks about basically racial profiling.&quot;

He is on the board of the TransAfrica Forum, a Pan African organization that is focused on African, Caribbean and Latin American issues.

He has been an activist with projects of The Revcoms, such as Refuse Fascism and Stop Mass Incarceration Network. Carl Dix interviewed Chuck D on The Revcoms&#x27; YouTube program &quot;The RNL – Revolution, Nothing Less! – Show&quot;.

In 2022, he endorsed Conrad Tillard, formerly the Nation of Islam Minister known as Conrad Muhammad and subsequently a Baptist Minister, in his campaign for New York State Senate in District 25 (covering part of eastern and north-central Brooklyn).

Chuck D is a US Global Music Ambassador in a programme established by the US State Department and YouTube. It is part of the State Department&#x27;s Global Music Diplomacy Initiative, which is designed to &quot;elevate music as a diplomatic platform to promote peace and democracy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Chuck D does not drink alcohol.

Chuck D has said on Twitter that he is the maternal great-grandson of architect George Washington Foster.

As of June 2023, he had three children aged 34, 30, and 10, the two oldest by his first ex-wife, Deborah McClendon and the youngest by Gaye Theresa Johnson.

Chuck D lives in California and lost his home in the Thomas Fire that occurred from December 2017 to January 2018.

<text>In film and video, a cutaway is the interruption of a continuously filmed action by inserting a view of something else. It is usually followed by a cut back to the first shot. A cutaway scene is the interruption of a scene with the insertion of another scene, generally unrelated or only peripherally related to the original scene. The interruption is usually quick, and is usually, although not always, ended by a return to the original scene. The effect is of commentary to the original scene and creates variety.

==Usage==
The most common use of cutaway shots in dramatic films is to adjust the pace of the main action, to conceal the deletion of some unwanted part of the main shot, or to allow the joining of parts of two versions of that shot. For example, a scene may be improved by cutting a few frames out of an actor&#x27;s pause; a brief view of a listener can help conceal the break. Or the actor may fumble some of his lines in a group shot; rather than discarding a good version of the shot, the director may just have the actor repeat the lines for a new shot, and cut to that alternate view when necessary.

Cutaways are also used often in older horror films in place of special effects. For example, a shot of a zombie getting its head cut off may, for instance, start with a view of an axe being swung through the air, followed by a close-up of the actor swinging it, then followed by a cut back to the now severed head. George A. Romero, creator of the &quot;Dead Series&quot;, and Tom Savini pioneered effects that removed the need for cutaways in horror films.

In news broadcasting and documentary work, the cutaway is used much as it would be in fiction. On location, there is usually just one camera to film an interview, and it is usually trained on the interviewee. Often, there is also only one microphone. After the interview, the interviewer usually repeats his questions while he is being filmed, with pauses that act as if the answers are listened to. These shots can be used as cutaways. Cutaways to the interviewer, called noddies, can also be used to cover cuts.

The cutaway does not necessarily contribute any dramatic content of its own, but is used to help the editor assemble a longer sequence. For that reason, editors choose cutaways related to the main action, such as another action or object in the same location. For example, if the main shot is of a man walking down an alley, possible cutaways may include a shot of a cat on a nearby dumpster or a shot of a person watching from a window overhead.

The animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot; is noted for its usage of cutaway gags.

<text>A coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound, lacks a normal wake–sleep cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions. The person may experience respiratory and circulatory problems due to the body&#x27;s inability to maintain normal bodily functions. People in a coma often require extensive medical care to maintain their health and prevent complications such as pneumonia or blood clots. Coma patients exhibit a complete absence of wakefulness and are unable to consciously feel, speak or move. Comas can be the result of natural causes, or can be medically induced.

Clinically, a coma can be defined as the consistent inability to follow a one-step command. For a patient to maintain consciousness, the components of &quot;wakefulness&quot; and &quot;awareness&quot; must be maintained. Wakefulness is a quantitative assessment of the degree of consciousness, whereas awareness is a qualitative assessment of the functions mediated by the cortex, including cognitive abilities such as attention, sensory perception, explicit memory, language, the execution of tasks, temporal and spatial orientation and reality judgment. Neurologically, consciousness is maintained by the activation of the cerebral cortex—the gray matter that forms the brain&#x27;s outermost layer—and by the reticular activating system (RAS), a structure in the brainstem.

==Etymology==
The term &#x27;coma&#x27;, from the Greek &quot;koma&quot;, meaning deep sleep, had already been used in the Hippocratic corpus (&quot;Epidemica&quot;) and later by Galen (second century AD). Subsequently, it was hardly used in the known literature up to the middle of the 17th century. The term is found again in Thomas Willis&#x27; (1621–1675) influential &quot;De anima brutorum&quot; (1672), where lethargy (pathological sleep), &#x27;coma&#x27; (heavy sleeping), &quot;carus&quot; (deprivation of the senses) and apoplexy (into which &quot;carus&quot; could turn and which he localized in the white matter) are mentioned. The term &quot;carus&quot; is also derived from Greek, where it can be found in the roots of several words meaning soporific or sleepy. It can still be found in the root of the term &#x27;carotid&#x27;. Thomas Sydenham (1624–89) mentioned the term &#x27;coma&#x27; in several cases of fever (Sydenham, 1685).

== Signs and symptoms ==
General symptoms of a person in a comatose state are:
* Inability to voluntarily open the eyes
* A nonexistent sleep–wake cycle
* Lack of response to physical (painful) or verbal stimuli
* Depressed brainstem reflexes, such as pupils not responding to light
* Abnormal, difficulty, or irregular breathing or no breathing at all when coma was caused by cardiac arrest 
* Scores between 3 and 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale

==Causes==
Many types of problems can cause a coma. Forty percent of comatose states result from drug poisoning. Certain drug use under certain conditions can damage or weaken the synaptic functioning in the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) and keep the system from properly functioning to arouse the brain. Secondary effects of drugs, which include abnormal heart rate and blood pressure, as well as abnormal breathing and sweating, may also indirectly harm the functioning of the ARAS and lead to a coma. Given that drug poisoning is the cause for a large portion of patients in a coma, hospitals first test all comatose patients by observing pupil size and eye movement, through the vestibular–ocular reflex. (See &quot;Diagnosis&quot; below.)

The second most common cause of coma, which makes up about 25% of cases, is lack of oxygen, generally resulting from cardiac arrest. The central nervous system (CNS) requires a great deal of oxygen for its neurons. Oxygen deprivation in the brain, or &quot;cerebral hypoxia&quot;, causes sodium and calcium from outside of the neurons to decrease and intracellular calcium to increase, which harms neuron communication. Lack of oxygen in the brain also causes ATP exhaustion and cellular breakdown from cytoskeleton damage and nitric oxide production.

Twenty percent of comatose states result from an ischemic stroke, brain hemorrhage, or brain tumor. During a stroke, blood flow to part of the brain is restricted or blocked. An ischemic stroke, brain hemorrhage, or brain tumor may cause restriction of blood flow. Lack of blood to cells in the brain prevents oxygen from getting to the neurons, and consequently causes cells to become disrupted and die. As brain cells die, brain tissue continues to deteriorate, which may affect the functioning of the ARAS, causing unconsciousness and coma.

Comatose cases can also result from traumatic brain injury, excessive blood loss, malnutrition, hypothermia, hyperthermia, hyperammonemia, abnormal glucose levels, and many other biological disorders. Furthermore, studies show that 1 out of 8 patients with traumatic brain injury experience a comatose state.

Heart-related causes of coma include cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmia when severe, cardiogenic shock, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Respiratory arrest is the only lung condition to cause coma, but many different lung conditions can cause decreased level of consciousness, but do not reach coma.

Other causes of coma include severe or persistent seizures, kidney failure, liver failure, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and infections involving the brain, like meningitis and encephalitis.

==Pathophysiology==
Injury to either or both of the cerebral cortex or the reticular activating system (RAS) is sufficient to cause a person to enter coma.

The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain. The cerebral cortex is composed of gray matter which consists of the nuclei of neurons, whereas the inner portion of the cerebrum is composed of white matter and is composed of the axons of neuron. White matter is responsible for perception, relay of the sensory input via the thalamic pathway, and many other neurological functions, including complex thinking.

The RAS, on the other hand, is a more primitive structure in the brainstem which includes the reticular formation (RF). The RAS has two tracts, the ascending and descending tract. The ascending tract, or ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), is made up of a system of acetylcholine-producing neurons, and works to arouse and wake up the brain. Arousal of the brain begins from the RF, through the thalamus, and then finally to the cerebral cortex. Any impairment in ARAS functioning, a neuronal dysfunction, along the arousal pathway stated directly above, prevents the body from being aware of its surroundings. Without the arousal and consciousness centers, the body cannot awaken, remaining in a comatose state.

The severity and mode of onset of coma depends on the underlying cause. There are two main subdivisions of a coma: structural and diffuse neuronal. A structural cause, for example, is brought upon by a mechanical force that brings about cellular damage, such as physical pressure or a blockage in neural transmission. By contrast, a diffuse cause is limited to aberrations of cellular function which fall under a metabolic or toxic subgroup. Toxin-induced comas are caused by extrinsic substances, whereas metabolic-induced comas are caused by intrinsic processes, such as body thermoregulation or ionic imbalances (e.g. sodium). For instance, severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hypercapnia (increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood) are examples of a metabolic diffuse neuronal dysfunction. Hypoglycemia or hypercapnia initially cause mild agitation and confusion, but progress to obtundation, stupor, and finally, complete unconsciousness. In contrast, coma resulting from a severe traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage can be instantaneous. The mode of onset may therefore be indicative of the underlying cause.

Structural and diffuse causes of coma are not isolated from one another, as one can lead to the other in some situations. For instance, coma induced by a diffuse metabolic process, such as hypoglycemia, can result in a structural coma if it is not resolved. Another example is if cerebral edema, a diffuse dysfunction, leads to ischemia of the brainstem, a structural issue, due to the blockage of the circulation in the brain.

==Diagnosis==
Although diagnosis of coma is simple, investigating the underlying cause of onset can be rather challenging. As such, after gaining stabilization of the patient&#x27;s airways, breathing and circulation (the basic ABCs) various diagnostic tests, such as physical examinations and imaging tools (CT scan, MRI, etc.) are employed to access the underlying cause of the coma.

When an unconscious person enters a hospital, the hospital utilizes a series of diagnostic steps to identify the cause of unconsciousness. According to Young, the following steps should be taken when dealing with a patient possibly in a coma:
# Perform a general examination and medical history check
# Make sure the patient is in an actual comatose state and is not in a locked-in state or experiencing psychogenic unresponsiveness. Patients with locked-in syndrome present with voluntary movement of their eyes, whereas patients with psychogenic comas demonstrate active resistance to passive opening of the eyelids, with the eyelids closing abruptly and completely when the lifted upper eyelid is released (rather than slowly, asymmetrically and incompletely as seen in comas due to organic causes).
# Find the site of the brain that may be causing coma (e.g., brainstem, back of brain...) and assess the severity of the coma with the Glasgow Coma Scale
# Take blood work to see if drugs were involved or if it was a result of hypoventilation/hyperventilation
# Check for levels of serum glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, urea, and creatinine
# Perform brain scans to observe any abnormal brain functioning using either CT or MRI scans
# Continue to monitor brain waves and identify seizures of patient using EEGs

===Initial evaluation===

In the initial assessment of coma, it is common to gauge the level of consciousness on the AVPU (alert, vocal stimuli, painful stimuli, unresponsive) scale by spontaneously exhibiting actions and, assessing the patient&#x27;s response to vocal and painful stimuli. More elaborate scales, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale, quantify an individual&#x27;s reactions such as eye opening, movement and verbal response in order to indicate their extent of brain injury. The patient&#x27;s score can vary from a score of 3 (indicating severe brain injury and death) to 15 (indicating mild or no brain injury).

In those with deep unconsciousness, there is a risk of asphyxiation as the control over the muscles in the face and throat is diminished. As a result, those presenting to a hospital with coma are typically assessed for this risk (&quot;airway management&quot;). If the risk of asphyxiation is deemed high, doctors may use various devices (such as an oropharyngeal airway, nasopharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube) to safeguard the airway.

===Imaging and testing===
Imaging encompasses computed tomography (CAT or CT) scan of the brain, or MRI for example, and is performed to identify specific causes of the coma, such as hemorrhage in the brain or herniation of the brain structures. Special tests such as an EEG can also show a lot about the activity level of the cortex such as semantic processing, presence of seizures, and are important available tools not only for the assessment of the cortical activity but also for predicting the likelihood of the patient&#x27;s awakening. The autonomous responses such as the skin conductance response may also provide further insight on the patient&#x27;s emotional processing.

In the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI), there are 4 examination methods that have proved useful: skull x-ray, angiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The skull x-ray can detect linear fractures, impression fractures (expression fractures) and burst fractures. Angiography is used on rare occasions for TBIs i.e. when there is suspicion of an aneurysm, carotid sinus fistula, traumatic vascular occlusion, and vascular dissection. A CT can detect changes in density between the brain tissue and hemorrhages like subdural and intracerebral hemorrhages. MRIs are not the first choice in emergencies because of the long scanning times and because fractures cannot be detected as well as CT. MRIs are used for the imaging of soft tissues and lesions in the posterior fossa which cannot be found with the use of CT.

===Body movements===
Assessment of the brainstem and cortical function through special reflex tests such as the oculocephalic reflex test (doll&#x27;s eyes test), oculovestibular reflex test (cold caloric test), corneal reflex, and the gag reflex. Reflexes are a good indicator of what cranial nerves are still intact and functioning and is an important part of the physical exam. Due to the unconscious status of the patient, only a limited number of the nerves can be assessed. These include the cranial nerves number 2 (CN II), number 3 (CN III), number 5 (CN V), number 7 (CN VII), and cranial nerves 9 and 10 (CN IX, CN X).

Assessment of posture and physique is the next step. It involves general observation about the patient&#x27;s positioning. There are often two stereotypical postures seen in comatose patients. Decorticate posturing is a stereotypical posturing in which the patient has arms flexed at the elbow, and arms adducted toward the body, with both legs extended. Decerebrate posturing is a stereotypical posturing in which the legs are similarly extended (stretched), but the arms are also stretched (extended at the elbow). The posturing is critical since it indicates where the damage is in the central nervous system. A decorticate posturing indicates a lesion (a point of damage) at or above the red nucleus, whereas a decerebrate posturing indicates a lesion at or below the red nucleus. In other words, a decorticate lesion is closer to the cortex, as opposed to a decerebrate posturing which indicates that the lesion is closer to the brainstem.

=== Pupil size ===
Pupil assessment is often a critical portion of a comatose examination, as it can give information as to the cause of the coma; the following table is a technical, medical guideline for common pupil findings and their possible interpretations:

===Severity===
A coma can be classified as (1) supratentorial (above Tentorium cerebelli), (2) infratentorial (below Tentorium cerebelli), (3) metabolic or (4) diffused. This classification is merely dependent on the position of the original damage that caused the coma, and does not correlate with severity or the prognosis. The severity of coma impairment however is categorized into several levels. Patients may or may not progress through these levels. In the first level, the brain responsiveness lessens, normal reflexes are lost, the patient no longer responds to pain and cannot hear.

The Rancho Los Amigos Scale is a complex scale that has eight separate levels, and is often used in the first few weeks or months of coma while the patient is under closer observation, and when shifts between levels are more frequent.

==Treatment==

Treatment for people in a coma will depend on the severity and cause of the comatose state. Upon admittance to an emergency department, coma patients will usually be placed in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) immediately, where maintenance of the patient&#x27;s respiration and circulation become a first priority. Stability of their respiration and circulation is sustained through the use of intubation, ventilation, administration of intravenous fluids or blood and other supportive care as needed.

=== Continued care ===
Once a patient is stable and no longer in immediate danger, there may be a shift of priority from stabilizing the patient to maintaining the state of their physical wellbeing. Moving patients every 2–3 hours by turning them side to side is crucial to avoiding bed sores as a result of being confined to a bed. Moving patients through the use of physical therapy also aids in preventing atelectasis, contractures or other orthopedic deformities which would interfere with a coma patient&#x27;s recovery.

Pneumonia is also common in coma patients due to their inability to swallow which can then lead to aspiration. A coma patient&#x27;s lack of a gag reflex and use of a feeding tube can result in food, drink or other solid organic matter being lodged within their lower respiratory tract (from the trachea to the lungs). This trapping of matter in their lower respiratory tract can ultimately lead to infection, resulting in aspiration pneumonia.

Coma patients may also deal with restlessness or seizures. As such, soft cloth restraints may be used to prevent them from pulling on tubes or dressings and side rails on the bed should be kept up to prevent patients from falling.

=== Caregivers ===
Coma has a wide variety of emotional reactions from the family members of the affected patients, as well as the primary care givers taking care of the patients. Research has shown that the severity of injury causing coma was found to have no significant impact compared to how much time has passed since the injury occurred. Common reactions, such as desperation, anger, frustration, and denial are possible. The focus of the patient care should be on creating an amicable relationship with the family members or dependents of a comatose patient as well as creating a rapport with the medical staff. Although there is heavy importance of a primary care taker, secondary care takers can play a supporting role to temporarily relieve the primary care taker&#x27;s burden of tasks.

== Prognosis ==
Comas can last from several days to, in particularly extreme cases, years. Some patients eventually gradually come out of the coma, some progress to a vegetative state or a minimally conscious state, and others die. Some patients who have entered a vegetative state go on to regain a degree of awareness; and in some cases may remain in vegetative state for years or even decades such as the Aruna Shanbaug case or Edwarda O&#x27;Bara.

Predicted chances of recovery will differ depending on which techniques were used to measure the patient&#x27;s severity of neurological damage. Predictions of recovery are based on statistical rates, expressed as the level of chance the person has of recovering. Time is the best general predictor of a chance of recovery. For example, after four months of coma caused by brain damage, the chance of partial recovery is less than 15%, and the chance of full recovery is very low.

The outcome for coma and vegetative state depends on the cause, location, severity and extent of neurological damage. A deeper coma alone does not necessarily mean a slimmer chance of recovery; similarly, a milder coma does not indicate a higher chance of recovery. The most common cause of death for a person in a vegetative state is secondary infection such as pneumonia, which can occur in patients who lie still for extended periods.

=== Recovery ===
People may emerge from a coma with a combination of physical, intellectual, and psychological difficulties that need special attention. It is common for coma patients to awaken in a profound state of confusion and experience dysarthria, the inability to articulate any speech. Recovery is usually gradual. In the first days, the patient may only awaken for a few minutes, with increased duration of wakefulness as their recovery progresses, and they may eventually recover full awareness. That said, some patients may never progress beyond very basic responses.

There are reports of people coming out of a coma after long periods of time. After 19 years in a minimally conscious state, Terry Wallis spontaneously began speaking and regained awareness of his surroundings.

A man with brain damage and trapped in a coma-like state for six years was brought back to consciousness in 2003 by doctors who planted electrodes deep inside his brain. The method, called deep brain stimulation (DBS), successfully roused communication, complex movement and eating ability in the man with a traumatic brain injury. His injuries left him in a minimally conscious state, a condition akin to a coma but characterized by occasional, but brief, evidence of environmental and self-awareness that coma patients lack.

==Society and culture==
Research by Eelco Wijdicks on the depiction of comas in movies was published in Neurology in May 2006. Wijdicks studied 30 films (made between 1970 and 2004) that portrayed actors in prolonged comas, and he concluded that only two films accurately depicted the state of a coma patient and the agony of waiting for a patient to awaken: &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Dreamlife of Angels&quot; (1998). The remaining 28 were criticized for portraying miraculous awakenings with no lasting side effects, unrealistic depictions of treatments and equipment required, and comatose patients remaining muscular and tanned.

=== Bioethics ===
A person in a coma is said to be in an unconscious state. Perspectives on personhood, identity and consciousness come into play when discussing the metaphysical and bioethical views on comas.

It has been argued that unawareness should be just as ethically relevant and important as a state of awareness and that there should be metaphysical support of unawareness as a state.

In the ethical discussions about disorders of consciousness (DOCs), two abilities are usually considered as central: &quot;experiencing well-being&quot; and &quot;having interest&quot;. Well-being can broadly be understood as the positive effect related to what makes life good (according to specific standards) for the individual in question. The only condition for well-being broadly considered is the ability to experience its &#x27;positiveness&#x27;. That said, because experiencing positiveness is a basic emotional process with phylogenetic roots, it is likely to occur at a completely unaware level and, therefore, introduces the idea of an unconscious well-being. As such, the ability of having interests is crucial for describing two abilities which those with comas are deficient in. Having an interest in a certain domain can be understood as having a stake in something that can affect what makes our life good in that domain. An interest is what directly and immediately improves life from a certain point of view or within a particular domain, or greatly increases the likelihood of life improvement enabling the subject to realize some good. That said, sensitivity to reward signals is a fundamental element in the learning process, both consciously and unconsciously. Moreover, the unconscious brain is able to interact with its surroundings in a meaningful way and to produce meaningful information processing of stimuli coming from the external environment, including other people.

According to Hawkins, &quot;1. A life is good if the subject is able to value, or more basically if the subject is able to care. Importantly, Hawkins stresses that caring has no need for cognitive commitment, i.e. for high-level cognitive activities: it requires being able to distinguish something, track it for a while, recognize it over time, and have certain emotional dispositions &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; something. 2. A life is good if the subject has the capacity for relationship with others, i.e. for meaningfully interacting with other people.&quot; This suggests that unawareness may (at least partly) fulfill both conditions identified by Hawkins for life to be good for a subject, thus making the unconscious ethically relevant.

<text>Call of Cthulhu is a horror fiction role-playing game based on H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s story of the same name and the associated Cthulhu Mythos. The game, often abbreviated as &quot;CoC&quot;, is published by Chaosium; it was first released in 1981 and is in its seventh edition, with licensed foreign language editions available as well. Its game system is based on Chaosium&#x27;s Basic Role-Playing (BRP) with additions for the horror genre. These include special rules for sanity and luck.

==Gameplay==
===Setting===
&quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; is set in a darker version of our world based on H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s observation (from his essay, &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;) that &quot;The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.&quot; The original edition, first published in 1981, uses Basic Role-Playing as its basis and is set in the 1920s, the setting of many of Lovecraft&#x27;s stories. The &quot;Cthulhu by Gaslight&quot; supplement blends the occult and Holmesian mystery and is mostly set in England during the 1890s. &quot;Cthulhu Now&quot; and &quot;Delta Green&quot; are set in a modern/1980s era and deal with conspiracies. Recent settings include 1000 AD (&quot;Cthulhu: Dark Ages&quot;), the 23rd century (&quot;Cthulhu Rising&quot;) and Ancient Rome (&quot;Cthulhu Invictus&quot;). The protagonists may also travel to places that are not of this earth, such as the Dreamlands (which can be accessed through dreams as well as being physically connected to the earth), other planets, or the voids of space. In keeping with the Lovecraftian theme, the gamemaster is called the Keeper of Arcane Lore (&quot;the keeper&quot;), while player characters are called Investigators of the Unknown (&quot;investigators&quot;).

While predominantly focused on Lovecraftian fiction and horror, playing in the Cthulhu Mythos is not required. The system also includes ideas for non-Lovecraft games, such as using folk horror or the settings of other authors and horror movies, or with entirely custom settings and creatures by the gamemaster and/or players.

===Mechanics===

&quot;CoC&quot; uses the Basic Role-Playing system first developed for &quot;RuneQuest&quot; and used in other Chaosium games. It is skill-based, with player characters getting better with their skills by succeeding at using them for as long as they stay functionally healthy and sane. They do not, however, gain hit points and do not become significantly harder to kill. The game does not use levels.

&quot;CoC&quot; uses percentile dice (with results ranging from 1 to 100) to determine success or failure. Every player statistic is intended to be compatible with the notion that there is a probability of success for a particular action given what the player is capable of doing. For example, an artist may have a 75% chance of being able to draw something (represented by having 75 in Art skill), and thus rolling a number under 75 would yield a success. Rolling or less of the skill level (1–15 in the example) would be a &quot;special success&quot; (or an &quot;impale&quot; for combat skills) and would yield some extra bonus to be determined by the keeper. For example, the artist character might draw especially well or especially fast, or catch some unapparent detail in the drawing.

The players take the roles of ordinary people drawn into the realm of the mysterious: detectives, criminals, scholars, artists, war veterans, etc. Often, happenings begin innocently enough, until more and more of the workings behind the scenes are revealed. As the characters learn more of the true horrors of the world and the irrelevance of humanity, their sanity (represented by &quot;Sanity Points&quot;, abbreviated SAN) inevitably withers away. The game includes a mechanism for determining how damaged a character&#x27;s sanity is at any given point; encountering the horrific beings usually triggers a loss of SAN points. To gain the tools they need to defeat the horrors – mystic knowledge and magic – the characters may end up losing some of their sanity, though other means such as pure firepower or simply outsmarting one&#x27;s opponents also exist. &quot;CoC&quot; has a reputation as a game in which it is quite common for a player character to die in gruesome circumstances or end up in a mental institution. Eventual triumph of the players is not guaranteed.

==History==
The original conception of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; was &quot;Dark Worlds&quot;, a game commissioned by the publisher Chaosium but never published. Sandy Petersen contacted them regarding writing a supplement for their popular fantasy game &quot;RuneQuest&quot; set in Lovecraft&#x27;s Dreamlands. He took over the writing of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, and the game was released in 1981. Petersen oversaw the first four editions with only minor changes to the system. Once he left, development was continued by Lynn Willis, who was credited as co-author in the fifth and sixth editions. After the death of Willis, Mike Mason became &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; line editor in 2013, continuing its development with Paul Fricker. Together they made the most significant rules alterations than in any previous edition, culminating in the release of the 7th edition in 2014.

===Editions===

===Early releases===
For those grounded in the RPG tradition, the very first release of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; created a brand new framework for table-top gaming. Rather than the traditional format established by &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which often involved the characters wandering through caves or tunnels and fighting different types of monsters, Sandy Petersen introduced the concept of the &quot;Onion Skin&quot;: Interlocking layers of information and nested clues that lead the player characters from seemingly minor investigations into a missing person to discovering mind-numbingly awful, global conspiracies to destroy the world. Unlike its predecessor games, &quot;CoC&quot; assumed that most investigators would not survive, alive or sane, and that the only safe way to deal with the vast majority of nasty things described in the rule books was to run away. A well-run &quot;CoC&quot; campaign should engender a sense of foreboding and inevitable doom in its players. The style and setting of the game, in a relatively modern time period, created an emphasis on real-life settings, character research, and thinking one&#x27;s way around trouble.

The first book of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; adventures was &quot;Shadows of Yog-Sothoth&quot;. In this work, the characters come upon a secret society&#x27;s foul plot to destroy mankind, and pursue it first near to home and then in a series of exotic locations. This template was to be followed in many subsequent campaigns, including &quot;Fungi from Yuggoth&quot; (later known as &quot;Curse of Cthulhu&quot; and &quot;Day of the Beast&quot;), &quot;Spawn of Azathoth&quot;, and possibly the most highly acclaimed, &quot;Masks of Nyarlathotep&quot;.

&quot;Shadows of Yog-Sothoth&quot; is important not only because it represents the first published addition to the boxed first edition of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, but because its format defined a new way of approaching a campaign of linked RPG scenarios involving actual clues for the would-be detectives amongst the players to follow and link in order to uncover the dastardly plots afoot. Its format has been used by every other campaign-length &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; publication. The standard of &quot;CoC&quot; scenarios was well received by independent reviewers. &quot;The Asylum and Other Tales&quot;, a series of stand alone articles released in 1983, rated an overall 9/10 in Issue 47 of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine.

The standard of the included &#x27;clue&#x27; material varies from scenario to scenario, but reached its zenith in the original boxed versions of the &quot;Masks of Nyarlathotep&quot; and &quot;Horror on the Orient Express&quot; campaigns. Inside these one could find matchbooks and business cards apparently defaced by non-player characters, newspaper cuttings and (in the case of &quot;Orient Express&quot;) period passports to which players could attach their photographs, increasing the sense of immersion. Indeed, during the period that these supplements were produced, third party campaign publishers strove to emulate the quality of the additional materials, often offering separately-priced &#x27;deluxe&#x27; clue packages for their campaigns.

Additional milieux were provided by Chaosium with the release of &quot;Dreamlands&quot;, a boxed supplement containing additional rules needed for playing within the Lovecraft Dreamlands, a large map and a scenario booklet, and &quot;Cthulhu By Gaslight&quot;, another boxed set which moved the action from the 1920s to the 1890s.

===&quot;Cthulhu Now&quot;===
In 1987, Chaosium issued the supplement titled &quot;Cthulhu Now&quot;, a collection of rules, supplemental source materials and scenarios for playing &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; in the present day. This proved to be a very popular alternative milieu, so much so that much of the supplemental material is now included in the core rule book.

===&quot;Lovecraft Country&quot;===
&quot;Lovecraft Country&quot; was a line of supplements for &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; released in 1990. These supplements were overseen by Keith Herber and provided backgrounds and adventures set in Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional towns of Arkham, Kingsport, Innsmouth, Dunwich, and their environs. The intent was to give investigators a common base, as well as to center the action on well-drawn characters with clear motivations.

===&quot;Terror Australis&quot;===

In 1987, &quot;Terror Australis: Call of Cthulhu in the Land Down Under&quot; was published. In 2018, a revised and updated version of the 1987 game was reissued, with about triple the content and two new games. It requires the &quot;Call of Cthulhu Keeper&#x27;s Rulebook&quot; (7th Edition) and is usable with &quot;Pulp Cthulhu&quot;.

===&quot;Harlem Unbound&quot;===

In 2020, Chaosium released the 2nd edition of &quot;Harlem Unbound,&quot; a Call of Cthulhu supplement set in the Harlem Renaissance. &quot;Harlem Unbound&quot; received three Gold ENNIE Awards and an Indie Game Developer Network award.

===Recent history===
In the years since the collapse of the &quot;Mythos&quot; collectible card game (production ceased in 1997), the release of &quot;CoC&quot; books has been very sporadic, with up to a year between releases. Chaosium struggled with near bankruptcy for many years before finally starting their upward climb again.

2005 was Chaosium&#x27;s busiest year for many years, with 10 releases for the game. Chaosium took to marketing &quot;monographs&quot;—short books by individual writers with editing and layout provided out-of-house—directly to the consumer, allowing the company to gauge market response to possible new works. The range of times and places in which the horrors of the Mythos can be encountered was also expanded in late 2005 onward with the addition of &quot;Cthulhu Dark Ages&quot; by Stéphane Gesbert, which gives a framework for playing games set in 11th century Europe, &quot;Secrets of Japan&quot; by Michael Dziesinski for gaming in modern-day Japan, and &quot;Secrets of Kenya&quot; by David Conyers for gaming in interwar period Africa.

In July 2011, Chaosium announced it would re-release a 30th anniversary edition of the &quot;CoC&quot; 6th edition role-playing game. This 320-page book features thick (3 mm) leatherette hardcovers with the front cover and spine stamped with gold foil. The interior pages are printed in black ink, on 90 gsm matte art paper. The binding is thread sewn, square backed. Chaosium offered a one-time printing of this Collector&#x27;s Edition.

On May 28, 2013, a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for the 7th edition of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; was launched with a goal of $40,000; it ended on June 29 of the same year having collected $561,836. It included many more major revisions than any previous edition, and also split the core rules into two books, a Player&#x27;s Guide and Keeper&#x27;s Guide. Problems and delays fulfilling the Kickstarters for the 7th edition of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; led Greg Stafford and Sandy Petersen (who had both left in 1998) to return to an active role at Chaosium in June 2015. The print version of 7th edition became available in September 2016.

The available milieux were also expanded with the release of Cthulhu Through the Ages, a supplement containing additional rules needed for playing within the Roman Empire, Mythic Iceland, a futuristic micro-setting, and the End Times, where the monsters of the mythos attempt to subjugate or destroy the world.

==Licenses==
Chaosium has licensed other publishers to create supplements, video, card and board games using the setting and the &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; brand. Many, such as &quot;Delta Green&quot; by Pagan Publishing and Arkham Horror by Fantasy Flight, have moved away completely from &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;. Other licensees have included Infogrames, Miskatonic River Press, Theater of the Mind Enterprises, Triad Entertainment, Games Workshop, RAFM, Goodman Games, Grenadier Models Inc. and Yog-Sothoth.com. These supplements may be set in different time frames or even different game universes from the original game.

===&quot;Trail of Cthulhu&quot;===

In February 2008, Pelgrane Press published &quot;Trail of Cthulhu&quot;, a stand-alone game created by Kenneth Hite using the GUMSHOE System developed by Robin Laws. GUMSHOE is specifically designed to be used in investigative games.

===&quot;Shadows of Cthulhu&quot;===
In September 2008, Reality Deviant Publications published &quot;Shadows of Cthulhu&quot;, a supplement that brings Lovecraftian gaming to Green Ronin&#x27;s True20 system.

===&quot;Realms of Cthulhu&quot;===
In October 2009, Reality Blurs published &quot;Realms of Cthulhu&quot;, a supplement for Pinnacle Entertainment&#x27;s Savage Worlds system.

===&quot;Delta Green&quot;===

Pagan Publishing published &quot;Delta Green&quot;, a series of supplements originally set in the 1990s, although later supplements add support for playing closer to the present day. In these, player characters are agents of a secret agency known as Delta Green, which fights against creatures from the Mythos and conspiracies related to them. Arc Dream Publishing released a new version of &quot;Delta Green&quot; in 2016 as a standalone game, partially using the mechanics from &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;.

===&quot;d20 Call of Cthulhu&quot;===
In 2001, a stand-alone version of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; was released by Wizards of the Coast, for the d20 system. Intended to preserve the feeling of the original game, the d20 conversion of the game rules were supposed to make the game more accessible to the large &quot;D&amp;D&quot; player base. The d20 system also made it possible to use &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; characters in &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, as well as to introduce the Cthulhu Mythos into &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games. The d20 version of the game is no longer supported by Wizards as per their contract with Chaosium. Chaosium included d20 stats as an appendix in three releases (see Lovecraft Country), but have since dropped the &quot;dual stat&quot; idea.

===Card games===

&quot;Mythos&quot; was a collectible card game (CCG) based on the Cthulhu Mythos that Chaosium produced and marketed during the mid-1990s. While generally praised for its fast gameplay and unique mechanics, it ultimately failed to gain a very large market presence. It bears mention because its eventual failure brought the company to hard times that affected its ability to produce material for &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;. &quot;Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game&quot; is a second collectible card game, produced by Fantasy Flight Games.

===Miniatures===
The first licensed &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; gaming miniatures were sculpted by Andrew Chernack and released by Grenadier Models in boxed sets and blister packs in 1983. The license was later transferred to RAFM. As of 2011, RAFM still produce licensed C&quot;all of Cthulhu&quot; models sculpted by Bob Murch. Both lines include investigator player character models and the iconic monsters of the Cthulhu mythos.
As of July 2015, Reaper Miniatures started its third &quot;Bones Kickstarter&quot;, a Kickstarter intended to help the company migrate some miniatures from metal to plastic, and introducing some new ones. Among the stretch goals was the second $50 expansion, devoted to the Mythos, with miniatures such as Cultists, Deep Ones, Mi&#x27;Go, and an extra $15 Shub-Niggurath &quot;miniature&quot; (it is, at least, 6x4 squares). It is expected for those miniatures to remain in the Reaper Miniatures catalogue after the Kickstarter project finishes. In 2020 Chaosium announced a license agreement with Ardacious for &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; virtual miniatures to be released on their augmented reality app Ardent Roleplay.

====&quot;Shadow of the Comet&quot;====

&quot;Shadow of the Comet&quot; (later repackaged as &quot;Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet&quot;) is an adventure game developed and released by Infogrames in 1993. The game is based on H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos and uses many elements from Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; and &quot;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&quot;. A follow-up game, &quot;Prisoner of Ice&quot;, is not a direct sequel.

====&quot;Prisoner of Ice&quot;====

&quot;Prisoner of Ice&quot; (also &quot;Call of Cthulhu: Prisoner of Ice&quot;) is an adventure game developed and released by Infogrames for the PC and Macintosh computers in 1995 in America and Europe. It is based on H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos, particularly &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;, and is a follow-up to Infogrames&#x27; earlier &quot;Shadow of the Comet&quot;. In 1997, the game was ported to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation exclusively in Japan.

====&quot;Dark Corners of the Earth&quot;====

A licensed first-person shooter adventure game by Headfirst Productions, based on &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; campaign &quot;Escape from Innsmouth&quot; and released by Bethesda Softworks in 2005/2006 for the PC and Xbox.

====&quot;The Wasted Land&quot;====

In April 2011, Chaosium and new developer Red Wasp Design announced a joint project to produce a mobile video game based on the &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; RPG, entitled &quot;Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land&quot;. The game was released on January 30, 2012.

====&quot;Cthulhu Chronicles&quot;====
In 2018, Metarcade produced &quot;Cthulhu Chronicles&quot;, a game for iOS with a campaign of nine mobile interactive fiction stories set in 1920s England based on &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;. The first five stories were released on July 10, 2018.

====&quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;====

&quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; is a survival horror role-playing video game developed by Cyanide and published by Focus Home Interactive for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows. The game features a semi-open world environment and incorporates themes of Lovecraftian and psychological horror into a story which includes elements of investigation and stealth. It is inspired by H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;.

==Reception==
Multiple reviews of various editions appeared in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot;. 
* In the March 1982 edition (No. 49), William A. Barton noted that there were some shortcomings resulting from an assumption by the designers that players would have access to rules from &quot;RuneQuest&quot; that were not in &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, but otherwise Barton called the game &quot;an excellent piece of work... The worlds of H. P. Lovecraft are truly open for the fantasy gamer.&quot; 
* In the October–November 1987 edition (No. 80), Lisa Cohen reviewed the 3rd edition, saying, &quot;&quot;This book can be for collectors of art, players, or anyone interested in knowledge about old time occult. It is the one reprint that is worth the money.&quot;

Multiple reviews of various editions appeared in &quot;White Dwarf&quot;.
* In the August 1982 edition (Issue 32), Ian Bailey admired much about the first edition of the game; his only criticism was that the game was too &quot;U.S. orientated and consequently any Keeper... who wants to set his game in the UK will have a lot of research to do.&quot; Bailey gave the game an above average rating of 9 out of 10, saying, &quot;&quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; is an excellent game and a welcome addition to the world of role-playing.&quot;
* In the August 1986 edition (Issue 80), Ashley Shepherd thought the inclusion of much material in the 3rd edition that had been previously published as supplementary books &quot;makes the game incredibly good value.&quot; He concluded, &quot;This package is going to keep &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; at the front of the fantasy game genre.&quot;

Several reviews of various editions and supplements also appeared in &quot;Dragon&quot;. 
* In the May 1982 edition (Issue 61), David Cook thought the rules were too complex for new gamers, but said, &quot;It is a good game for experienced role-playing gamers and ambitious judges, especially if they like Lovecraft’s type of story.&quot;
* In the August 1987 edition (Issue 124), Ken Rolston reviewed the &quot;Terror Australis&quot; supplement for 3rd edition that introduced an Australian setting in the 1920s. Bambra thought that &quot;Literate, macabre doom shambles from each page. Good reading, and a good campaign setting for COC adventures.&quot;
* In the October 1988 edition (Issue 138), Ken Rolston gave an overview of the 3rd edition, and placed it ahead of its competitors due to superior campaign setting, tone and atmosphere, the player characters as investigators, and the use of realistic player handouts such as authentic-looking newspaper clippings. Rolston concluded, &quot;&quot;CoC&quot; is one of role-playing’s acknowledged classics. Its various supplements over the years have maintained an exceptional level of quality; several, including &quot;Shadows of Yog-Sothoth&quot; and &quot;Masks of Nyarlathotep&quot;, deserve consideration among the greatest pinnacles of the fantasy role-playing game design.&quot;
* In the June 1990 edition (Issue 158), Jim Bambra liked the updated setting of the 4th edition, placing the game firmly in Lovecraft&#x27;s 1920s. He also liked the number of adventures included in the 192-page rulebook: &quot;The fourth edition contains enough adventures to keep any group happily entertained and sanity blasted.&quot; However, while Cook questioned whether owners of the 2nd or 3rd edition would get good value for their money — &quot;You lack only the car-chase rules and the improved layout of the three books in one. The rest of the material has received minor editing but no substantial changes&quot; — Cook strongly recommended the new edition to newcomers, saying, &quot;If you don’t already play &quot;CoC&quot;, all I can do is urge you to give it a try... discover for yourself why it has made so many converts since its release.&quot;
* In the October 1992 edition (Issue 186), Rick Swan admitted that he was skeptical that the 5th edition would offer anything new, but instead found that the new edition benefited from &quot;fresh material, judicious editing, and thorough polishes.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Few RPGs exceed the &quot;CoC&quot; game’s scope or match its skillful integration of background and game systems. And there’s no game more fun.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan gave the game a top rating of 4 out of 4, calling it &quot;a masterpiece, easily the best horror RPG ever published and possibly the best RPG, period ... breathtaking in scope and as richly textured as a fine novel. All role-players owe it to themselves to experience this truly remarkable game.&quot;

In Issue 68 of &quot;Challenge&quot;, Craig Sheeley reviewed the fifth edition and liked the revisions. &quot;The entire character generation process is highly streamlined and easily illustrated on a two-page flowchart.&quot; DeJong also liked the inclusion of material from all three of &quot;CoC&quot;″s settings (1890s, 1920s, 1990s), calling it &quot;One of the best features of this edition.&quot; And he was very impressed with the layout of the book, commenting, &quot;The organization and format of this book deserve special mention. I hold that every game company should study this book to learn what to do right.&quot; DeJong concluded, &quot;I am seriously impressed with this product. From cover to cover, it’s well done.&quot;

In a reader poll conducted by UK magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; in 1996 to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; was ranked 1st. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;&quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; is fully deserved of the title as the most popular roleplaying system ever - it&#x27;s a game that doesn&#x27;t age, is eminently playable, and which hangs together perfectly. The system, even though it&#x27;s over ten years old, it still one of the very best you&#x27;ll find in any roleplaying game. Also, there&#x27;s not a referee in the land who could say they&#x27;ve read every Lovecraft inspired book or story going, so there&#x27;s a pretty-well endless supply of scenario ideas. It&#x27;s simply marvellous.&quot;

Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2013 rated &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; as #4 in the top ten role-playing games of all time, saying &quot;With various revisions, but never a full rewrite of its percentile-based system, &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; might be antiquated by today&#x27;s standards, but remember it is supposed to be set in the 1920s, so to me that seems more than appropriate.&quot;

&quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; has been reported to be the second-most popular game played on the virtual table top platform Roll20 in 2021 (the most popular being &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;). It has also been reported to have found success especially in Korea and Japan, and to have overtaken D&amp;D in Japan.

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted up to this point in time, &quot;roleplaying games are united in one way: In some fashion, they are all power fantasies. Characters go someplace, kill some things, find some loot, and maybe gain enough experience points to unlock their hidden personal potential in the form of new spells or a new power.&quot; Horvath then pointed out that this game, as the first horror RPG, had an essential difference: &quot;Horror, as a genre, is generally concerned with powerlessness ... In a complete inversion of other RPGs, characters in &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; are doomed.&quot; About the game itself, Horvath commented, &quot;I find &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; unabashedly fun, despite the scares and the despair ... The slumbering god is certainly one of the strangest of pop culture canonizations, but there seems to be an endless appetite — and deep wallets — for all things Cthulhu. So long as that remains true, the Great Old One will continue to loom large over RPGs.&quot;

<doc id="5724" wikidata="Q188489" url="?curid=5724" title="Cape Breton Island">
<text>Cape Breton Island (, formerly &#x27;; or&#x27;; ) is a rugged and irregularly shaped island on the Atlantic coast of North America and part of the province of Nova Scotia, Canada.

The island accounts for 18.7% of Nova Scotia&#x27;s total area. Although the island is physically separated from the Nova Scotia peninsula by the Strait of Canso, the long Canso Causeway connects it to mainland Nova Scotia. The island is east-northeast of the mainland with its northern and western coasts fronting on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence with its western coast forming the eastern limits of the Northumberland Strait. The eastern and southern coasts front the Atlantic Ocean with its eastern coast also forming the western limits of the Cabot Strait. Its landmass slopes upward from south to north, culminating in the highlands of its northern cape. A large body of saltwater, the (&quot;Golden Arm&quot; in French), dominates the island&#x27;s centre.

The total population at the 2016 census numbered 132,010 Cape Bretoners, which is approximately 15% of the provincial population. Cape Breton Island has experienced a decline in population of approximately 2.9% since the 2011 census. Approximately 75% of the island&#x27;s population is in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality (CBRM), which includes all of Cape Breton County and is often referred to as Industrial Cape Breton.

==Toponymy==
Cape Breton Island takes its name from its easternmost point, Cape Breton. This may have been named after the Gascon fishing port of Capbreton, but more probably takes its name from the Bretons of northwestern France. A Portuguese &quot;mappa mundi&quot; of 1516–20 includes the label &quot;terra q(ue) foy descuberta por Bertomes&quot; in the vicinity of the Gulf of St Lawrence, which means &quot;land discovered by Bretons&quot;. The name &quot;Cape Breton&quot; first appears on a map of 1516, as &quot;C(abo) dos Bretoes&quot;, and became the general name for both the island and the cape toward the end of the 16th century.

The indigenous Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk name for the island is Unama&#x27;ki, which loosely translates to &quot;land of fog.&quot; Unama&#x27;ki is one of the seven districts of Mi&#x27;kmaw Country, Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki, which itself forms one branch of the Wabanaki Confederacy. The district hosts the seat of the Grand Council (Sante&#x27; Mawio&#x27;mi) at Mniku, which still functions as the capital of the nation in the Potlotek reserve. Despite colonial efforts to replace indigenous names, the use of &quot;Unama&#x27;ki&quot; has increased in recent years, with examples including Unama&#x27;ki College (an offshoot of Cape Breton University), the multicultural festival &quot;Hello Cape Breton - Kwe&#x27; Unama&#x27;ki,&quot; and private organizations using the name, including, for example, Cape Breton Partnership&#x27;s investment campaign titled &quot;Invest in Unama’ki – Cape Breton.&quot;

==History==
Cape Breton Island&#x27;s first residents were likely archaic maritime natives, ancestors of the Mi&#x27;kmaq people. These peoples and their progeny inhabited the island (known as Unama&#x27;ki) for several thousand years and continue to live there to this day. Their traditional lifestyle centred around hunting and fishing because of the unfavourable agricultural conditions of their maritime home. This ocean-centric lifestyle did, however, make them among the first Indigenous peoples to discover European explorers and sailors fishing in the St Lawrence Estuary. Italian explorer (sailing for the British crown) John Cabot reportedly visited the island in 1497. However, European histories and maps of the period are of too poor quality to be sure whether Cabot first visited Newfoundland or Cape Breton Island. This discovery is commemorated by Cape Breton&#x27;s Cabot Trail, and by the Cabot&#x27;s Landing Historic Site &amp; Provincial Park, near the village of Dingwall.

The local Mi&#x27;kmaq peoples began trading with European fishermen when the fishermen began landing in their territories as early as the 1520s. In about 1521–22, the Portuguese under João Álvares Fagundes established a fishing colony on the island. As many as two hundred settlers lived in a village, the name of which is not known, located according to some historians at what is now Ingonish on the island&#x27;s northeastern peninsula. These fishermen traded with the local population but did not maintain a permanent settlement. This Portuguese colony&#x27;s fate is unknown, but it is mentioned as late as 1570.

During the Anglo-French War of 1627 to 1629, under King Charles I, the Kirkes took Quebec City, James Stewart, 4th Lord Ochiltree, planted a colony on Unama&#x27;ki at Baleine, Nova Scotia, and Alexander&#x27;s son, William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling, established the first incarnation of &quot;New Scotland&quot; at Port Royal (Annapolis Royal). These claims, and larger ideals of European colonization were the first time the island was incorporated as European territory, though it would be several decades later that treaties would actually be signed. However, no copies of these treaties exist.

These Scottish triumphs, which left Cape Sable as the only major French holding in North America, did not last. Charles I&#x27;s haste to make peace with France on the terms most beneficial to him meant the new North American gains would be bargained away in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which established which European power had laid claim over the territories.

The French quickly defeated the Scots at Baleine, and established the first European settlements on Île Royale, which is present-day Englishtown (1629) and St. Peter&#x27;s (1630). These settlements lasted only one generation, until Nicolas Denys left in 1659. The island did not have any European settlers for another fifty years before those communities along with Louisbourg were re-established in 1713, after which point European settlement was permanently established on the island.

===Île Royale===
Known as &quot;Île Royale&quot; (&quot;Royal Island&quot;) to the French, the island also saw active settlement by France. After the French ceded their claims to Newfoundland and the Acadian mainland to the British by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the French relocated the population of Plaisance, Newfoundland, to Île Royale and the French garrison was established in the central eastern part at Sainte Anne. As the harbour at Sainte Anne experienced icing problems, it was decided to build a much larger fortification at Louisbourg to improve defences at the entrance to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and to defend France&#x27;s fishing fleet on the Grand Banks. The French also built the Louisbourg Lighthouse in 1734, the first lighthouse in Canada and one of the first in North America. In addition to Cape Breton Island, the French colony of Île Royale also included Île Saint-Jean, today called Prince Edward Island, and Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine.

====Seven Years&#x27; War====
Louisbourg itself was one of the most important commercial and military centres in New France. Louisbourg was captured by New Englanders with British naval assistance in the Siege of Louisbourg (1745) and by British forces in 1758. The French population of Île Royale was deported to France after each siege. While French settlers returned to their homes in Île Royale after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed in 1748, the fortress was demolished after the second siege in 1758. Île Royale remained formally part of New France until it was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. It was then merged with the adjacent British colony of Nova Scotia (present-day peninsular Nova Scotia and New Brunswick). Acadians who had been expelled from Nova Scotia and Île Royale were permitted to settle in Cape Breton beginning in 1764, and established communities in northwestern Cape Breton, near Chéticamp, and southern Cape Breton, on and near Isle Madame.

Some of the first British-sanctioned settlers on the island following the Seven Years&#x27; War were Irish, although upon settlement they merged with local French communities to form a culture rich in music and tradition. From 1763 to 1784, the island was administratively part of the colony of Nova Scotia and was governed from Halifax.

The first permanently settled Scottish community on Cape Breton Island was Judique, settled in 1775 by Michael Mor MacDonald. He spent his first winter using his upside-down boat for shelter, which is reflected in the architecture of the village&#x27;s Community Centre. He composed a song about the area called &quot;O &#x27;s àlainn an t-àite&quot;, or &quot;O, Fair is the Place.&quot;

==== American Revolution ====
During the American Revolution, on 1 November 1776, John Paul Jones, the father of the American Navy, set sail in command of &quot;Alfred&quot; to free hundreds of American prisoners working in the area&#x27;s coal mines. Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of &quot;Mellish&quot;, a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for John Burgoyne&#x27;s troops in Canada.

Major Timothy Hierlihy and his regiment on board &quot;HMS Hope&quot; worked in and protected the coal mines at Sydney Cape Breton from privateer attacks. Sydney, Cape Breton provided a vital supply of coal for Halifax throughout the war. The British began developing the mining site at Sydney Mines in 1777. On 14 May 1778, Major Hierlihy arrived at Cape Breton. While there, Hierlihy reported that he &quot;beat off many piratical attacks, killed some and took other prisoners.&quot;

A few years into the war, there was also a naval engagement between French ships and a British convoy off Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River (1781), Cape Breton. French ships, fighting with the Americans, were re-coaling and defeated a British convoy. Six French and 17 British sailors were killed, with many more wounded.

===Colony of Cape Breton===
In 1784, Britain split the colony of Nova Scotia into three separate colonies: New Brunswick, Cape Breton Island, and present-day peninsular Nova Scotia, in addition to the adjacent colonies of St. John&#x27;s Island (renamed Prince Edward Island in 1798) and Newfoundland. The colony of Cape Breton Island had its capital at Sydney on its namesake harbour fronting on Spanish Bay and the Cabot Strait. Its first Lieutenant-Governor was Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres (1784–1787) and his successor was William Macarmick (1787).

A number of United Empire Loyalists emigrated to the Canadian colonies, including Cape Breton. David Mathews, the former Mayor of New York City during the American Revolution, emigrated with his family to Cape Breton in 1783. He succeeded Macarmick as head of the colony and served from 1795 to 1798.

From 1799 to 1807, the military commandant was John Despard, brother of Edward.

An order forbidding the granting of land in Cape Breton, issued in 1763, was removed in 1784. The mineral rights to the island were given over to the Duke of York by an order-in-council. The British government had intended that the Crown take over the operation of the mines when Cape Breton was made a colony, but this was never done, probably because of the rehabilitation cost of the mines. The mines were in a neglected state, caused by careless operations dating back at least to the time of the final fall of Louisbourg in 1758.

Large-scale shipbuilding began in the 1790s, beginning with schooners for local trade, moving in the 1820s to larger brigs and brigantines, mostly built for British ship owners. Shipbuilding peaked in the 1850s, marked in 1851 by the full-rigged ship &quot;Lord Clarendon&quot;, which was the largest wooden ship ever built in Cape Breton.

===Merger with Nova Scotia===
In 1820, the colony of Cape Breton Island was merged for the second time with Nova Scotia. This development is one of the factors which led to large-scale industrial development in the Sydney Coal Field of eastern Cape Breton County. By the late 19th century, as a result of the faster shipping, expanding fishery and industrialization of the island, exchanges of people between the island of Newfoundland and Cape Breton increased, beginning a cultural exchange that continues to this day.

The 1920s were some of the most violent times in Cape Breton. They were marked by several severe labour disputes. The famous murder of William Davis by strike breakers, and the seizing of the New Waterford power plant by striking miners led to a major union sentiment that persists to this day in some circles. William Davis Miners&#x27; Memorial Day continues to be celebrated in coal mining towns to commemorate the deaths of miners at the hands of the coal companies.

===20th century===
The turn of the 20th century saw Cape Breton Island at the forefront of scientific achievement with the now-famous activities launched by inventors Alexander Graham Bell and Guglielmo Marconi.

Following his successful invention of the telephone and being relatively wealthy, Bell acquired land near Baddeck in 1885. He chose the land, which he named &quot;Beinn Bhreagh&quot;, largely due to its resemblance to his early surroundings in Scotland. He established a summer estate complete with research laboratories, working with deaf people including Helen Keller, and continued to invent. Baddeck would be the site of his experiments with hydrofoil technologies as well as the Aerial Experiment Association, financed by his wife Mabel Gardiner Hubbard. These efforts resulted in the first powered flight in Canada when the AEA &quot;Silver Dart&quot; took off from the ice-covered waters of Bras d&#x27;Or Lake. Bell also built the forerunner to the iron lung and experimented with breeding sheep.

Marconi&#x27;s contributions to Cape Breton Island were also quite significant, as he used the island&#x27;s geography to his advantage in transmitting the first North American trans-Atlantic radio message from a station constructed at Table Head in Glace Bay to a receiving station at Poldhu in Cornwall, England. Marconi&#x27;s pioneering work in Cape Breton marked the beginning of modern radio technology. Marconi&#x27;s station at Marconi Towers, on the outskirts of Glace Bay, became the chief communication centre for the Royal Canadian Navy in World War I through to the early years of World War II.

Promotions for tourism beginning in the 1950s recognized the importance of the Scottish culture to the province, as the provincial government started encouraging the use of Gaelic once again. The establishment of funding for the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts and formal Gaelic language courses in public schools are intended to address the near-loss of this culture to assimilation into Anglophone Canadian culture.

In the 1960s, the Fortress of Louisbourg was partially reconstructed by Parks Canada, using the labour of unemployed coal miners. Since 2009, this National Historic Site of Canada has attracted an average of 90,000 visitors per year.

== Geography ==
The irregularly-shaped rectangular island is about 100 km wide and 150 long, for a total of in area.

It lies in the southeastern extremity of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Cape Breton is separated from the Nova Scotia peninsula by the very deep Strait of Canso. The island is joined to the mainland by the Canso Causeway.

Cape Breton Island is composed of rocky shores, rolling farmland, glacial valleys, barren headlands, highlands, woods and plateaus.

=== Geology ===
The island is characterized by a number of elevations of ancient crystalline and metamorphic rock rising up from the south to the north, and contrasted with eroded lowlands. The bedrock of blocks that developed in different places around the globe, at different times, and then were fused together via tectonics.

Cape Breton is formed from three terranes. These are fragments of the Earth&#x27;s crust formed on a tectonic plate and attached by accretion or suture to crust lying on another plate. Each of these has its own distinctive geologic history, which is different from that of the surrounding areas. The southern half of the island formed from the Avalon terrane, which was once a microcontinent in the Paleozoic era. It is made up of volcanic rock that formed near what is now called Africa. Most of the northern half of the island is on the Bras d&#x27;Or terrane (part of the Ganderia terrane). It contains volcanic and sedimentary rock formed off the coast of what is now South America. The third terrane is the relatively small Blair River inlier on the far northwestern tip. It contains the oldest rock in the Maritimes, formed up to 1.6 billion years ago. These rocks, which can be seen in the Polletts Cove - Aspy Fault Wilderness Area north of Pleasant Bay, are likely part of the Canadian Shield, a large area of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock that forms the core of the North American continent.

The Avalon and Bras d&#x27;Or terranes were pushed together about 500 million years ago when the supercontinent Gondwana was formed. The Blair River inlier was sandwiched in between the two when Laurussia was formed 450-360 million years ago, at which time the land was found in the tropics. This collision also formed the Appalachian Mountains. Associated rifting and faulting is now visible as the canyons of the Cape Breton Highlands. Then, during the Carboniferous period, the area was flooded, which created sedimentary rock layers such as sandstone, shale, gypsum, and conglomerate. Later, most of the island was tropical forest which later formed coal deposits.

Much later, the land was shaped by repeated ice ages which left striations, till, U-shaped valleys, and carved the Bras d&#x27;Or Lake from the bedrock. Examples of U-shaped valleys are those of the Chéticamp, Grande Anse, and Clyburn River valleys. Other valleys have been eroded by water, forming V-shaped valleys and canyons. Cape Breton has many fault lines but few earthquakes. Since the North American continent is moving westward, earthquakes tend to occur on the western edge of the continent.

=== Climate ===
The warm summer humid continental climate is moderated by the proximity of the cold, oftentimes polar Labrador Current and its warmer counterpart the Gulf Stream, both being dominant currents in the North Atlantic Ocean.

=== Ecology ===
==== Lowlands ====
There are lowland areas in along the western shore, around Lake Ainslie, the Bras d&#x27;Or watershed, Boularderie Island, and the Sydney coalfield. They include salt marshes, coastal beaches, and freshwater wetlands.

Starting in the 1800s, many areas were cleared for farming or timber. Many farms were abandoned from the 1920s to the 1950s with fields being reclaimed by white spruce, red maple, white birch, and balsam fir. Higher slopes are dominated by yellow birch and sugar maple. In sheltered areas with sun and drainage, Acadian forest is found. Wetter areas have tamarack, and black spruce. The weather station at Ingonish records more rain than anywhere else in Nova Scotia.

Behind barrier beaches and dunes at Aspy Bay are salt marshes. The Aspy, Clyburn, and Ingonish rivers have all created floodplains which support populations of black ash, fiddle head fern, swamp loosestrife, swamp milkweed, southern twayblade, and bloodroot.

Red sandstone and white gypsum cliffs can be observed throughout this area. Bedrock is Carboniferous sedimentary with limestone, shale, and sandstone. Many fluvial remains from are glaciation found here. Mining has been ongoing for centuries, and more than 500 mine openings can be found, mainly in the east.

Karst topography is found in Dingwall, South Harbour, Plaster Provincial Park, along the Margaree and Middle Rivers, and along the north shore of Lake Ainslie. The presence of gypsum and limestone increases soil pH and produces some rich wetlands which support giant spear, tufted fen, and other mosses, as well as vascular plants like sedges.

This ecosystem is spread throughout Cape Breton and is defined as hills and slopes 150-300m above sea level, typically covered with Acadian forest.

It includes North Mountain, Kellys Mountain, and East Bay Hills.

Forests in this area were cleared for timber and agriculture and are now a mosaic of habitats depending on the local terrain, soils and microclimate. Typical species include ironwood, white ash, beech, sugar maple, red maple, and yellow birch. The understory can include striped maple, beaked hazelnut, fly honeysuckle, club mosses and ferns. Ephemerals are visible in the spring, such as Dutchman&#x27;s breeches and spring beauty.

In ravines, shade tolerant trees like hemlock, white pine, red spruce are found. Less well-drained areas are forested with balsam fir and black spruce.

==== Highlands and the Northern Plateau ====
The Highlands comprise a tableland in the northern portions of Inverness and Victoria counties.

An extension of the Appalachian mountain chain, elevations average 350 metres at the edges of the plateau and rise to more than 500 metres at the centre. The area has broad, gently rolling hills bisected with deep valleys and steep-walled canyons. A majority of the land is a taiga of balsam fir, with some white birch, white spruce, mountain ash, and heart-leaf birch.

The northern and western edges of the plateau, particularly at high elevations, resemble arctic tundra. Trees 30–90 high, overgrown with reindeer lichens, can be 150 years old. At very high elevations some areas are exposed bedrock without any vegetation apart from Cladonia lichens. There are many barrens, or heaths, dominated by bushy species of the Ericaceae family.

Spruce, killed by spruce budworm in the late 1970s, has reestablished at lower elevations, but not at higher elevations due to moose browsing. Decomposition is slow, leaving thick layers of plant litter. Ground cover includes wood aster, twinflower, liverworts, wood sorrel, bluebead lily, goldthread, various ferns, and lily-of-the-valley, with bryophyte and large-leaved goldenrod at higher elevations. The understory can include striped maple, mountain ash, ferns, and mountain maple.

Near water, bog birch, alder, and mountain-ash are found. There are many open wetlands populated with stunted tamarack and black spruce. Poor drainage has led to the formation of peatlands which can support tufted clubrush, Bartram&#x27;s serviceberry, coastal sedge, and bakeapple.

==== Cape Breton coastal ====
The eastern shore is unique in that while not at a high elevation, it has a cool climate with much rain and fog, strong winds, and low summer temperatures. It is dominated by a boreal forest of black spruce and balsam fir. Sheltered areas support tolerant hardwoods such as white birch and red maple. Many salt marshes, fens, and bogs are found there.

There are many beaches on the highly crenelated coastline. Unlike elsewhere on the island, these are rocky and support plants unlike those of sandy beaches. The coast provides habitat for common coast bird species like common eider, black legged kittiwake, black guillemot, whimbrel, and great cormorant.

=== Hydrology ===
Land is drained into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence via the rivers Aspy, Sydney, Mira, Framboise, Margaree, and Chéticamp. The largest freshwater lake is Lake Ainslie.

==Government==
Local government on the island is provided by the Cape Breton Regional Municipality, the Municipality of the County of Inverness, the Municipality of the County of Richmond, and the Municipality of the County of Victoria, along with the Town of Port Hawkesbury.

The island has five Miꞌkmaq Indian reserves: Eskasoni (the largest in population and land area), Membertou, Wagmatcook, Waycobah, and Potlotek.

==Demographics==
The island&#x27;s residents can be grouped into five main cultures: Scottish, Mi&#x27;kmaq, Acadian, Irish, and English, with respective languages Scottish Gaelic, Mi&#x27;kmaq, French, and English alongside several sign languages including Maritime Sign Language. English is now the primary language, including a locally distinctive Cape Breton accent, while Mi&#x27;kmaq, Scottish Gaelic and Acadian French are still spoken in some communities. Amongst sign languages, it is unknown to what extent LSQ is spoken amongst Acadians, but American Sign Language is certainly predominant across the island, as it has gained significant numbers of signers, especially with the steep declines in Maritime Sign Language use.

Later migrations of Black Loyalists, Italians, and Eastern Europeans mostly settled in the island&#x27;s eastern part around the industrial Cape Breton region. Cape Breton Island&#x27;s population has been in decline two decades with an increasing exodus in recent years due to economic conditions.

Population trend

===Religious groups===
Statistics Canada in 2001 reported a &quot;religion&quot; total of 145,525 for Cape Breton, including 5,245 with &quot;no religious affiliation.&quot; Major categories included:
*Roman Catholic: 96,260 (includes Eastern Catholic, Polish National Catholic Church, Old Catholic)
*Protestant: 42,390
*Christian, not included elsewhere: 580
*Orthodox: 395
*Jewish: 250
*Muslim: 145

==Economy==

Much of the recent economic history of Cape Breton Island can be tied to the coal industry.

The island has two major coal deposits:

*the Sydney Coal Field in the southeastern part of the island along the Atlantic Ocean drove the Industrial Cape Breton economy throughout the 19th and 20th centuries—until after World War II, its industries were the largest private employers in Canada.
*the Inverness Coal Field in the western part of the island along the Gulf of St. Lawrence is significantly smaller but hosted several mines.

Sydney has traditionally been the main port, with facilities in a large, sheltered, natural harbour. It is the island&#x27;s largest commercial centre and home to the &quot;Cape Breton Post&quot; daily newspaper, as well as one television station, CJCB-TV (CTV), and several radio stations. The Marine Atlantic terminal at North Sydney is the terminal for large ferries traveling to Channel-Port aux Basques and seasonally to Argentia, both on the island of Newfoundland.

Point Edward on the west side of Sydney Harbour is the location of Sydport, a former navy base () now converted to commercial use. The Canadian Coast Guard College is nearby at Westmount. Petroleum, bulk coal, and cruise ship facilities are also in Sydney Harbour.

Glace Bay, the second largest urban community in population, was the island&#x27;s main coal mining centre until its last mine closed in the 1980s. Glace Bay was the hub of the Sydney &amp; Louisburg Railway and a major fishing port. At one time, Glace Bay was known as the largest town in Nova Scotia, based on population.

Port Hawkesbury has risen to prominence since the completion of the Canso Causeway and Canso Canal created an artificial deep-water port, allowing extensive petrochemical, pulp and paper, and gypsum handling facilities to be established. The Strait of Canso is completely navigable to Seawaymax vessels, and Port Hawkesbury is open to the deepest-draught vessels on the world&#x27;s oceans. Large marine vessels may also enter Bras d&#x27;Or Lake through the Great Bras d&#x27;Or channel, and small craft can use the Little Bras d&#x27;Or channel or St. Peters Canal. While commercial shipping no longer uses the St. Peters Canal, it remains an important waterway for recreational vessels.

The industrial Cape Breton area faced several challenges with the closure of the Cape Breton Development Corporation&#x27;s (DEVCO) coal mines and the Sydney Steel Corporation&#x27;s (SYSCO) steel mill. In recent years, the Island&#x27;s residents have tried to diversify the area economy by investing in tourism developments, call centres, and small businesses, as well as manufacturing ventures in fields such as auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and window glazings.

While the Cape Breton Regional Municipality is in transition from an industrial to a service-based economy, the rest of Cape Breton Island outside the industrial area surrounding Sydney-Glace Bay has been more stable, with a mixture of fishing, forestry, small-scale agriculture, and tourism.

Tourism in particular has grown throughout the post-Second World War era, especially the growth in vehicle-based touring, which was furthered by the creation of the Cabot Trail scenic drive. The scenery of the island is rivalled in northeastern North America by only Newfoundland; and Cape Breton Island tourism marketing places a heavy emphasis on its Scottish Gaelic heritage through events such as the Celtic Colours Festival, held each October, as well as promotions through the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts.

Whale-watching is a popular attraction for tourists. Whale-watching cruises are operated by vendors from Baddeck to Chéticamp. The most popular species of whale found in Cape Breton&#x27;s waters is the pilot whale.

The Cabot Trail is a scenic road circuit around and over the Cape Breton Highlands with spectacular coastal vistas; over 400,000 visitors drive the Cabot Trail each summer and fall. Coupled with the Fortress of Louisbourg, it has driven the growth of the tourism industry on the island in recent decades. The &quot;Condé Nast&quot; travel guide has rated Cape Breton Island as one of the world&#x27;s best island destinations.

=== Transport ===
The island&#x27;s primary east–west road is Highway 105, the Trans-Canada Highway, although Trunk 4 is also heavily used. Highway 125 is an important arterial route around Sydney Harbour in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. The Cabot Trail, circling the Cape Breton Highlands, and Trunk 19, along the island&#x27;s western coast, are important secondary roads. The Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway maintains railway connections between the port of Sydney to the Canadian National Railway in Truro.

Cape Breton Island is served by several airports, the largest, the JA Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport, situated on Trunk 4 between the communities of Sydney and Glace Bay, as well as smaller airports at Port Hawksbury, Margaree, and Baddeck.

==Culture==


=== Language ===
Gaelic speakers in Cape Breton, as elsewhere in Nova Scotia, constituted a large proportion of the local population from the 18th century on. They brought with them a common culture of poetry, traditional songs and tales, music and dance, and used this to develop distinctive local traditions.

Most Gaelic settlement in Nova Scotia happened between 1770 and 1840, with probably over 50,000 Gaelic speakers emigrating from the Scottish Highlands and the Hebrides to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Such emigration was facilitated by changes in Gaelic society and the economy, with sharp increases in rents, confiscation of land and disruption of local customs and rights. In Nova Scotia, poetry and song in Gaelic flourished. George Emmerson argues that an &quot;ancient and rich&quot; tradition of storytelling, song, and Gaelic poetry emerged during the 18th century and was transplanted from the Highlands of Scotland to Nova Scotia, where the language similarly took root there. The majority of those settling in Nova Scotia from the end of the 18th century through to middle of the next were from the Scottish Highlands, rather than the Lowlands, making the Highland tradition&#x27;s impact more profound on the region. Gaelic settlement in Cape Breton began in earnest in the early nineteenth century.
The Gaelic language became dominant from Colchester County in the west of Nova Scotia into Cape Breton County in the east. It was reinforced in Cape Breton in the first half of the 19th century with an influx of Highland Scots numbering approximately 50,000 as a result of the Highland Clearances.

From 1892 to 1904, Jonathon MacKinnon published the Scottish Gaelic-language biweekly newspaper () in Sydney, Nova Scotia. During the 1920s, several Scottish Gaelic-language newspapers were printed in Sydney for distribution primarily on Cape Breton, including the (), which included Gaelic-language lessons; the United Church-affiliated (); and MacKinnon&#x27;s later endeavor, ().

Gaelic speakers, however, tended to be poor; they were largely illiterate and had little access to education. This situation persisted into the early days of the twentieth century. In 1921 Gaelic was approved as an optional subject in the curriculum of Nova Scotia, but few teachers could be found and children were discouraged from using the language in schools. By 1931 the number of Gaelic speakers in Nova Scotia had fallen to approximately 25,000, mostly in discrete pockets. In Cape Breton it was still a majority language, but the proportion was falling. Children were no longer being raised with Gaelic.

From 1939 on, attempts were made to strengthen its position in the public school system in Nova Scotia, but funding, official commitment and the availability of teachers continued to be a problem. By the 1950s the number of speakers was less than 7,000. The advent of multiculturalism in Canada in the 1960s meant that new educational opportunities became available, with a gradual strengthening of the language at secondary and tertiary level. At present several schools in Cape Breton offer Gaelic Studies and Gaelic language programs, and the language is taught at Cape Breton University.

The 2016 Canadian Census shows that there are only 40 reported speakers of Gaelic as a mother tongue in Cape Breton. On the other hand, there are families and individuals who have recommenced intergenerational transmission. They include fluent speakers from Gaelic-speaking areas of Scotland and speakers who became fluent in Nova Scotia and who in some cases studied in Scotland. Other revitalization activities include adult education, community cultural events and publishing.

===Traditional music===
Cape Breton is well known for its traditional fiddle music, which was brought to North America by Scottish immigrants during the Highland Clearances. The traditional style has been well preserved in Cape Breton, and cèilidhs have become a popular attraction for tourists. Inverness County in particular has a heavy concentration of musical activity, with regular performances in communities such as Mabou and Judique. Judique is recognized as &quot;&quot; () or the &#x27;Home of Celtic Music&#x27;, featuring the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre. The traditional fiddle music of Cape Breton is studied by musicians around the world, where its global recognition continues to rise.

Local performers who have received significant recognition outside of Cape Breton include Angus Chisholm; Buddy MacMaster; Joseph Cormier, the first Cape Breton fiddler to record an album made available in Europe (1974); Lee Cremo; Bruce Guthro; Natalie MacMaster; Ashley MacIsaac; The Rankin Family; Aselin Debison; Gordie Sampson; John Allan Cameron; and the Barra MacNeils.

The Men of the Deeps are a male choral group of current and former miners from the industrial Cape Breton area.

&quot;The Island&quot; by Kenzie MacNeil, and &quot;Rise Again&quot;, written by Leon Dubinsky and recorded by The Rankin Family, are each considered unofficial anthems of Cape Breton.

<text>The Cthulhu Mythos is a mythopoeia and a shared fictional universe, originating in the works of American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. The term was coined by August Derleth, a contemporary correspondent and protégé of Lovecraft, to identify the settings, tropes, and lore that were employed by Lovecraft and his literary successors. The name &quot;Cthulhu&quot; derives from the central creature in Lovecraft&#x27;s seminal short story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, first published in the pulp magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in 1928.

Richard L. Tierney, a writer who also wrote Mythos tales, later applied the term &quot;Derleth Mythos&quot; to distinguish Lovecraft&#x27;s works from Derleth&#x27;s later stories, which modify key tenets of the Mythos. Authors of Lovecraftian horror in particular frequently use elements of the Cthulhu Mythos.

==History==

In his essay &quot;H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, Robert M. Price described two stages in the development of the Cthulhu Mythos. Price called the first stage the &quot;Cthulhu Mythos proper&quot;. This stage was formulated during Lovecraft&#x27;s lifetime and was subject to his guidance. The second stage was guided by August Derleth who, in addition to publishing Lovecraft&#x27;s stories after his death, attempted to categorize and expand the Mythos.

===First stage===
An ongoing theme in Lovecraft&#x27;s work is the complete irrelevance of mankind in the face of the cosmic horrors that apparently exist in the universe. Lovecraft made frequent references to the &quot;Great Old Ones&quot;, a loose pantheon of ancient, powerful deities from space who once ruled the Earth and have since fallen into a deathlike sleep. While these monstrous deities were present in almost all of Lovecraft&#x27;s published work (his second short story &quot;Dagon&quot;, published in 1919, is considered the start of the Mythos), the first story to really expand the pantheon of Great Old Ones and its themes is &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, which was published in 1928.

Lovecraft broke with other pulp writers of the time by having his main characters&#x27; minds deteriorate when afforded a glimpse of what exists outside their perceived reality. He emphasized the point by stating in the opening sentence of the story that &quot;The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.&quot;

Writer Dirk W. Mosig noted that Lovecraft was a &quot;mechanistic materialist&quot; who embraced the philosophy of cosmic indifferentism and believed in a purposeless, mechanical, and uncaring universe. Human beings, with their limited faculties, can never fully understand this universe, and the cognitive dissonance caused by this revelation leads to insanity, in his view.

There have been attempts at categorizing this fictional group of beings. Phillip A. Schreffler argues that by carefully scrutinizing Lovecraft&#x27;s writings, a workable framework emerges that outlines the entire &quot;pantheon&quot;from the unreachable &quot;Outer Ones&quot; (e.g., Azathoth, who occupies the centre of the universe) and &quot;Great Old Ones&quot; (e.g., Cthulhu, imprisoned on Earth in the sunken city of R&#x27;lyeh) to the lesser castes (the lowly slave shoggoths and the Mi-Go).

David E. Schultz said Lovecraft never meant to create a canonical Mythos but rather intended his imaginary pantheon to serve merely as a background element. Lovecraft himself humorously referred to his Mythos as &quot;Yog Sothothery&quot; (Dirk W. Mosig coincidentally suggested the term &quot;Yog-Sothoth Cycle of Myth&quot; be substituted for &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot;). At times, Lovecraft even had to remind his readers that his Mythos creations were entirely fictional.

The view that there was no rigid structure is expounded upon by S. T. Joshi, who said

Price said Lovecraft&#x27;s writings could at least be divided into categories and identified three distinct themes: the &quot;Dunsanian&quot; (written in a similar style as Lord Dunsany), &quot;Arkham&quot; (occurring in Lovecraft&#x27;s fictionalized New England setting), and &quot;Cthulhu&quot; (the cosmic tales) cycles. Writer Will Murray noted that while Lovecraft often used his fictional pantheon in the stories he ghostwrote for other authors, he reserved Arkham and its environs exclusively for those tales he wrote under his own name.

Although the Mythos was not formalized or acknowledged between them, Lovecraft did correspond, meet in person, and share story elements with other contemporary writers including Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch, Frank Belknap Long, Henry Kuttner, Henry S. Whitehead, and Fritz Leibera group referred to as the &quot;Lovecraft Circle&quot;.

For example, Robert E. Howard&#x27;s character Friedrich Von Junzt reads Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Necronomicon&quot; in the short story &quot;The Children of the Night&quot; (1931), and in turn Lovecraft mentions Howard&#x27;s &quot;Unaussprechlichen Kulten&quot; in the stories &quot;Out of the Aeons&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; (1936). Many of Howard&#x27;s original unedited &quot;Conan&quot; stories also involve parts of the Cthulhu Mythos.

===Second stage===
Price denotes the second stage&#x27;s commencement with August Derleth, with the principal difference between Lovecraft and Derleth being Derleth&#x27;s use of hope and development of the idea that the Cthulhu Mythos essentially represented a struggle between good and evil. Derleth is credited with creating the &quot;Elder Gods&quot;. He stated:

Price said the basis for Derleth&#x27;s system is found in Lovecraft: &quot;Was Derleth&#x27;s use of the rubric &#x27;Elder Gods&#x27; so alien to Lovecraft&#x27;s in &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;? Perhaps not. In fact, this very story, along with some hints from &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;, provides the key to the origin of the &#x27;Derleth Mythos&#x27;. For in &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; is shown the history of a conflict between interstellar races, first among them the Elder Ones and the Cthulhu-spawn.&quot;

Derleth said Lovecraft wished for other authors to actively write about the Mythos as opposed to it being a discrete plot device within Lovecraft&#x27;s own stories. Derleth expanded the boundaries of the Mythos by including any passing reference to another author&#x27;s story elements by Lovecraft as part of the genre. Just as Lovecraft made passing reference to Clark Ashton Smith&#x27;s &quot;Book of Eibon&quot;, Derleth in turn added Smith&#x27;s Ubbo-Sathla to the Mythos.

Derleth also attempted to connect the deities of the Mythos to the four elements (air, earth, fire, and water), creating new beings representative of certain elements in order to legitimize his system of classification. He created &quot;Cthugha&quot; as a sort of fire elemental when a fan, Francis Towner Laney, complained that he had neglected to include the element in his schema. Laney, the editor of &quot;The Acolyte&quot;, had categorized the Mythos in an essay that first appeared in the Winter 1942 issue of the magazine.

Impressed by the glossary, Derleth asked Laney to rewrite it for publication in the Arkham House collection &quot;Beyond the Wall of Sleep&quot; (1943). Laney&#x27;s essay (&quot;The Cthulhu Mythos&quot;) was later republished in &quot;Crypt of Cthulhu #32&quot; (1985). In applying the elemental theory to beings that function on a cosmic scale (e.g., Yog-Sothoth) some authors created a fifth element that they termed &quot;aethyr&quot;.

== Fictional cults ==
A number of fictional cults dedicated to &quot;malevolent supernatural entities&quot; appear in the Cthulhu Mythos, the loosely connected series of horror stories written by Lovecraft and other writers inspired by his creations. These fictional cults have in some ways taken on a life of their own beyond the pages of Lovecraft&#x27;s works. According to author John Engle, &quot;The very real world of esoteric magical and occult practices has adopted Lovecraft and his works into its canon, which have informed the ritual practices, or even formed the bedrock, of certain cabals and magical circles&quot;.

== Significance ==
The Cthulhu Mythos of H. P. Lovecraft is considered to have been highly influential for the speculative fiction genre. It has been called &quot;the official fictional religion of fantasy, science fiction, and horror, a grab bag for writers in need of unthinkably vast, and unthinkably indifferent, eldritch entities&quot;.

== Biology ==
&quot;Sollasina cthulhu&quot;, an extinct ophiocistioid echinoderm, is named after the Cthulhu Mythos.

Yogsothoth is a genus of centrohelid protists.

<doc id="5726" wikidata="Q1723013" url="?curid=5726" title="Crane shot">
<text>In filmmaking and video production, a crane shot is a shot taken by a camera on a moving crane or jib. Filmmaker D. W. Griffith created the first crane for his 1916 epic film &quot;Intolerance&quot;, with famed special effects pioneer Eiji Tsuburaya later constructing the first iron camera crane which is still adapted worldwide today. Most cranes accommodate both the camera and an operator, but some can be moved by remote control. Crane shots are often found in what are supposed to be emotional or suspenseful scenes. One example of this technique is the shots taken by remote cranes in the car-chase sequence of the 1985 film &quot;To Live and Die in L.A&quot;. Some filmmakers place the camera on a boom arm simply to make it easier to move around between ordinary set-ups.

==History==

D. W. Griffith designed the first camera crane for his 1916 epic film &quot;Intolerance&quot;. His crane measured 140 feet tall and ascended on six four-wheeled railroad trucks. In 1929, future special effects pioneer Eiji Tsuburaya constructed a smaller replica of Griffith&#x27;s wooden camera crane without blueprints or manuals. Although his wooden crane collapsed shortly after its completion, Tsuburaya created the first-ever iron shooting crane in October 1934, and an adaptation of this crane is still used worldwide today.

== Camera crane types ==
Camera cranes may be small, medium, or large, depending on the load capacity and length of the loading arm. Historically, the first camera crane provided for lifting the camera together with the operator, and sometimes an assistant. The range of motion of the boom was restricted because of the high load capacity and the need to ensure operator safety. In recent years a camera crane boom tripod with a remote control has become popular. It carries on the boom only a movie or television camera without an operator and allows shooting from difficult positions as a small load capacity makes it possible to achieve a long reach of the crane boom and relative freedom of movement. The operator controls the camera from the ground through a motorized panoramic head, using remote control and video surveillance by watching the image on the monitor. A separate category consists of telescopic camera cranes. These devices allow setting an arbitrary trajectory of the camera, eliminating the characteristic jib crane radial displacement that comes with traditional spanning shots.

Large camera cranes are almost indistinguishable from the usual boom-type cranes, with the exception of special equipment for smoothly moving the boom and controlling noise. Small camera cranes and crane-trucks have a lightweight construction, often without a mechanical drive. The valves are controlled manually by balancing the load-specific counterweight, facilitating manipulation. To improve usability and repeatability of movement of the crane in different takes, the axis of rotation arrows are provided with limbs and a pointer. In some cases, the camera crane is mounted on a dolly for even greater camera mobility. Such devices are called crane trolleys. In modern films robotic cranes allow use of multiple actuators for high-accuracy repeated movement of the camera in trick photography. These devices are called tap-robots; some sources use the term motion control.

== Manufacturers ==
The major supplier of cranes in the cinema of the United States throughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s was the Chapman Company (later Chapman-Leonard of North Hollywood), supplanted by dozens of similar manufacturers around the world. The traditional design provided seats for both the director and the camera operator, and sometimes a third seat for the cinematographer as well. Large weights on the back of the crane compensate for the weight of the people riding the crane and must be adjusted carefully to avoid the possibility of accidents. During the 1960s, the tallest crane was the Chapman Titan crane, a massive design over 20 feet high that won an Academy Scientific &amp; Engineering award. 

During the last few years, camera cranes have been miniaturized and costs have dropped so dramatically that most aspiring film makers have access to these tools. What was once a &quot;Hollywood&quot; effect is now available for under $400. Manufacturers of camera cranes include ABC-Products, Cambo, Filmotechnic, Polecam, Panther and Matthews Studio Equipment, Sevenoak, and Newton Nordic.

== Camera crane technique==
Most such cranes were manually operated, requiring an experienced boom operator who knew how to vertically raise, lower, and &quot;crab&quot; the camera alongside actors while the crane platform rolled on separate tracks. The crane operator and camera operator had to precisely coordinate their moves so that focus, pan, and camera position all started and stopped at the same time, requiring great skill and rehearsal. On the back of the crane is a counter weight. This allows the crane to smooth action while in motion with minimal effort.

== Notable usage==

* D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916) featured the first ever crane shot for a film.
* Atsuo Tomioka&#x27;s 1935 film &quot;The Chorus of a Million&quot; featured the first iron camera crane, which was created and employed in the film in 1934 by Eiji Tsuburaya.
* Leni Riefenstahl had a cameraman shoot a half-circle pan shot from a crane for the 1935 Nazi propaganda film &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;.
* A crane shot was used in Orson Welles&#x27; 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Welles also used a crane camera during the iconic opening of &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958). The camera perched on a Chapman crane begins on a close-up of a ticking time bomb and ends three-plus minutes later with a blinding explosion.
* The Western &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) had a famous crane shot. The shot backs up and rises, in order to show Marshal Will Kane totally alone and isolated on the street.
* The 1964 film by Mikhail Kalatozov, &quot;I Am Cuba&quot; contains two of the most astonishing tracking shots ever attempted.
* In his film &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, Jean-Luc Godard used a crane for almost every shot in the movie, giving each scene a 360-degree tour of the tableau Godard presented to the viewer. In the final scene, he even shows the crane he was able to rent on his limited budget by including it in the scene. This was one of his traits as a filmmaker — showing off his budget — as he did with Brigitte Bardot in &quot;Le Mepris&quot; (&quot;Contempt&quot;).
* The closing take of Richard Attenborough&#x27;s film version of &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; begins with a single war grave, gradually pulling back to reveal hundreds of identical crosses.
* The 1980 comedy-drama film &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; featured a crane throughout the production of the fictitious film-within-a-film (with the director played by Peter O&#x27;Toole).
* The television comedy &quot;Second City Television&quot; (&quot;SCTV&quot;) uses the concept of the crane shot as comedic material. After using a crane shot in one of the first NBC-produced episodes, the network complained about the exorbitant cost of renting the crane. SCTV writers responded by making the &quot;crane shot&quot; a ubiquitous symbol of production excess while also lampooning network executives who care nothing about artistic vision and everything about the bottom line. At the end of the second season, an inebriated Johnny LaRue (John Candy) is given his very own crane by Santa Claus, implying he would be able to have a crane shot whenever he wanted it. 
* Director Dario Argento included an extensive scene in &quot;Tenebrae&quot; where the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up a house wall, all in one seamless take. Due to its length, the tracking shot ended up being the production&#x27;s most difficult and complex part to complete.
* The 2004 Johnnie To film &quot;Breaking News&quot; opens with an elaborate seven-minute single-take crane shot.
* Director Dennis Dugan frequently uses top-to-bottom crane shots in his comedy films.
* A camera crane panoramic master interior live shot opens &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; after the pre-recorded exterior aerial-shot.
* &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; uses a crane to pan the camera over the audience.

<text>Chariots of Fire is a 1981 historical sports drama film directed by Hugh Hudson, written by Colin Welland and produced by David Puttnam. It is based on the true story of two British athletes in the 1924 Olympics: Eric Liddell, a devout Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of God, and Harold Abrahams, an English Jew who runs to overcome prejudice. Ben Cross and Ian Charleson star as Abrahams and Liddell, alongside Nigel Havers, Ian Holm, John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, Cheryl Campbell, Alice Krige, Brad Davis and Dennis Christopher in supporting roles. Kenneth Branagh and Stephen Fry make their debuts in minor roles.

&quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Score for Vangelis&#x27;s electronic theme tune. At the 35th British Academy Film Awards, the film was nominated in 11 categories and won in three, including Best Film. It is ranked 19th in the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of Top 100 British films.

The film&#x27;s title was inspired by the line &quot;Bring me my Chariot of fire!&quot; from the William Blake poem adapted into the British hymn and unofficial English anthem &quot;Jerusalem&quot;; the hymn is heard at the end of the film. The original phrase &quot;chariot(s) of fire&quot; is from 2 Kings and in the Bible.

== Plot ==
During a 1978 funeral service in London in honour of the life of Harold Abrahams, headed by his former colleague Lord Andrew Lindsay, there is a flashback to when he was young and in a group of athletes running along a beach.

In 1919, Harold Abrahams enters the University of Cambridge, where he experiences antisemitism from the staff but enjoys participating in the Gilbert and Sullivan club. He becomes the first person to complete the Trinity Great Court Run, running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with Sybil Gordon, a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano.

Eric Liddell, born in China to Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie disapproves of Liddell&#x27;s plans to pursue competitive running. Still, Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary. When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but Sam Mussabini, a professional trainer he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters, who assert that it isn&#x27;t gentlemanly for an amateur to &quot;play the tradesman&quot; by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for antisemitic and class-based prejudice. When Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to return eventually to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running and that not to run would be to dishonour God.

After years training and racing, the two athletes are accepted to represent Great Britain in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams&#x27;s Cambridge friends, Andrew Lindsay, Aubrey Montague, and Henry Stallard. While boarding the boat to France for the Olympics, Liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday. Despite intense pressure from the Prince of Wales and the British Olympic Committee, he refuses to run the race because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the Lord&#x27;s Day. A solution is found thanks to Liddell&#x27;s teammate Lindsay, who, having already won a silver medal in the 400 metres hurdles, offers to give his place in the 400-metre race on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully accepts. Liddell&#x27;s religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world; he delivers a sermon at the Paris Church of Scotland that Sunday, and quotes from .

Abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200-metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race and wins. His coach Mussabini, who was barred from the stadium, is overcome that the years&#x27; dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he has neglected for the sake of running. Before Liddell&#x27;s race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his new, far longer, 400-metre race. But one of the American runners, Jackson Scholz, hands Liddell a note of support that quotes . Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal. The British team returns home triumphant.

A textual epilogue reveals that Abrahams married Sybil and became the elder statesman of British athletics while Liddell went on to do missionary work and was mourned by all of Scotland following his death in Japanese-occupied China.

== Cast ==
Other actors in smaller roles include John Young as Eric and Jennie&#x27;s father Reverend J.D. Liddell, Yvonne Gilan as their mother Mary, Benny Young as their older brother Rob, Yves Beneyton as French runner Géo André, Philip O&#x27;Brien as American coach George Collins, Patrick Doyle as Jimmie, and Ruby Wax as Bunty. Kenneth Branagh, who worked as a set gofer, appears as an extra in the Cambridge Society Day sequence. Stephen Fry has a likewise uncredited role as a Gilbert-and-Sullivan Club singer.

== Production ==
=== Screenplay ===

Producer David Puttnam was looking for a story in the mould of &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966), regarding someone who follows his conscience, and felt that sport provided clear situations in this sense. He discovered Eric Liddell&#x27;s story by accident in 1977, when he happened upon &quot;An Approved History of the Olympic Games&quot;, a reference book on the Olympics, while housebound from the flu, in a rented house in Malibu.

Screenwriter Colin Welland, commissioned by Puttnam, did an enormous amount of research for his Academy Award-winning script. Among other things, he took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics, went to the National Film Archives for pictures and footage of the 1924 Olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. Welland just missed Abrahams, who died on 14 January 1978, but he did attend Abrahams&#x27; February 1978 memorial service, which inspired the present-day framing device of the film. Aubrey Montague&#x27;s son saw Welland&#x27;s newspaper ad and sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home – which gave Welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film. Except for changes in the greetings of the letters from &quot;Darling Mummy&quot; to &quot;Dear Mum&quot; and the change from Oxford to Cambridge, all of the readings from Montague&#x27;s letters are from the originals.

Welland&#x27;s original script also featured, in addition to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist Douglas Lowe, who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to have anything to do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay.

Initial financing towards development costs was provided by Goldcrest Films, who then sold the project to Mohamed Al-Fayed&#x27;s Allied Stars, but kept a percentage of the profits.

Ian Charleson wrote Eric Liddell&#x27;s speech to the post-race workingmen&#x27;s crowd at the Scotland v. Ireland races. Charleson, who had studied the Bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director Hugh Hudson that he didn&#x27;t feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. Hudson and Welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead.

Puttnam chose Hugh Hudson, a multiple award-winning advertising and documentary filmmaker who had never helmed a feature film, to direct &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. Hudson and Puttnam had known each other since the 1960s when Puttnam was an advertising executive and Hudson was making films for ad agencies. In 1977, Hudson had also been second-unit director on the Puttnam-produced film &quot;Midnight Express&quot;.

=== Casting ===
Director Hugh Hudson was determined to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, and Ian Holm as their supporting cast. Hudson and producer David Puttnam did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell. They then saw Scottish stage actor Ian Charleson performing the role of Pierre in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Piaf&quot;, and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would &quot;fit like a kid glove&quot;.

Ben Cross, who plays Harold Abrahams, was discovered while playing Billy Flynn in &quot;Chicago&quot;. In addition to having a natural pugnaciousness, he had the desired ability to sing and play the piano. Cross was thrilled to be cast, and said he was moved to tears by the film&#x27;s script.

20th Century-Fox, which put up half of the production budget in exchange for distribution rights outside of North America, insisted on having a couple of notable American names in the cast. Thus the small parts of the two American champion runners, Jackson Scholz and Charley Paddock, were cast with recent headliners: Brad Davis had recently starred in &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (also produced by Puttnam), and Dennis Christopher had recently starred, as a young bicycle racer, in the popular indie film &quot;Breaking Away&quot;.

All of the actors portraying runners underwent an intensive three-month training regimen with renowned running coach Tom McNab. This training and isolation of the actors also created a strong bond and sense of camaraderie among them.

=== Filming ===
The beach scenes showing the athletes running towards the Carlton Hotel at Broadstairs, Kent, were shot in Scotland on West Sands, St Andrews next to the 18th hole of the Old Course at St Andrews Links. A plaque now commemorates the filming. The impact of these scenes (as the athletes run in slow motion to Vangelis&#x27;s music) prompted Broadstairs town council to commemorate them with a seafront plaque.

All of the indoor Cambridge scenes were actually filmed at Hugh Hudson&#x27;s alma mater Eton College, because Cambridge refused filming rights, fearing depictions of anti-Semitism. The Cambridge administration greatly regretted the decision after the film&#x27;s enormous success.

Liverpool Town Hall was the setting for the scenes depicting the British Embassy in Paris. The Colombes Olympic Stadium in Paris was represented by the Oval Sports Centre, Bebington, Merseyside. The nearby Woodside ferry terminal was used to represent the embarkation scenes set in Dover. The railway station scenes were filmed in York, using locomotives from the National Railway Museum. The filming of the Scotland–France international athletic meeting took place at Goldenacre Sports Ground in Edinburgh, owned by George Heriot&#x27;s School, while the Scotland–Ireland meeting was at the nearby Inverleith Sports Ground. The scene depicting a performance of &quot;The Mikado&quot; was filmed in the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool, with members of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company who were on tour.

=== Editing ===
The film was slightly altered for the U.S. audience. A brief scene depicting a pre-Olympics cricket game between Abrahams, Liddell, Montague, and the rest of the British track team appears shortly after the beginning of the original film. For the American audience, this brief scene was deleted. In the U.S., to avoid the initial G rating, which had been strongly associated with children&#x27;s films and might have hindered box office sales, a different scene was used – one depicting Abrahams and Montague arriving at a Cambridge railway station and encountering two First World War veterans who use an obscenity – in order to be given a PG rating. An off-camera retort of, &quot;Win it for Israel&quot; among exhortations of fellow students of Abrahams before he takes on the challenge of The Great Court Run was absent from the final cuts theatrically distributed in the U.S. However, they can be heard in versions broadcast on such cable outlets as TCM.

=== Soundtrack ===
Although the film is a period piece set in the 1920s, the Academy Award-winning original soundtrack composed by Vangelis (credited as Vangelis Papathanassiou) uses a contemporary 1980s electronic sound, with a strong use of synthesizer and piano among other instruments. This was a departure from earlier period films, which employed sweeping orchestral instrumentals. The title theme of the film has been used in subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.

Vangelis, a Greek-born electronic composer who moved to Paris in the late 1960s, had been living in London since 1974. Director Hugh Hudson had collaborated with him on documentaries and commercials, and was also particularly impressed with his 1979 albums &quot;Opera Sauvage&quot; and &quot;China&quot;. David Puttnam also greatly admired Vangelis&#x27;s body of work, having originally selected his compositions for his previous film &quot;Midnight Express&quot;. Hudson made the choice for Vangelis and for a modern score: &quot;I knew we needed a piece which was anachronistic to the period to give it a feel of modernity. It was a risky idea but we went with it rather than have a period symphonic score.&quot; The soundtrack had a personal significance to Vangelis: after composing the theme he told Puttnam, &quot;My father is a runner, and this is an anthem to him.&quot;

Hudson originally wanted Vangelis&#x27;s 1977 tune &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&quot;, from his &quot;Opera Sauvage&quot; album, to be the title theme of the film, and the beach running sequence was actually filmed with &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&quot; playing on loudspeakers for the runners to pace to. Vangelis finally convinced Hudson he could create a new and better piece for the film&#x27;s main theme – and when he played the &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; theme for Hudson, it was agreed the new tune was unquestionably better. The &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&quot; melody still made it into the film: when the athletes reach Paris and enter the stadium, a brass band marches through the field, and first plays a modified, acoustic performance of the piece. Vangelis&#x27;s electronic &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&quot; track eventually was used prominently in the 1982 film &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot;.

Some pieces of Vangelis&#x27;s music in the film did not end up on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. One of them is the background music to the race Eric Liddell runs in the Scottish highlands. This piece is a version of &quot;Hymne&quot;, the original version of which appears on Vangelis&#x27;s 1979 album, &quot;Opéra sauvage&quot;. Various versions are also included on Vangelis&#x27;s compilation albums &quot;Themes&quot;, &quot;Portraits&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, though none of these include the version used in the film.

Five lively Gilbert and Sullivan tunes also appear in the soundtrack, and serve as jaunty period music which counterpoints Vangelis&#x27;s modern electronic score. These are: &quot;He is an Englishman&quot; from &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;Three Little Maids From School Are We&quot; from &quot;The Mikado&quot;, &quot;With Catlike Tread&quot; from &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, &quot;The Soldiers of Our Queen&quot; from &quot;Patience&quot;, and &quot;There Lived a King&quot; from &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;.

The film also incorporates a major traditional work: &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams. The words, written by William Blake in 1804–08, were set to music by Hubert Parry in 1916 as a celebration of England. This hymn has been described as &quot;England&#x27;s unofficial national anthem&quot;, concludes the film and inspired its title. A handful of other traditional anthems and hymns and period-appropriate instrumental ballroom-dance music round out the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

==Release==
The film was distributed by 20th Century-Fox and selected for the 1981 Royal Film Performance with its premiere on 30 March 1981 at the Odeon Haymarket before opening to the public the following day. It opened in Edinburgh on 4 April and in Oxford and Cambridge on 5 April with other openings in Manchester and Liverpool before expanding further in May into 20 additional London cinemas and 11 others nationally. It was shown in competition at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival on 20 May.

The film was distributed by The Ladd Company through Warner Bros. in North America and released on 25 September 1981 in Los Angeles, California and in the New York Film Festival, on 26 September 1981 in New York and on 9 April 1982 in the United States.

== Reception ==
Since its release, &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; has received generally positive reviews from critics. , the film holds an 84% rating from the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 117 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Decidedly slower and less limber than the Olympic runners at the center of its story, &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; nevertheless manages to make effectively stirring use of its spiritual and patriotic themes.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 78 out of 100 based on 19 critics&#x27; reviews.

For its 2012 re-release, Kate Muir of &quot;The Times&quot; gave the film five stars, writing: &quot;In a time when drug tests and synthetic fibres have replaced gumption and moral fibre, the tale of two runners competing against each other in the 1924 Olympics has a simple, undiminished power. From the opening scene of pale young men racing barefoot along the beach, full of hope and elation, backed by Vangelis&#x27;s now famous anthem, the film is utterly compelling.&quot;

In its first four weeks at the Odeon Haymarket it grossed £106,484. The film was the highest-grossing British film for the year with theatrical rentals of £1,859,480. Its gross of almost $59 million in the United States and Canada made it the highest-grossing film import into the US (i.e. a film without any US input) at the time, surpassing &quot;Meatballs&quot;″ $43 million.

The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Values&quot;.

In 2024, filmmaker Christopher Nolan cited it as one of his favorite films and as one of the sources of inspiration for his film &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017).

== Accolades ==
The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning four (including Best Picture). When accepting his Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, Colin Welland famously announced &quot;The British are coming&quot;. It was the first film released by Warner Bros. to win Best Picture since &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in 1964.

== Historical accuracy ==
&quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; is a film about achieving victory through self sacrifice and moral courage. While the producers&#x27; intent was to make a cinematic work that was historically authentic, the film was not intended to be historically accurate. Numerous liberties were taken with the actual historical chronology, the inclusion and exclusion of notable people, and the creation of fictional scenes for dramatic purpose, plot pacing and exposition.

=== Characters ===
The film depicts Abrahams as attending Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, with three other Olympic athletes: Henry Stallard, Aubrey Montague, and Lord Andrew Lindsay. However, whereas Abrahams and Stallard were indeed students there, Montague attended Oxford and not Cambridge. Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montague&#x27;s narration in the film.

The character of Lindsay was based partially on David Cecil (Lord Burghley), a significant figure in the history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based &quot;Lindsay&quot; as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle – this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses. Burghley was not willing to be involved in the film and the fictional character of Lindsay was created when Douglas Lowe, who was Britain&#x27;s third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, also declined.
Another scene in the film recreates the Great Court Run, in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was Lord Burghley, in 1927. In &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film&#x27;s release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.

In the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400-metre event of a Scotland–France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20-metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at Stoke-on-Trent in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day. Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to Sam Mussabini. This is alluded to: in the film, Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race.

Abrahams and Liddell did race against each other twice, but not as depicted in the film, which shows Liddell winning the final of the 100 yards against a shattered Abrahams at the 1923 AAA Championship at Stamford Bridge. In fact, they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards, which Liddell won, five yards ahead of Abrahams, who did not progress to the final. In the 100 yards, Abrahams was eliminated in the heats and did not race against Liddell, who won the finals of both races the next day. They also raced against each other in the 200 m final at the 1924 Olympics, and this was also not shown in the film.

Abrahams&#x27; fiancée is misidentified as Sybil Gordon, a soprano with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company. In fact, in 1936, Abrahams married Sybil Evers, who also performed with D&#x27;Oyly Carte, but they did not meet until 1934. Also, in the film, Sybil is depicted as singing the role of Yum-Yum in &quot;The Mikado&quot;, but neither Gordon nor Evers ever sang that role with D&#x27;Oyly Carte, although Evers was known for her charm in singing Peep-Bo, one of the two other &quot;little maids from school&quot;. Harold Abrahams&#x27; love of and heavy involvement with Gilbert and Sullivan, as depicted in the film, is factual.

Liddell&#x27;s sister was several years younger than she was portrayed in the film. Her disapproval of Liddell&#x27;s track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. Jenny Liddell Somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the Paris Church of Scotland during Liddell&#x27;s sermon.

At the memorial service for Harold Abrahams, which opens the film, Lord Lindsay mentions that he and Aubrey Montague are the only members of the 1924 Olympic team still alive. However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams&#x27; death.

=== Paris Olympics 1924 ===

In the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called &quot;Tom Watson&quot;; the real medallist was Arthur Porritt of New Zealand, who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty, and his wish was accepted by the film&#x27;s producers, even though his permission was not necessary. However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from the University of Oxford, substantially matches Porritt&#x27;s history. With the exception of Porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the Prince of Wales.

Jackson Scholz is depicted as handing Liddell an inspirational Bible-quotation message before the 400 metres final: &quot;It says in the Old Book, &#x27;He that honors me, I will honor.&#x27; Good luck.&quot; In reality, the note was from members of the British team, and was handed to Liddell before the race by his attending masseur at the team&#x27;s Paris hotel. For dramatic purposes, screenwriter Welland asked Scholz if he could be depicted handing the note, and Scholz readily agreed, saying &quot;Yes, great, as long as it makes me look good.&quot;

The events surrounding Liddell&#x27;s refusal to race on a Sunday were changed for dramatic purposes. In the film, he does not learn that the 100-metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance; Liddell did, however, face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, and was called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other grandees; his refusal to run made headlines around the world.

The decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which his times were modest by international standards. Liddell&#x27;s success in the Olympic 400m was thus largely unexpected.

The film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400-metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400-metre race for Liddell. In fact, Burghley, on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he went on to win a gold medal in the 400-metre hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.

The film reverses the order of Abrahams&#x27; 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the 200 metres but finished last, Jackson Scholz taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. During the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, a French newspaper clipping shows Scholz and Charley Paddock with a headline stating that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting &quot;beaten out of sight&quot; in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.

Eric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same finals race. While their meeting in the 1923 AAA Championship in the film was fictitious, Liddell&#x27;s record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder.

Abrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the 4 x 100 metres relay team, not shown in the film, and Aubrey Montague placed sixth in the steeplechase, as depicted.

== London Olympics&#x27; 2012 revival ==
&quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; became a recurring theme in promotions for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The film&#x27;s theme was featured at the opening of the 2012 London New Year&#x27;s fireworks celebrating the Olympics. The runners who first tested the new Olympic Park were spurred on by the &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; theme, and the music was also used as a fanfare for the carriers of the Olympic flame on parts of its route through the UK. The beach-running sequence was also recreated at St. Andrews and filmed as part of the Olympic torch relay.

The film&#x27;s theme was also performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Simon Rattle, during the Opening Ceremony of the games; the performance was accompanied by a comedy skit by Rowan Atkinson (as Mr. Bean) which included the opening beach-running footage from the film. The film&#x27;s theme was again played during each medal ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.

As an official part of the London 2012 Festival celebrations, a new digitally re-mastered version of the film screened in 150 cinemas throughout the UK. The re-release began 13 July 2012, two weeks before the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.

A Blu-ray of the film was released on 10 July 2012 in North America, and was released 16 July 2012 in the UK. The release includes nearly an hour of special features, a CD sampler, and a 32-page &quot;digibook&quot;.

=== Stage adaptation ===

A stage adaptation of &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; was mounted in honour of the 2012 Olympics. The play, &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, which was adapted by playwright Mike Bartlett and included the Vangelis score, ran from 9 May to 16 June 2012 at London&#x27;s Hampstead Theatre, and transferred to the Gielgud Theatre in the West End on 23 June, where it ran until 5 January 2013. It starred Jack Lowden as Eric Liddell and James McArdle as Harold Abrahams, and Edward Hall directed. Stage designer Miriam Buether transformed each theatre into an Olympic stadium, and composer Jason Carr wrote additional music. Vangelis also created several new pieces of music for the production.

The stage version for the London Olympic year was the idea of the film&#x27;s director, Hugh Hudson, who co-produced the play; he stated, &quot;Issues of faith, of refusal to compromise, standing up for one&#x27;s beliefs, achieving something for the sake of it, with passion, and not just for fame or financial gain, are even more vital today.&quot;

Another play, &quot;Running for Glory&quot;, written by Philip Dart, based on the 1924 Olympics, and focusing on Abrahams and Liddell, toured parts of Britain from 25 February to 1 April 2012. It starred Nicholas Jacobs as Harold Abrahams, and Tom Micklem as Eric Liddell.

<doc id="5734" wikidata="Q646102" url="?curid=5734" title="Consequentialism">
<text>In moral philosophy, consequentialism is a class of normative, teleological ethical theories that holds that the of one&#x27;s conduct are the ultimate basis for judgement about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (including omission from acting) is one that will produce a good outcome. Consequentialism, along with eudaimonism, falls under the broader category of teleological ethics, a group of views which claim that the moral value of any act consists in its tendency to produce things of intrinsic value. Consequentialists hold in general that an act is right &quot;if and only if&quot; the act (or in some views, the rule under which it falls) will produce, will probably produce, or is intended to produce, a greater balance of good over evil than any available alternative. Different consequentialist theories differ in how they define moral goods, with chief candidates including pleasure, the absence of pain, the satisfaction of one&#x27;s preferences, and broader notions of the &quot;general good&quot;.

Consequentialism is usually contrasted with deontological ethics (or &quot;deontology&quot;): deontology, in which rules and moral duty are central, derives the rightness or wrongness of one&#x27;s conduct from the character of the behaviour itself, rather than the outcomes of the conduct. It is also contrasted with both virtue ethics, which focuses on the character of the agent rather than on the nature or consequences of the act (or omission) itself, and pragmatic ethics, which treats morality like science: advancing collectively as a society over the course of many lifetimes, such that any moral criterion is subject to revision.

Some argue that consequentialist theories (such as utilitarianism) and deontological theories (such as Kantian ethics) are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, T. M. Scanlon advances the idea that human rights, which are commonly considered a &quot;deontological&quot; concept, can only be justified with reference to the consequences of having those rights. Similarly, Robert Nozick argued for a theory that is mostly consequentialist, but incorporates inviolable &quot;side-constraints&quot; which restrict the sort of actions agents are permitted to do. Derek Parfit argued that, in practice, when understood properly, rule consequentialism, Kantian deontology, and contractualism would all end up prescribing the same behavior.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;consequentialism&quot; was coined by G. E. M. Anscombe in her essay &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot; in 1958. However, the meaning of the word has changed over the time since Anscombe used it: in the sense she coined it, she had explicitly placed J.S. Mill in the nonconsequentialist and W.D. Ross in the consequentialist camp, whereas, in the contemporary sense of the word, they would be classified the other way round. This is due to changes in the meaning of the word, not due to changes in perceptions of W.D. Ross&#x27;s and J.S. Mill&#x27;s views.

==Classification==
One common view is to classify consequentialism, together with virtue ethics, under a broader label of &quot;teleological ethics&quot;. Proponents of teleological ethics (Greek: &quot;telos&quot;, &#x27;end, purpose&#x27; + &quot;logos&quot;, &#x27;science&#x27;) argue that the moral value of any act consists in its tendency to produce things of intrinsic value, meaning that an act is right &quot;if and only if&quot; it, or the rule under which it falls, produces, will probably produce, or is intended to produce, a greater balance of good over evil than any alternative act. This concept is exemplified by the famous aphorism, &quot;the end justifies the means,&quot; variously attributed to Machiavelli or Ovid i.e. if a goal is morally important enough, any method of achieving it is acceptable.

Teleological ethical theories are contrasted with deontological ethical theories, which hold that acts themselves are &quot;inherently&quot; good or bad, rather than good or bad because of extrinsic factors (such as the act&#x27;s consequences or the moral character of the person who acts).

==Forms of consequentialism==
===Utilitarianism===

In summary, Jeremy Bentham states that people are driven by their interests and their fears, but their interests take precedence over their fears; their interests are carried out in accordance with how people view the consequences that might be involved with their interests. &quot;Happiness&quot;, in this account, is defined as the maximization of pleasure and the minimization of pain. It can be argued that the existence of phenomenal consciousness and &quot;qualia&quot; is required for the experience of pleasure or pain to have an ethical significance.

Historically, &quot;hedonistic utilitarianism&quot; is the paradigmatic example of a consequentialist moral theory. This form of utilitarianism holds that what matters is to aggregate happiness; the happiness of everyone, and not the happiness of any particular person. John Stuart Mill, in his exposition of hedonistic utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures. However, some contemporary utilitarians, such as Peter Singer, are concerned with maximizing the satisfaction of preferences, hence &quot;preference utilitarianism&quot;. Other contemporary forms of utilitarianism mirror the forms of consequentialism outlined below.

===Rule consequentialism===

In general, consequentialist theories focus on actions. However, this need not be the case. Rule consequentialism is a theory that is sometimes seen as an attempt to reconcile consequentialism with deontology, or rules-based ethics—and in some cases, this is stated as a criticism of rule consequentialism. Like deontology, rule consequentialism holds that moral behavior involves following certain rules. However, rule consequentialism chooses rules based on the consequences that the selection of those rules has. Rule consequentialism exists in the forms of rule utilitarianism and rule egoism.

Various theorists are split as to whether the rules are the only determinant of moral behavior or not. For example, Robert Nozick held that a certain set of minimal rules, which he calls &quot;side-constraints,&quot; are necessary to ensure appropriate actions. There are also differences as to how absolute these moral rules are. Thus, while Nozick&#x27;s side-constraints are absolute restrictions on behavior, Amartya Sen proposes a theory that recognizes the importance of certain rules, but these rules are not absolute. That is, they may be violated if strict adherence to the rule would lead to much more undesirable consequences.

One of the most common objections to rule-consequentialism is that it is incoherent, because it is based on the consequentialist principle that what we should be concerned with is maximizing the good, but then it tells us not to act to maximize the good, but to follow rules (even in cases where we know that breaking the rule could produce better results).

In &quot;Ideal Code, Real World&quot;, Brad Hooker avoids this objection by not basing his form of rule-consequentialism on the ideal of maximizing the good. He writes:

[T]he best argument for rule-consequentialism is not that it derives from an overarching commitment to maximise the good. The best argument for rule-consequentialism is that it does a better job than its rivals of matching and tying together our moral convictions, as well as offering us help with our moral disagreements and uncertainties.

Derek Parfit described Hooker&#x27;s book as the &quot;best statement and defence, so far, of one of the most important moral theories.&quot;

===State consequentialism===

&quot;State consequentialism&quot;, also known as &quot;Mohist consequentialism&quot;, is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the welfare of a state. According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BCE, is the &quot;world&#x27;s earliest form of consequentialism, a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare.&quot;

Unlike utilitarianism, which views utility as the sole moral good, &quot;the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are...order, material wealth, and increase in population.&quot; The word &quot;order&quot; refers to Mozi&#x27;s stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability; &quot;material wealth&quot; of Mohist consequentialism refers to basic needs, like shelter and clothing; and &quot;increase in population&quot; relates to the time of Mozi, war and famine were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. In &quot;The Cambridge History of Ancient China&quot;, Stanford sinologist David Shepherd Nivison writes that the moral goods of Mohism &quot;are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth...if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically.&quot;

The Mohists believed that morality is based on &quot;promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven.&quot; In contrast to Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic or individualistic. The importance of outcomes that are good for the community outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain. The term &quot;state consequentialism&quot; has also been applied to the political philosophy of the Confucian philosopher Xunzi. On the other hand, &quot;legalist&quot; Han Fei &quot;is motivated almost totally from the ruler&#x27;s point of view.&quot;

===Ethical egoism===
Ethical egoism can be understood as a consequentialist theory according to which the consequences for the individual agent are taken to matter more than any other result. Thus, egoism will prescribe actions that may be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral to the welfare of others. Some, like Henry Sidgwick, argue that a certain degree of egoism &quot;promotes&quot; the general welfare of society for two reasons: because individuals know how to please themselves best, and because if everyone were an austere altruist then general welfare would inevitably decrease.

===Ethical altruism===

Ethical altruism can be seen as a consequentialist theory which prescribes that an individual take actions that have the best consequences for everyone, not necessarily including themselves (similar to selflessness). This was advocated by Auguste Comte, who coined the term &quot;altruism&quot;, and whose ethics can be summed up in the phrase &quot;Live for others.&quot;

===Two-level consequentialism===
The two-level approach involves engaging in critical reasoning and considering all the possible ramifications of one&#x27;s actions before making an ethical decision, but reverting to generally reliable moral rules when one is not in a position to stand back and examine the dilemma as a whole. In practice, this equates to adhering to rule consequentialism when one can only reason on an intuitive level, and to act consequentialism when in a position to stand back and reason on a more critical level.

This position can be described as a reconciliation between &quot;act consequentialism&quot;—in which the morality of an action is determined by that action&#x27;s effects—and &quot;rule consequentialism&quot;—in which moral behavior is derived from following rules that lead to positive outcomes.

The two-level approach to consequentialism is most often associated with R. M. Hare and Peter Singer.

===Motive consequentialism===
Another consequentialist application view is motive consequentialism, which looks at whether the state of affairs that results from the motive to choose an action is better or at least as good as each alternative state of affairs that would have resulted from alternative actions. This version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. An act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act was based on a right motive. A possible inference is that one can not be blamed for mistaken judgments if the motivation was to do good.

===Negative consequentialism===

Most consequentialist theories focus on &quot;promoting&quot; some sort of good consequences. However, negative utilitarianism lays out a consequentialist theory that focuses solely on minimizing bad consequences.

One major difference between these two approaches is the agent&#x27;s responsibility. &quot;Positive&quot; consequentialism demands that we bring about good states of affairs, whereas &quot;negative&quot; consequentialism requires that we avoid bad ones. Stronger versions of negative consequentialism will require active intervention to prevent bad and ameliorate existing harm. In weaker versions, simple forbearance from acts tending to harm others is sufficient. An example of this is the slippery-slope argument, which encourages others to avoid a specified act on the grounds that it may ultimately lead to undesirable consequences.

Often &quot;negative&quot; consequentialist theories assert that reducing suffering is more important than increasing pleasure. Karl Popper, for example, claimed that &quot;from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure.&quot; (While Popper is not a consequentialist per se, this is taken as a classic statement of negative utilitarianism.) When considering a theory of justice, negative consequentialists may use a statewide or global-reaching principle: the reduction of suffering (for the disadvantaged) is more valuable than increased pleasure (for the affluent or luxurious).

===Acts and omissions===
Since pure consequentialism holds that an action is to be judged solely by its result, most consequentialist theories hold that a deliberate action is no different from a deliberate decision not to act. This contrasts with the &quot;acts and omissions doctrine&quot;, which is upheld by some medical ethicists and some religions: it asserts there is a significant moral distinction between acts and deliberate non-actions which lead to the same outcome. This contrast is brought out in issues such as voluntary euthanasia.

=== Actualism and possibilism ===

The normative status of an action depends on its consequences according to consequentialism. The consequences of the actions of an agent may include other actions by this agent. Actualism and possibilism disagree on how later possible actions impact the normative status of the current action by the same agent. Actualists assert that it is only relevant what the agent &quot;would&quot; actually do later for assessing the value of an alternative. Possibilists, on the other hand, hold that we should also take into account what the agent &quot;could&quot; do, even if she would not do it.

For example, assume that Gifre has the choice between two alternatives, eating a cookie or not eating anything. Having eaten the first cookie, Gifre could stop eating cookies, which is the best alternative. But after having tasted one cookie, Gifre would freely decide to continue eating cookies until the whole bag is finished, which would result in a terrible stomach ache and would be the worst alternative. Not eating any cookies at all, on the other hand, would be the second-best alternative. Now the question is: should Gifre eat the first cookie or not? Actualists are only concerned with the actual consequences. According to them, Gifre should not eat any cookies at all since it is better than the alternative leading to a stomach ache. Possibilists, however, contend that the best possible course of action involves eating the first cookie and this is therefore what Gifre should do.

One counterintuitive consequence of actualism is that agents can avoid moral obligations simply by having an imperfect moral character. For example, a lazy person might justify rejecting a request to help a friend by arguing that, due to her lazy character, she would not have done the work anyway, even if she had accepted the request. By rejecting the offer right away, she managed at least not to waste anyone&#x27;s time. Actualists might even consider her behavior praiseworthy since she did what, according to actualism, she ought to have done. This seems to be a very easy way to &quot;get off the hook&quot; that is avoided by possibilism. But possibilism has to face the objection that in some cases it sanctions and even recommends what actually leads to the worst outcome.

Douglas W. Portmore has suggested that these and other problems of actualism and possibilism can be avoided by constraining what counts as a genuine alternative for the agent. On his view, it is a requirement that the agent has rational control over the event in question. For example, eating only one cookie and stopping afterward only is an option for Gifre if she has the rational capacity to repress her temptation to continue eating. If the temptation is irrepressible then this course of action is not considered to be an option and is therefore not relevant when assessing what the best alternative is. Portmore suggests that, given this adjustment, we should prefer a view very closely associated with &quot;possibilism&quot; called &quot;maximalism&quot;.

==Issues==

===Action guidance===
One important characteristic of many normative moral theories such as consequentialism is the ability to produce practical moral judgements. At the very least, any moral theory needs to define the standpoint from which the goodness of the consequences are to be determined. What is primarily at stake here is the &quot;responsibility&quot; of the agent.

====The ideal observer====
One common tactic among consequentialists, particularly those committed to an altruistic (selfless) account of consequentialism, is to employ an ideal, neutral observer from which moral judgements can be made. John Rawls, a critic of utilitarianism, argues that utilitarianism, in common with other forms of consequentialism, relies on the perspective of such an ideal observer. The particular characteristics of this ideal observer can vary from an omniscient observer, who would grasp all the consequences of any action, to an ideally informed observer, who knows as much as could reasonably be expected, but not necessarily all the circumstances or all the possible consequences. Consequentialist theories that adopt this paradigm hold that right action is the action that will bring about the best consequences from this ideal observer&#x27;s perspective.

====The real observer====
In practice, it is very difficult, and at times arguably impossible, to adopt the point of view of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know everything about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for agents to inform themselves as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.

===Consequences for whom===

Moral action always has consequences for certain people or things. Varieties of consequentialism can be differentiated by the beneficiary of the good consequences. That is, one might ask &quot;Consequences for whom?&quot;

====Agent-focused or agent-neutral====
A fundamental distinction can be drawn between theories which require that agents act for ends perhaps disconnected from their own interests and drives, and theories which permit that agents act for ends in which they have some personal interest or motivation. These are called &quot;agent-neutral&quot; and &quot;agent-focused&quot; theories respectively.

Agent-neutral consequentialism ignores the specific value a state of affairs has for any particular agent. Thus, in an agent-neutral theory, an actor&#x27;s personal goals do not count any more than anyone else&#x27;s goals in evaluating what action the actor should take. Agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent. Thus, in an agent-focused account, such as one that Peter Railton outlines, the agent might be concerned with the general welfare, but the agent is &quot;more&quot; concerned with the immediate welfare of herself and her friends and family.

These two approaches could be reconciled by acknowledging the tension between an agent&#x27;s interests as an individual and as a member of various groups, and seeking to somehow optimize among all of these interests. For example, it may be meaningful to speak of an action as being good for someone as an individual, but bad for them as a citizen of their town.

====Human-centered?====
Many consequentialist theories may seem primarily concerned with human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue that we should not limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. Jeremy Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that &#x27;non-human animals&#x27; should be a serious object of moral concern.

More recently, Peter Singer has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them. Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.

===Value of consequences===
One way to divide various consequentialisms is by the types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to utilitarianism, a good action is one that results in an increase in pleasure, and the best action is one that results in the most pleasure for the greatest number. Closely related is eudaimonic consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in material equality or political liberty instead of something like the more ephemeral &quot;pleasure&quot;. Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally. As the consequentialist approach contains an inherent assumption that the outcomes of a moral decision can be quantified in terms of &quot;goodness&quot; or &quot;badness,&quot; or at least put in order of increasing preference, it is an especially suited moral theory for a probabilistic and decision theoretical approach.

===Virtue ethics===
Consequentialism can also be contrasted with aretaic moral theories such as virtue ethics. Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be the primary focus of our thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists that it is the character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, Philippa Foot argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence.

However, consequentialism and virtue ethics need not be entirely antagonistic. Iain King has developed an approach that reconciles the two schools. Other consequentialists consider effects on the character of people involved in an action when assessing consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot&#x27;s lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.
===Ultimate end===
The &quot;ultimate end&quot; is a concept in the moral philosophy of Max Weber, in which individuals act in a faithful, rather than rational, manner.

==Criticisms==
G. E. M. Anscombe objects to the consequentialism of Sidgwick on the grounds that the moral worth of an action is premised on the predictive capabilities of the individual, relieving them of the responsibility for the &quot;badness&quot; of an act should they &quot;make out a case for not having foreseen&quot; negative consequences.

Immanuel Kant makes a similar argument against consequentialism in the case of the inquiring murder. The example asks whether or not it would be right to give false statement to an inquiring murderer in order to misdirect the individual away from the intended victim. He argues, in On a Supposed Right to Tell Lies from Benevolent Motives, that lying from &quot;benevolent motives,&quot; here the motive to maximize the good consequences by protecting the intended victim, should then make the liar responsible for the consequences of the act. For example, it could be that by misdirecting the inquiring murder away from where one thought the intended victim was actually directed the murder to the intended victim. That such an act is immoral mirrors Anscombe&#x27;s objection to Sidgwick that his consequentialism would problematically absolve the consequentalist of moral responsibility when the consequentalist fails to foresee the true consequences of an act.

The future amplification of the effects of small decisions is an important factor that makes it more difficult to predict the ethical value of consequences, even though most would agree that only predictable consequences are charged with a moral responsibility.
Bernard Williams has argued that consequentialism is alienating because it requires moral agents to put too much distance between themselves and their own projects and commitments. Williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents to take a strictly impersonal view of all actions, since it is only the consequences, and not who produces them, that are said to matter. Williams argues that this demands too much of moral agents—since (he claims) consequentialism demands that they be willing to sacrifice any and all personal projects and commitments in any given circumstance in order to pursue the most beneficent course of action possible. He argues further that consequentialism fails to make sense of intuitions that it can matter whether or not someone is personally the author of a particular consequence. For example, that participating in a crime can matter, even if the crime would have been committed anyway, or would even have been worse, without the agent&#x27;s participation.

Some consequentialists—most notably Peter Railton—have attempted to develop a form of consequentialism that acknowledges and avoids the objections raised by Williams. Railton argues that Williams&#x27;s criticisms can be avoided by adopting a form of consequentialism in which moral decisions are to be determined by the sort of life that they express. On his account, the agent should choose the sort of life that will, on the whole, produce the best overall effects.

<doc id="5735" wikidata="Q580750" url="?curid=5735" title="Conscription">
<text>Conscription, also known as the draft in American English, is the practice in which the compulsory enlistment in a national service, mainly a military service, is enforced by law. Conscription dates back to antiquity and it continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1 to 8 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.

Conscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including conscientious objection to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; sexism, in that historically men have been subject to the draft in the most cases; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country, and seeking asylum in another country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing alternative service outside combat-operations roles or even outside the military, such as (alternative civil service) in Finland and (compulsory community service) in Austria and Switzerland. Several countries conscript male soldiers not only for armed forces, but also for paramilitary agencies, which are dedicated to police-like &quot;domestic-only&quot; service like internal troops, border guards or &quot;non-combat&quot; rescue duties like civil defence.

As of 2023, many states no longer conscript their citizens, relying instead upon professional militaries with volunteers. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription still, therefore, reserve the power to resume conscription during wartime or times of crisis. States involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, and democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription. With a few exceptions, such as Singapore and Egypt, former British colonies are less likely to have conscription, as they are influenced by British anti-conscription norms that can be traced back to the English Civil War; the United Kingdom abolished conscription in 1960.

==History==

===In pre-modern times===

====Ilkum====
Around the reign of Hammurabi (1791–1750 BC), the Babylonian Empire used a system of conscription called &quot;Ilkum&quot;. Under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land. It is possible that this right was not to hold land &quot;per se&quot; but specific land supplied by the state.

Various forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the Code of Hammurabi, the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi.

===Medieval period===

====Medieval levies====

Under the feudal laws on the European continent, landowners in the medieval period enforced a system whereby all peasants, freemen commoners and noblemen aged 15 to 60 living in the countryside or in urban centers, were summoned for military duty when required by either the king or the local lord, bringing along the weapons and armor according to their wealth. These levies fought as footmen, sergeants, and men at arms under local superiors appointed by the king or the local lord such as the arrière-ban in France. Arrière-ban denoted a general levy, where all able-bodied males age 15 to 60 living in the Kingdom of France were summoned to go to war by the King (or the constable and the marshals). Men were summoned by the bailiff (or the sénéchal in the south). Bailiffs were military and political administrators installed by the King to steward and govern a specific area of a province following the king&#x27;s commands and orders. The men summoned in this way were then summoned by the lieutenant who was the King&#x27;s representative and military governor over an entire province comprising many bailiwicks, seneschalties and castellanies. All men from the richest noble to the poorest commoner were summoned under the arrière-ban and they were supposed to present themselves to the King or his officials.

In medieval Scandinavia the &quot;leiðangr&quot; (Old Norse), &quot;leidang&quot; (Norwegian), &quot;leding&quot;, (Danish), &quot;ledung&quot; (Swedish), &quot;lichting&quot; (Dutch), &quot;expeditio&quot; (Latin) or sometimes &quot;leþing&quot; (Old English), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.

The bulk of the Anglo-Saxon English army, called the &quot;fyrd&quot;, was composed of part-time English soldiers drawn from the freemen of each county. In the 690s laws of Ine of Wessex, three levels of fines are imposed on different social classes for neglecting military service.

Some modern writers claim military service in Europe was restricted to the landowning minor nobility. These thegns were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the &quot;fyrd&quot; as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a &quot;ridiculous fantasy&quot;:

The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or &quot;fyrd&quot; is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.
In feudal Japan the shogun decree of 1393 exempted money lenders from religious or military levies, in return for a yearly tax. The Ōnin War weakened the shogun and levies were imposed again on money lenders. This overlordism was arbitrary and unpredictable for commoners. While the money lenders were not poor, several overlords tapped them for income. Levies became necessary for the survival of the overlord, allowing the lord to impose taxes at will. These levies included &quot;tansen&quot; tax on agricultural land for ceremonial expenses. Y&quot;akubu takumai&quot; tax was raised on all land to rebuild the Ise Grand Shrine, and &quot;munabechisen&quot; tax was imposed on all houses. At the time, land in Kyoto was acquired by commoners through usury and in 1422 the shogun threatened to repossess the land of those commoners who failed to pay their levies.

==== Military slavery ====
The system of military slaves was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the creation of the corps of Turkic slave-soldiers (&quot;ghulams&quot; or &quot;mamluks&quot;) by the Abbasid caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim in the 820s and 830s. The Turkic troops soon came to dominate the government, establishing a pattern throughout the Islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the Mamluks of Egypt and the Janissary corps of the Ottoman Empire, institutions that survived until the early 19th century.

In the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan Murad I developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the &quot;Kapıkulu&quot;. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the &quot;devşirme&quot; (translated &quot;gathering&quot; or &quot;converting&quot;). The captive children were forced to convert to Islam. The Sultans had the young boys trained over several years. Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan&#x27;s personal service, and turned into the Janissaries, the elite branch of the &quot;Kapıkulu&quot;. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as Pargalı İbrahim Pasha and Sokollu Mehmet Paşa, were recruited in this way. By 1609, the Sultan&#x27;s &quot;Kapıkulu&quot; forces increased to about 100,000.

In later years, Sultans turned to the Barbary Pirates to supply their Jannissaries corps. Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan&#x27;s system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of Circassians in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies. As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. Mahmud II forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.

Similar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the Middle Ages. The Mamluks were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkic children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts. The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim caliphs and the Ayyubid sultans during the Middle Ages. The first mamluks served the Abbasid caliphs in 9th-century Baghdad. Over time they became a powerful military caste. On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling Egypt from 1250 to 1517.

From 1250 Egypt had been ruled by the Bahri dynasty of Kipchak origin. Slaves from the Caucasus served in the army and formed an elite corps of troops. They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the Burgi dynasty. The Mamluks&#x27; excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian Crusader fortresses in the Holy Land. The Mamluks were the most successful defence against the Mongol Ilkhanate of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.

On the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers. They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated. In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north. The Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail, called &quot;the Bloodthirsty&quot; (1672–1727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his Black Guard. He used them to coerce the country into submission.

===In modern times===
Modern conscription, the massed military enrollment of national citizens (), was devised during the French Revolution, to enable the Republic to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies. Deputy Jean-Baptiste Jourdan gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act, whose first article stated: &quot;Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation.&quot; It enabled the creation of the , what Napoleon Bonaparte called &quot;the nation in arms&quot;, which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands. More than 2.6 million men were inducted into the French military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813.

The defeat of the Prussian Army in particular shocked the Prussian establishment, which had believed it was invincible after the victories of Frederick the Great. The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced Napoleon&#x27;s forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. Scharnhorst advocated adopting the , the military conscription used by France. The was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.

In the Russian Empire, the military service time &quot;owed&quot; by serfs was 25 years at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1834 it was decreased to 20 years. The recruits were to be not younger than 17 and not older than 35. In 1874 Russia introduced universal conscription in the modern pattern, an innovation only made possible by the abolition of serfdom in 1861. New military law decreed that all male Russian subjects, when they reached the age of 20, were eligible to serve in the military for six years.

In the decades prior to World War I universal conscription along broadly Prussian lines became the norm for European armies, and those modeled on them. By 1914 the only substantial armies still completely dependent on voluntary enlistment were those of Britain and the United States. Some colonial powers such as France reserved their conscript armies for home service while maintaining professional units for overseas duties.

====World Wars====
The range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the World Wars.
In the United States, the Selective Service System drafted men for World War I initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45. In the case of a widespread mobilization of forces where service includes homefront defense, ages of conscripts may range much higher, with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility.

Expanded-age conscription was common during the Second World War: in Britain, it was commonly known as &quot;call-up&quot; and extended to age 51. Nazi Germany termed it (&quot;People&#x27;s Storm&quot;) and included boys as young as 16 and men as old as 60. During the Second World War, both Britain and the Soviet Union conscripted women. The United States was on the verge of drafting women into the Nurse Corps because it anticipated it would need the extra personnel for its planned invasion of Japan. However, the Japanese surrendered and the idea was abandoned.
During the Great Patriotic War, the Red Army conscripted nearly 30 million men.

==Arguments against conscription==
===Sexism===
Men&#x27;s rights activists, feminists, and opponents of discrimination against men have criticized military conscription, or compulsory military service, as sexist. The National Coalition for Men, a men&#x27;s rights group, sued the US Selective Service System in 2019, leading to it being declared unconstitutional by a US Federal Judge. The federal district judge&#x27;s opinion was unanimously overturned on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. In September 2021, the House of Representatives passed the annual Defense Authorization Act, which included an amendment that states that &quot;all Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 must register for selective service.&quot; This amendment omitted the word &quot;male&quot;, which would have extended a potential draft to women; however, the amendment was removed before the National Defense Authorization Act was passed.

Feminists have argued, first, that military conscription is sexist because wars serve the interests of what they view as the patriarchy; second, that the military is a sexist institution and that conscripts are therefore indoctrinated into sexism; and third, that conscription of men normalizes violence by men as socially acceptable. Feminists have been organizers and participants in resistance to conscription in several countries.

Conscription has also been criticized on the ground that, historically, only men have been subjected to conscription. Men who opt out or are deemed unfit for military service must often perform alternative service, such as Zivildienst in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, or pay extra taxes, whereas women do not have these obligations. In the US, men who do not register with the Selective Service cannot apply for citizenship, receive federal financial aid, grants or loans, be employed by the federal government, be admitted to public colleges or universities, or, in some states, obtain a driver&#x27;s license.

===Involuntary servitude===

Many American libertarians oppose conscription and call for the abolition of the Selective Service System, arguing that impressment of individuals into the armed forces amounts to involuntary servitude. For example, Ron Paul, a former U.S. Libertarian Party presidential nominee, has said that conscription &quot;is wrongly associated with patriotism, when it really represents slavery and involuntary servitude&quot;. The philosopher Ayn Rand opposed conscription, opining that &quot;of all the statist violations of individual rights in a mixed economy, the military draft is the worst. It is an abrogation of rights. It negates man&#x27;s fundamental right—the right to life—and establishes the fundamental principle of statism: that a man&#x27;s life belongs to the state, and the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in battle.&quot;

In 1917, a number of radicals and anarchists, including Emma Goldman, challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. However, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the case of &quot;Arver v. United States&quot; on 7 January 1918, on the ground that the Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war and to raise and support armies. The Court also relied on the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens. &quot;It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government in its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel.&quot;

===Economic===
It can be argued that in a cost-to-benefit ratio, conscription during peacetime is not worthwhile. Months or years of service performed by the most fit and capable subtract from the productivity of the economy; add to this the cost of training them, and in some countries paying them. Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident is required by law to register with the Selective Service System within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration.

According to Milton Friedman the cost of conscription can be related to the parable of the broken window in anti-draft arguments. The cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this is potentially more costly in a post-industrial society where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even more dire economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.

==Arguments for conscription==

===Political and moral motives===

Classical republicans promoted conscription as a tool for maintaining civilian control of the military, thereby preventing usurpation by a select class of warriors or mercenaries. Jean Jacques Rousseau argued vehemently against professional armies since he believed that it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society and that it was a mark of moral decline to leave the business to professionals. He based his belief upon the development of the Roman Republic, which came to an end at the same time as the Roman Army changed from a conscript to a professional force. Similarly, Aristotle linked the division of armed service among the populace intimately with the political order of the state. Niccolò Machiavelli argued strongly for conscription in &quot;The Prince&quot; and &quot;The Art of War&quot; and saw the professional armies, made up of mercenary units, as the cause of the failure of societal unity in Italy.

Other proponents, such as William James, consider both mandatory military and national service as ways of instilling maturity in young adults. Some proponents, such as Jonathan Alter and Mickey Kaus, support a draft in order to reinforce social equality, create social consciousness, break down class divisions and allow young adults to immerse themselves in public enterprise. This justification forms the basis of Israel&#x27;s People&#x27;s Army Model. Charles Rangel called for the reinstatement of the draft during the Iraq War not because he seriously expected it to be adopted but to stress how the socioeconomic restratification meant that very few children of upper-class Americans served in the all-volunteer American armed forces.
===Economic and resource efficiency===

It is estimated by the British military that in a professional military, a company deployed for active duty in peacekeeping corresponds to three inactive companies at home. Salaries for each are paid from the military budget. In contrast, volunteers from a trained reserve are in their civilian jobs when they are not deployed.

Under the total defense doctrine, conscription paired with periodic refresher training ensures that the entire able-bodied population of a country can be mobilized to defend against invasion or assist civil authorities during emergencies. For this reason, some European countries have reintroduced or debated reintroducing conscription during the onset of the Second Cold War.

Military Keynesians often argue for conscription as a job guarantee. For example, it was more financially beneficial for less-educated young Portuguese men born in 1967 to participate in conscription than to participate in the highly competitive job market with men of the same age who continued to higher education.

== Drafting of women ==


Throughout history, women have only been conscripted to join armed forces in a few countries, in contrast to the universal practice of conscription from among the male population. The traditional view has been that military service is a test of manhood and a rite of passage from boyhood into manhood. In recent years, this position has been challenged on the basis that it violates gender equality, and some countries, especially in Europe, have extended conscription obligations to women.

In 2006, eight countries (China, Eritrea, Israel, Libya, Malaysia, North Korea, Peru, and Taiwan) conscripted women into military service.

Norway introduced female conscription in 2015, making it the first NATO member to have a legally compulsory national service for both men and women, and the first country in the world to draft women on the same formal terms as men. In practice only motivated volunteers are selected to join the army in Norway.

Sweden introduced female conscription in 2010, but it was not activated until 2017. This made Sweden the second nation in Europe to draft women, and the second in the world (after Norway) to draft women on the same formal terms as men.

Denmark will extend conscription to women from 2027, also on a gender-neutral model.

Israel has universal female conscription, although it is possible to avoid service by claiming a religious exemption and over a third of Israeli women do so.

Finland introduced voluntary female conscription in 1995, giving women between the ages of 18 and 29 an option to complete their military service alongside men.

Sudanese law allows for conscription of women, but this is not implemented in practice.

In the United Kingdom during World War II, beginning in 1941, women were brought into the scope of conscription but, as all women with dependent children were exempt and many women were informally left in occupations such as nursing or teaching, the number conscripted was relatively few. Most women who were conscripted were sent to the factories, although some were part of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS), Women&#x27;s Land Army, and other women&#x27;s services. None were assigned to combat roles unless they volunteered. In contemporary United Kingdom, in July 2016, all exclusions on women serving in Ground Close Combat (GCC) roles were lifted.

In the Soviet Union, there was never conscription of women for the armed forces, but the severe disruption of normal life and the high proportion of civilians affected by World War II after the German invasion attracted many volunteers for &quot;The Great Patriotic War&quot;. Medical doctors of both sexes could and would be conscripted (as officers). Also, the Soviet university education system required Department of Chemistry students of both sexes to complete an ROTC course in NBC defense, and such female reservist officers could be conscripted in times of war. 

The United States came close to drafting women into the Nurse Corps in preparation for a planned invasion of Japan.

In 1981 in the United States, several men filed lawsuit in the case &quot;Rostker v. Goldberg&quot;, alleging that the Selective Service Act of 1948 violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by requiring that only men register with the Selective Service System (SSS). The Supreme Court eventually upheld the Act, stating that &quot;the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than &#x27;equity.&#x27;&quot; In 2013, Judge Gray H. Miller of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled that the Service&#x27;s men-only requirement was unconstitutional, as while at the time &quot;Rostker&quot; was decided, women were banned from serving in combat, the situation had since changed with the 2013 and 2015 restriction removals. Miller&#x27;s opinion was reversed by the Fifth Circuit, stating that only the Supreme Court could overturn the Supreme Court precedence from &quot;Rostker&quot;. The Supreme Court considered but declined to review the Fifth Circuit&#x27;s ruling in June 2021. In an opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Brett Kavanaugh, the three justices agreed that the male-only draft was likely unconstitutional given the changes in the military&#x27;s stance on the roles, but because Congress had been reviewing and evaluating legislation to eliminate its male-only draft requirement via the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service (NCMNPS) since 2016, it would have been inappropriate for the Court to act at that time.

On 1 October 1999, in Taiwan, the Judicial Yuan of the Republic of China in its Interpretation 490 considered that the physical differences between males and females and the derived role differentiation in their respective social functions and lives would not make drafting only males a violation of the Constitution of the Republic of China. Though women are not conscripted in Taiwan, transsexual persons are exempt.

In 2018, the Netherlands started including women in its draft registration system, although conscription is not currently enforced for either sex. France and Portugal, where conscription was abolished, extended their symbolic, mandatory day of information on the armed forces for young people - called Defence and Citizenship Day in France and Day of National Defence in Portugal – to women in 1997 and 2008, respectively; at the same time, the military registry of both countries and obligation of military service in case of war was extended to women.

==Conscientious objection==

A conscientious objector is an individual whose personal beliefs are incompatible with military service, or, more often, with any role in the armed forces. In some countries, conscientious objectors have special legal status, which augments their conscription duties. For example, Sweden allows conscientious objectors to choose a service in the weapons-free civil defense.

The reasons for refusing to serve in the military are varied. Some people are conscientious objectors for religious reasons. In particular, the members of the historic peace churches are pacifist by doctrine, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, while not strictly pacifists, refuse to participate in the armed forces on the ground that they believe that Christians should be neutral in international conflicts.

==By country==


=== Austria ===
Every male citizen of the Republic of Austria from the age of 17 up to 50, specialists up to 65 years is liable to military service. However, besides mobilization, conscription calls to a six-month long basic military training in the can be done up to the age of 35. For men refusing to undergo this training, a nine-month lasting community service is mandatory.

=== Belgium ===
Belgium abolished the conscription in 1994. The last conscripts left active service in February 1995. To this day (2019), a small minority of the Belgian citizens supports the idea of reintroducing military conscription, for both men and women.

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgaria had conscription for males above 18 until it was ended in 2008. Due to a shortfall in the army of some 5,500 soldiers, parts of the former ruling coalition have expressed their support for the return of conscription, most notably Krasimir Karakachanov. Opposition towards this idea from the main coalition partner, GERB, saw a compromise in 2018, where instead of conscription, Bulgaria could have possibly introduced a voluntary military service by 2019 where young citizens can volunteer for a period of 6 to 9 months, receiving a basic wage. However, this has not gone forward.

=== Cambodia ===
Since the signing of the Peace Accord in 1993, there has been no official conscription in Cambodia. Also the National Assembly has repeatedly rejected to reintroduce it due to popular resentment. However, in November 2006, it was reintroduced. Although mandatory for all males between the ages of 18 and 30 (with some sources stating up to age 35), less than 20% of those in the age group are recruited amidst a downsizing of the armed forces.

===Canada===

Compulsory service in a sedentary militia was practiced in Canada as early as 1669. In peacetime, compulsory service was typically limited to attending an annual muster, although the Canadian militia was mobilized for longer periods during wartime. Compulsory service in the sedentary militia continued until the early 1880s when Canada&#x27;s sedentary Reserve Militia system fell into disuse. The legislative provision that formally made every male inhabitant aged 16 to 60 member of the Reserve Militia was removed in 1904, replaced with provisions that made them theoretically &quot;liable to serve in the militia&quot;. 

Conscription into a full-time military service had only been instituted twice by the government of Canada, during both world wars. Conscription into the Canadian Expeditionary Force was practiced in the last year of the First World War in 1918. During the Second World War, conscription for home defence was introduced in 1940 and for overseas service in 1944. Conscription has not been practiced in Canada since the end of the Second World War in 1945.

=== China ===

Universal conscription in China dates back to the State of Qin, which eventually became the Qin Empire of 221 BC. Following unification, historical records show that a total of 300,000 conscript soldiers and 500,000 conscript labourers constructed the Great Wall of China. In the following dynasties, universal conscription was abolished and reintroduced on numerous occasions.

, universal military conscription is theoretically mandatory in China, and reinforced by law. However, due to the large population of China and large pool of candidates available for recruitment, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army has always had sufficient volunteers, so conscription has not been required in practice.

===Cuba===
=== Cyprus ===

Military service in Cyprus has a deep rooted history entangled with the Cyprus problem. Military service in the Cypriot National Guard is mandatory for all male citizens of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as any male non-citizens born of a parent of Greek Cypriot descent, lasting from the 1 January of the year in which they turn 18 years of age to 31 December, of the year in which they turn 50. All male residents of Cyprus who are of military age (16 and over) are required to obtain an exit visa from the Ministry of Defense. Currently, military conscription in Cyprus lasts up to 14 months.

=== Denmark ===

Conscription is known in Denmark since the Viking Age, where one man out of every 10 had to serve the king. Frederick IV of Denmark changed the law in 1710 to every 4th man. The men were chosen by the landowner and it was seen as a penalty.

Since 12 February 1849, every physically fit man must do military service. According to §81 in the Constitution of Denmark, which was promulgated in 1849: Every male person able to carry arms shall be liable with his person to contribute to the defence of his country under such rules as are laid down by Statute. — Constitution of DenmarkThe legislation about compulsory military service is articulated in the Danish Law of Conscription. National service takes 4–12 months. It is possible to postpone the duty when one is still in full-time education. Every male turning 18 will be drafted to the &#x27;Day of Defence&#x27;, where they will be introduced to the Danish military and their health will be tested. Physically unfit persons are not required to do military service. It is only compulsory for men, while women are free to choose to join the Danish army. Almost all of the men have been volunteers in recent years, 96.9% of the total number of recruits having been volunteers in the 2015 draft.

After lottery, one can become a conscientious objector. Total objection (refusal from alternative civilian service) results in up to 4 months jailtime according to the law. However, in 2014 a Danish man, who signed up for the service and objected later, got only 14 days of home arrest.

=== Eritrea ===
=== Estonia ===

Estonia adopted a policy of &quot;ajateenistus&quot; (literally &quot;time service&quot;) in late 1991, having inherited the concept from Soviet legislature. 
According to §124 of the 1992 constitution, &quot;Estonian citizens have a duty to participate in national defence on the bases and pursuant to a procedure provided by a law&quot;, which in practice means that men aged 18–27 are subject to the draft.

In the formative years, conscripts had to serve an 18-month term. An amendment passed in 1994 shortened this to 12 months. Further revisions in 2003 established an eleven-month term for draftees trained as NCOs and drivers, and an eight-month term for rank &amp; file. Under the current system, the yearly draft is divided into three &quot;waves&quot; - separate batches of eleven-month conscripts start their service in January and July while those selected for an eight-month term are brought in on October. An estimated 3200 people go through conscript service every year. 

From 2013, women have been able to voluntarily join the conscription under the same conditions as men, the only difference being the norms of the general fitness tests and a 90-day window during which women can leave the service. 

Conscripts serve in all branches of the Estonian Defence Forces except the air force which only relies on paid professionals due to its highly technical nature and security concerns. Historically, draftees could also be assigned to the border guard (before it switched to an all-volunteer model in 2000), a special rapid response unit of the police force (disbanded in 1997) or three militarized rescue companies within the Estonian Rescue Board (disbanded in 2004).

=== Finland ===

Conscription in Finland is part of a general compulsion for national military service for all adult males (; ) defined in the 127§ of the Constitution of Finland.

Conscription can take the form of military or of civilian service. According to 2021 data, 65% of Finnish males entered and finished the military service. The number of female volunteers to annually enter armed service had stabilised at approximately 300. The service period is 165, 255 or 347 days for the rank and file conscripts and 347 days for conscripts trained as NCOs or reserve officers. The length of civilian service is always twelve months. Those electing to serve unarmed in duties where unarmed service is possible serve either nine or twelve months, depending on their training.

Any Finnish male citizen who refuses to perform both military and civilian service faces a penalty of 173 days in prison, minus any served days. Such sentences are usually served fully in prison, with no parole. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are no longer exempted from service as of 27 February 2019. The inhabitants of demilitarized Åland are exempt from military service. By the Conscription Act of 1951, they are, however, required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard. However, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. The non-military service of Åland has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. The inhabitants of Åland can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. As of 1995, women are permitted to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers in the military after their initial voluntary military service.

The military service takes place in Finnish Defence Forces or in the Finnish Border Guard. All services of the Finnish Defence Forces train conscripts. However, the Border Guard trains conscripts only in land-based units, not in coast guard detachments or in the Border Guard Air Wing. Civilian service may take place in the Civilian Service Center in Lapinjärvi or in an accepted non-profit organization of educational, social or medical nature.

=== Germany ===
Between 1956 and 2011 conscription was mandatory for all male citizens in the German federal armed forces (), as well as for the Federal Border Guard () in the 1970s (see Border Guard Service). With the end of the Cold War the German government drastically reduced the size of its armed forces. The low demand for conscripts led to the suspension of compulsory conscription in 2011. Since then, only volunteer professionals serve in the .

=== Greece ===


Since 1914 Greece has been enforcing mandatory military service, currently lasting 12 months (but historically up to 36 months) for all adult men. Citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the reserve and are subject to periodic recalls of 1–10 days at irregular intervals.

Universal conscription was introduced in Greece during the military reforms of 1909, although various forms of selective conscription had been in place earlier. In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on 20 July 1974, due to the crisis in Cyprus (the mobilisation was formally ended on 18 December 2002).

The duration of military service has historically ranged between 9 and 36 months depending on various factors either particular to the conscript or the political situation in the Eastern Mediterranean. Although women are employed by the Greek army as officers and soldiers, they are not obliged to enlist. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided with medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.

Greece enforces conscription for all male citizens aged between 19 and 45. In August 2009, duration of the mandatory service was reduced from 12 months as it was before to 9 months for the army, but remained at 12 months for the navy and the air force. The number of conscripts allocated to the latter two has been greatly reduced aiming at full professionalization. Nevertheless, mandatory military service at the army was once again raised to 12 months in March 2021, unless served in units in Evros or the North Aegean islands where duration was kept at 9 months. Although full professionalization is under consideration, severe financial difficulties and mismanagement, including delays and reduced rates in the hiring of professional soldiers, as well as widespread abuse of the deferment process, has resulted in the postponement of such a plan.

=== Iran ===

In Iran, all men who reach the age of 18 must do about two years of compulsory military service in the IR police department or Iranian army or Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Before the 1979 revolution, women could serve in the military. However, after the establishment of the Islamic Republic, some Ayatollahs considered women&#x27;s military service to be disrespectful to women by the Pahlavi government and banned women&#x27;s military service in Iran. Therefore, Iranian women and girls were completely exempted from military service, which caused Iranian men and boys to oppose.

In Iran, men who refuse to go to military service are deprived of their citizenship rights, such as employment, health insurance, continuing their education at university, finding a job, going abroad, opening a bank account, etc. Iranian men have so far opposed mandatory military service and demanded that military service in Iran become a job like in other countries, but the Islamic Republic is opposed to this demand. Some Iranian military commanders consider the elimination of conscription or improving the condition of soldiers as a security issue and one of Ali Khamenei&#x27;s powers as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so they treat it with caution. In Iran, usually wealthy people are exempted from conscription. Some other men can be exempted from conscription due to their fathers serving in the Iran-Iraq war.

=== Israel ===
There is a mandatory military service for all men and women in Israel who are fit and 18 years old. Men must serve 32 months while women serve 24 months, with the vast majority of conscripts being Jewish.

Some Israeli citizens are exempt from mandatory service:
* Non-Jewish Arab citizens 
* Permanent residents (non-civilian) such as the Druze of the Golan Heights
* Male Ultra-Orthodox Jews can apply for deferment to study in Yeshiva and the deferment tends to become an exemption, although some do opt to serve in the military
* Female religious Jews, as long as they declare they are unable to serve due to religious grounds. Most of whom opt for the alternative of volunteering in the national service Sherut Leumi

All of the exempt above are eligible to volunteer to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), as long as they declare so.

Male Druze and male Circassian Israeli citizens are liable for conscription, in accordance with agreement set by their community leaders (their community leaders however signed a clause in which all female Druze and female Circassian are exempt from service).

A few male Bedouin Israeli citizens choose to enlist to the Israeli military in every draft (despite their Muslim-Arab background that exempt them from conscription).

=== Lithuania ===

Lithuania abolished its conscription in 2008. In May 2015, the Lithuanian parliament voted to reintroduce conscription and the conscripts started their training in August 2015. From 2015 to 2017 there were enough volunteers to avoid drafting civilians.

=== Luxembourg ===
Luxembourg practiced military conscription from 1948 until 1967.

=== Moldova ===
Moldova has a 12-month conscription for all males between 18 and 27 years. However, a citizen who completed a military training course at a military department is exempted from conscription.

=== Netherlands ===
Conscription, which was called &quot;Service Duty&quot; () in the Netherlands, was first employed in 1810 by French occupying forces. Napoleon&#x27;s brother Louis Bonaparte, who was King of Holland from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.

Later on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.

In the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-professional force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Since then, the Dutch army has become an all-professional force. However, to this day, every male and – from January 2020 onward – female citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which they are told that they have been registered but do not have to present themselves for service.

=== Norway ===

Conscription was constitutionally established the 12 April 1907 with &quot;Kongeriket Norges Grunnlov § 119.&quot;. 
, Norway currently employs a weak form of mandatory military service for men and women. In practice recruits are not forced to serve, instead only those who are motivated are selected. About 60,000 Norwegians are available for conscription every year, but only 8,000 to 10,000 are conscripted. Since 1985, women have been able to enlist for voluntary service as regular recruits. On 14 June 2013 the Norwegian Parliament voted to extend conscription to women, resulting in universal conscription in effect from 2015. This made Norway the first NATO member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both sexes. In earlier times, up until at least the early 2000s, all men aged 19–44 were subject to mandatory service, with good reasons required to avoid becoming drafted. There is a right of conscientious objection. As of 2020 Norway did not reach gender equity in conscription with only 33% of all conscripted being women.

In addition to the military service, the Norwegian government draft a total of 8,000 men and women between 18 and 55 to non-military Civil defence duty. (Not to be confused with Alternative civilian service.) Former service in the military does not exclude anyone from later being drafted to the Civil defence, but an upper limit of total 19 months of service applies. Neglecting mobilisation orders to training exercises and actual incidents, may impose fines.

===Russia===
The Russian Armed Forces draw personnel from various sources. In addition to conscripts, the 2022 Russian mobilization on account of the Russian invasion of Ukraine revealed Russian irregular units in Ukraine and Russian penal military units as sources of manpower. This adds to the BARS (Russia), the National Guard of Russia and the Russian volunteer battalions.

=== Serbia ===
, Serbia no longer practises mandatory military service. Prior to this, mandatory military service lasted 6 months for men. Conscientious objectors could however opt for 9 months of civil service instead.

On 15 December 2010, the Parliament of Serbia voted to suspend mandatory military service. The decision fully came into force on 1 January 2011.

In September 2024, Prime Minister Miloš Vučević announced that conscription will return in September 2025 with the mandatory military service lasting 75 days. Civil service will still be possible as an alternative.

=== Singapore ===
=== South Africa ===
There was mandatory military conscription for all white men in South Africa from 1968 until the end of apartheid in 1994. Under South African defense law, young white men had to undergo two years&#x27; continuous military training after they leave school, after which they had to serve 720 days in occasional military duty over the next 12 years. The End Conscription Campaign began in 1983 in opposition to the requirement. In the same year the National Party government announced plans to extend conscription to white immigrants in the country.

=== South Korea ===
=== Sweden ===

Sweden had conscription () for men between 1901 and 2010. During the last few decades it was selective. Since 1980, women have been allowed to sign up by choice, and, if passing the tests, do military training together with male conscripts. Since 1989 women have been allowed to serve in all military positions and units, including combat.

In 2010, conscription was made gender-neutral, meaning both women and men would be conscripted on equal terms. The conscription system was simultaneously deactivated in peacetime. Seven years later, referencing increased military threat, the Swedish Government reactivated military conscription. Beginning in 2018, both men and women are conscripted.

=== Taiwan ===

Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), maintains an active conscription system. All qualified male citizens of military age are now obligated to receive 4-month of military training. In December 2022, President Tsai Ing-wen led the government to announce the reinstatement of the mandatory 1-year active duty military service from January 2024.

=== United Kingdom ===

The United Kingdom introduced conscription to full-time military service for the first time in January 1916 (the eighteenth month of World War I) and abolished it in 1920. Ireland, then part of the United Kingdom, was exempted from the original 1916 military service legislation, and although further legislation in 1918 gave power for an extension of conscription to Ireland, the power was never put into effect.

Conscription was reintroduced in 1939, in the lead up to World War II, and continued in force until 1963. Northern Ireland was exempted from conscription legislation throughout the whole period.

In all, eight million men were conscripted during both World Wars, as well as several hundred thousand younger single women. The introduction of conscription in May 1939, before the war began, was partly due to pressure from the French, who emphasized the need for a large British army to oppose the Germans. From early 1942 unmarried women age 20–30 were conscripted (unmarried women who had dependent children aged 14 or younger, including those who had illegitimate children or were widows with children were excluded). Most women who were conscripted were sent to the factories, but they could volunteer for the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) and other women&#x27;s services. Some women served in the Women&#x27;s Land Army: initially volunteers but later conscription was introduced. However, women who were already working in a skilled job considered helpful to the war effort, such as a General Post Office telephonist, were told to continue working as before. None was assigned to combat roles unless she volunteered. By 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51. During the Second World War, 1.4 million British men volunteered for service and 3.2 million were conscripted. Conscripts comprised 50% of the Royal Air Force, 60% of the Royal Navy and 80% of the British Army.

The abolition of conscription in Britain was announced on 4 April 1957, by new prime minister Harold Macmillan, with the last conscripts being recruited three years later.

=== United States ===

Conscription in the United States ended in 1973, but males aged between 18 and 25 are required to register with the Selective Service System to enable a reintroduction of conscription if necessary. President Gerald Ford had suspended mandatory draft registration in 1975, but President Jimmy Carter reinstated that requirement when the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan five years later. Consequently, Selective Service registration is still required of almost all young men. There have been no prosecutions for violations of the draft registration law since 1986. Males between the ages of 17 and 45, and female members of the US National Guard may be conscripted for federal militia service pursuant to 10 U.S. Code § 246 and the Militia Clauses of the United States Constitution.

In February 2019, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled that male-only conscription registration breached the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s equal protection clause. In &quot;National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System&quot;, a case brought by a non-profit men&#x27;s rights organization the National Coalition for Men against the U.S. Selective Service System, judge Gray H. Miller issued a declaratory judgment that the male-only registration requirement is unconstitutional, though did not specify what action the government should take. That ruling was reversed by the Fifth Circuit. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision by the Court of Appeals.

<text>Catherine Grace &quot;Cady&quot; Coleman (born December 14, 1960) is an American chemist, engineer, former United States Air Force colonel, and retired NASA astronaut. She is a veteran of two Space Shuttle missions, and departed the International Space Station on May 23, 2011, as a crew member of Expedition 27 after logging 159 days in space.

== Education ==
Coleman graduated from Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School, Fairfax, Virginia, in 1978. In 1978–1979, she was an exchange student at Røyken Upper Secondary School in Norway with the AFS Intercultural Programs. She received a B.S. degree in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1983 and was commissioned as graduate of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (Air Force ROTC)., then received a Ph.D. degree in polymer science and engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1991. She was advised by Professor Thomas J. McCarthy on her doctorate. As an undergraduate, she was a member of the intercollegiate rowing crew and was a resident of Baker House.

== Military career ==
Coleman continued to pursue her PhD at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as a second lieutenant. In 1988, she entered active duty at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as a research chemist. During her work, she participated as a surface analysis consultant on the NASA Long Duration Exposure Facility experiment. In 1991, she received her doctorate in polymer science and engineering. She retired from the Air Force in November 2009 as a colonel.

== NASA career ==

Coleman was selected by NASA in 1992 to join the NASA Astronaut Corps. In 1995, she was a member of the STS-73 crew on the scientific mission USML-2 with experiments including biotechnology, combustion science, and the physics of fluids. STS-93 was Coleman&#x27;s second space flight in 1999. She was mission specialist in charge of deploying the Chandra X-ray Observatory and its Inertial Upper Stage out of the shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay.

Coleman served as Chief of Robotics for the Astronaut Office, to include robotic arm operations and training for all Space Shuttle and International Space Station missions. In October 2004, Coleman served as an aquanaut during the NEEMO 7 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for eleven days.

Coleman was assigned as a backup U.S. crew member for Expeditions 19, 20 and 21 and served as a backup crew member for Expeditions 24 and 25 as part of her training for Expedition 26.

Coleman launched on December 15, 2010 (December 16, 2010 Baikonur time), aboard Soyuz TMA-20 to join the Expedition 26 mission aboard the International Space Station. She retired from NASA on December 1, 2016.

=== Spaceflight experience ===
STS-73 on Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; (October 20 to November 5, 1995) was the second United States Microgravity Laboratory (USML-2) mission. The mission focused on materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, the physics of fluids, and numerous scientific experiments housed in the pressurized Spacelab module. In completing her first space flight, Coleman orbited the Earth 256 times, traveled over 6 million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, 52 minutes and 21 seconds in space.

STS-93 on &quot;Columbia&quot; (July 22 to 27, 1999) was a five-day mission during which Coleman was the lead mission specialist for the deployment of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Designed to conduct comprehensive studies of the universe, the telescope will enable scientists to study exotic phenomena such as exploding stars, quasars, and black holes. Mission duration was 118 hours and 50 minutes.

Soyuz TMA-20 / Expedition 26/27 (December 15, 2010, to May 23, 2011) was an extended duration mission to the International Space Station.

== Personal ==
Coleman is married to glass artist Josh Simpson who lives in Massachusetts. They have two sons. She is part of the band Bandella, which also includes fellow NASA astronaut Stephen Robinson, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, and Micki Pettit (wife of the astronaut Donald Pettit). Coleman is a flute player and has taken several flutes with her to the ISS, including a pennywhistle from Paddy Moloney of The Chieftains, an old Irish flute from Matt Molloy of The Chieftains, and a flute from Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull (band). On February 15, 2011, she played one of the instruments live from orbit on National Public Radio. 

On April 12, 2011, she played a duet with Ian Anderson to honour Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s 50th anniversary of his flight. She first recorded her part, which later on Anderson joined while on tour in Perm. 

On May 13 of that year, Coleman delivered a taped commencement address to the class of 2011 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

As do many other astronauts, Coleman holds an amateur radio license (callsign: KC5ZTH).

As of 2015, she is also known to be working as a guest speaker at the Baylor College of Medicine, for the children&#x27;s program &quot;Saturday Morning Science&quot;.

In 2018, she gave a graduation address to Carter Lynch, the sole graduate of Cuttyhunk Elementary School, on Cuttyhunk Island, Massachusetts.

In 2019 the Irish postal service An Post issued a set of commemorative stamps for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Moon landings, Catherine Coleman is featured alongside fellow astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Eileen Collins.

<text>The cervix (: cervices) or cervix uteri is a dynamic fibromuscular sexual organ of the female reproductive system that connects the vagina with the uterine cavity. The human female cervix has been documented anatomically since at least the time of Hippocrates, over 2,000 years ago. The cervix is approximately 4 cm long with a diameter of approximately 3 cm and tends to be described as a cylindrical shape, although the front and back walls of the cervix are contiguous. The size of the cervix changes throughout a woman&#x27;s life cycle. For example, women in the fertile years of their reproductive cycle tend to have larger cervixes than postmenopausal women; likewise, women who have produced offspring have a larger cervix than those who have not.

In relation to the vagina, the part of the cervix that opens to the uterus is called the &quot;internal os&quot; and the opening of the cervix in the vagina is called the &quot;external os&quot;. Between them is a conduit commonly called the cervical canal. The lower part of the cervix, known as the vaginal portion of the cervix (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina. The endocervix borders the uterus. The cervical canal has at least two types of epithelium (lining): the endocervical lining is glandular epithelium that lines the endocervix with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervical part of the conduit contains squamous epithelium. Squamous epithelium lines the conduit with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. These two linings converge at the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). This junction moves throughout a woman&#x27;s life.

Cervical infections with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, which can lead to cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding heterosexual sex, using penile condoms, and receiving the HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.

The cervical canal allows blood to flow from the uterus and through the vagina at menstruation, which occurs in the absence of pregnancy. 

Several methods of contraception aim to prevent fertilization by blocking this conduit, including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms, preventing sperm from passing through the cervix. Other approaches include methods that observe cervical mucus, such as the Creighton Model and Billings method. Cervical mucus&#x27;s consistency changes during menstrual periods, which may signal ovulation.

During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow the foetus to move down the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use the extent of cervical dilation to assist decision-making during childbirth.

== Structure ==
The cervix is part of the female reproductive system. Around in length, it is the lower narrower part of the uterus continuous above with the broader upper part—or body—of the uterus. The lower end of the cervix bulges through the anterior wall of the vagina, and is referred to as the vaginal portion of cervix (or ectocervix) while the rest of the cervix above the vagina is called the supravaginal portion of cervix. A central canal, known as the cervical canal, runs along its length and connects the cavity of the body of the uterus with the lumen of the vagina. The openings are known as the internal os and external orifice of the uterus (or external os), respectively. The mucosa lining the cervical canal is known as the endocervix, and the mucosa covering the ectocervix is known as the exocervix. The cervix has an inner mucosal layer, a thick layer of smooth muscle, and posteriorly the supravaginal portion has a serosal covering consisting of connective tissue and overlying peritoneum.

In front of the upper part of the cervix lies the bladder, separated from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over the sides of the cervix. To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs onto the back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. The cervix is more tightly connected to surrounding structures than the rest of the uterus.

The cervical canal varies greatly in length and width between women or over the course of a woman&#x27;s life, and it can measure 8 mm (0.3 inch) at its widest diameter in premenopausal adults. It is wider in the middle and narrower at each end. The anterior and posterior walls of the canal each have a vertical fold, from which ridges run diagonally upwards and laterally. These are known as &quot;palmate folds&quot;, due to their resemblance to a palm leaf. The anterior and posterior ridges are arranged in such a way that they interlock with each other and close the canal. They are often effaced after pregnancy.

The ectocervix (also known as the vaginal portion of the cervix) has a convex, elliptical shape and projects into the cervix between the anterior and posterior vaginal fornices. On the rounded part of the ectocervix is a small, depressed external opening, connecting the cervix with the vagina. The size and shape of the ectocervix and the external opening (external os) can vary according to age, hormonal state, and whether childbirth has taken place. In women who have not had a vaginal delivery, the external opening is small and circular, and in women who have had a vaginal delivery, it is slit-like. On average, the ectocervix is long and wide.

Blood is supplied to the cervix by the descending branch of the uterine artery and drains into the uterine vein. The pelvic splanchnic nerves, emerging as S2–S3, transmit the sensation of pain from the cervix to the brain. These nerves travel along the uterosacral ligaments, which pass from the uterus to the anterior sacrum.

Three channels facilitate lymphatic drainage from the cervix. The anterior and lateral cervix drains to nodes along the uterine arteries, travelling along the cardinal ligaments at the base of the broad ligament to the external iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes. The posterior and lateral cervix drains along the uterine arteries to the internal iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes, and the posterior section of the cervix drains to the obturator and presacral lymph nodes. However, there are variations as lymphatic drainage from the cervix travels to different sets of pelvic nodes in some people. This has implications in scanning nodes for involvement in cervical cancer.

After menstruation and directly under the influence of estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.

=== Development ===
As a component of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously, it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.

=== Histology ===

The endocervical mucosa is about thick and lined with a single layer of columnar mucous cells. It contains numerous tubular mucous glands, which empty viscous alkaline mucus into the lumen. In contrast, the ectocervix is covered with nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, which resembles the squamous epithelium lining the vagina. The junction between these two types of epithelia is called the squamocolumnar junction. Underlying both types of epithelium is a tough layer of collagen. The mucosa of the endocervix is not shed during menstruation. The cervix has more fibrous tissue, including collagen and elastin, than the rest of the uterus.

In prepubertal girls, the functional squamocolumnar junction is present just within the cervical canal. Upon entering puberty, due to hormonal influence, and during pregnancy, the columnar epithelium extends outward over the ectocervix as the cervix everts. Hence, this also causes the squamocolumnar junction to move outwards onto the vaginal portion of the cervix, where it is exposed to the acidic vaginal environment. The exposed columnar epithelium can undergo physiological metaplasia and change to tougher metaplastic squamous epithelium in days or weeks, which is very similar to the original squamous epithelium when mature. The new squamocolumnar junction is therefore internal to the original squamocolumnar junction, and the zone of unstable epithelium between the two junctions is called the &quot;transformation zone&quot; of the cervix. Histologically, the transformation zone is generally defined as surface squamous epithelium with surface columnar epithelium or stromal glands/crypts, or both.

After menopause, the uterine structures involute and the functional squamocolumnar junction moves into the cervical canal.

Nabothian cysts (or Nabothian follicles) form in the transformation zone where the lining of metaplastic epithelium has replaced mucous epithelium and caused a strangulation of the outlet of some of the mucous glands. A buildup of mucus in the glands forms Nabothian cysts, usually less than about in diameter, which are considered physiological rather than pathological. Both gland openings and Nabothian cysts are helpful to identify the transformation zone.

== Function ==
=== Fertility ===
The cervical canal is a pathway through which sperm enter the uterus after being induced by estradiol after penile-vaginal intercourse, and some forms of artificial insemination. Some sperm remains in cervical crypts, infoldings of the endocervix, which act as a reservoir, releasing sperm over several hours and maximising the chances of fertilisation. A theory states the cervical and uterine contractions during orgasm draw semen into the uterus. Although the &quot;upsuck theory&quot; has been generally accepted for some years, it has been disputed due to lack of evidence, small sample size, and methodological errors.

Some methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and the Billings method involve estimating a woman&#x27;s periods of fertility and infertility by observing physiological changes in her body. Among these changes are several involving the quality of her cervical mucus: the sensation it causes at the vulva, its elasticity (&quot;Spinnbarkeit&quot;), its transparency, and the presence of ferning.

=== Cervical mucus ===
Several hundred glands in the endocervix produce 20–60 mg of cervical mucus a day, increasing to 600 mg around the time of ovulation. It is viscous because it contains large proteins known as mucins. The viscosity and water content varies during the menstrual cycle; mucus is composed of around 93% water, reaching 98% at midcycle. These changes allow it to function either as a barrier or a transport medium to spermatozoa. It contains electrolytes such as calcium, sodium, and potassium; organic components such as glucose, amino acids, and soluble proteins; trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and selenium; free fatty acids; enzymes such as amylase; and prostaglandins. Its consistency is determined by the influence of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. At midcycle around the time of ovulation—a period of high estrogen levels— the mucus is thin and serous to allow sperm to enter the uterus and is more alkaline and hence more hospitable to sperm. It is also higher in electrolytes, which results in the &quot;ferning&quot; pattern that can be observed in drying mucus under low magnification; as the mucus dries, the salts crystallize, resembling the leaves of a fern. The mucus has a stretchy character described as &quot;Spinnbarkeit&quot; most prominent around the time of ovulation.

At other times in the cycle, the mucus is thick and more acidic due to the effects of progesterone. This &quot;infertile&quot; mucus acts as a barrier to keep sperm from entering the uterus. Women taking an oral contraceptive pill also have thick mucus from the effects of progesterone. Thick mucus also prevents pathogens from interfering with a nascent pregnancy.

A cervical mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides a protective seal for the uterus against the entry of pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during the first stage of childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.

=== Childbirth ===
The cervix plays a major role in childbirth. As the fetus descends within the uterus in preparation for birth, the presenting part, usually the head, rests on and is supported by the cervix. As labour progresses, the cervix becomes softer and shorter, begins to dilate, and withdraws to face the anterior of the body. The support the cervix provides to the fetal head starts to give way when the uterus begins its contractions. During childbirth, the cervix must dilate to a diameter of more than to accommodate the head of the fetus as it descends from the uterus to the vagina. In becoming wider, the cervix also becomes shorter, a phenomenon known as effacement.

Along with other factors, midwives and doctors use the extent of cervical dilation to assist decision making during childbirth. Generally, the active first stage of labour, when the uterine contractions become strong and regular, begins when the cervical dilation is more than . The second phase of labor begins when the cervix has dilated to , which is regarded as its fullest dilation, and is when active pushing and contractions push the baby along the birth canal leading to the birth of the baby. The number of past vaginal deliveries is a strong factor in influencing how rapidly the cervix is able to dilate in labour. The time taken for the cervix to dilate and efface is one factor used in reporting systems such as the Bishop score, used to recommend whether interventions such as a forceps delivery, induction, or Caesarean section should be used in childbirth.

Cervical incompetence is a condition in which shortening of the cervix due to dilation and thinning occurs, before term pregnancy. Short cervical length is the strongest predictor of preterm birth.

=== Contraception ===
Several methods of contraception involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted by a woman prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against the walls of the vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus, enhancing their effectiveness.

==Clinical significance==
===Cancer===

In 2008, cervical cancer was the third-most common cancer in women worldwide, with rates varying geographically from less than one to more than 50 cases per 100,000 women. It is a leading cause of cancer-related death in poor countries, where delayed diagnosis leading to poor outcomes is common. The introduction of routine screening has resulted in fewer cases of (and deaths from) cervical cancer, however this has mainly taken place in developed countries. Most developing countries have limited or no screening, and 85% of the global burden occurring there.

Cervical cancer nearly always involves human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a virus with numerous strains, several of which predispose to precancerous changes in the cervical epithelium, particularly in the transformation zone, which is the most common area for cervical cancer to start. HPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, by inoculating against the viral strains involved in cancer development.

Potentially precancerous changes in the cervix can be detected by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped from the surface of the cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the Pap test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.

An inexpensive, cost-effective and practical alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs in these regions can be difficult, due to the need for trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.

A result of dysplasia is usually further investigated, such as by taking a cone biopsy, which may also remove the cancerous lesion. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is a possible result of the biopsy and represents dysplastic changes that may eventually progress to invasive cancer. Most cases of cervical cancer are detected in this way, without having caused any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include vaginal bleeding, discharge, or discomfort.

===Inflammation===

Inflammation of the cervix is referred to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.

===Anatomical abnormalities===
Cervical stenosis is an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated with the development of cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance, which is the condition wherein, as the name suggests, the cervix of the uterus is shaped like a cockscomb. About one third of women born to diethylstilbestrol-treated mothers (i.e. in-utero exposure) develop a cockscomb cervix.

Enlarged folds or ridges of cervical stroma (fibrous tissues) and epithelium constitute a cockscomb cervix. Similarly, cockscomb polyps lining the cervix are usually considered or grouped into the same overarching description. It is in and of itself considered a benign abnormality; its presence, however is usually indicative of DES exposure, and as such women who experience these abnormalities should be aware of their increased risk of associated pathologies.

Cervical agenesis is a rare congenital condition in which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the vagina to develop. Other congenital cervical abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of the vagina and uterus. The cervix may be duplicated in situations such as bicornuate uterus and uterine didelphys.

Cervical polyps, which are benign overgrowths of endocervical tissue, if present, may cause bleeding, or a benign overgrowth may be present in the cervical canal. Cervical ectropion refers to the horizontal overgrowth of the endocervical columnar lining in a one-cell-thick layer over the ectocervix.

==Animals==
Female marsupials have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal species have a single cervix and a single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family Myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they are thought to have lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage. In domestic pigs, the cervix contains a series of five interdigitating pads that hold the boar&#x27;s corkscrew-shaped penis during copulation.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;cervix&quot; () came to English from the Latin &quot;cervīx&quot;, where it means &quot;neck&quot;, and like its Germanic counterpart, it can refer not only to the neck [of the body] but also to an analogous narrowed part of an object. The cervix uteri (neck of the uterus) is thus the uterine cervix, but in English the word &quot;cervix&quot; used alone usually refers to it. Thus the adjective &quot;cervical&quot; may refer either to the neck (as in &quot;cervical vertebrae&quot; or &quot;cervical lymph nodes&quot;) or to the uterine cervix (as in &quot;cervical cap&quot; or &quot;cervical cancer&quot;).

Latin &quot;cervix&quot; came from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;ker-&quot;, referring to a &quot;structure that projects&quot;. Thus, the word cervix is linguistically related to the English word &quot;&quot;, the Persian word for &quot;head&quot; ( &quot;sar&quot;), the Greek word for &quot;head&quot; ( &quot;koruphe&quot;), and the Welsh and Romanian words for &quot;deer&quot; (, Romanian: &quot;cerb&quot;).

The cervix was documented in anatomical literature in at least the time of Hippocrates; cervical cancer was first described more than 2,000 years ago, with descriptions provided by both Hippocrates and Aretaeus. However, there was some variation in word sense among early writers, who used the term to refer to both the cervix and the internal uterine orifice. The first attested use of the word to refer to the cervix of the uterus was in 1702.

<text>In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the &quot;source&quot; language) into another language (the &quot;target&quot; language). The name &quot;compiler&quot; is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a low-level programming language (e.g. assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.

There are many different types of compilers which produce output in different useful forms. A &quot;cross-compiler&quot; produces code for a different CPU or operating system than the one on which the cross-compiler itself runs. A &quot;bootstrap compiler&quot; is often a temporary compiler, used for compiling a more permanent or better optimised compiler for a language.

Related software include &quot;decompilers&quot;, programs that translate from low-level languages to higher level ones; programs that translate between high-level languages, usually called &quot;source-to-source compilers&quot; or &quot;transpilers&quot;; language &quot;rewriters&quot;, usually programs that translate the form of expressions without a change of language; and &quot;compiler-compilers&quot;, compilers that produce compilers (or parts of them), often in a generic and reusable way so as to be able to produce many differing compilers.

A compiler is likely to perform some or all of the following operations, often called phases: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and machine specific code generation. Compilers generally implement these phases as modular components, promoting efficient design and correctness of transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.

==Comparison with interpreter==

With respect to making source code runnable, an interpreter provides a similar function as a compiler, but via a different mechanism. An interpreter executes code without converting it to machine code. Some interpreters execute source code while others execute an intermediate form such as bytecode.

A program compiled to native code tends to run faster than if interpreted. Environments with a bytecode intermediate form tend toward intermediate speed. Just-in-time compilation allows for native execution speed with a one-time startup processing time cost.

Low-level programming languages, such as assembly and C, are typically compiled, especially when speed is a significant concern, rather than cross-platform support. For such languages, there are more one-to-one correspondences between the source code and the resulting machine code, making it easier for programmers to control the use of hardware.

In theory, a programming language can be used via either a compiler or an interpreter, but in practice, each language tends to be used with only one or the other. None-the-less, it is possible to write a compiler for a languages that is commonly interpreted. For example, Common Lisp can be compiled to Java bytecode (then interpreted by the Java virtual machine), C code (then compiled to native machine code), or directly to native code.

== History ==
Theoretical computing concepts developed by scientists, mathematicians, and engineers formed the basis of digital modern computing development during World War II. Primitive binary languages evolved because digital devices only understand ones and zeros and the circuit patterns in the underlying machine architecture. In the late 1940s, assembly languages were created to offer a more workable abstraction of the computer architectures. Limited memory capacity of early computers led to substantial technical challenges when the first compilers were designed. Therefore, the compilation process needed to be divided into several small programs. The front end programs produce the analysis products used by the back end programs to generate target code. As computer technology provided more resources, compiler designs could align better with the compilation process.

It is usually more productive for a programmer to use a high-level language, so the development of high-level languages followed naturally from the capabilities offered by digital computers. High-level languages are formal languages that are strictly defined by their syntax and semantics which form the high-level language architecture. Elements of these formal languages include:
* &quot;Alphabet&quot;, any finite set of symbols;
* &quot;String&quot;, a finite sequence of symbols;
* &quot;Language&quot;, any set of strings on an alphabet.

The sentences in a language may be defined by a set of rules called a grammar.

Backus–Naur form (BNF) describes the syntax of &quot;sentences&quot; of a language. It was developed by John Backus and used for the syntax of Algol 60. The ideas derive from the context-free grammar concepts by linguist Noam Chomsky. &quot;BNF and its extensions have become standard tools for describing the syntax of programming notations. In many cases, parts of compilers are generated automatically from a BNF description.&quot;

Between 1942 and 1945, Konrad Zuse designed the first (algorithmic) programming language for computers called (&quot;Plan Calculus&quot;). Zuse also envisioned a (&quot;Plan assembly device&quot;) to automatically translate the mathematical formulation of a program into machine-readable punched film stock. While no actual implementation occurred until the 1970s, it presented concepts later seen in APL designed by Ken Iverson in the late 1950s. APL is a language for mathematical computations.

Between 1949 and 1951, Heinz Rutishauser proposed Superplan, a high-level language and automatic translator. His ideas were later refined by Friedrich L. Bauer and Klaus Samelson.

High-level language design during the formative years of digital computing provided useful programming tools for a variety of applications:
* FORTRAN (Formula Translation) for engineering and science applications is considered to be one of the first actually implemented high-level languages and first optimizing compiler.
* COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) evolved from A-0 and FLOW-MATIC to become the dominant high-level language for business applications.
* LISP (List Processor) for symbolic computation.

Compiler technology evolved from the need for a strictly defined transformation of the high-level source program into a low-level target program for the digital computer. The compiler could be viewed as a front end to deal with the analysis of the source code and a back end to synthesize the analysis into the target code. Optimization between the front end and back end could produce more efficient target code.

Some early milestones in the development of compiler technology:
* &quot;May 1952&quot;: Grace Hopper&#x27;s team at Remington Rand wrote the compiler for the A-0 programming language (and coined the term &quot;compiler&quot; to describe it), although the A-0 compiler functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a full compiler. 
* &quot;1952, before September&quot;: An Autocode compiler developed by Alick Glennie for the Manchester Mark I computer at the University of Manchester is considered by some to be the first compiled programming language.
* &quot;1954–1957&quot;: A team led by John Backus at IBM developed FORTRAN which is usually considered the first high-level language. In 1957, they completed a FORTRAN compiler that is generally credited as having introduced the first unambiguously complete compiler.
* &quot;1959&quot;: The Conference on Data Systems Language (CODASYL) initiated development of COBOL. The COBOL design drew on A-0 and FLOW-MATIC. By the early 1960s COBOL was compiled on multiple architectures.
* &quot;1958–1960&quot;: Algol 58 was the precursor to ALGOL 60. It introduced code blocks, a key advance in the rise of structured programming. ALGOL 60 was the first language to implement nested function definitions with lexical scope. It included recursion. Its syntax was defined using BNF. ALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. Tony Hoare remarked: &quot;... it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors.&quot;
* &quot;1958–1962&quot;: John McCarthy at MIT designed LISP. The symbol processing capabilities provided useful features for artificial intelligence research. In 1962, LISP 1.5 release noted some tools: an interpreter written by Stephen Russell and Daniel J. Edwards, a compiler and assembler written by Tim Hart and Mike Levin.

Early operating systems and software were written in assembly language. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the use of high-level languages for system programming was still controversial due to resource limitations. However, several research and industry efforts began the shift toward high-level systems programming languages, for example, BCPL, BLISS, B, and C.

BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language) designed in 1966 by Martin Richards at the University of Cambridge was originally developed as a compiler writing tool. Several compilers have been implemented, Richards&#x27; book provides insights to the language and its compiler. BCPL was not only an influential systems programming language that is still used in research but also provided a basis for the design of B and C languages.

BLISS (Basic Language for Implementation of System Software) was developed for a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-10 computer by W. A. Wulf&#x27;s Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) research team. The CMU team went on to develop BLISS-11 compiler one year later in 1970.

Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service), a time-sharing operating system project, involved MIT, Bell Labs, General Electric (later Honeywell) and was led by Fernando Corbató from MIT. Multics was written in the PL/I language developed by IBM and IBM User Group. IBM&#x27;s goal was to satisfy business, scientific, and systems programming requirements. There were other languages that could have been considered but PL/I offered the most complete solution even though it had not been implemented. For the first few years of the Multics project, a subset of the language could be compiled to assembly language with the Early PL/I (EPL) compiler by Doug McIlory and Bob Morris from Bell Labs. EPL supported the project until a boot-strapping compiler for the full PL/I could be developed.

Bell Labs left the Multics project in 1969, and developed a system programming language B based on BCPL concepts, written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. Ritchie created a boot-strapping compiler for B and wrote Unics (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service) operating system for a PDP-7 in B. Unics eventually became spelled Unix.

Bell Labs started the development and expansion of C based on B and BCPL. The BCPL compiler had been transported to Multics by Bell Labs and BCPL was a preferred language at Bell Labs. Initially, a front-end program to Bell Labs&#x27; B compiler was used while a C compiler was developed. In 1971, a new PDP-11 provided the resource to define extensions to B and rewrite the compiler. By 1973 the design of C language was essentially complete and the Unix kernel for a PDP-11 was rewritten in C. Steve Johnson started development of Portable C Compiler (PCC) to support retargeting of C compilers to new machines.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) offered some interesting possibilities for application development and maintenance. OOP concepts go further back but were part of LISP and Simula language science. Bell Labs became interested in OOP with the development of C++. C++ was first used in 1980 for systems programming. The initial design leveraged C language systems programming capabilities with Simula concepts. Object-oriented facilities were added in 1983. The Cfront program implemented a C++ front-end for C84 language compiler. In subsequent years several C++ compilers were developed as C++ popularity grew.

In many application domains, the idea of using a higher-level language quickly caught on. Because of the expanding functionality supported by newer programming languages and the increasing complexity of computer architectures, compilers became more complex.

DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) sponsored a compiler project with Wulf&#x27;s CMU research team in 1970. The Production Quality Compiler-Compiler PQCC design would produce a Production Quality Compiler (PQC) from formal definitions of source language and the target. PQCC tried to extend the term compiler-compiler beyond the traditional meaning as a parser generator (e.g., Yacc) without much success. PQCC might more properly be referred to as a compiler generator.

PQCC research into code generation process sought to build a truly automatic compiler-writing system. The effort discovered and designed the phase structure of the PQC. The BLISS-11 compiler provided the initial structure. The phases included analyses (front end), intermediate translation to virtual machine (middle end), and translation to the target (back end). TCOL was developed for the PQCC research to handle language specific constructs in the intermediate representation. Variations of TCOL supported various languages. The PQCC project investigated techniques of automated compiler construction. The design concepts proved useful in optimizing compilers and compilers for the (since 1995, object-oriented) programming language Ada.

The Ada &quot;STONEMAN&quot; document formalized the program support environment (APSE) along with the kernel (KAPSE) and minimal (MAPSE). An Ada interpreter NYU/ED supported development and standardization efforts with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO). Initial Ada compiler development by the U.S. Military Services included the compilers in a complete integrated design environment along the lines of the &quot;STONEMAN&quot; document. Army and Navy worked on the Ada Language System (ALS) project targeted to DEC/VAX architecture while the Air Force started on the Ada Integrated Environment (AIE) targeted to IBM 370 series. While the projects did not provide the desired results, they did contribute to the overall effort on Ada development.

Other Ada compiler efforts got underway in Britain at the University of York and in Germany at the University of Karlsruhe. In the U. S., Verdix (later acquired by Rational) delivered the Verdix Ada Development System (VADS) to the Army. VADS provided a set of development tools including a compiler. Unix/VADS could be hosted on a variety of Unix platforms such as DEC Ultrix and the Sun 3/60 Solaris targeted to Motorola 68020 in an Army CECOM evaluation. There were soon many Ada compilers available that passed the Ada Validation tests. The Free Software Foundation GNU project developed the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) which provides a core capability to support multiple languages and targets. The Ada version GNAT is one of the most widely used Ada compilers. GNAT is free but there is also commercial support, for example, AdaCore, was founded in 1994 to provide commercial software solutions for Ada. GNAT Pro includes the GNU GCC based GNAT with a tool suite to provide an integrated development environment.

High-level languages continued to drive compiler research and development. Focus areas included optimization and automatic code generation. Trends in programming languages and development environments influenced compiler technology. More compilers became included in language distributions (PERL, Java Development Kit) and as a component of an IDE (VADS, Eclipse, Ada Pro). The interrelationship and interdependence of technologies grew. The advent of web services promoted growth of web languages and scripting languages. Scripts trace back to the early days of Command Line Interfaces (CLI) where the user could enter commands to be executed by the system. User Shell concepts developed with languages to write shell programs. Early Windows designs offered a simple batch programming capability. The conventional transformation of these language used an interpreter. While not widely used, Bash and Batch compilers have been written. More recently sophisticated interpreted languages became part of the developers tool kit. Modern scripting languages include PHP, Python, Ruby and Lua. (Lua is widely used in game development.) All of these have interpreter and compiler support.

&quot;When the field of compiling began in the late 50s, its focus was limited to the translation of high-level language programs into machine code ... The compiler field is increasingly intertwined with other disciplines including computer architecture, programming languages, formal methods, software engineering, and computer security.&quot; The &quot;Compiler Research: The Next 50 Years&quot; article noted the importance of object-oriented languages and Java. Security and parallel computing were cited among the future research targets.

== Compiler construction ==

A compiler implements a formal transformation from a high-level source program to a low-level target program. Compiler design can define an end-to-end solution or tackle a defined subset that interfaces with other compilation tools e.g. preprocessors, assemblers, linkers. Design requirements include rigorously defined interfaces both internally between compiler components and externally between supporting toolsets.

In the early days, the approach taken to compiler design was directly affected by the complexity of the computer language to be processed, the experience of the person(s) designing it, and the resources available. Resource limitations led to the need to pass through the source code more than once.

A compiler for a relatively simple language written by one person might be a single, monolithic piece of software. However, as the source language grows in complexity the design may be split into a number of interdependent phases. Separate phases provide design improvements that focus development on the functions in the compilation process.

=== One-pass vis-à-vis multi-pass compilers ===
Classifying compilers by number of passes has its background in the hardware resource limitations of computers. Compiling involves performing much work and early computers did not have enough memory to contain one program that did all of this work. As a result, compilers were split up into smaller programs which each made a pass over the source (or some representation of it) performing some of the required analysis and translations.

The ability to compile in a single pass has classically been seen as a benefit because it simplifies the job of writing a compiler and one-pass compilers generally perform compilations faster than multi-pass compilers. Thus, partly driven by the resource limitations of early systems, many early languages were specifically designed so that they could be compiled in a single pass (e.g., Pascal).

In some cases, the design of a language feature may require a compiler to perform more than one pass over the source. For instance, consider a declaration appearing on line 20 of the source which affects the translation of a statement appearing on line 10. In this case, the first pass needs to gather information about declarations appearing after statements that they affect, with the actual translation happening during a subsequent pass.

The disadvantage of compiling in a single pass is that it is not possible to perform many of the sophisticated optimizations needed to generate high quality code. It can be difficult to count exactly how many passes an optimizing compiler makes. For instance, different phases of optimization may analyse one expression many times but only analyse another expression once.

Splitting a compiler up into small programs is a technique used by researchers interested in producing provably correct compilers. Proving the correctness of a set of small programs often requires less effort than proving the correctness of a larger, single, equivalent program.

=== Three-stage compiler structure ===

Regardless of the exact number of phases in the compiler design, the phases can be assigned to one of three stages. The stages include a front end, a middle end, and a back end.
* The &quot;front end&quot; scans the input and verifies syntax and semantics according to a specific source language. For statically typed languages it performs type checking by collecting type information. If the input program is syntactically incorrect or has a type error, it generates error and/or warning messages, usually identifying the location in the source code where the problem was detected; in some cases the actual error may be (much) earlier in the program. Aspects of the front end include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. The front end transforms the input program into an intermediate representation (IR) for further processing by the middle end. This IR is usually a lower-level representation of the program with respect to the source code.
* The &quot;middle end&quot; performs optimizations on the IR that are independent of the CPU architecture being targeted. This source code/machine code independence is intended to enable generic optimizations to be shared between versions of the compiler supporting different languages and target processors. Examples of middle end optimizations are removal of useless (dead-code elimination) or unreachable code (reachability analysis), discovery and propagation of constant values (constant propagation), relocation of computation to a less frequently executed place (e.g., out of a loop), or specialization of computation based on the context, eventually producing the &quot;optimized&quot; IR that is used by the back end.
* The &quot;back end&quot; takes the optimized IR from the middle end. It may perform more analysis, transformations and optimizations that are specific for the target CPU architecture. The back end generates the target-dependent assembly code, performing register allocation in the process. The back end performs instruction scheduling, which re-orders instructions to keep parallel execution units busy by filling delay slots. Although most optimization problems are NP-hard, heuristic techniques for solving them are well-developed and implemented in production-quality compilers. Typically the output of a back end is machine code specialized for a particular processor and operating system.

This front/middle/back-end approach makes it possible to combine front ends for different languages with back ends for different CPUs while sharing the optimizations of the middle end. Practical examples of this approach are the GNU Compiler Collection, Clang (LLVM-based C/C++ compiler), and the Amsterdam Compiler Kit, which have multiple front-ends, shared optimizations and multiple back-ends.

==== Front end ====
The front end analyzes the source code to build an internal representation of the program, called the intermediate representation (IR). It also manages the symbol table, a data structure mapping each symbol in the source code to associated information such as location, type and scope.

While the frontend can be a single monolithic function or program, as in a scannerless parser, it was traditionally implemented and analyzed as several phases, which may execute sequentially or concurrently. This method is favored due to its modularity and separation of concerns. Most commonly, the frontend is broken into three phases: lexical analysis (also known as lexing or scanning), syntax analysis (also known as scanning or parsing), and semantic analysis. Lexing and parsing comprise the syntactic analysis (word syntax and phrase syntax, respectively), and in simple cases, these modules (the lexer and parser) can be automatically generated from a grammar for the language, though in more complex cases these require manual modification. The lexical grammar and phrase grammar are usually context-free grammars, which simplifies analysis significantly, with context-sensitivity handled at the semantic analysis phase. The semantic analysis phase is generally more complex and written by hand, but can be partially or fully automated using attribute grammars. These phases themselves can be further broken down: lexing as scanning and evaluating, and parsing as building a concrete syntax tree (CST, parse tree) and then transforming it into an abstract syntax tree (AST, syntax tree). In some cases additional phases are used, notably &quot;line reconstruction&quot; and &quot;preprocessing,&quot; but these are rare.

The main phases of the front end include the following:
* &quot;&quot; converts the input character sequence to a canonical form ready for the parser. Languages which strop their keywords or allow arbitrary spaces within identifiers require this phase. The top-down, recursive-descent, table-driven parsers used in the 1960s typically read the source one character at a time and did not require a separate tokenizing phase. Atlas Autocode and Imp (and some implementations of ALGOL and Coral 66) are examples of stropped languages whose compilers would have a &quot;Line Reconstruction&quot; phase.
* &quot;Preprocessing&quot; supports macro substitution and conditional compilation. Typically the preprocessing phase occurs before syntactic or semantic analysis; e.g. in the case of C, the preprocessor manipulates lexical tokens rather than syntactic forms. However, some languages such as Scheme support macro substitutions based on syntactic forms.
* &quot;Lexical analysis&quot; (also known as &quot;lexing&quot; or &quot;tokenization&quot;) breaks the source code text into a sequence of small pieces called &quot;lexical tokens&quot;. This phase can be divided into two stages: the &quot;scanning&quot;, which segments the input text into syntactic units called &quot;lexemes&quot; and assigns them a category; and the &quot;evaluating&quot;, which converts lexemes into a processed value. A token is a pair consisting of a &quot;token name&quot; and an optional &quot;token value&quot;. Common token categories may include identifiers, keywords, separators, operators, literals and comments, although the set of token categories varies in different programming languages. The lexeme syntax is typically a regular language, so a finite-state automaton constructed from a regular expression can be used to recognize it. The software doing lexical analysis is called a lexical analyzer. This may not be a separate step—it can be combined with the parsing step in scannerless parsing, in which case parsing is done at the character level, not the token level.
* &quot;Syntax analysis&quot; (also known as &quot;parsing&quot;) involves parsing the token sequence to identify the syntactic structure of the program. This phase typically builds a parse tree, which replaces the linear sequence of tokens with a tree structure built according to the rules of a formal grammar which define the language&#x27;s syntax. The parse tree is often analyzed, augmented, and transformed by later phases in the compiler.
* &quot;Semantic analysis&quot; adds semantic information to the parse tree and builds the symbol table. This phase performs semantic checks such as type checking (checking for type errors), or object binding (associating variable and function references with their definitions), or definite assignment (requiring all local variables to be initialized before use), rejecting incorrect programs or issuing warnings. Semantic analysis usually requires a complete parse tree, meaning that this phase logically follows the parsing phase, and logically precedes the code generation phase, though it is often possible to fold multiple phases into one pass over the code in a compiler implementation.

==== Middle end ====
The middle end, also known as &quot;optimizer,&quot; performs optimizations on the intermediate representation in order to improve the performance and the quality of the produced machine code. The middle end contains those optimizations that are independent of the CPU architecture being targeted.

The main phases of the middle end include the following:
* Analysis: This is the gathering of program information from the intermediate representation derived from the input; data-flow analysis is used to build use-define chains, together with dependence analysis, alias analysis, pointer analysis, escape analysis, etc. Accurate analysis is the basis for any compiler optimization. The control-flow graph of every compiled function and the call graph of the program are usually also built during the analysis phase.
* Optimization: the intermediate language representation is transformed into functionally equivalent but faster (or smaller) forms. Popular optimizations are inline expansion, dead-code elimination, constant propagation, loop transformation and even automatic parallelization.
Compiler analysis is the prerequisite for any compiler optimization, and they tightly work together. For example, dependence analysis is crucial for loop transformation.

The scope of compiler analysis and optimizations vary greatly; their scope may range from operating within a basic block, to whole procedures, or even the whole program. There is a trade-off between the granularity of the optimizations and the cost of compilation. For example, peephole optimizations are fast to perform during compilation but only affect a small local fragment of the code, and can be performed independently of the context in which the code fragment appears. In contrast, interprocedural optimization requires more compilation time and memory space, but enable optimizations that are only possible by considering the behavior of multiple functions simultaneously.

Interprocedural analysis and optimizations are common in modern commercial compilers from HP, IBM, SGI, Intel, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems. The free software GCC was criticized for a long time for lacking powerful interprocedural optimizations, but it is changing in this respect. Another open source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is Open64, which is used by many organizations for research and commercial purposes.

Due to the extra time and space needed for compiler analysis and optimizations, some compilers skip them by default. Users have to use compilation options to explicitly tell the compiler which optimizations should be enabled.

==== Back end ====
The back end is responsible for the CPU architecture specific optimizations and for code generation&quot;.&quot;

The main phases of the back end include the following:
* &quot;Machine dependent optimizations&quot;: optimizations that depend on the details of the CPU architecture that the compiler targets. A prominent example is peephole optimizations, which rewrites short sequences of assembler instructions into more efficient instructions.
* &quot;Code generation&quot;: the transformed intermediate language is translated into the output language, usually the native machine language of the system. This involves resource and storage decisions, such as deciding which variables to fit into registers and memory and the selection and scheduling of appropriate machine instructions along with their associated addressing modes (see also Sethi–Ullman algorithm). Debug data may also need to be generated to facilitate debugging.

=== Compiler correctness ===

Compiler correctness is the branch of software engineering that deals with trying to show that a compiler behaves according to its language specification. Techniques include developing the compiler using formal methods and using rigorous testing (often called compiler validation) on an existing compiler.

== Compiled vis-à-vis interpreted languages ==

Higher-level programming languages usually appear with a type of translation in mind: either designed as compiled language or interpreted language. However, in practice there is rarely anything about a language that &quot;requires&quot; it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted, although it is possible to design languages that rely on re-interpretation at run time. The categorization usually reflects the most popular or widespread implementations of a language – for instance, BASIC is sometimes called an interpreted language, and C a compiled one, despite the existence of BASIC compilers and C interpreters.

Interpretation does not replace compilation completely. It only hides it from the user and makes it gradual. Even though an interpreter can itself be interpreted, a set of directly executed machine instructions is needed somewhere at the bottom of the execution stack (see machine language).

Furthermore, for optimization compilers can contain interpreter functionality, and interpreters may include ahead of time compilation techniques. For example, where an expression can be executed during compilation and the results inserted into the output program, then it prevents it having to be recalculated each time the program runs, which can greatly speed up the final program. Modern trends toward just-in-time compilation and bytecode interpretation at times blur the traditional categorizations of compilers and interpreters even further.

Some language specifications spell out that implementations &quot;must&quot; include a compilation facility; for example, Common Lisp. However, there is nothing inherent in the definition of Common Lisp that stops it from being interpreted. Other languages have features that are very easy to implement in an interpreter, but make writing a compiler much harder; for example, APL, SNOBOL4, and many scripting languages allow programs to construct arbitrary source code at runtime with regular string operations, and then execute that code by passing it to a special evaluation function. To implement these features in a compiled language, programs must usually be shipped with a runtime library that includes a version of the compiler itself.

== Types ==
One classification of compilers is by the platform on which their generated code executes. This is known as the &quot;target platform.&quot;

A &quot;native&quot; or &quot;hosted&quot; compiler is one whose output is intended to directly run on the same type of computer and operating system that the compiler itself runs on. The output of a cross compiler is designed to run on a different platform. Cross compilers are often used when developing software for embedded systems that are not intended to support a software development environment.

The output of a compiler that produces code for a virtual machine (VM) may or may not be executed on the same platform as the compiler that produced it. For this reason, such compilers are not usually classified as native or cross compilers.

The lower level language that is the target of a compiler may itself be a high-level programming language. C, viewed by some as a sort of portable assembly language, is frequently the target language of such compilers. For example, Cfront, the original compiler for C++, used C as its target language. The C code generated by such a compiler is usually not intended to be readable and maintained by humans, so indent style and creating pretty C intermediate code are ignored. Some of the features of C that make it a good target language include the codice_1 directive, which can be generated by the compiler to support debugging of the original source, and the wide platform support available with C compilers.

While a common compiler type outputs machine code, there are many other types:
* Source-to-source compilers are a type of compiler that takes a high-level language as its input and outputs a high-level language. For example, an automatic parallelizing compiler will frequently take in a high-level language program as an input and then transform the code and annotate it with parallel code annotations (e.g. OpenMP) or language constructs (e.g. Fortran&#x27;s codice_2 statements). Other terms for a source-to-source compiler are transcompiler or transpiler.
* Bytecode compilers compile to assembly language of a theoretical machine, like some Prolog implementations
** This Prolog machine is also known as the Warren Abstract Machine (or WAM).
** Bytecode compilers for Java, Python are also examples of this category.
* Just-in-time compilers (JIT compiler) defer compilation until runtime. JIT compilers exist for many modern languages including Python, JavaScript, Smalltalk, Java, Microsoft .NET&#x27;s Common Intermediate Language (CIL) and others. A JIT compiler generally runs inside an interpreter. When the interpreter detects that a code path is &quot;hot&quot;, meaning it is executed frequently, the JIT compiler will be invoked and compile the &quot;hot&quot; code for increased performance.
** For some languages, such as Java, applications are first compiled using a bytecode compiler and delivered in a machine-independent intermediate representation. A bytecode interpreter executes the bytecode, but the JIT compiler will translate the bytecode to machine code when increased performance is necessary.
* Hardware compilers (also known as synthesis tools) are compilers whose input is a hardware description language and whose output is a description, in the form of a netlist or otherwise, of a hardware configuration.
** The output of these compilers target computer hardware at a very low level, for example a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or structured application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Such compilers are said to be hardware compilers, because the source code they compile effectively controls the final configuration of the hardware and how it operates. The output of the compilation is only an interconnection of transistors or lookup tables.
** An example of hardware compiler is XST, the Xilinx Synthesis Tool used for configuring FPGAs. Similar tools are available from Altera, Synplicity, Synopsys and other hardware vendors.
* A program that translates from a low-level language to a higher level one is a decompiler.
* A program that translates into an object code format that is not supported on the compilation machine is called a cross compiler and is commonly used to prepare code for execution on embedded software applications.
* A program that rewrites object code back into the same type of object code while applying optimisations and transformations is a binary recompiler.

&quot;Assemblers,&quot; which translate human readable assembly language to the machine code instructions executed by hardware, are not considered compilers. (The inverse program that translates machine code to assembly language is called a disassembler.)

<text>A castrato (Italian; : castrati) is a male singer who underwent castration before puberty in order to retain a singing voice equivalent to that of a soprano, mezzo-soprano, or contralto. The voice can also occur in one who, due to an endocrinological condition, never reaches sexual maturity.

Castration before puberty (or in its early stages) prevents the larynx from being transformed by the normal physiological events of puberty. As a result, the vocal range of prepubescence (shared by both sexes) is largely retained, and the voice develops into adulthood in a unique way. Prepubescent castration for this purpose diminished greatly in the late 18th century.

Methods of castration used to terminate the onset of puberty varied. Methods involved using opium to medically induce a coma, then submerging the boy into an ice or milk bath where the procedure of either twisting the testicles until they atrophied, or complete removal via surgical cutting was performed (however the complete removal of the testicles was not a popularly used technique). The procedure was usually done to boys around the age of 8–10; recovery time from the procedure took around two weeks. The means by which future singers were prepared could lead to premature death. To prevent the child from experiencing the intense pain of castration, many were inadvertently administered lethal doses of opium or some other narcotic, or were killed by overlong compression of the carotid artery in the neck (intended to render them unconscious during the castration procedure). 
The geographical locations of where these procedures took place is not known specifically. During the 18th century, the music historian Charles Burney was sent from pillar to post in search of places where the operation was carried out: I enquired throughout Italy at what place boys were chiefly qualified for singing by castration, but could get no certain intelligence. I was told at Milan that it was at Venice; at Venice that it was at Bologna; but at Bologna the fact was denied, and I was referred to Florence; from Florence to Rome, and from Rome I was sent to Naples. The operation most certainly is against the law in all these places, as well as against nature; and all the Italians are so much ashamed of it, that in every province they transfer it some other.

As a castrato&#x27;s body grew, his lack of testosterone meant that his epiphyses (bone-joints) did not harden in the normal manner. Thus, the limbs of the castrati often grew unusually long, as did their ribs. This, combined with intensive training, gave them unrivaled lung power and breath capacity. Operating through small, child-sized vocal cords, their voices were also extraordinarily flexible, and quite different from the equivalent adult female voice. Their vocal range was higher than that of the uncastrated adult male. Listening to the only surviving recordings of a castrato (see below), one can hear that the lower part of the voice sounds like a &quot;super-high&quot; tenor, with a more falsetto-like upper register above that.

Castrati were rarely referred to as such: in the 18th century, the euphemism &quot;musico&quot; (: &quot;musici&quot;) was much more generally used, although it usually carried derogatory implications; another synonym was &quot;evirato&quot;, literally meaning &quot;emasculated&quot;. Eunuch is a more general term since, historically, many eunuchs were castrated after puberty and thus the castration had no effect on their voices.

==History==


Castration as a means of subjugation, enslavement or other punishment has a very long history, dating back to ancient Sumer. In a Western context, eunuch singers are known to have existed from the early Byzantine Empire. In Constantinople around 400 AD, the empress Aelia Eudoxia had a eunuch choir-master, Brison, who may have established the use of castrati in Byzantine choirs, though whether Brison himself was a singer and whether he had colleagues who were eunuch singers is not certain. By the 9th century, eunuch singers were well-known (most in the choir of Hagia Sophia) and remained so until the sack of Constantinople by the Western forces of the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Their fate from then until their reappearance in Italy more than three hundred years later is not clear. It seems likely that the Spanish tradition of soprano falsettists may have hidden castrati. Much of Spain was under Muslim rulers during the Middle Ages, and castration had a history going back to the ancient Near East. Stereotypically, eunuchs served as harem guards, but they were also valued as high-level political appointees since they could not start a dynasty which would threaten the ruler.

== European classical tradition ==
Castrati first appeared in Italy in the mid-16th century, though at first the terms describing them were not always clear. The phrase &quot;soprano maschio&quot; (male soprano), which could also mean falsettist, occurs in the &quot;Due Dialoghi della Musica&quot; (Two dialogues upon music) of Luigi Dentice, an Oratorian priest, published in Rome in 1553. On 9 November 1555 Cardinal Ippolito II d&#x27;Este (famed as the builder of the Villa d&#x27;Este at Tivoli), wrote to Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua (1538–1587), that he has heard that the Duke was interested in his &quot;cantoretti&quot; (little singers) and offered to send him two, so that he could choose one for his own service. This is a rare term but probably does equate to &quot;castrato&quot;. The Cardinal&#x27;s nephew, Alfonso II d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, was another early enthusiast, inquiring about castrati in 1556. There were certainly castrati in the Sistine Chapel choir in 1558, although not described as such: on 27 April of that year, Hernando Bustamante, a Spaniard from Palencia, was admitted (the first castrati so termed who joined the Sistine choir were Pietro Paolo Folignato and Girolamo Rossini, admitted in 1599). Surprisingly, considering the later French distaste for castrati, they certainly existed in France at this time also, being known of in Paris, Orléans, Picardy and Normandy, though they were not abundant: the King of France himself had difficulty in obtaining them. By 1574, there were castrati in the Ducal court chapel at Munich, where the Kapellmeister (music director) was the famous Orlando di Lasso. In 1589, by the bull &quot;Cum pro nostro pastorali munere&quot;, Pope Sixtus V re-organised the choir of St Peter&#x27;s, Rome specifically to include castrati.

Thus the castrati came to supplant both boys (whose voices broke after only a few years) and falsettists (whose voices were weaker and less reliable) from the top line in such choirs. Women were banned by the Pauline dictum &quot;mulieres in ecclesiis taceant&quot; (&quot;let women keep silent in the churches&quot;; see I Corinthians, ch. 14, v. 34).

The Italian castrati were often rumored to have unusually long lives, but a 1993 study found that their lifespans were average.

==Opera==

Although the castrato (or musico) predates opera, there is some evidence that castrati had parts in the earliest operas. In the first performance of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo&quot; (1607), for example, they played subsidiary roles, including Speranza and (possibly) that of Euridice. Although female roles were performed by castrati in some of the papal states, this was increasingly rare; by 1680, they had supplanted normal male voices in lead roles, and retained their position as &quot;primo uomo&quot; for about a hundred years; an Italian opera not featuring at least one renowned castrato in a lead part would be doomed to fail. Because of the popularity of Italian opera throughout 18th-century Europe (except France), singers such as Ferri, Farinelli, Senesino and Pacchierotti became the first operatic superstars, earning enormous fees and hysterical public adulation. The strictly hierarchical organisation of &quot;opera seria&quot; favoured their high voices as symbols of heroic virtue, though they were frequently mocked for their strange appearance and bad acting. In his 1755 &quot;Reflections upon theatrical expression in tragedy&quot;, Roger Pickering wrote:
Farinelli drew every Body to the Haymarket. What a Pipe! What Modulation! What Extasy to the Ear! But, Heavens! What Clumsiness! What Stupidity! What Offence to the Eye! Reader, if of the City, thou mayest probably have seen in the Fields of Islington or Mile-End or, If thou art in the environs of St James&#x27;, thou must have observed in the Park with what Ease and Agility a cow, heavy with calf, has rose up at the command of the Milk-woman&#x27;s foot: thus from the mossy bank sprang the DIVINE FARINELLI.The training of the boys was rigorous. The regimen of one singing school in Rome (c. 1700) consisted of one hour of singing difficult and awkward pieces, one hour practising trills, one hour practising ornamented passaggi, one hour of singing exercises in their teacher&#x27;s presence and in front of a mirror so as to avoid unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces, and one hour of literary study; all this, moreover, before lunch. After, half an hour would be devoted to musical theory, another to writing counterpoint, an hour copying down the same from dictation, and another hour of literary study. During the remainder of the day, the young castrati had to find time to practice their harpsichord playing, and to compose vocal music, either sacred or secular depending on their inclination. This demanding schedule meant that, if sufficiently talented, they were able to make a debut in their mid-teens with a perfect technique and a voice of a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match.

Many castrati came from poor homes and were castrated by their parents in the hope that their child might be successful and lift them from poverty (this was the case with Senesino). There are, though, records of some young boys asking to be operated on to preserve their voices (e.g. Caffarelli, who was from a wealthy family: his grandmother gave him the income from two vineyards to pay for his studies). Caffarelli was also typical of many castrati in being famous for tantrums on and off-stage, and for amorous adventures with noble ladies. Some, as described by Casanova, preferred gentlemen (noble or otherwise).

According to John Rosselli, the total number of castrati alive at any given time during the height of their existence cannot be ascertained. He estimates that &quot;several hundred&quot; of them existed at any given time between 1630 and 1750. Approximately 100 existed in Rome in 1694, but the possibility that was a decline from earlier in the century cannot be ruled out. Only a small percentage of boys castrated to preserve their voices had successful careers on the operatic stage; the better &quot;also-rans&quot; sang in cathedral or church choirs, but because of their marked appearance and the ban on their marrying, there was little room for them in society outside a musical context.

The castrati came in for a great amount of scurrilous and unkind abuse, and as their fame increased, so did the hatred of them. They were often castigated as malign creatures who lured men into homosexuality. There were homosexual castrati, as Casanova&#x27;s accounts of 18th-century Italy bear witness. He mentions meeting an abbé whom he took for a girl in disguise, only later discovering that &quot;she&quot; was a famous castrato. In Rome in 1762 he attended a performance at which the prima donna was a castrato, &quot;the favourite &quot; of Cardinal Borghese, who dined every evening with his protector. From his behaviour on stage &quot;it was obvious that he hoped to inspire the love of those who liked him as a man, and probably would not have done so as a woman&quot;.

==Decline==

By the late 18th century, changes in operatic taste and social attitudes spelled the end for castrati. They lingered on past the end of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, which their style of opera parallels, and two of their number, Pacchierotti and Crescentini, performed before Napoleon. The last great operatic castrato was Giovanni Battista Velluti (1781–1861), who performed the last operatic castrato role ever written: Armando in &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot; by Meyerbeer (Venice, 1824). Soon after this they were replaced definitively as the first men of the operatic stage by a new breed of heroic tenor, as first incarnated by the Frenchman Gilbert-Louis Duprez, the earliest so-called &quot;king of the high Cs&quot;. His successors have included such singers as Enrico Tamberlik, Jean de Reszke, Francesco Tamagno, Enrico Caruso, Giovanni Martinelli, Beniamino Gigli, Jussi Björling, Franco Corelli and Luciano Pavarotti, among others.

After the unification of Italy in 1861, &quot;eviration&quot; was officially made illegal, as the new Italian state had adopted the previous penal code of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which expressly forbade the practice. In 1878, Pope Leo XIII prohibited the hiring of new castrati by the church: only in the Sistine Chapel and in other papal basilicas in Rome did a few castrati linger. A group photo of the Sistine Choir taken in 1898 shows that by then only six remained, plus the &quot;Direttore Perpetuo&quot;, the fine soprano castrato Domenico Mustafà. In 1902 a ruling was extracted from Pope Leo that no further castrati should be admitted. The official end to the castrati came on St. Cecilia&#x27;s Day, 22 November 1903, when the new pope, Pius X, issued his &quot;motu proprio&quot;, &quot;Tra le Sollecitudini&quot; (&quot;Amongst the Cares&quot;), which contained this instruction: &quot;Whenever ... it is desirable to employ the high voices of sopranos and contraltos, these parts must be taken by boys, according to the most ancient usage of the Church.&quot;
The last Sistine castrato to survive was Alessandro Moreschi, the only castrato to have made solo recordings. While an interesting historical record, these discs of his give us only a glimpse of the castrato voice. Although he had been renowned as &quot;The Angel of Rome&quot; at the beginning of his career, some would say he was past his prime when the recordings were made in 1902 and 1904 and he never attempted to sing opera. Domenico Salvatori, a castrato who was contemporary with Moreschi, made some ensemble recordings with him but has no surviving solo recordings. The recording technology of the day was not of modern high quality. Salvatori died in 1909; Moreschi retired officially in March 1913, and died in 1922.

The Catholic Church&#x27;s involvement in the castrato phenomenon has long been controversial, and there have recently been calls for it to issue an official apology for its role. As early as 1748, Pope Benedict XIV tried to ban castrati from churches, but such was their popularity at the time that he realised that doing so might result in a drastic decline in church attendance.

The rumours of another castrato sequestered in the Vatican for the personal delectation of the Pontiff until as recently as 1959 have been proven false. The singer in question was a pupil of Moreschi&#x27;s, Domenico Mancini, such a successful imitator of his teacher&#x27;s voice that even Lorenzo Perosi, Direttore Perpetuo of the Sistine Choir from 1898 to 1956 and a strenuous opponent of the practice of castrato singers, thought he was a castrato. Mancini was in fact a moderately skillful falsettist and professional double bass player.

==Modern castrati and similar voices==
A male can retain his child voice if it never changes during puberty. The retained voice can be the treble voice shared by both sexes in childhood and is the same as a boy soprano voice. But as evidence shows, many castrati, such as Senesino and Caffarelli, were actually altos (mezzo-soprano) – not sopranos. So-called &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;endocrinological castrati&quot; are born with hormonal anomalies, such as Klinefelter&#x27;s syndrome and Kallmann&#x27;s syndrome, or have undergone unusual physical or medical events during their early lives that reproduce the vocal effects of castration without being castrated.

Jimmy Scott, Radu Marian and Javier Medina are examples of this type of high male voice via endocrinological conditions. Michael Maniaci is somewhat different, in that he has no hormonal or other anomalies, but claims that his voice did not &quot;break&quot; in the usual manner, leaving him still able to sing in the soprano register. Other uncastrated male adults sing soprano, generally using some form of falsetto but in a much higher range than most countertenors. Examples are Aris Christofellis, Jörg Waschinski, and Ghio Nannini.

However, it is believed the castrati possessed more of a tenorial chest register (the aria &quot;Navigante che non spera&quot; in Leonardo Vinci&#x27;s opera &quot;Il Medo&quot;, written for Farinelli, requires notes down to C3, 131 Hz). Similar low-voiced singing can be heard from the jazz vocalist Jimmy Scott, whose range matches approximately that used by female blues singers. High-pitched singer Jordan Smith has demonstrated having more of a tenorial chest register.

Actor Chris Colfer has stated in interviews that when his voice began to change at puberty, he sang in a high voice &quot;constantly&quot; in an effort to retain his range. Actor and singer Alex Newell has soprano range. Voice actor Walter Tetley may or may not have been a &quot;castrato&quot;; Bill Scott, a co-worker of Tetley&#x27;s during their later work in television, once half-jokingly quipped that Tetley&#x27;s mother &quot;had him fixed&quot; to protect the child star&#x27;s voice-acting career. Tetley never did personally divulge the exact reason for his condition, which left him with the voice of a preteen boy for his entire adult life. Botanist George Washington Carver was noted for his high voice, believed to be the result of pertussis and croup infections in his childhood that stunted his growth.

<text>A counting-out game or counting-out rhyme is a simple method of &#x27;randomly&#x27; selecting a person from a group, often used by children for the purpose of playing another game. It usually requires no materials, and is achieved with spoken words or hand gestures. The historian Henry Carrington Bolton suggested in his 1888 book &quot;Counting Out Rhymes of Children&quot; that the custom of counting out originated in the &quot;superstitious practices of divination by lots.&quot;

Many such methods involve one person pointing at each participant in a circle of players while reciting a rhyme. A new person is pointed at as each word is said. The player who is selected at the conclusion of the rhyme is &quot;it&quot; or &quot;out&quot;. In an alternate version, the circle of players may each put two feet in and at the conclusion of the rhyme, that player removes one foot and the rhyme starts over with the next person. In this case, the first player that has both feet removed is &quot;it&quot; or &quot;out&quot;. In theory the result of a counting rhyme is determined entirely by the starting selection (and would result in a modulo operation), but in practice they are often accepted as random selections because the number of words has not been calculated beforehand, so the result is unknown until someone is selected.

A variant of counting-out game, known as the Josephus problem, represents a famous theoretical problem in mathematics and computer science.

==Examples==
Several simple games can be played to select one person from a group, either as a straightforward winner, or as someone who is eliminated. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Odd or Even and Blue Shoe require no materials and are played using hand gestures, although with the former it is possible for a player to win or lose through skill rather than luck. Coin flipping and drawing straws are fair methods of randomly determining a player. Fizz Buzz is a spoken word game where if a player slips up and speaks a word out of sequence, they are eliminated.

===Common rhymes===
(These rhymes may have many local or regional variants.)
* Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
* 10 Little Indians
* Five Little Ducks
* Ip dip
* One, Two, Three, Four, Five
* Tinker, Tailor (traditionally played in England)
* Yan Tan Tethera
* Inky Pinky Ponky
* One potato, two potato
*Ink-a-dink
* En Den Dino

==Cultural references==

=== Marx Brothers ===
A scene in the Marx Brothers movie &quot;Duck Soup&quot; plays on the fact that counting-out games are not really random. Faced with selecting someone to go on a dangerous mission, the character Chicolini (Chico Marx) chants:

:&quot;Rrringspot, vonza, twoza, zig-zag-zav, popti, vinaga, [tin-lie, tav,] harem, scarem, merchan, tarem, teir, tore...&quot;

only to stop as he realizes he is about to select himself. He then says, &quot;I did it wrong. Wait, wait, I start here&quot;, and repeats the chant—with the same result. After that, he says, &quot;That&#x27;s no good too. I got it!&quot; and reduces the chant to

:&quot;Rrringspot, buck!&quot;

And with this version he finally manages to &quot;randomly&quot; select someone else.

=== Seinfeld ===
A version of a counting game &quot;ink-a-dink&quot; features in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Statue.&quot; The relevant scene includes a discussion between the characters of Jerry and George if the person who is &quot;it&quot; is the &quot;winner&quot; or the &quot;loser&quot;: 

: JERRY: Alright, let&#x27;s go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
: GEORGE: What?
: JERRY: The Ink-a-dink.. you were &quot;It&quot;.
: GEORGE: &quot;It&quot;″s bad?
: JERRY: &quot;It&quot;″s very bad.

<text>In cryptography, key size or key length refers to the number of bits in a key used by a cryptographic algorithm (such as a cipher).

Key length defines the upper-bound on an algorithm&#x27;s security (i.e. a logarithmic measure of the fastest known attack against an algorithm), because the security of all algorithms can be violated by brute-force attacks. Ideally, the lower-bound on an algorithm&#x27;s security is by design equal to the key length (that is, the algorithm&#x27;s design does not detract from the degree of security inherent in the key length).

Most symmetric-key algorithms are designed to have security equal to their key length. However, after design, a new attack might be discovered. For instance, Triple DES was designed to have a 168-bit key, but an attack of complexity 2112 is now known (i.e. Triple DES now only has 112 bits of security, and of the 168 bits in the key the attack has rendered 56 &#x27;ineffective&#x27; towards security). Nevertheless, as long as the security (understood as &quot;the amount of effort it would take to gain access&quot;) is sufficient for a particular application, then it does not matter if key length and security coincide. This is important for asymmetric-key algorithms, because no such algorithm is known to satisfy this property; elliptic curve cryptography comes the closest with an effective security of roughly half its key length.

==Significance==
Keys are used to control the operation of a cipher so that only the correct key can convert encrypted text (ciphertext) to plaintext. All commonly-used ciphers are based on publicly known algorithms or are open source and so it is only the difficulty of obtaining the key that determines security of the system, provided that there is no analytic attack (i.e. a &quot;structural weakness&quot; in the algorithms or protocols used), and assuming that the key is not otherwise available (such as via theft, extortion, or compromise of computer systems). The widely accepted notion that the security of the system should depend on the key alone has been explicitly formulated by Auguste Kerckhoffs (in the 1880s) and Claude Shannon (in the 1940s); the statements are known as Kerckhoffs&#x27; principle and Shannon&#x27;s Maxim respectively.

A key should, therefore, be large enough that a brute-force attack (possible against any encryption algorithm) is infeasible – i.e. would take too long and/or would take too much memory to execute. Shannon&#x27;s work on information theory showed that to achieve so-called &#x27;perfect secrecy&#x27;, the key length must be at least as large as the message and only used once (this algorithm is called the one-time pad). In light of this, and the practical difficulty of managing such long keys, modern cryptographic practice has discarded the notion of perfect secrecy as a requirement for encryption, and instead focuses on computational security, under which the computational requirements of breaking an encrypted text must be infeasible for an attacker.

==Key size and encryption system==
Encryption systems are often grouped into families. Common families include symmetric systems (e.g. AES) and asymmetric systems (e.g. RSA and Elliptic-curve cryptography [ECC]). They may be grouped according to the central algorithm used (e.g. ECC and Feistel ciphers). Because each of these has a different level of cryptographic complexity, it is usual to have different key sizes for the same level of security, depending upon the algorithm used. For example, the security available with a 1024-bit key using asymmetric RSA is considered approximately equal in security to an 80-bit key in a symmetric algorithm.

The actual degree of security achieved over time varies, as more computational power and more powerful mathematical analytic methods become available. For this reason, cryptologists tend to look at indicators that an algorithm or key length shows signs of potential vulnerability, to move to longer key sizes or more difficult algorithms. For example, , a 1039-bit integer was factored with the special number field sieve using 400 computers over 11 months. The factored number was of a special form; the special number field sieve cannot be used on RSA keys. The computation is roughly equivalent to breaking a 700 bit RSA key. However, this might be an advance warning that 1024 bit RSA keys used in secure online commerce should be deprecated, since they may become breakable in the foreseeable future. Cryptography professor Arjen Lenstra observed that &quot;Last time, it took nine years for us to generalize from a special to a nonspecial, hard-to-factor number&quot; and when asked whether 1024-bit RSA keys are dead, said: &quot;The answer to that question is an unqualified yes.&quot;

The 2015 Logjam attack revealed additional dangers in using Diffie-Hellman key exchange when only one or a few common 1024-bit or smaller prime moduli are in use. This practice, somewhat common at the time, allows large amounts of communications to be compromised at the expense of attacking a small number of primes.

== Brute-force attack ==
Even if a symmetric cipher is currently unbreakable by exploiting structural weaknesses in its algorithm, it may be possible to run through the entire space of keys in what is known as a brute-force attack. Because longer symmetric keys require exponentially more work to brute force search, a sufficiently long symmetric key makes this line of attack impractical.

With a key of length &quot;n&quot; bits, there are 2n possible keys. This number grows very rapidly as &quot;n&quot; increases. The large number of operations (2128) required to try all possible 128-bit keys is widely considered out of reach for conventional digital computing techniques for the foreseeable future. However, a quantum computer capable of running Grover&#x27;s algorithm would be able to search the possible keys more efficiently. If a suitably sized quantum computer would reduce a 128-bit key down to 64-bit security, roughly a DES equivalent. This is one of the reasons why AES supports key lengths of 256 bits and longer.

==Symmetric algorithm key lengths==
IBM&#x27;s Lucifer cipher was selected in 1974 as the base for what would become the Data Encryption Standard. Lucifer&#x27;s key length was reduced from 128 bits to 56 bits, which the NSA and NIST argued was sufficient for non-governmental protection at the time. The NSA has major computing resources and a large budget; some cryptographers including Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman complained that this made the cipher so weak that NSA computers would be able to break a DES key in a day through brute force parallel computing. The NSA disputed this, claiming that brute-forcing DES would take them &quot;something like 91 years&quot;.

However, by the late 90s, it became clear that DES could be cracked in a few days&#x27; time-frame with custom-built hardware such as could be purchased by a large corporation or government. The book &quot;Cracking DES&quot; (O&#x27;Reilly and Associates) tells of the successful ability in 1998 to break 56-bit DES by a brute-force attack mounted by a cyber civil rights group with limited resources; see EFF DES cracker. Even before that demonstration, 56 bits was considered insufficient length for symmetric algorithm keys for general use. Because of this, DES was replaced in most security applications by Triple DES, which has 112 bits of security when using 168-bit keys (triple key).

The Advanced Encryption Standard published in 2001 uses key sizes of 128, 192 or 256 bits. Many observers consider 128 bits sufficient for the foreseeable future for symmetric algorithms of AES&#x27;s quality until quantum computers become available. However, as of 2015, the U.S. National Security Agency has issued guidance that it plans to switch to quantum computing resistant algorithms and now requires 256-bit AES keys for data classified up to Top Secret.

In 2003, the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology, NIST proposed phasing out 80-bit keys by 2015. At 2005, 80-bit keys were allowed only until 2010.

Since 2015, NIST guidance says that &quot;the use of keys that provide less than 112 bits of security strength for key agreement is now disallowed.&quot; NIST approved symmetric encryption algorithms include three-key Triple DES, and AES. Approvals for two-key Triple DES and Skipjack were withdrawn in 2015; the NSA&#x27;s Skipjack algorithm used in its Fortezza program employs 80-bit keys.

==Asymmetric algorithm key lengths==
The effectiveness of public key cryptosystems depends on the intractability (computational and theoretical) of certain mathematical problems such as integer factorization. These problems are time-consuming to solve, but usually faster than trying all possible keys by brute force. Thus, asymmetric keys must be longer for equivalent resistance to attack than symmetric algorithm keys. The most common methods are assumed to be weak against sufficiently powerful quantum computers in the future.

Since 2015, NIST recommends a minimum of 2048-bit keys for RSA, an update to the widely accepted recommendation of a 1024-bit minimum since at least 2002.

1024-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 80-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit RSA keys to 112-bit symmetric keys, 3072-bit RSA keys to 128-bit symmetric keys, and 15360-bit RSA keys to 256-bit symmetric keys. In 2003, RSA Security claimed that 1024-bit keys were likely to become crackable sometime between 2006 and 2010, while 2048-bit keys are sufficient until 2030. the largest RSA key publicly known to be cracked is RSA-250 with 829 bits.

The Finite Field Diffie-Hellman algorithm has roughly the same key strength as RSA for the same key sizes. The work factor for breaking Diffie-Hellman is based on the discrete logarithm problem, which is related to the integer factorization problem on which RSA&#x27;s strength is based. Thus, a 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman key has about the same strength as a 2048-bit RSA key.

Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an alternative set of asymmetric algorithms that is equivalently secure with shorter keys, requiring only approximately twice the bits as the equivalent symmetric algorithm. A 256-bit Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key has approximately the same safety factor as a 128-bit AES key. A message encrypted with an elliptic key algorithm using a 109-bit long key was broken in 2004.

The NSA previously recommended 256-bit ECC for protecting classified information up to the SECRET level, and 384-bit for TOP SECRET; In 2015 it announced plans to transition to quantum-resistant algorithms by 2024, and until then recommends 384-bit for all classified information.

== Effect of quantum computing attacks on key strength ==
The two best known quantum computing attacks are based on Shor&#x27;s algorithm and Grover&#x27;s algorithm. Of the two, Shor&#x27;s offers the greater risk to current security systems.

Derivatives of Shor&#x27;s algorithm are widely conjectured to be effective against all mainstream public-key algorithms including RSA, Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve cryptography. According to Professor Gilles Brassard, an expert in quantum computing: &quot;The time needed to factor an RSA integer is the same order as the time needed to use that same integer as modulus for a single RSA encryption. In other words, it takes no more time to break RSA on a quantum computer (up to a multiplicative constant) than to use it legitimately on a classical computer.&quot; The general consensus is that these public key algorithms are insecure at any key size if sufficiently large quantum computers capable of running Shor&#x27;s algorithm become available. The implication of this attack is that all data encrypted using current standards based security systems such as the ubiquitous SSL used to protect e-commerce and Internet banking and SSH used to protect access to sensitive computing systems is at risk. Encrypted data protected using public-key algorithms can be archived and may be broken at a later time, commonly known as retroactive/retrospective decryption or &quot;harvest now, decrypt later&quot;.

Mainstream symmetric ciphers (such as AES or Twofish) and collision resistant hash functions (such as SHA) are widely conjectured to offer greater security against known quantum computing attacks. They are widely thought most vulnerable to Grover&#x27;s algorithm. Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, and Vazirani proved in 1996 that a brute-force key search on a quantum computer cannot be faster than roughly 2&quot;n&quot;/2 invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2&quot;n&quot; in the classical case. Thus in the presence of large quantum computers an &quot;n&quot;-bit key can provide at least &quot;n&quot;/2 bits of security. Quantum brute force is easily defeated by doubling the key length, which has little extra computational cost in ordinary use. This implies that at least a 256-bit symmetric key is required to achieve 128-bit security rating against a quantum computer. As mentioned above, the NSA announced in 2015 that it plans to transition to quantum-resistant algorithms.

In a 2016 Quantum Computing FAQ, the NSA affirmed:
In a 2022 press release, the NSA notified:
Since September 2022, the NSA has been transitioning from the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (now referred to as CNSA 1.0), originally launched in January 2016, to the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 (CNSA 2.0), both summarized below:
