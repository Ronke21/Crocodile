<text>In modern physics, the double-slit experiment demonstrates that light and matter can exhibit behavior of both classical particles and classical waves. This type of experiment was first performed by Thomas Young in 1801, as a demonstration of the wave behavior of visible light. In 1927, Davisson and Germer and, independently, George Paget Thomson and his research student Alexander Reid demonstrated that electrons show the same behavior, which was later extended to atoms and molecules. Thomas Young&#x27;s experiment with light was part of classical physics long before the development of quantum mechanics and the concept of wave–particle duality. He believed it demonstrated that the Christiaan Huygens&#x27; wave theory of light was correct, and his experiment is sometimes referred to as Young&#x27;s experiment or Young&#x27;s slits.

The experiment belongs to a general class of &quot;double path&quot; experiments, in which a wave is split into two separate waves (the wave is typically made of many photons and better referred to as a wave front, not to be confused with the wave properties of the individual photon) that later combine into a single wave. Changes in the path-lengths of both waves result in a phase shift, creating an interference pattern. Another version is the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, which splits the beam with a beam splitter.

In the basic version of this experiment, a coherent light source, such as a laser beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate. The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to interfere, producing bright and dark bands on the screen – a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles. However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles (not waves); the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen. Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected photon passes through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave). However, such experiments demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through. These results demonstrate the principle of wave–particle duality.

Other atomic-scale entities, such as electrons, are found to exhibit the same behavior when fired towards a double slit. Additionally, the detection of individual discrete impacts is observed to be inherently probabilistic, which is inexplicable using classical mechanics.

The experiment can be done with entities much larger than electrons and photons, although it becomes more difficult as size increases. The largest entities for which the double-slit experiment has been performed were molecules that each comprised 2000 atoms (whose total mass was 25,000 atomic mass units).

The double-slit experiment (and its variations) has become a classic for its clarity in expressing the central puzzles of quantum mechanics. Richard Feynman called it &quot;a phenomenon which is impossible […] to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery [of quantum mechanics].&quot;

==Overview==

If light consisted strictly of ordinary or classical particles, and these particles were fired in a straight line through a slit and allowed to strike a screen on the other side, we would expect to see a pattern corresponding to the size and shape of the slit. However, when this &quot;single-slit experiment&quot; is actually performed, the pattern on the screen is a diffraction pattern in which the light is spread out. The smaller the slit, the greater the angle of spread. The top portion of the image shows the central portion of the pattern formed when a red laser illuminates a slit and, if one looks carefully, two faint side bands. More bands can be seen with a more highly refined apparatus. Diffraction explains the pattern as being the result of the interference of light waves from the slit.

If one illuminates two parallel slits, the light from the two slits again interferes. Here the interference is a more pronounced pattern with a series of alternating light and dark bands. The width of the bands is a property of the frequency of the illuminating light. (See the bottom photograph to the right.)
When Thomas Young (1773–1829) first demonstrated this phenomenon, it indicated that light consists of waves, as the distribution of brightness can be explained by the alternately additive and subtractive interference of wavefronts. Young&#x27;s experiment, performed in the early 1800s, played a crucial role in the understanding of the wave theory of light, vanquishing the corpuscular theory of light proposed by Isaac Newton, which had been the accepted model of light propagation in the 17th and 18th centuries.

However, the later discovery of the photoelectric effect demonstrated that under different circumstances, light can behave as if it is composed of discrete particles. These seemingly contradictory discoveries made it necessary to go beyond classical physics and take into account the quantum nature of light.

Feynman was fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can be gleaned from carefully thinking through the implications of this single experiment. He also proposed (as a thought experiment) that if detectors were placed before each slit, the interference pattern would disappear.

The Englert–Greenberger duality relation provides a detailed treatment of the mathematics of double-slit interference in the context of quantum mechanics.

A low-intensity double-slit experiment was first performed by G. I. Taylor in 1909, by reducing the level of incident light until photon emission/absorption events were mostly non-overlapping.

A slit interference experiment was not performed with anything other than light until 1961, when Claus Jönsson of the University of Tübingen performed it with coherent electron beams and multiple slits. In 1974, the Italian physicists Pier Giorgio Merli, Gian Franco Missiroli, and Giulio Pozzi performed a related experiment using single electrons from a coherent source and a biprism beam splitter, showing the statistical nature of the buildup of the interference pattern, as predicted by quantum theory. In 2002, the single-electron version of the experiment was voted &quot;the most beautiful experiment&quot; by readers of &quot;Physics World.&quot; Since that time a number of related experiments have been published, with a little controversy.

In 2012, Stefano Frabboni and co-workers sent single electrons onto nanofabricated slits (about 100 nm wide) and, by detecting the transmitted electrons with a single-electron detector, they could show the build-up of a double-slit interference pattern. Many related experiments involving the coherent interference have been performed; they are the basis of modern electron diffraction, microscopy and high resolution imaging.

In 2018, single particle interference was demonstrated for antimatter in the Positron Laboratory (L-NESS, Politecnico di Milano) of Rafael Ferragut in Como (Italy), by a group led by Marco Giammarchi.

==Variations of the experiment==

===Interference from individual particles===
An important version of this experiment involves single particle detection. Illuminating the double-slit with a low intensity results in single particles being detected as white dots on the screen. Remarkably, however, an interference pattern emerges when these particles are allowed to build up one by one (see the image below).

This demonstrates the wave–particle duality, which states that all matter exhibits both wave and particle properties: The particle is measured as a single pulse at a single position, while the modulus squared of the wave describes the probability of detecting the particle at a specific place on the screen giving a statistical interference pattern. This phenomenon has been shown to occur with photons, electrons, atoms, and even some molecules: with buckminsterfullerene () in 2001, with 2 molecules of 430 atoms ( and ) in 2011, and with molecules of up to 2000 atoms in 2019.
In addition to interference patterns built up from single particles, up to 4 entangled photons can also show interference patterns.

===Mach-Zehnder interferometer===

The Mach–Zehnder interferometer can be seen as a simplified version of the double-slit experiment. Instead of propagating through free space after the two slits, and hitting any position in an extended screen, in the interferometer the photons can only propagate via two paths, and hit two discrete photodetectors. This makes it possible to describe it via simple linear algebra in dimension 2, rather than differential equations.

A photon emitted by the laser hits the first beam splitter and is then in a superposition between the two possible paths. In the second beam splitter these paths interfere, causing the photon to hit the photodetector on the right with probability one, and the photodetector on the bottom with probability zero. Blocking one of the paths, or equivalently detecting the presence of a photon on a path eliminates interference between the paths: both photodetectors will be hit with probability 1/2. This indicates that after the first beam splitter the photon does not take one path or another, but rather exists in a quantum superposition of the two paths.

===&quot;Which-way&quot; experiments and the principle of complementarity===
A well-known thought experiment predicts that if particle detectors are positioned at the slits, showing through which slit a photon goes, the interference pattern will disappear. This which-way experiment illustrates the complementarity principle that photons can behave as either particles or waves, but cannot be observed as both at the same time.
Despite the importance of this thought experiment in the history of quantum mechanics (for example, see the discussion on Einstein&#x27;s version of this experiment), technically feasible realizations of this experiment were not proposed until the 1970s. (Naive implementations of the textbook thought experiment are not possible because photons cannot be detected without absorbing the photon.) Currently, multiple experiments have been performed illustrating various aspects of complementarity.

An experiment performed in 1987 produced results that demonstrated that partial information could be obtained regarding which path a particle had taken without destroying the interference altogether. This &quot;wave-particle trade-off&quot; takes the form of an inequality relating the visibility of the interference pattern and the distinguishability of the which-way paths.

===Delayed choice and quantum eraser variations===
Wheeler&#x27;s delayed-choice experiments demonstrate that extracting &quot;which path&quot; information after a particle passes through the slits can seem to retroactively alter its previous behavior at the slits.

Quantum eraser experiments demonstrate that wave behavior can be restored by erasing or otherwise making permanently unavailable the &quot;which path&quot; information.

A simple do-it-at-home illustration of the quantum eraser phenomenon was given in an article in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. If one sets polarizers before each slit with their axes orthogonal to each other, the interference pattern will be eliminated. The polarizers can be considered as introducing which-path information to each beam. Introducing a third polarizer in front of the detector with an axis of 45° relative to the other polarizers &quot;erases&quot; this information, allowing the interference pattern to reappear. This can also be accounted for by considering the light to be a classical wave, and also when using circular polarizers and single photons. Implementations of the polarizers using entangled photon pairs have no classical explanation.

===Weak measurement===

In a highly publicized experiment in 2012, researchers claimed to have identified the path each particle had taken without any adverse effects at all on the interference pattern generated by the particles. In order to do this, they used a setup such that particles coming to the screen were not from a point-like source, but from a source with two intensity maxima. However, commentators such as Svensson have pointed out that there is in fact no conflict between the weak measurements performed in this variant of the double-slit experiment and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Weak measurement followed by post-selection did not allow simultaneous position and momentum measurements for each individual particle, but rather allowed measurement of the average trajectory of the particles that arrived at different positions. In other words, the experimenters were creating a statistical map of the full trajectory landscape.

===Other variations===

In 1967, Pfleegor and Mandel demonstrated two-source interference using two separate lasers as light sources.

It was shown experimentally in 1972 that in a double-slit system where only one slit was open at any time, interference was nonetheless observed provided the path difference was such that the detected photon could have come from either slit. The experimental conditions were such that the photon density in the system was much less than 1.

In 1991, Carnal and Mlynek performed the classic Young&#x27;s double slit experiment with metastable helium atoms passing through micrometer-scale slits in gold foil.

In 1999, a quantum interference experiment (using a diffraction grating, rather than two slits) was successfully performed with buckyball molecules (each of which comprises 60 carbon atoms). A buckyball is large enough (diameter about 0.7 nm, nearly half a million times larger than a proton) to be seen in an electron microscope.

In 2002, an electron field emission source was used to demonstrate the double-slit experiment. In this experiment, a coherent electron wave was emitted from two closely located emission sites on the needle apex, which acted as double slits, splitting the wave into two coherent electron waves in a vacuum. The interference pattern between the two electron waves could then be observed. In 2017, researchers performed the double-slit experiment using light-induced field electron emitters. With this technique, emission sites can be optically selected on a scale of ten nanometers. By selectively deactivating (closing) one of the two emissions (slits), researchers were able to show that the interference pattern disappeared.

In 2005, E. R. Eliel presented an experimental and theoretical study of the optical transmission of a thin metal screen perforated by two subwavelength slits, separated by many optical wavelengths. The total intensity of the far-field double-slit pattern is shown to be reduced or enhanced as a function of the wavelength of the incident light beam.

In 2012, researchers at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln performed the double-slit experiment with electrons as described by Richard Feynman, using new instruments that allowed control of the transmission of the two slits and the monitoring of single-electron detection events. Electrons were fired by an electron gun and passed through one or two slits of 62 nm wide × 4 μm tall.

In 2013, a quantum interference experiment (using diffraction gratings, rather than two slits) was successfully performed with molecules that each comprised 810 atoms (whose total mass was over 10,000 atomic mass units). The record was raised to 2000 atoms (25,000 amu) in 2019.

====Hydrodynamic pilot wave analogs====

Hydrodynamic analogs have been developed that can recreate various aspects of quantum mechanical systems, including single-particle interference through a double-slit. A silicone oil droplet, bouncing along the surface of a liquid, self-propels via resonant interactions with its own wave field. The droplet gently sloshes the liquid with every bounce. At the same time, ripples from past bounces affect its course. The droplet&#x27;s interaction with its own ripples, which form what is known as a pilot wave, causes it to exhibit behaviors previously thought to be peculiar to elementary particles – including behaviors customarily taken as evidence that elementary particles are spread through space like waves, without any specific location, until they are measured.

Behaviors mimicked via this hydrodynamic pilot-wave system include quantum single particle diffraction, tunneling, quantized orbits, orbital level splitting, spin, and multimodal statistics. It is also possible to infer uncertainty relations and exclusion principles. Videos are available illustrating various features of this system. (See the External links.)

However, more complicated systems that involve two or more particles in superposition are not amenable to such a simple, classically intuitive explanation. Accordingly, no hydrodynamic analog of entanglement has been developed. Nevertheless, optical analogs are possible.

==== Double-slit experiment on time ====
In 2023, an experiment was reported recreating an interference pattern in time by shining a pump laser pulse at a screen coated in indium tin oxide (ITO) which would alter the properties of the electrons within the material due to the Kerr effect, changing it from transparent to reflective for around 200 femtoseconds long where a subsequent probe laser beam hitting the ITO screen would then see this temporary change in optical properties as a slit in time and two of them as a double slit with a phase difference adding up destructively or constructively on each frequency component resulting in an interference pattern. Similar results have been obtained classically on water waves.

==Classical wave-optics formulation==


Much of the behaviour of light can be modelled using classical wave theory. The Huygens–Fresnel principle is one such model; it states that each point on a wavefront generates a secondary wavelet, and that the disturbance at any subsequent point can be found by summing the contributions of the individual wavelets at that point. This summation needs to take into account the phase as well as the amplitude of the individual wavelets. Only the intensity of a light field can be measured—this is proportional to the square of the amplitude.

In the double-slit experiment, the two slits are illuminated by the quasi-monochromatic light of a single laser. If the width of the slits is small enough (much less than the wavelength of the laser light), the slits diffract the light into cylindrical waves. These two cylindrical wavefronts are superimposed, and the amplitude, and therefore the intensity, at any point in the combined wavefronts depends on both the magnitude and the phase of the two wavefronts. The difference in phase between the two waves is determined by the difference in the distance travelled by the two waves.

If the viewing distance is large compared with the separation of the slits (the far field), the phase difference can be found using the geometry shown in the figure below right. The path difference between two waves travelling at an angle is given by:

:formula_1

Where d is the distance between the two slits. When the two waves are in phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to an integral number of wavelengths, the summed amplitude, and therefore the summed intensity is maximum, and when they are in anti-phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to half a wavelength, one and a half wavelengths, etc., then the two waves cancel and the summed intensity is zero. This effect is known as interference. The interference fringe maxima occur at angles

:formula_2

where λ is the wavelength of the light. The angular spacing of the fringes, , is given by

:formula_3

The spacing of the fringes at a distance from the slits is given by

:formula_4

For example, if two slits are separated by 0.5 mm (), and are illuminated with a 0.6 μm wavelength laser (), then at a distance of 1 m (), the spacing of the fringes will be 1.2 mm.

If the width of the slits is appreciable compared to the wavelength, the Fraunhofer diffraction equation is needed to determine the intensity of the diffracted light as follows:

:formula_5

where the sinc function is defined as sinc(&quot;x&quot;) = sin(&quot;x&quot;)/&quot;x&quot; for &quot;x&quot; ≠ 0, and sinc(0) = 1.

This is illustrated in the figure above, where the first pattern is the diffraction pattern of a single slit, given by the function in this equation, and the second figure shows the combined intensity of the light diffracted from the two slits, where the function represents the fine structure, and the coarser structure represents diffraction by the individual slits as described by the function.

Similar calculations for the near field can be made by applying the Fresnel diffraction equation, which implies that as the plane of observation gets closer to the plane in which the slits are located, the diffraction patterns associated with each slit decrease in size, so that the area in which interference occurs is reduced, and may vanish altogether when there is no overlap in the two diffracted patterns.

==Path-integral formulation==
The double-slit experiment can illustrate the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics provided by Feynman. The path integral formulation replaces the classical notion of a single, unique trajectory for a system, with a sum over all possible trajectories. The trajectories are added together by using functional integration.

Each path is considered equally likely, and thus contributes the same amount. However, the phase of this contribution at any given point along the path is determined by the action along the path:
formula_6

All these contributions are then added together, and the magnitude of the final result is squared, to get the probability distribution for the position of a particle:
formula_7

As is always the case when calculating probability, the results must then be normalized by imposing:
formula_8

The probability distribution of the outcome is the normalized square of the norm of the superposition, over all paths from the point of origin to the final point, of waves propagating proportionally to the action along each path. The differences in the cumulative action along the different paths (and thus the relative phases of the contributions) produces the interference pattern observed by the double-slit experiment. Feynman stressed that his formulation is merely a mathematical description, not an attempt to describe a real process that we can measure.

==Interpretations of the experiment==
Like the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat thought experiment, the double-slit experiment is often used to highlight the differences and similarities between the various interpretations of quantum mechanics.

===Standard quantum physics===
The standard interpretation of the double slit experiment is that the pattern is a wave phenomenon, representing interference between two probability amplitudes, one for each slit. Low intensity experiments demonstrate that the pattern is filled in one particle detection at a time. Any change to the apparatus designed to detect a particle at a particular slit alters the probability amplitudes and the interference disappears. This interpretation is independent of any conscious observer.

===Complementarity===

Niels Bohr interpreted quantum experiments like the double-slit experiment using the concept of complementarity. In Bohr&#x27;s view quantum systems are not classical, but measurements can only give classical results. Certain pairs of classical properties will never be observed in a quantum system simultaneously: the interference pattern of waves in the double slit experiment will disappear if particles are detected at the slits. Modern quantitative versions of the concept allow for a continuous tradeoff between the visibility of the interference fringes and the probability of particle detection at a slit.

===Copenhagen interpretation===

The Copenhagen interpretation is a collection of views about the meaning of quantum mechanics, stemming from the work of Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and others. The term &quot;Copenhagen interpretation&quot; was apparently coined by Heisenberg during the 1950s to refer to ideas developed in the 1925–1927 period, glossing over his disagreements with Bohr. Consequently, there is no definitive historical statement of what the interpretation entails. Features common across versions of the Copenhagen interpretation include the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic, with probabilities calculated using the Born rule, and some form of complementarity principle. Moreover, the act of &quot;observing&quot; or &quot;measuring&quot; an object is irreversible, and no truth can be attributed to an object, except according to the results of its measurement. In the Copenhagen interpretation, complementarity means a particular experiment can demonstrate particle behavior (passing through a definite slit) or wave behavior (interference), but not both at the same time. In a Copenhagen-type view, the question of which slit a particle travels through has no meaning when there is no detector.

===Relational interpretation===
According to the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics, first proposed by Carlo Rovelli, observations such as those in the double-slit experiment result specifically from the interaction between the observer (measuring device) and the object being observed (physically interacted with), not any absolute property possessed by the object. In the case of an electron, if it is initially &quot;observed&quot; at a particular slit, then the observer–particle (photon–electron) interaction includes information about the electron&#x27;s position. This partially constrains the particle&#x27;s eventual location at the screen. If it is &quot;observed&quot; (measured with a photon) not at a particular slit but rather at the screen, then there is no &quot;which path&quot; information as part of the interaction, so the electron&#x27;s &quot;observed&quot; position on the screen is determined strictly by its probability function. This makes the resulting pattern on the screen the same as if each individual electron had passed through both slits.

===Many-worlds interpretation===
As with Copenhagen, there are multiple variants of the many-worlds interpretation. The unifying theme is that physical reality is identified with a wavefunction, and this wavefunction always evolves unitarily, i.e., following the Schrödinger equation with no collapses. Consequently, there are many parallel universes, which only interact with each other through interference. David Deutsch argues that the way to understand the double-slit experiment is that in each universe the particle travels through a specific slit, but its motion is affected by interference with particles in other universes, and this interference creates the observable fringes. David Wallace, another advocate of the many-worlds interpretation, writes that in the familiar setup of the double-slit experiment the two paths are not sufficiently separated for a description in terms of parallel universes to make sense.

===De Broglie–Bohm theory===

An alternative to the standard understanding of quantum mechanics, the De Broglie–Bohm theory states that particles also have precise locations at all times, and that their velocities are defined by the wave-function. So while a single particle will travel through one particular slit in the double-slit experiment, the so-called &quot;pilot wave&quot; that influences it will travel through both. The two slit de Broglie-Bohm trajectories were first calculated by Chris Dewdney while working with Chris Philippidis and Basil Hiley at Birkbeck College (London). The de Broglie-Bohm theory produces the same statistical results as standard quantum mechanics, but dispenses with many of its conceptual difficulties by adding complexity through an &quot;ad hoc&quot; quantum potential to guide the particles.

While the model is in many ways similar to Schrödinger equation, it is known to fail for relativistic cases and does not account for features such as particle creation or annihilation in quantum field theory. Many authors such as nobel laureates Werner Heisenberg, Sir Anthony James Leggett and Sir Roger Penrose have criticized it for not adding anything new.

More complex variants of this type of approach have appeared, for instance the &quot;three wave hypothesis&quot; of Ryszard Horodecki as well as other complicated combinations of de Broglie and Compton waves. To date there is no evidence that these are useful.

<doc id="8668" wikidata="Q92624" url="?curid=8668" title="Dan Bricklin">
<text>Daniel Singer Bricklin (born July 16, 1951) is an American businessman and engineer who is the co-creator, with Bob Frankston, of VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program. He also founded Software Garden, Inc., of which he is currently president, and Trellix, which he left in 2004. He currently serves as the chief technology officer of Alpha Software.

His book, &quot;Bricklin on Technology&quot;, was published by Wiley in May 2009. For his work with VisiCalc, Bricklin is often referred to as &quot;the father of the Spreadsheet&quot;. He was one of six people spotlighted when the Computer was denoted &quot;Machine of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1982.

==Early life and education==
Bricklin was born in Philadelphia, where he attended Akiba Hebrew Academy. He began his college as a mathematics major, but soon switched to computer science. He earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973, where he was a resident of Bexley Hall.

Upon graduating from MIT, Bricklin worked for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) where he was part of the team that worked on WPS-8 until 1976, when he began working for FasFax, a cash register manufacturer. In 1977, he returned to education, and was awarded a Master of Business Administration from Harvard University in 1979.

While a student at Harvard Business School, Bricklin co-developed VisiCalc in 1979, making it the first electronic spreadsheet readily available for home and office use. It ran on an Apple II computer, and was considered a fourth generation software program. VisiCalc is widely credited for fueling the rapid growth of the personal computer industry. Instead of doing financial projections with manually calculated spreadsheets, and having to recalculate with every single cell in the sheet, VisiCalc allowed the user to change any cell, and have the entire sheet automatically recalculated. This could turn 20 hours of work into 15 minutes and allowed for more creativity.

==Career==

===Software Arts===

In 1979, Bricklin and Frankston founded Software Arts, Inc., and began selling VisiCalc, via a separate company named VisiCorp. Along with Frankston, Bricklin started writing versions of the program for the Tandy TRS-80, Commodore PET and the Atari 800. Soon after its launch, VisiCalc became a fast seller at $100.

Software Arts also published TK/Solver and Spotlight, a desktop organizer for the IBM Personal Computer.&quot;

Bricklin was awarded the Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1981 for VisiCalc. Bricklin could not patent VisiCalc, since software inventions were not eligible for patent protection at the time.

Bricklin was chairman of Software Arts until 1985, the year that Software Arts was acquired by Lotus. He left and founded Software Garden.

===Software Garden===
Dan Bricklin founded Software Garden, a small consulting firm and developer of software applications, in 1985. The company&#x27;s focus was to produce and market “Dan Bricklin&#x27;s Demo Program”. The program allowed users to create demonstrations of their programs before they were even written, and was also used to create tutorials for Windows-based programs. Other versions released soon after included demo-it! He remained the president of the company until he co-founded Slate Corporation in 1990. In 1992, he became the vice president of Phoenix-based Slate corporation, and developed &quot;At Hand&quot;, a pen-based spreadsheet. When Slate closed in 1994, Bricklin returned to Software Garden.

His &quot;Dan Bricklin&#x27;s Overall Viewer&quot; (described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a visual way to display information in Windows-based software&quot;) was released in November 1994.

=== Corporation===
In 1995 Bricklin founded Trellix Corporation, named for &quot;Trellix Site Builder&quot;.

Trellix was bought by Interland (now Web.com) in 2003, and Bricklin became Interland&#x27;s chief technology officer until early 2004.

===Current work===
Bricklin continues to serve as president of Software Garden, a small company that develops and markets software tools he creates, as well as providing speaking and consulting services.

He has released Note Taker HD, an application that integrates handwritten notes on the Apple iPad tablet.

He is also developing wikiCalc, a collaborative, basic spreadsheet running on the Web.

He is currently the chief technology officer of Alpha Software in Burlington, Massachusetts, a company that creates tools to easily develop cross-platform mobile business applications.

==Affiliations==
In 1994, Bricklin was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. He is a founding trustee of the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council and has served on the boards of the Software Publishers Association and the Boston Computer Society.

He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2003 for the invention and creation of the electronic spreadsheet.

==Awards==
In 1981, Bricklin was given a Grace Murray Hopper Award for VisiCalc.

In 1996, Bricklin was awarded by the IEEE Computer Society with the Computer Entrepreneur Award for pioneering the development and commercialization of the spreadsheet and the profound changes it fostered in business and industry.

In 2003, Bricklin was given the Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award for being a technology change leader. He was recognized for having used information technology in an industry-transforming way. He has received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Newbury College. He also became a member of the National Academy of Engineering.

In 2004, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum &quot;for advancing the utility of personal computers by developing the VisiCalc electronic spreadsheet.&quot;

Bricklin:
* appeared in the 1996 documentary &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot;, as well as the 2005 documentary &quot;Aardvark&#x27;d: 12 Weeks with Geeks&quot;, in both cases discussing the development of VisiCalc.
* introduced the term &quot;friend-to-friend networking&quot; on August 11, 2000.
* also introduced the term cornucopia of the commons about the same time.

<doc id="8674" wikidata="Q1224749" url="?curid=8674" title="DECT">
<text>Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) is a cordless telephony standard maintained by ETSI. It originated in Europe, where it is the common standard, replacing earlier standards, such as CT1 and CT2. Since the DECT-2020 standard onwards, it also includes IoT communication.

Beyond Europe, it has been adopted by Australia and most countries in Asia and South America. North American adoption was delayed by United States radio-frequency regulations. This forced development of a variation of DECT called DECT 6.0, using a slightly different frequency range, which makes these units incompatible with systems intended for use in other areas, even from the same manufacturer. DECT has almost completely replaced other standards in most countries where it is used, with the exception of North America.

DECT was originally intended for fast roaming between networked base stations, and the first DECT product was Net3 wireless LAN. However, its most popular application is single-cell cordless phones connected to traditional analog telephone, primarily in home and small-office systems, though gateways with multi-cell DECT and/or DECT repeaters are also available in many private branch exchange (PBX) systems for medium and large businesses, produced by Panasonic, Mitel, Gigaset, Ascom, Cisco, Grandstream, Snom, Spectralink, and RTX. DECT can also be used for purposes other than cordless phones, such as baby monitors, wireless microphones and industrial sensors. The ULE Alliance&#x27;s DECT ULE and its &quot;HAN FUN&quot; protocol are variants tailored for home security, automation, and the internet of things (IoT).

The DECT standard includes the generic access profile (GAP), a common interoperability profile for simple telephone capabilities, which most manufacturers implement. GAP-conformance enables DECT handsets and bases from different manufacturers to interoperate at the most basic level of functionality, that of making and receiving calls. Japan uses its own DECT variant, J-DECT, which is supported by the DECT forum.

The New Generation DECT (NG-DECT) standard, marketed as CAT-iq by the DECT Forum, provides a common set of advanced capabilities for handsets and base stations. CAT-iq allows interchangeability across IP-DECT base stations and handsets from different manufacturers, while maintaining backward compatibility with GAP equipment. It also requires mandatory support for wideband audio.

DECT-2020 New Radio, marketed as NR+ (New Radio plus), is a 5G data transmission protocol which meets ITU-R IMT-2020 requirements for ultra-reliable low-latency and massive machine-type communications, and can co-exist with earlier DECT devices.

==Standards history==
The DECT standard was developed by ETSI in several phases, the first of which took place between 1988 and 1992 when the first round of standards were published. These were the ETS 300-175 series in nine parts defining the air interface, and ETS 300-176 defining how the units should be type approved. A technical report, ETR-178, was also published to explain the standard. Subsequent standards were developed and published by ETSI to cover interoperability profiles and standards for testing.

Named Digital European Cordless Telephone at its launch by CEPT in November 1987; its name was soon changed to Digital European Cordless Telecommunications, following a suggestion by Enrico Tosato of Italy, to reflect its broader range of application including data services. In 1995, due to its more global usage, the name was changed from European to Enhanced. DECT is recognized by the ITU as fulfilling the IMT-2000 requirements and thus qualifies as a 3G system. Within the IMT-2000 group of technologies, DECT is referred to as IMT-2000 Frequency Time (IMT-FT).

DECT was developed by ETSI but has since been adopted by many countries all over the World. The original DECT frequency band (1880–1900 MHz) is used in all countries in Europe. Outside Europe, it is used in most of Asia, Australia and South America. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission in 2005 changed channelization and licensing costs in a nearby band (1920–1930 MHz, or 1.9 GHz), known as Unlicensed Personal Communications Services (UPCS), allowing DECT devices to be sold in the U.S. with only minimal changes. These channels are reserved exclusively for voice communication applications and therefore are less likely to experience interference from other wireless devices such as baby monitors and wireless networks.

The New Generation DECT (NG-DECT) standard was first published in 2007; it was developed by ETSI with guidance from the Home Gateway Initiative through the DECT Forum to support IP-DECT functions in home gateway/IP-PBX equipment. The ETSI TS 102 527 series comes in five parts and covers wideband audio and mandatory interoperability features between handsets and base stations. They were preceded by an explanatory technical report, ETSI TR 102 570. The DECT Forum maintains the CAT-iq trademark and certification program; CAT-iq wideband voice profile 1.0 and interoperability profiles 2.0/2.1 are based on the relevant parts of ETSI TS 102 527.

The DECT Ultra Low Energy (DECT ULE) standard was announced in January 2011 and the first commercial products were launched later that year by Dialog Semiconductor. The standard was created to enable home automation, security, healthcare and energy monitoring applications that are battery powered. Like DECT, DECT ULE standard uses the 1.9 GHz band, and so suffers less interference than Zigbee, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi from microwave ovens, which all operate in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band. DECT ULE uses a simple star network topology, so many devices in the home are connected to a single control unit.

A new low-complexity audio codec, LC3plus, has been added as an option to the 2019 revision of the DECT standard. This codec is designed for high-quality voice and music applications such as wireless speakers, headphones, headsets, and microphones. LC3plus supports scalable 16-bit narrowband, wideband, super wideband, fullband, and 24-bit high-resolution fullband and ultra-band coding, with sample rates of 8, 16, 24, 32, 48 and 96 kHz and audio bandwidth of up to 48 kHz.

DECT-2020 New Radio protocol was published in July 2020; it defines a new physical interface based on cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CP-OFDM) capable of up to 1.2Gbit/s transfer rate with QAM-1024 modulation. The updated standard supports multi-antenna MIMO and beamforming, FEC channel coding, and hybrid automatic repeat request. There are 17 radio channel frequencies in the range from 450MHz up to 5,875MHz, and channel bandwidths of 1,728, 3,456, or 6,912kHz. Direct communication between end devices is possible with a mesh network topology. In October 2021, DECT-2020 NR was approved for the IMT-2020 standard, for use in Massive Machine Type Communications (MMTC) industry automation, Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), and professional wireless audio applications with point-to-point or multicast communications; the proposal was fast-tracked by ITU-R following real-world evaluations. The new protocol will be marketed as NR+ (New Radio plus) by the DECT Forum. OFDMA and SC-FDMA modulations were also considered by the ESTI DECT committee.

OpenD is an open-source framework designed to provide a complete software implementation of DECT ULE protocols on reference hardware from Dialog Semiconductor and DSP Group; the project is maintained by the DECT forum.

==Application==
The DECT standard originally envisaged three major areas of application:
* Domestic cordless telephony, using a single base station to connect one or more handsets to the public telecommunications network.
* Enterprise premises cordless PABXs and wireless LANs, using many base stations for coverage. Calls continue as users move between different coverage cells, through a mechanism called handover. Calls can be both within the system and to the public telecommunications network.
* Public access, using large numbers of base stations to provide high capacity building or urban area coverage as part of a public telecommunications network.
* Wireless microphone systems, for Speech optimized applications with Automatic frequency and interference management.

Of these, the domestic application (cordless home telephones) has been extremely successful. The enterprise PABX market, albeit much smaller than the cordless home market, has been very successful as well, and all the major PABX vendors have advanced DECT access options available. The public access application did not succeed, since public cellular networks rapidly out-competed DECT by coupling their ubiquitous coverage with large increases in capacity and continuously falling costs. There has been only one major installation of DECT for public access: in early 1998 Telecom Italia launched a wide-area DECT network known as &quot;Fido&quot; after much regulatory delay, covering major cities in Italy. The service was promoted for only a few months and, having peaked at 142,000 subscribers, was shut down in 2001.

DECT has been used for wireless local loop as a substitute for copper pairs in the &quot;last mile&quot; in countries such as India and South Africa. By using directional antennas and sacrificing some traffic capacity, cell coverage could extend to over . One example is the corDECT standard.

The first data application for DECT was Net3 wireless LAN system by Olivetti, launched in 1993 and discontinued in 1995. A precursor to Wi-Fi, Net3 was a micro-cellular data-only network with fast roaming between base stations and 520 kbit/s transmission rates.

Data applications such as electronic cash terminals, traffic lights, and remote door openers also exist, but have been eclipsed by Wi-Fi, 3G and 4G which compete with DECT for both voice and data.

==Characteristics==
The DECT standard specifies a means for a portable phone or &quot;Portable Part&quot; to access a fixed telephone network via radio. Base station or &quot;Fixed Part&quot; is used to terminate the radio link and provide access to a fixed line. A gateway is then used to connect calls to the fixed network, such as public switched telephone network (telephone jack), office PBX, ISDN, or VoIP over Ethernet connection.

Typical abilities of a domestic DECT Generic Access Profile (GAP) system include multiple handsets to one base station and one phone line socket. This allows several cordless telephones to be placed around the house, all operating from the same telephone jack. Additional handsets have a battery charger station that does not plug into the telephone system. Handsets can in many cases be used as intercoms, communicating between each other, and sometimes as walkie-talkies, intercommunicating without telephone line connection.

DECT operates in the 1880–1900 MHz band and defines ten frequency channels from 1881.792 MHz to 1897.344 MHz with a band gap of 1728 kHz.

DECT operates as a multicarrier frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) system. This means that the radio spectrum is divided into physical carriers in two dimensions: frequency and time. FDMA access provides up to 10 frequency channels, and TDMA access provides 24 time slots per every frame of 10ms. DECT uses time-division duplex (TDD), which means that down- and uplink use the same frequency but different time slots. Thus a base station provides 12 duplex speech channels in each frame, with each time slot occupying any available channel thus 10 × 12 = 120 carriers are available, each carrying 32 kbit/s.

DECT also provides frequency-hopping spread spectrum over TDMA/TDD structure for ISM band applications. If frequency-hopping is avoided, each base station can provide up to 120 channels in the DECT spectrum before frequency reuse. Each timeslot can be assigned to a different channel in order to exploit advantages of frequency hopping and to avoid interference from other users in asynchronous fashion.

DECT allows interference-free wireless operation to around outdoors. Indoor performance is reduced when interior spaces are constrained by walls.

DECT performs with fidelity in common congested domestic radio traffic situations. It is generally immune to interference from other DECT systems, Wi-Fi networks, video senders, Bluetooth technology, baby monitors and other wireless devices.

===Technical properties===

ETSI standards documentation ETSI EN 300 175 parts 1–8 (DECT), ETSI EN 300 444 (GAP) and ETSI TS 102 527 parts 1–5 (NG-DECT) prescribe the following technical properties:

=== Physical layer ===
The DECT physical layer uses FDMA/TDMA access with TDD.

Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) modulation is used: the binary one is coded with a frequency increase by 288 kHz, and the binary zero with frequency decrease of 288 kHz. With high quality connections, 2-, 4- or 8-level differential PSK modulation (DBPSK, DQPSK or D8PSK), which is similar to QAM-2, QAM-4 and QAM-8, can be used to transmit 1, 2, or 3 bits per each symbol. QAM-16 and QAM-64 modulations with 4 and 6 bits per symbol can be used for user data (B-field) only, with resulting transmission speeds of up to 5,068Mbit/s.

DECT provides dynamic channel selection and assignment; the choice of transmission frequency and time slot is always made by the mobile terminal. In case of interference in the selected frequency channel, the mobile terminal (possibly from suggestion by the base station) can initiate either intracell handover, selecting another channel/transmitter on the same base, or intercell handover, selecting a different base station altogether. For this purpose, DECT devices scan all idle channels at regular 30s intervals to generate a received signal strength indication (RSSI) list. When a new channel is required, the mobile terminal (PP) or base station (FP) selects a channel with the minimum interference from the RSSI list.

The maximum allowed power for portable equipment as well as base stations is 250 mW. A portable device radiates an average of about 10 mW during a call as it is only using one of 24 time slots to transmit. In Europe, the power limit was expressed as effective radiated power (ERP), rather than the more commonly used equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), permitting the use of high-gain directional antennas to produce much higher EIRP and hence long ranges.

===Data link control layer===
The DECT media access control layer controls the physical layer and provides connection oriented, connectionless and broadcast services to the higher layers.

The DECT data link layer uses Link Access Protocol Control (LAPC), a specially designed variant of the ISDN data link protocol called LAPD. They are based on HDLC.

GFSK modulation uses a bit rate of 1152 kbit/s, with a frame of 10ms (11520bits) which contains 24 time slots. Each slots contains 480 bits, some of which are reserved for physical packets and the rest is guard space. Slots 0–11 are always used for downlink (FP to PP) and slots 12–23 are used for uplink (PP to FP).

There are several combinations of slots and corresponding types of physical packets with GFSK modulation:
* Basic packet (P32) 420 or 424 bits &quot;full slot&quot;, used for normal speech transmission. User data (B-field) contains 320 bits.
* Low-capacity packet (P00) 96 bits at the beginning of the time slot (&quot;short slot&quot;). This packet only contains 64-bit header (A-field) used as a dummy bearer to broadcast base station identification when idle.
* Variable capacity packet (P00&quot;j&quot;) 100 + &quot;j&quot; or 104 + &quot;j&quot; bits, either two half-slots (0 ≤ &quot;j&quot; ≤ 136) or &quot;long slot&quot; (137 ≤ &quot;j&quot; ≤ 856). User data (B-field) contains &quot;j&quot; bits.
** P64 (&quot;j&quot; = 640), P67 (&quot;j&quot; = 672) &quot;long slot&quot;, used by NG-DECT/CAT-iq wideband voice and data.
* High-capacity packet (P80) 900 or 904 bits, &quot;double slot&quot;. This packet uses two time slots and always begins in an even time slot. The B-field is increased to 800 bits..

The 420/424 bits of a GFSK basic packet (P32) contain the following fields:
* 32 bits synchronization code (S-field): constant bit string AAAAE98AH for FP transmission, 55551675H for PP transmission
* 388 bits data (D-field), including
** 64 bits header (A-field): control traffic in logical channels C, M, N, P, and Q
** 320 bits user data (B-field): DECT payload, i.e. voice data
** 4 bits error-checking (X-field): CRC of the B-field
* 4 bits collision detection/channel quality (Z-field): optional, contains a copy of the X-field

The resulting full data rate is 32 kbit/s, available in both directions.

===Network layer===
The DECT network layer always contains the following protocol entities:
* Call Control (CC)
* Mobility Management (MM)

Optionally it may also contain others:
* Call Independent Supplementary Services (CISS)
* Connection Oriented Message Service (COMS)
* Connectionless Message Service (CLMS)

All these communicate through a Link Control Entity (LCE).

The call control protocol is derived from ISDN DSS1, which is a Q.931-derived protocol. Many DECT-specific changes have been made.

The mobility management protocol includes the management of identities, authentication, location updating, on-air subscription and key allocation. It includes many elements similar to the GSM protocol, but also includes elements unique to DECT.

Unlike the GSM protocol, the DECT network specifications do not define cross-linkages between the operation of the entities (for example, Mobility Management and Call Control). The architecture presumes that such linkages will be designed into the interworking unit that connects the DECT access network to whatever mobility-enabled fixed network is involved. By keeping the entities separate, the handset is capable of responding to any combination of entity traffic, and this creates great flexibility in fixed network design without breaking full interoperability.

DECT GAP is an interoperability profile for DECT. The intent is that two different products from different manufacturers that both conform not only to the DECT standard, but also to the GAP profile defined within the DECT standard, are able to interoperate for basic calling. The DECT standard includes full testing suites for GAP, and GAP products on the market from different manufacturers are in practice interoperable for the basic functions.

===Security===
The DECT media access control layer includes authentication of handsets to the base station using the DECT Standard Authentication Algorithm (DSAA). When registering the handset on the base, both record a shared 128-bit Unique Authentication Key (UAK). The base can request authentication by sending two random numbers to the handset, which calculates the response using the shared 128-bit key. The handset can also request authentication by sending a 64-bit random number to the base, which chooses a second random number, calculates the response using the shared key, and sends it back with the second random number.

The standard also provides encryption services with the DECT Standard Cipher (DSC). The encryption is fairly weak, using a 35-bit initialization vector and encrypting the voice stream with 64-bit encryption. While most of the DECT standard is publicly available, the part describing the DECT Standard Cipher was only available under a non-disclosure agreement to the phones&#x27; manufacturers from ETSI.

The properties of the DECT protocol make it hard to intercept a frame, modify it and send it later again, as DECT frames are based on time-division multiplexing and need to be transmitted at a specific point in time. Unfortunately very few DECT devices on the market implemented authentication and encryption procedures and even when encryption was used by the phone, it was possible to implement a man-in-the-middle attack impersonating a DECT base station and revert to unencrypted mode which allows calls to be listened to, recorded, and re-routed to a different destination.

After an unverified report of a successful attack in 2002, members of the deDECTed.org project actually did reverse engineer the DECT Standard Cipher in 2008, and as of 2010 there has been a viable attack on it that can recover the key.

In 2012, an improved authentication algorithm, the DECT Standard Authentication Algorithm 2 (DSAA2), and improved version of the encryption algorithm, the DECT Standard Cipher 2 (DSC2), both based on AES 128-bit encryption, were included as optional in the NG-DECT/CAT-iq suite.

DECT Forum also launched the DECT Security certification program which mandates the use of previously optional security features in the GAP profile, such as early encryption and base authentication.

===Profiles===
Various access profiles have been defined in the DECT standard:
* Public Access Profile (PAP) (deprecated)

== Additional specifications ==

=== DECT 6.0 ===
DECT 6.0 is a North American marketing term for DECT devices manufactured for the United States and Canada operating at 1.9 GHz. The &quot;6.0&quot; does not equate to a spectrum band; it was decided the term DECT 1.9 might have confused customers who equate larger numbers (such as the 2.4 and 5.8 in existing 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz cordless telephones) with later products. The term was coined by Rick Krupka, marketing director at Siemens and the DECT USA Working Group / Siemens ICM.

In North America, DECT suffers from deficiencies in comparison to DECT elsewhere, since the UPCS band (1920–1930 MHz) is not free from heavy interference. Bandwidth is half as wide as that used in Europe (1880–1900 MHz), the 4 mW average transmission power reduces range compared to the 10 mW permitted in Europe, and the commonplace lack of GAP compatibility among US vendors binds customers to a single vendor.

Before 1.9 GHz band was approved by the FCC in 2005, DECT could only operate in unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz Region 2 ISM bands; some users of Uniden WDECT 2.4 GHz phones reported interoperability issues with Wi-Fi equipment.

North-American products may not be used in Europe, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Africa, as they cause and suffer from interference with the local cellular networks. Use of such products is prohibited by European Telecommunications Authorities, PTA, Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka and the Independent Communication Authority of South Africa. European DECT products may not be used in the United States and Canada, as they likewise cause and suffer from interference with American and Canadian cellular networks, and use is prohibited by the Federal Communications Commission and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada.

DECT 8.0 HD is a marketing designation for North American DECT devices certified with CAT-iq 2.0 &quot;Multi Line&quot; profile.

=== NG-DECT/CAT-iq ===

Cordless Advanced Technology—internet and quality (CAT-iq) is a certification program maintained by the DECT Forum. It is based on New Generation DECT (NG-DECT) series of standards from ETSI.

NG-DECT/CAT-iq contains features that expand the generic GAP profile with mandatory support for high quality wideband voice, enhanced security, calling party identification, multiple lines, parallel calls, and similar functions to facilitate VoIP calls through SIP and H.323 protocols.

There are several CAT-iq profiles which define supported voice features:
* CAT-iq 1.0 &quot;HD Voice&quot; (ETSI TS 102 527-1): wideband audio, calling party line and name identification (CLIP/CNAP)
* CAT-iq 2.0 &quot;Multi Line&quot; (ETSI TS 102 527-3): multiple lines, line name, call waiting, call transfer, phonebook, call list, DTMF tones, headset, settings
* CAT-iq 2.1 &quot;Green&quot; (ETSI TS 102 527-5): 3-party conference, call intrusion, caller blocking (CLIR), answering machine control, SMS, power-management
* CAT-iq Data light data services, software upgrade over the air (SUOTA) (ETSI TS 102 527-4)
* CAT-iq IOT Smart Home connectivity (IOT) with DECT Ultra Low Energy (ETSI TS 102 939)

CAT-iq allows any DECT handset to communicate with a DECT base from a different vendor, providing full interoperability. CAT-iq 2.0/2.1 feature set is designed to support IP-DECT base stations found in office IP-PBX and home gateways.

=== DECT-2020 ===
DECT-2020, also called NR+, is a new radio standard by ETSI for the DECT bands worldwide. The standard was designed to meet a subset of the ITU IMT-2020 5G requirements that are applicable to IOT and Industrial internet of things. DECT-2020 is compliant with the requirements for Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications URLLC and massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) of IMT-2020.

DECT-2020 NR has new capabilities compared to DECT and DECT Evolution:

* Better multipath operation (OFDM Cyclic Prefix)
* Better radio sensitivity (OFDM and Turbocodes)
* Better resistance to radio interference (co-channel interference rejection)
* Better bandwidth utilization
* Mesh deployment

The DECT-2020 standard has been designed to co-exist in the DECT radio band with existing DECT deployments. It uses the same Time Division slot timing and Frequency Division center frequencies and uses pre-transmit scanning to minimize co-channel interference.

==DECT for data networks==
Other interoperability profiles exist in the DECT suite of standards, and in particular the DPRS (DECT Packet Radio Services) bring together a number of prior interoperability profiles for the use of DECT as a wireless LAN and wireless internet access service. With good range (up to indoors and using directional antennae outdoors), dedicated spectrum, high interference immunity, open interoperability and data speeds of around 500 kbit/s, DECT appeared at one time to be a superior alternative to Wi-Fi. The protocol capabilities built into the DECT networking protocol standards were particularly good at supporting fast roaming in the public space, between hotspots operated by competing but connected providers. The first DECT product to reach the market, Olivetti&#x27;s Net3, was a wireless LAN, and German firms Dosch &amp; Amand and Hoeft &amp; Wessel built niche businesses on the supply of data transmission systems based on DECT.

However, the timing of the availability of DECT, in the mid-1990s, was too early to find wide application for wireless data outside niche industrial applications. Whilst contemporary providers of Wi-Fi struggled with the same issues, providers of DECT retreated to the more immediately lucrative market for cordless telephones. A key weakness was also the inaccessibility of the U.S. market, due to FCC spectrum restrictions at that time. By the time mass applications for wireless Internet had emerged, and the U.S. had opened up to DECT, well into the new century, the industry had moved far ahead in terms of performance and DECT&#x27;s time as a technically competitive wireless data transport had passed.

==Health and safety==

DECT uses UHF radio, similar to mobile phones, baby monitors, Wi-Fi, and other cordless telephone technologies.

In North America, the 4 mW average transmission power reduces range compared to the 10 mW permitted in Europe.

The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) claims that due to a mobile phone&#x27;s adaptive power ability, a European DECT cordless phone&#x27;s radiation could actually exceed the radiation of a mobile phone. A European DECT cordless phone&#x27;s radiation has an average output power of 10 mW but is in the form of 100 bursts per second of 250 mW, a strength comparable to some mobile phones.

Most studies have been unable to demonstrate any link to health effects, or have been inconclusive. Electromagnetic fields may have an effect on protein expression in laboratory settings but have not yet been demonstrated to have clinically significant effects in real-world settings. The World Health Organization has issued a statement on medical effects of mobile phones which acknowledges that the longer term effects (over several decades) require further research.

<doc id="8678" wikidata="Q960436" url="?curid=8678" title="Donn">
<text>In Irish mythology, Donn (&quot;the dark one&quot;, from ) is an ancestor of the Gaels and is believed to have been a god of the dead. Donn is said to dwell in Tech Duinn (the &quot;house of Donn&quot; or &quot;house of the dark one&quot;), where the souls of the dead gather. He may have originally been an aspect of the Dagda. Folklore about Donn survived into the modern era in parts of Ireland, in which he is said to be a phantom horseman riding a white horse.

==Early literary sources==
A 9th-century poem says that Donn&#x27;s dying wish was that all his descendants would gather at Donn&#x27;s house or &quot;Tech Duinn&quot; (modern Irish &quot;Teach Duinn&quot;) after death: &quot;To me, to my house, you shall all come after your deaths&quot;. The 10th-century tale &quot;Airne Fíngein&quot; (&quot;Fíngen&#x27;s Vigil&quot;) says that Tech Duinn is where the souls of the dead gather. In their translation of &quot;Acallam na Senórach&quot;, Ann Dooley and Harry Roe commented that &quot;to go to the House of Donn in Irish tradition means to die&quot;. This suggests that the pagan Gaels saw Donn as their ancestor and believed they would go to his abode when they died. Tech Duinn may have been thought of as a place where the souls of the dead gathered before travelling to their final destination in the otherworld, or before being reincarnated. According to Julius Caesar, the Gauls also claimed descent from a god whom he likened to Dis Pater, the Roman god of the underworld.

The Christian writers who recorded the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; made Donn into Éber Donn one of the mythical Milesian ancestors of the Gaels. The Milesians invade Ireland and take it from the Tuatha Dé Danann. During their invasion, Donn slights Ériu, one of the eponymous goddesses of Ireland, and he drowns in a shipwreck off the southwest coast. Donn is then buried on a rocky island which becomes known as Tech Duinn. In the literature, Tech Duinn is said to lie at or beyond the western edge of Ireland. Tech Duinn is commonly identified with Bull Rock, an islet off the western tip of the Beara Peninsula. Bull Rock resembles a dolmen or portal tomb as it has a natural tunnel through it, allowing the sea to pass under it as if through a portal. In Ireland there was a belief that the souls of the dead departed westwards over the sea with the setting sun.

The &quot;Metrical Dindshenchas&quot; entry for &quot;Tech Duinn&quot; recounts the tale:Through the incantations of the druids a storm came upon them, and the ship wherein Donn was foundered. &#x27;Let his body be carried to yonder high rock&#x27;, says Amairgen: &#x27;his folk shall come to this spot.&#x27; So hence it is called Tech Duinn: and for this cause, according to the heathen, the souls of sinners visit Tech Duinn before they go to hell, and give their blessing, ere they go, to the soul of Donn. But as for the righteous soul of a penitent, it beholds the place from afar, and is not borne astray. Such, at least, is the belief of the heathen. – Translation by E. Gwynn&quot;

In the tale &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot; (&quot;The Destruction of Dá Derga&#x27;s Hostel&quot;), king Conaire Mór meets his death in Bruiden Dá Derga (the &quot;great hall or hostel of the red god&quot;). On his way to the hostel, Conaire meets three red men riding red horses from the otherworld. They foretell his doom and tell him &quot;we ride the horses of Donn ... although we are alive, we are dead&quot;. Donn is called &quot;king of the dead&quot; in the tale. It has been suggested that Dá Derga and Dá Derga&#x27;s Hostel is another name for Donn and his abode. It may be a name for the death god in the context of violent death or sacrifice, hence the name &quot;red god&quot;.

In the tale &quot;Tochmarc Treblainne&quot; (&quot;The Wooing of Treblann&quot;), the otherworld woman Treblann elopes with the mortal man Fráech, who sends her to safety in Tech Duinn while he embarks on a quest. In this tale, Donn is said to be the son or foster-son of the Dagda. Dáithí Ó hÓgáin notes similarities between the two and suggests that Donn was originally an epithet of the Dagda.

Donn is the father of Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, whom he gave in fosterage to the god of youth, Aengus mac Óg, to raise.

==Modern sources==
Folklore about Donn survived into the early modern era. In County Limerick, a Donn Fírinne was said to dwell in the sacred hill of Cnoc Fírinne (Knockfeerina or Knockfierna), and folklore told of people being brought into the hill to be with Donn when they died. He was said to appear as a phantom horseman riding a white horse. He was also associated with the weather: thunder and lightning meant that Donn Fírinne was riding his horse through the sky, and if clouds were over the hill it meant that he was gathering them together to make rain. This imagery may have been influenced by the lore of Odin and his horse Sleipnir from the Norse settlers in Limerick. Donn Fírinne was also said to appear and warn anyone who interfered with his hill. On the west coast of County Clare there was a Donn na Duimhche or Donn Dumhach (&quot;Donn of the dunes&quot;), who &quot;was also often encountered as a night-horseman&quot;. In later folklore, the name &#x27;Donn&#x27; came to mean an &#x27;otherworld lord&#x27; in general.

In modern Irish &quot;donn&quot; is the most common word for the colour brown, and by extension can also mean &quot;sturdy (like) wood&quot;. This is one possible etymology of the English colour &quot;dun&quot; (greyish brown).

<doc id="8681" wikidata="Q3113333" url="?curid=8681" title="Data compression ratio">
<text>Data compression ratio, also known as compression power, is a measurement of the relative reduction in size of data representation produced by a data compression algorithm. It is typically expressed as the division of uncompressed size by compressed size.

==Definition==
Data compression ratio is defined as the ratio between the &quot;uncompressed size&quot; and &quot;compressed size&quot;:

:formula_1

Thus, a representation that compresses a file&#x27;s storage size from 10 MB to 2 MB has a compression ratio of 10/2 = 5, often notated as an explicit ratio, 5:1 (read &quot;five&quot; to &quot;one&quot;), or as an implicit ratio, 5/1. This formulation applies equally for compression, where the uncompressed size is that of the original; and for decompression, where the uncompressed size is that of the reproduction. 

Sometimes the &quot;space saving&quot; is given instead, which is defined as the reduction in size relative to the uncompressed size: 

:formula_2

Thus, a representation that compresses the storage size of a file from 10 MB to 2 MB yields a space saving of 1 - 2/10 = 0.8, often notated as a percentage, 80%.

For signals of indefinite size, such as streaming audio and video, the compression ratio is defined in terms of uncompressed and compressed data rates instead of data sizes: 

:formula_3

and instead of space saving, one speaks of data-rate saving, which is defined as the data-rate reduction relative to the uncompressed data rate: 

:formula_4

For example, uncompressed songs in CD format have a data rate of 16 bits/channel x 2 channels x 44.1 kHz ≅ 1.4 Mbit/s, whereas AAC files on an iPod are typically compressed to 128 kbit/s, yielding a compression ratio of 10.9, for a data-rate saving of 0.91, or 91%. 

When the uncompressed data rate is known, the compression ratio can be inferred from the compressed data rate.

==Lossless vs. Lossy==
Lossless compression of digitized data such as video, digitized film, and audio preserves all the information, but it does not generally achieve compression ratio much better than 2:1 because of the intrinsic entropy of the data. Compression algorithms which provide higher ratios either incur very large overheads or work only for specific data sequences (e.g. compressing a file with mostly zeros). In contrast, lossy compression (e.g. JPEG for images, or MP3 and Opus for audio) can achieve much higher compression ratios at the cost of a decrease in quality, such as Bluetooth audio streaming, as visual or audio compression artifacts from loss of important information are introduced. A compression ratio of at least 50:1 is needed to get 1080i video into a 20 Mbit/s MPEG transport stream.

==Uses==
The data compression ratio can serve as a measure of the complexity of a data set or signal. In particular it is used to approximate the algorithmic complexity. It is also used to see how much of a file is able to be compressed without increasing its original size.

<doc id="8683" wikidata="Q130857" url="?curid=8683" title="Disc jockey">
<text>A disc jockey, more commonly abbreviated as DJ, is a person who plays recorded music for an audience. Types of DJs include radio DJs (who host programs on music radio stations), club DJs (who work at nightclubs or music festivals), mobile DJs (who are hired to work at public and private events such as weddings, parties, or festivals), and turntablists (who use record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records). Originally, the &quot;disc&quot; in &quot;disc jockey&quot; referred to shellac and later vinyl records, but nowadays DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to also describe persons who mix music from other recording media such as cassettes, CDs or digital audio files on a CDJ, controller, or even a laptop. DJs may adopt the title &quot;DJ&quot; in front of their real names, adopted pseudonyms, or stage names.

DJs commonly use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously. This enables them to blend tracks together to create transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. This can involve aligning the beats of the music sources so their rhythms and tempos do not clash when played together and enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized DJ mixers, small audio mixers with crossfader and cue functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in headphones and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a DJ controller device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a microphone to speak to the audience; effects units such as reverb to create sound effects and electronic musical instruments such as drum machines and synthesizers.
==List of popular DJs==
Some of the most popular DJs are Skrillex, David Guetta, Porter Robinson, deadmau5, Avicii, Calvin Harris, Martin Garrix, Marshmello, Zedd, Alan Walker, Eric Prydz, DJ Snake, R3HAB, Timmy Trumpet, Tiësto, Steve Aoki, Diplo, Nicky Romero, Lost Frequencies, Daft Punk.
==Etymology==
The term &quot;disc jockey&quot; was ostensibly coined by radio gossip commentator Walter Winchell in 1935 to describe the radio work of Martin Block. The phrase first appeared in print in a 1941 &quot;Variety&quot; magazine. Originally, the word &quot;disc&quot; in &quot;disc jockey&quot; referred to phonograph or gramophone records and was used to describe radio personalities who introduced them on the air.

==Role==
&quot;DJ&quot; is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including vinyl records, cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files stored on USB stick or laptop. DJs typically perform for a live audience in a nightclub or dance club or a TV, radio broadcast audience, or an online radio audience. DJs also create mixes, remixes and tracks that are recorded for later sale and distribution. In hip hop music, DJs may create beats, using percussion breaks, basslines and other musical content sampled from pre-existing records. In hip hop, rappers and MCs use these beats to rap over. Some DJs adopt the title &quot;DJ&quot; as part of their names (e.g., DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Qbert, DJ Shadow and DJ Yoda). Professional DJs often specialize in a specific genre of music, such as techno, house or hip hop music. DJs typically have extensive knowledge about the music they specialize in. Many DJs are avid music collectors of vintage, rare or obscure tracks and records.

==Types==
===Club DJs===

Club DJs, commonly referred to as DJs in general, play music at musical events, such as parties at music venues or bars, clubs, music festivals, corporate and private events. Typically, club DJs mix music recordings from two or more sources using different mixing techniques to produce a non-stopping flow of music. Mixing began with hip hop in the 1970s and would subsequently expand to other genres in especially (but not exclusively) dance music. 

One key technique used for seamlessly transitioning from one song to another is beatmatching. A DJ who mostly plays and mixes one specific music genre is often given the title of that genre; for example, a DJ who plays hip hop music is called a hip hop DJ, a DJ who plays house music is a house DJ, a DJ who plays techno is called a techno DJ, and so on.
The quality of a DJ performance (often called a DJ mix or DJ set) consists of two main features: technical skills, or how well the DJ can operate the equipment and produce smooth transitions between two or more recordings and a playlist; and the ability of a DJ to select the most suitable recordings, also known as &quot;reading the crowd&quot;.

===Hip hop DJs===
DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa were members of a block party at South Bronx from 1973 onwards. Kool Herc played records such as James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Give It Up or Turnit a Loose&quot;, Jimmy Castor&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Just Begun&quot;, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;Melting Pot&quot;, Incredible Bongo Band&#x27;s &quot;Bongo Rock&quot; and &quot;Apache&quot;, and UK rock band Babe Ruth&#x27;s &quot;The Mexican&quot;. With Bronx clubs struggling with street gangs, uptown DJs catering to an older disco crowd with different aspirations, and commercial radio also catering to a demographic distinct from teenagers in the Bronx, Herc&#x27;s parties had a ready-made audience.

DJ Kool Herc developed the style that was the blueprint for hip hop music. Herc used the record to focus on a short, heavily percussive part in it: the &quot;break&quot;. Since this part of the record was the one the dancers liked best, Herc isolated the break and prolonged it by changing between two record players. As one record reached the end of the break, he cued a second record back to the beginning of the break, which allowed him to extend a relatively short section of music into a &quot;five-minute loop of fury&quot;. This innovation had its roots in what Herc called &quot;The Merry-Go-Round&quot;, a technique by which the DJ switched from break to break at the height of the party. This technique is specifically called &quot;The Merry-Go-Round&quot; because according to Herc, it takes one &quot;back and forth with no slack.&quot;

===Radio DJs===

Radio DJs or radio personalities introduce and play music broadcasts on AM, FM, digital or Internet radio stations.

===Dancehall/reggae deejays===

In Jamaican music, a deejay (DJ) is a reggae or dancehall musician who sings and &quot;toasts&quot; (recites poetry) to an instrumental riddim. Deejays are not to be confused with DJs from other music genres like hip hop, where they select and play music. Dancehall/reggae DJs who select riddims to play are called selectors. Deejays whose style is nearer to singing are sometimes called singjays.

The term deejay originated in the 1960s and 1970s when performers such as U-Roy and King Stitt toasted over the instrumental (dub music) versions of popular records. These versions were often released on the flip side to the song&#x27;s 45 record. This gave the deejays the chance to create on-the-fly lyrics to the music. Big Youth, and I-Roy were famous deejays in Jamaica.

===Turntablists===
Turntablists, also called battle DJs, use turntables and DJ mixer to manipulate recorded sounds to produce new music. In essence, they use DJ equipment as a musical instrument. Perhaps the best-known turntablist technique is scratching. Turntablists often participate in DJ contests like DMC World DJ Championships and Red Bull 3Style.

=== Residents ===

A resident DJ performs at a venue on a regular basis or permanently. They would perform regularly (typically under an agreement) in a particular discotheque, a particular club, a particular event, or a particular broadcasting station. Residents have a decisive influence on the club or a series of events. Per agreement with the management or company, the DJ would have to perform under agreed times and dates. Typically, DJs perform as residents for two or three times in a week, for example, on Friday and Saturday. DJs who make a steady income from a venue are also considered resident DJs.

Examples for resident DJs are:

* Alfredo Fiorito, Richie Hawtin, Sven Väth – Amnesia, Ibiza, Spain
* Martin Garrix – Hï Ibiza, Ibiza, Spain
* Larry Levan – Paradise Garage, New York City, US
* David Mancuso – The Loft, New York City
* Tiësto, Deadmau5, Calvin Harris – Hakkasan, Las Vegas, US
* Kaskade – Encore Beach Club, Las Vegas, US
* Ben Klock, Marcel Dettmann, Tama Sumo – Berghain, Berlin, Germany
* Fish Go Deep – Cork, Ireland
* Djsky – Ghana, West Africa
* Tale of Us – Hï Ibiza, Ibiza, Spain
* Claptone – Pacha, Ibiza, Spain

===Other types===
*Bedroom DJs – A non-professional DJ who mixes music in their room as a hobby, rather than on radio or in a music venue such as a bar or a nightclub. Bedroom DJs are normally motivated by a desire to hone their skills and have fun with friends. Many professional DJs start out as bedroom DJs but not all bedroom DJs want to become professional–some are content being hobbyists. Most bedroom DJs generally have small set-ups of basic equipment. They might be learning how to DJ on a laptop or have a controller.
* Mobile DJs – DJs with their own portable audio sound systems who specialize in performing at gatherings such as block parties, street fairs, taverns, weddings, birthdays, school and corporate events. Mobile DJs may also offer lighting packages and video systems.

* DJanes – a term describing women DJs used in countries such as Germany that employ grammatical gender in their languages
* Celebrity DJs – widely known celebrities performing as DJs.

== Women DJs ==

In Western popular music, even though there are relatively few women DJs and turntablists, women musicians have achieved great success in singing and songwriting roles, however, they are given much less representation than men DJs. Part of this may stem from a generally low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs. A 2013 &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; article by Rosina Ncube stated that there are &quot;... few women in record production and sound engineering.&quot; Ncube states that &quot;[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are women producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their counterparts.&quot; The vast majority of students in music technology programs are male. In hip hop music, the low percentage of women DJs and turntablists may stem from the overall men&#x27;s domination of the entire hip hop music industry. Most of the top rappers, MCs, DJs, record producers and music executives are men. There are a small number of high-profile women, but they are rare. 

In 2007, Mark Katz&#x27;s article &quot;Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle&quot;, stated that &quot;very few women [do turntablism] battle[s]; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years.&quot; In 2010, Rebekah Farrugia said &quot;the male-centricity of electronic dance music (EDM) culture&quot; contributes to &quot;a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces.&quot; While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as &quot;male technophilia&quot;. Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She says:an exclusive focus on women&#x27;s supposed failure to enter the field – is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put the burden of proof entirely on women and to [unreasonably] blame them for their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values. An equally challenging question is why and how boys have come to love things technical, how boys have historically been socialized as technophiles.

Lucy Green has focused on gender in relation to musical performers and creators, and specifically on educational frameworks as they relate to both. She suggests that women&#x27;s alienation from &quot;areas that have a strong technological tendency such as DJing, sound engineering and producing&quot; are &quot;not necessarily about their dislike of these instruments but relates to the interrupting effect of their dominantly masculine delineations&quot;. Despite this, women and girls do increasingly engage in turntable and DJ practices, individually and collectively, and &quot;carve out spaces for themselves in EDM and DJ Culture&quot;. A 2015 article cited a number of prominent women DJs: Hannah Wants, Ellen Allien, Miss Kittin, Monika Kruse, Nicole Moudaber, B.Traits, Magda, Nina Kraviz, Nervo, and Annie Mac. Two years later, another article brings out a list with world-famous women DJs including Nastia, tINY, Nora En Pure, Anja Schneider, Peggy Gou, Maya Jane Coles, and Eli &amp; Fur.

American DJ The Blessed Madonna has been called &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most exciting turntablists&quot;. Her stage name is a tribute to her mother&#x27;s favorite Catholic saint, Black Madonna. In 2018, The Blessed Madonna played herself as an in-residence DJ for the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto Online&quot;, as part of the &quot;After Hours&quot; DLC.

There are various projects dedicated to the promotion and support of these practices such as Female DJs London. Some artists and collectives go beyond these practices to be more gender inclusive. For example, Discwoman, a New York-based collective and booking agency, describe themselves as &quot;representing and showcasing cis women, trans women and genderqueer talent.&quot;

In Japan, the newest Bushiroad franchise: &quot;D4DJ&quot; focuses on an all-women DJ unit.

==Equipment==
DJs use equipment that enables them to play multiple sources of recorded music and mix them to create seamless transitions and unique arrangements of songs. An important tool for DJs is the specialized DJ mixer, a small audio mixer with a crossfader and cue functions. The crossfader enables the DJ to blend or transition from one song to another. The cue knobs or switches allow the DJ to &quot;listen&quot; to a source of recorded music in headphones before playing it for the live club or broadcast audience. Previewing the music in headphones helps the DJ pick the next track they want to play, cue up the track to the desired starting location, and align the two tracks&#x27; beats in traditional situations where auto-sync technology is not being used. This process ensures that the selected song will mix well with the currently playing music. DJs may align the beats of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when they are played together to help create a smooth transition from one song to another. Other equipment may include a microphone, effects units such as reverb, and electronic musical instruments such as drum machines and synthesizers.

As music technology has progressed, DJs have adopted different types of equipment to play and mix music, all of which are still commonly used. Traditionally, DJs used two turntables plugged into a DJ mixer to mix music on vinyl records. As compact discs became popular media for publishing music, specialized high-quality CD players known as CDJs were developed for DJs. CDJs can take the place of turntables or be used together with turntables. Many CDJs can now play digital music files from USB flash drives or SD cards in addition to CDs. With the spread of portable laptops, tablets, and smartphone computers, DJs began using software together with specialized sound cards and DJ controller hardware. DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer or be used instead of a hardware mixer.

===Turntables===
Turntables allow DJs to play vinyl records. By adjusting the playback speed of the turntable, either by adjusting the speed knob or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the tempos of different records so their rhythms can be played together at the same time without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as beatmatching. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keep the record moving in sync with the turntable with a slipmat that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. Direct-drive turntables are the type preferred by DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor can be damaged by this type of manipulation. Some DJs, most commonly those who play hip hop music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for scratching, beat juggling, and other turntablism techniques.

===CDJs/media players===

CDJs / media players are high-quality digital media players made for DJing. They often have large jog wheels and pitch controls to allow DJs to manipulate the playback of digital files for beatmatching similar to how DJs manipulate vinyl records on turntables. CDJs often have features such as loops and waveform displays similar to DJ software. Originally designed to play music from compact discs, they now can play digital music files stored on USB flash drives and SD cards. Some CDJs can also connect to a computer running DJ software to act as a DJ controller. Modern media players have the ability to stream music from online music providers such as Beatport, Beatsource, Tidal and SoundCloud GO.

===DJ mixers===
DJ mixers are small audio mixing consoles specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer used by a record producer or audio engineer; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard recording studio mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have many of the same features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, effects units, etc.), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the crossfader. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader&#x27;s travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two-channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a DJ controller instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.

===Headphones===

DJs generally use higher-quality headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate the sounds of the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to listen to one side of the headphones while turning the other headphone away (so they can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enable DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.

Closed-back headphones are highly recommended for DJs to block outside noise as the environment of DJ usually tends to be very noisy. Standard headphones have a 3.5mm jack but DJ equipment usually requires ¼ inch jack. Most specialized DJ Headphones have an adapter to switch between a 3.5mm jack and ¼ inch jack. Detachable coiled cables are perfect for DJ Headphones.

===Software===


DJs have changed their equipment as new technologies are introduced. The earliest DJs in pop music, in 1970s discos, used record turntables, vinyl records and audio consoles. In the 1970s, DJs would have to lug heavy direct-drive turntables and crates of records to clubs and shows. In the 1980s, many DJs transitioned to compact cassettes. In the 1990s and 2000s, many DJs switched to using digital audio such as CDs and MP3 files. As technological advances made it practical to store large collections of digital music files on a laptop computer, DJ software was developed so DJs could use a laptop as a source of music instead of transporting CDs or vinyl records to gigs. Unlike most music player software designed for regular consumers, DJ software can play at least two audio files simultaneously, display the waveforms of the files on screen and enable the DJ to listen to either source.

The waveforms allow the DJ to see what is coming next in the music and how the playback of different files is aligned. The software analyzes music files to identify their tempo and where the beats are. The analyzed information can be used by the DJ to help manually beatmatch like with vinyl records or the software can automatically synchronize the beats. Digital signal processing algorithms in software allow DJs to adjust the tempo of recordings independently of their pitch (and musical key, a feature known as &quot;keylock&quot;. Some software analyzes the loudness of the music for automatic normalization with ReplayGain and detects the musical key. Additionally, DJ software can store cue points, set loops, and apply effects.

As tablet computers and smartphones became widespread, DJ software was written to run on these devices in addition to laptops.
DJ software requires specialized hardware in addition to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer-grade, regular sound card integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs need to be able to output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or the main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher-quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.

===Timecode===
Special vinyl records (or CDs/digital files played with CDJs) can be used with DJ software to play digital music files with DJ software as if they were pressed onto vinyl, allowing turntablism techniques to be used with digital files. These vinyl records do not have music recordings pressed onto them. Instead, they are pressed with a special signal, referred to as &quot;timecode&quot;, to control DJ software. The DJ software interprets changes in the playback speed, direction, and position of the timecode signal and manipulates the digital files it is playing in the same way that the turntable manipulates the timecode record.

This requires a specialized DJ sound card with at least 4 channels (2 stereo pairs) of inputs and outputs. With this setup, the DJ software typically outputs unmixed signals from the music files to an external hardware DJ mixer. Some DJ mixers have integrated USB sound cards that allow DJ software to connect directly to the mixer without requiring a separate sound card.

===DJ controllers===

A DJ software can be used to mix audio files on the computer instead of a separate hardware mixer. When mixing on a computer, DJs often use a DJ controller device that mimics the layout of two turntables plus a DJ mixer to control the software rather than the computer keyboard &amp; touchpad on a laptop, or the touchscreen on a tablet computer or smartphone. Many DJ controllers have an integrated sound card with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs) that allow the DJ to use headphones to preview music before playing it on the main output.

===Other equipment===
* A microphone, so that the DJ can introduce songs and speak to the audience over the sound system.
* Electronic effects units such as delay, reverb, octave, equalizer, chorus, etc.
* Multi-stylus head shells, which allow a DJ to play different grooves of the same record at the same time.
* Samplers, sequencers, electronic musical keyboards (synthesizers), effects pedals (effects unit) or drum machines.
* PA system or sound reinforcement system (power amplifiers and speaker enclosures), typically including subwoofer cabinets for deep bass (or, if a DJ is broadcasting and/or recording a set, broadcasting equipment or recording gear)
*Monitor speakers, for listening to the &quot;house mix&quot; that is playing over the main speakers

==Techniques==

Several techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the cueing, equalization and audio mixing of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depend largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.

Club DJ turntable techniques include beatmatching, phrasing and slip-cueing to preserve energy on a dance floor. Turntablism embodies the art of cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, phase shifting, back spinning and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of samples in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a musical instrument rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use harmonic mixing to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys. Other techniques include chopping, screwing and looping.

Recent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include phrasing and beatmatching, which can be partially or completely automated by using DJ software that performs automatic synchronization of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled &quot;sync&quot;. Most DJ mixers now include a beat counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in beats per minute (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.

In the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.

===Miming===
In DJ culture, miming refers to the practice of DJ&#x27;s pantomiming the actions of live-mixing a set on stage while a pre-recorded mix plays over the sound system. Miming mixing in a live performance is considered to be controversial within DJ culture. Some within the DJ community say that miming is increasingly used as a technique by celebrity model DJs who may lack mixing skills, but can draw big crowds to a venue.

During a DJ tour for the release of the French group Justice&#x27;s &quot;A Cross the Universe&quot; in November 2008, controversy arose when a photograph of Augé DJing with an unplugged Akai MPD24 surfaced. The photograph sparked accusations that Justice&#x27;s live sets were faked. Augé has since said that the equipment was unplugged very briefly before being reattached and the band put a three-photo set of the incident on their MySpace page. After a 2013 Disclosure concert, the duo was criticized for pretending to live mix to a playback of a pre-recorded track. Disclosure&#x27;s Guy Lawrence said they did not deliberately intend to mislead their audience, and cited miming by other DJs such as David Guetta.

==History==

Playing recorded music for dancing and parties rose with the mass marketing of home phonographs in the late 19th century. 

British radio disc jockey Jimmy Savile hosted his first live dance party in 1943 using a single turntable and a makeshift sound system. Four years later, Savile began using two turntables welded together to form a single DJ console. In 1947, the Whisky à Gogo opened in Paris as the first discotheque. In 1959, one of the first discos in Germany, the Scotch Club, opened in Aachen and visiting journalist Klaus Quirini (later DJ Heinrich) made comments, conducted audience games, and announced songs while playing records. The first song he played was the hit &quot;Ein Schiff wird kommen&quot; by Lale Andersen.

In the 1960s, Rudy Bozak began making the first DJ mixers, mixing consoles specialized for DJing.
In the late 1960s to early 1970s Jamaican sound system culture, producer and sound system operator (DJ), (Jamaican) King Tubby and producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry were pioneers of the genre known as dub music. They experimented with tape-based composition; emphasized repetitive rhythmic structures (often stripped of their harmonic elements); electronically manipulated spatiality; sonically manipulated pre-recorded musical materials from mass media; and remixed music among other innovative techniques. It is widely known that the Jamaican dancehall culture has had and continues to have a significant impact on the American hip hop culture.

DJ turntablism has origins in the invention of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism and mixing, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by engineer Shuichi Obata at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.

In 1972, Technics started making their SL-1200 turntable, featuring high torque direct drive design. The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable direct drive enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. Hip hop DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with turntablism techniques such as scratching and beat juggling rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by DJ Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Afrika Bambaataa, as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. 

In 1980, Japanese company Roland released the TR-808, an analog rhythm/drum machine, which has unique artificial sounds, such as its booming bass and sharp snare, and a metronome-like rhythm. Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s use of the instrument in 1980 influenced hip hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa, after which the TR-808 would be widely adopted by hip hop DJs, with 808 sounds remaining central to hip-hop music ever since. The Roland TB-303, a bass synthesizer released in 1981, had a similar impact on electronic dance music genres such as techno and house music, along with Roland&#x27;s TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines.

In 1982, the Compact Disc (CD) format was released, popularizing digital audio. In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10, was introduced. In January of that same year at the BeOS Developer Conference, N2IT demonstrated FinalScratch, the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take some time for this novel concept to catch on with the &quot;die-hard Vinyl DJs&quot;, this would become the first step in the Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry&#x27;s first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the &quot;CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit&quot;, to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.

In 2001, Pioneer DJ began producing the CDJ-1000 CD player, making the use of digital music recordings with traditional DJ techniques practical for the first time. As the 2000s progressed, laptop computers became more powerful and affordable. DJ software, specialized DJ sound cards, and DJ controllers were developed for DJs to use laptops as a source of music rather than turntables or CDJs. In the 2010s, like laptops before them, tablet computers and smartphones became more powerful &amp; affordable. DJ software was written to run on these more portable devices instead of laptops, although laptops remain the more common type of computer for DJing.

==Health concerns==

The risk of DJs working in nightclubs with loud music includes noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus. Nightclubs constantly exceed safe levels of noise exposure with average sound levels ranging from 93.2 to 109.7 dB. Constant music exposure creates temporary and permanent auditory dysfunction for professional DJs with average levels at 96dB being above the recommended level, at which ear protection is mandatory for industry. Three-quarters of DJs have tinnitus and are at risk of tenosynovitis in the wrists and other limbs. Tenosynovitis results from staying in the same position over multiple gigs for scratching motion and cueing, this would be related to a repetitive strain injury. Gigs can last 4-5 hours in the nightlife and hospitality industry, as a result, there are potential complications of prolonged standing which include slouching, varicose veins, cardiovascular disorders, joint compression, and muscle fatigue. This is common for other staff to experience as well including bartenders and security staff for example.

<text>Detroit ( , ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is situated on the bank of the Detroit River across from Windsor, Ontario. It had a population of 639,111 at the 2020 census, making it the 26th-most populous city in the United States and the largest U.S. city on the Canada–United States border. The Metro Detroit area, home to 4.3 million people, is the second-largest in the Midwest after the Chicago metropolitan area and the 14th-largest in the United States. The seat of Wayne County, Detroit is a significant cultural center known for its contributions to music, art, architecture and design, in addition to its historical automotive and industrial background.

In 1701, Royal French explorers Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and Alphonse de Tonty founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit. During the late 19th and early 20th century, it became an important industrial hub at the center of the Great Lakes region. The city&#x27;s population rose to be the fourth-largest in the nation by 1920, with the expansion of the automotive industry in the early 20th century. One of its main features, the Detroit River, became the busiest commercial hub in the world. In the mid-20th century, Detroit entered a state of urban decay which has continued to the present, as a result of industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs in the auto industry, and rapid suburbanization. Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the 1950 census, Detroit&#x27;s population has declined by more than 65 percent. In 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, but successfully exited in 2014.

Detroit is a port on the Detroit River, one of the four major straits that connect the Great Lakes system to the St. Lawrence Seaway. The city anchors the third-largest regional economy in the Midwest and the 16th-largest in the United States. It is also best known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry, and the &quot;Big Three&quot; auto manufacturers—General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis North America (Chrysler)—are all headquartered in Metro Detroit. It houses the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, one of the most important hub airports in the United States. Detroit and its neighboring Canadian city Windsor constitute the second-busiest international crossing in North America, after San Diego–Tijuana.

Detroit&#x27;s culture is marked with diversity, having both local and international influences. Detroit gave rise to the music genres of Motown and techno, and also played an important role in the development of jazz, hip-hop, rock, and punk. A globally unique stock of architectural monuments and historic places was the result of the city&#x27;s rapid growth in its boom years. Since the 2000s, conservation efforts have managed to save many architectural pieces and achieve several large-scale revitalizations, including the restoration of several historic theaters and entertainment venues, high-rise renovations, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. Detroit is an increasingly popular tourist destination which caters to about 16 million visitors per year. In 2015, Detroit was given a name called &quot;City of Design&quot; by UNESCO, the first and only U.S. city to receive that designation.

==History==


===Toponymy===
Detroit is named after the Detroit River, connecting Lake Huron with Lake Erie. The name comes from the French language word meaning as the city was situated on a narrow north–south passage of water linking the two lakes. The river was known as in the French language, which means . In the historical context, the strait included the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and the Detroit River.

===Indigenous settlement===

Paleo-Indians inhabited areas near Detroit as early as 11,000 years ago including the culture referred to as the Mound Builders. By the 17th century, the region was inhabited by Huron, Odawa, Potawatomi, and Iroquois peoples. The area is known by the Anishinaabe people as &quot;Waawiiyaataanong&quot;, translating to &#x27;where the water curves around&#x27;.

The first Europeans did not penetrate into the region and reach the straits of Detroit until French missionaries and traders worked their way around the Iroquois League, with whom they were at war in the 1630s. The Huron and Neutral people held the north side of Lake Erie until the 1650s, when the Iroquois pushed them and the Erie people away from the lake and its beaver-rich feeder streams in the Beaver Wars of 1649–1655. By the 1670s, the war-weakened Iroquois laid claim to as far south as the Ohio River valley in northern Kentucky as hunting grounds, and had absorbed many other Iroquoian peoples after defeating them in war. For the next hundred years, virtually no British or French action was contemplated without consultation with the Iroquois or consideration of their likely response.

===French settlement===

On July 24, 1701, the French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac (1658–1730), with his lieutenant Alphonse de Tonty (1659–1727), and more than a hundred other Royal French settlers traveling south and west from New France (modern Province of Quebec), along the St. Lawrence River valley to the Great Lakes region, began constructing a small fort on the north bank of the Detroit River. Cadillac named the settlement Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, after Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain (1643–1727), the Secretary of State of the Navy under King Louis XIV (1638–1715, reigned 1643–1718) in the Royal government in Paris. &quot;Sainte-Anne-de-Détroit&quot; was founded on July 26 and is the second-oldest continuously operating Roman Catholic parish in the United States. France offered free land to colonists to attract families further west into the Great Lakes region interior of the North American continent to Detroit; when it eventually reached a population of about 800 by 1765, after the colonial conflict of the French and Indian War (1753–1763), (Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe), it became the largest European settlement between the important towns of Montreal and New Orleans, both also French settlements, in the former colonies of New France and La Louisiane (further south on the Mississippi River, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico), respectively. The region&#x27;s then colonial economy was based on the lucrative fur trade, in which numerous Native American peoples had important roles as trappers and traders.

===British rule===
During the French and Indian War (1753–63)—the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of France—British troops gained control of the settlement a few years into the conflict in 1760 and shortened its name to Detroit. Several regional Native American tribes, such as the Potowatomi, Ojibwe and Huron, launched Pontiac&#x27;s War (1763–1766), and laid siege in 1763 to Fort Detroit along the Detroit River in the Great Lakes but failed to capture it. In defeat, France ceded its territory in North America of New France and south of the lakes east of the Mississippi to the Appalachian Mountains to Britain following the war.

When Great Britain evicted France from its colonial possessions in New France (Canada) in the peace terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1763, it also removed one barrier to American colonists migrating west across the mountains. British negotiations with the Iroquois would both prove critical and lead to the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which limited settlements South of and below the Great Lakes and west of the Alleghenies / Appalachians. Many colonists and pioneers in the Thirteen Colonies along the East Coast, resented and then simply defied this restraint, later becoming supporters of the rebellious American Revolution. By 1773, after the addition of increasing numbers of the Anglo-American settlers, the population of Detroit and Fort Detroit, was edging up to 1,400 (doubled in the previous decade). During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the indigenous and loyalist raids of 1778 and the resultant 1779 decisive Sullivan Expedition reopened the Ohio Country (north of the Ohio River and west of the mountains) to even more westward emigration, which began almost immediately to get away from the eastern warfare. By 1778, its population had doubled again, reaching 2,144 and it was the third-largest town in what was known then as the Province of Quebec since the British takeover of former French colonial possessions in North America in 1763.

After the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and the establishment and recognition of the United States as an independent country, the Great Britain ceded Detroit and other territories in the interior region of the continent, south of the Great Lakes and west of the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River under the peace of the terms of the 1783 Treaty of Paris. The new Northwest Territories established the southern border with Great Britain&#x27;s remaining colonial provinces in British North America and became provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada. However, the disputed border area remained under British control with several military forts and trading posts for another decade, and its forces did not fully withdraw until 1796, following the negotiations and ratification of the subsequent Jay Treaty of 1794 between the British and Americans. By the turn of the 19th century, white American settlers began pouring westwards across the Appalachians and through the Great Lakes.

====Legacy====

Today the municipal flag of Detroit reflects its both its French and English colonial heritage. Descendants of the earliest French and French-Canadian settlers formed a cohesive community, who gradually were superseded as the dominant population after more Anglo-American settlers arrived in the early 19th century with American westward migration. Living along the shores of Lake St. Clair and south to Monroe and downriver suburbs, the ethnic French Canadians of Detroit, also known as Muskrat French in reference to the fur trade, remain a subculture in the region up into the 21st century.

===Post-revolutionary period and 19th century===
The Great Detroit Fire of 1805 destroyed most of the city&#x27;s wooden buildings, leaving only a stone fort, a river warehouse, and brick chimneys from former homes. Despite the extensive damage, none of Detroit&#x27;s 600 residents perished. The aftermath of the fire left a lasting legacy on the city&#x27;s heritage. Father Gabriel Richard coined the city motto, &quot;Speramus Meliora; Resurget Cineribus,&quot; as he surveyed the ruins. The city seal, designed in 1827, directly depicted the fire by showing two women, one grieving the destruction while the other gestures toward a new city rising from the ashes. The seal forms the center of Detroit&#x27;s flag.

From 1805 to 1847, Detroit served as the capital city of the Michigan Territory and later became its first state capital in January 1837 after Michigan&#x27;s admission to the Union. During the War of 1812, Detroit became a focal point of conflict. U.S. Army commander William Hull surrendered Fort Detroit without a fight, underestimating the number of British forces. Later, the U.S. attempted to retake the fort and town during the Battle of Frenchtown in January 1813, a significant victory for the British. The battle is commemorated at the River Raisin National Battlefield Park near Monroe, Michigan. Detroit was eventually recaptured later that year.

Detroit was officially incorporated as a city in 1815, and its urban design was influenced by the grand boulevards of Washington, D.C. Michigan Territorial Chief Justice Augustus B. Woodward, who played a key role in the city&#x27;s development, designed a geometric street plan that included wide avenues and plazas. In 1817, he founded the Catholepistemiad, later evolving into the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Detroit&#x27;s growth continued as a center of education and culture for the Michigan Territory.

Before the American Civil War, Detroit&#x27;s position along the Canada-U.S. border made it a vital stop on the Underground Railroad. Thousands of enslaved African Americans escaped to Canada via the city. Notable activists like George DeBaptiste, William Lambert, and Laura Smith Haviland played key roles in assisting refugees. Detroit&#x27;s contributions to the Union effort were also significant, with many residents volunteering to fight. The city&#x27;s 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment, part of the famous Iron Brigade, suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Gettysburg. The city&#x27;s tensions over race, in tandem with national concerns over the draft, led to the Detroit race riot of 1863, leaving some dead and over 200 Black residents homeless. This prompted the establishment of a full-time police force in 1865.

In the late 19th century, Detroit grew as a hub for industry, particularly shipping and manufacturing. The city&#x27;s wealth, driven by industrial magnates, led to the construction of opulent Gilded Age mansions along the grand avenues designed by Woodward. Detroit earned the nickname &quot;Paris of the West&quot; for its architectural beauty. By 1896, Henry Ford&#x27;s first automobile was built in the city, and Detroit expanded its borders, annexing surrounding villages and townships as it solidified its place as a key player in the automobile industry.

===Early 20th century and World War II===
In 1903, Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company. Alongside automotive pioneers William C. Durant, the Dodge brothers, James and William Packard, and Walter Chrysler, they established the Big Three automakers, solidifying Detroit&#x27;s status as the world&#x27;s automotive capital by the early 20th century. The rise of the automotive industry in the United States transformed the city, leading to the development of related businesses such as garages, gas stations, and factories for parts. Detroit&#x27;s population grew rapidly, reaching the fourth-largest city in the U.S. by 1920.

In 1907, the Detroit River carried 67 million tons of shipping commerce, surpassing both London and New York City in volume. This earned the river the title &quot;the Greatest Commercial Artery on Earth.&quot; During prohibition in the United States (1920–1933), the Detroit River became a major route for smuggling illegal alcohol from Canada. The booming auto industry and the expansion of shipping trade were central to Detroit&#x27;s economic growth in the early 20th century.

With the rapid growth of industrial workers in the auto factories, labor unions such as the American Federation of Labor and the United Auto Workers (UAW) fought to organize workers to gain them better working conditions and wages. They initiated strikes and other tactics in support of improvements such as the 8-hour day/40-hour work week, increased wages, greater benefits, and improved working conditions. The labor activism during those years increased the influence of union leaders in the city such as Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters and Walter Reuther of the UAW.

The demographic shifts caused by industrialization led to significant racial tensions in Detroit. The Great Migration brought African Americans from the South, while many southern and eastern European immigrants also moved to the city. Competition for jobs and housing fueled tensions between different ethnic and racial groups. This period saw the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in Detroit, which became a powerful force in the city during the 1920s, targeting Black, Catholic, and Jewish communities. Even after the Klan&#x27;s decline, the Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, continued to spread fear in the 1930s.

In the 1940s the world&#x27;s &quot;first urban depressed freeway&quot; ever built, the Davison, was constructed. Systemic racial discrimination remained prevalent in Detroit, with restrictive housing covenants and violence against Black neighborhoods like Black Bottom and Paradise Valley. The city&#x27;s racial tensions boiled over during the 1943 Detroit race riot. Sparked by a protest at the Packard plant, the riot resulted in 34 deaths, 433 injuries, and widespread property damage.

During World War II, the government encouraged retooling of the automobile industry in support of the Allied powers, leading to Detroit&#x27;s key role in the American Arsenal of Democracy. Jobs expanded so rapidly due to the defense buildup in World War II that 400,000 people migrated to the city from 1941 to 1943, including 50,000 blacks in the second wave of the Great Migration, and 350,000 whites, many of them from the South. Whites, including ethnic Europeans, feared black competition for jobs and scarce housing. The federal government prohibited discrimination in defense work, but when in June 1943 Packard promoted three black people to work next to whites on its assembly lines, 25,000 white workers walked off the job. 

===Late 20th century, racial tension and decline===

Industrial mergers in the 1950s, especially in the automobile sector, increased oligopoly in the American auto industry. Detroit saw the consolidation of companies like Packard and Hudson, which eventually disappeared. At its peak in the 1950 census, Detroit was the fifth-largest U.S. city, with a population of 1.85 million. The city&#x27;s auto industry, which made up 60% of its economy, continued to offer employment opportunities, especially for African Americans migrating from the South to escape Jim Crow laws.

While the migration brought higher employment rates, with a 103% increase in Black workers, racial discrimination persisted in employment and housing. Black Detroiters often held lower-paying factory jobs, while city services and better-paying positions remained largely dominated by white residents. Discriminatory policies, such as redlining, limited Black access to housing and financial services, forcing many into overcrowded, unsafe neighborhoods. White residents and political leaders resisted integration, reinforcing a cycle of exclusion and segregation.

As in other major American cities in the postwar era, urban planning and infrastructure changes also impacted Detroit&#x27;s racial dynamics. The construction of highways and freeways in the postwar era displaced many Black communities, including historically significant neighborhoods like Black Bottom and Paradise Valley. These areas, vital for Black businesses and culture, were demolished for urban renewal projects, exacerbating the displacement of low-income residents with little consideration for the community impact.

The city also saw a shift in its transportation system, as Detroit&#x27;s last electric streetcar line was replaced with buses in 1956. This change, alongside the rise of suburbanization and the relocation of industries to the outskirts, favored car-dependent, low-density development. By the 21st century, Detroit&#x27;s sprawling metro area had developed into one of the most spread-out job markets in the U.S., contributing to a decline in Detroit&#x27;s population and eroding its tax base as jobs moved beyond the reach of urban low-income workers.

In 1950, the city held about one-third of the state&#x27;s population. Over the next 60 years, the city&#x27;s population declined to less than 10 percent of the state&#x27;s population. During the same time period, the sprawling metropolitan area grew to contain more than half of Michigan&#x27;s population.

In June 1963, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a major speech as part of a civil rights march in Detroit that foreshadowed his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in Washington, D.C., two months later. While the civil rights movement gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965, longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner-city black youth who wanted change.


Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967. Governor George W. Romney ordered the Michigan National Guard into Detroit, and President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and business areas. Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods. The affected district lay in ruins for decades. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, it was the 3rd most costly riot in the United States.

In 1970, the NAACP filed a lawsuit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken, alleging &quot;de facto&quot; segregation in Detroit&#x27;s public schools. The lawsuit argued that although schools were not legally segregated, policies in Detroit and surrounding counties maintained racial segregation through housing practices, as school demographics mirrored segregated neighborhoods. The District Court ruled in favor of the NAACP, but in the landmark 1974 &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; decision, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the scope of desegregation, ruling that suburban areas could not be forced to aid in Detroit&#x27;s school desegregation.

Amid these challenges, Detroit elected Coleman Young as its first Black mayor in 1973. Young focused on increasing racial diversity in city services and improving Detroit&#x27;s transportation system, although regional tensions with suburban leaders persisted. In 1976, a federal grant for a regional rapid transit system failed due to conflicts over planning, leaving Detroit to develop its own Detroit People Mover system. The city&#x27;s struggles were exacerbated by the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, which hurt the auto industry and led to layoffs and plant closures, further diminishing the city&#x27;s tax base.

Despite efforts to revitalize the city, such as the opening of the Renaissance Center in 1977, downtown Detroit continued to lose businesses to suburban areas. Middle-class flight, high unemployment, and increased crime worsened the city&#x27;s conditions, with abandoned buildings and neighborhoods further contributing to its decline. Young&#x27;s focus on downtown development was criticized as insufficient in addressing the broader social and economic challenges faced by the city&#x27;s residents. In 1993, Young retired as Detroit&#x27;s longest-serving mayor andwas succeeded by Dennis Archer. Archer prioritized downtown development, easing tensions with its suburban neighbors. A referendum to allow casino gambling in the city passed in 1996; several temporary casino facilities opened in 1999, and permanent downtown casinos with hotels opened in 2007–08.

===21st century===

Campus Martius, a downtown park reconfiguration, opened in 2004 and was cited as one of the best public spaces in the U.S. The first phase of the International Riverfront redevelopment was completed in 2001 for Detroit&#x27;s 300th-anniversary celebration. In 2008, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick resigned after felony convictions, and in 2013 was sentenced to 28 years in prison. His actions cost the city an estimated $20 million. In 2011, about half of Detroit&#x27;s 305,000 property owners failed to pay their taxes, leaving approximately $246 million (~$ in ) uncollected.

Michigan took control of Detroit&#x27;s government after the city faced a $327 million deficit and over $14 billion in debt. Governor Rick Snyder declared a financial emergency in March 2013, and the city was relying on bond money to stay afloat, with unpaid days off for workers. Underfunded services and failed turnaround efforts led to the appointment of an emergency manager. In June 2013, Detroit defaulted on $2.5 billion in debt, and on July 18, it became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy. Detroit exited bankruptcy in December 2014, cutting $7 billion in debt and investing $1.7 billion in services. The Detroit Institute of Arts, holding over 60,000 artworks worth billions, became a private organization to help fund the city&#x27;s recovery after legal battles.

Post-bankruptcy, efforts to improve city services included replacing non-functional street lights with 65,000 LED lights, making Detroit the largest U.S. city with all LED street lighting by 2016. Neighborhood revitalization continued, with volunteer renovation projects and urban gardening movements. In 2011, the Port Authority Passenger Terminal opened, with the riverwalk connecting Hart Plaza to the Renaissance Center.

One symbol of the city&#x27;s decades-long decline, the Michigan Central Station, was long vacant. The city renovated it with new windows, elevators and facilities, completing the work in December 2015. In 2018, Ford Motor Company purchased the building and plans to use it for mobility testing with a potential return of train service. Several other landmark buildings have been privately renovated and adapted as condominiums, hotels, offices, or for cultural uses. Detroit was mentioned as a city of renaissance and has reversed many of the trends of the prior decades.

The city has seen a rise in gentrification in some neighborhoods. In downtown, for example, the construction of Little Caesars Arena brought with it high class shops and restaurants along Woodward Avenue. Office tower and condominium construction has led to an influx of wealthy families but also a displacement of long-time residents and culture. Areas outside of downtown and other recently revived areas have an average household income of about 25% less than the gentrified areas, a gap that is continuing to grow.

==Geography==
===Metropolitan area===
Detroit is the center of a three-county urban area (with a population of 3,734,090 within an area of according to the 2010 United States census), six-county metropolitan statistical area (population of 5,322,219 in an area of as of the 2010 census), and a nine-county Combined Statistical Area (population of 5.3 million within ).

===Topography===
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Detroit is the principal city in Metro Detroit and Southeast Michigan. It is situated in the Midwestern United States and the Great Lakes region.

The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge is the only international wildlife preserve in North America and is uniquely located in the heart of a major metropolitan area. The refuge includes islands, coastal wetlands, marshes, shoals, and waterfront lands along of the Detroit River and western Lake Erie shoreline.

The city slopes gently from the northwest to southeast on a till plain composed largely of glacial and lake clay. The most notable topographical feature in the city is the Detroit Moraine, a broad clay ridge on which the older portions of Detroit and Windsor are located, rising approximately above the river at its highest point. The highest elevation in the city is directly north of Gorham Playground on the northwest side approximately three blocks south of 8 Mile Road, at a height of . Detroit&#x27;s lowest elevation is along the Detroit River, at a surface height of .

Belle Isle Park is a island park in the Detroit River, between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. It is connected to the mainland by the MacArthur Bridge. Belle Isle Park contains such attractions as the James Scott Memorial Fountain, the Belle Isle Conservatory, the Detroit Yacht Club on an adjacent island, a half-mile (800 m) beach, a golf course, a nature center, monuments, and gardens. Both the Detroit and Windsor skylines can be viewed at the island&#x27;s Sunset Point.

Three road systems cross the city: the original French template, with avenues radiating from the waterfront, and true north–south roads based on the Northwest Ordinance township system. The city is north of Windsor, Ontario. Detroit is the only major city along the Canada–U.S. border in which one travels south to cross into Canada.

Detroit has four border crossings: the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit–Windsor tunnel provide motor vehicle thoroughfares, with the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel providing railroad access to and from Canada. The fourth border crossing is the Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry, near the Windsor Salt Mine and Zug Island. Near Zug Island, the southwest part of the city was developed over a salt mine that is below the surface. The Detroit salt mine run by the Detroit Salt Company has over of roads within.

=== Cityscape ===
==== Architecture ====

Detroit&#x27;s waterfront showcases a variety of architectural styles, with the postmodern Neo-Gothic spires of Ally Detroit Center paying homage to the city&#x27;s Art Deco skyscrapers. Together with the Renaissance Center, these buildings form a distinctive and recognizable skyline. Examples of the Art Deco style include the Guardian Building and Penobscot Building downtown, as well as the Fisher Building and Cadillac Place in New Center. Prominent cultural landmarks from the early 20th century include the Fox Theatre, Detroit Opera House, and Detroit Institute of Arts.

While Downtown Detroit and New Center feature high-rise buildings, much of Detroit consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes. Residential high-rises are concentrated in upscale neighborhoods such as the East Riverfront, extending toward Grosse Pointe, and Palmer Park. The University Commons-Palmer Park district anchors historic areas including Palmer Woods, Sherwood Forest, and the University District near the University of Detroit Mercy.

42 significant structures in the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Pre-World War II neighborhoods exhibit architectural styles of the era, with working-class areas featuring wood-frame and brick houses, while middle- and upper-class neighborhoods such as Brush Park, Woodbridge, Indian Village, Palmer Woods, and Boston-Edison contain larger, more ornate homes and mansions. Multi-million dollar restorations and new developments have revitalized neighborhoods such as West Canfield and Brush Park.

The city has one of the United States&#x27; largest surviving collections of late 19th- and early 20th-century buildings. Architecturally significant churches and cathedrals in the city include St. Joseph&#x27;s, Old St. Mary&#x27;s, the Sweetest Heart of Mary, and the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament. Historic preservation efforts continue to thrive, with downtown redevelopment projects revitalizing parts of the city, among them Campus Martius Park, Grand Circus Park near the city&#x27;s theater district, Ford Field, Comerica Park, and Little Caesars Arena.

====Neighborhoods====

Detroit has a variety of neighborhood types. The revitalized Downtown, Midtown, Corktown, New Center areas feature many historic buildings and are high density, while further out, particularly in the northeast and on the fringes, high vacancy levels are problematic, for which a number of solutions have been proposed. In 2007, Downtown Detroit was recognized as the best city neighborhood in which to retire among the United States&#x27; largest metro areas by CNNMoney editors.

Lafayette Park is a revitalized neighborhood on the city&#x27;s east side, part of the Ludwig Mies van der Rohe residential district. The development was originally called the Gratiot Park. Planned by Mies van der Rohe, Ludwig Hilberseimer and Alfred Caldwell it includes a landscaped, park with no through traffic, in which these and other low-rise apartment buildings are situated. Immigrants have contributed to the city&#x27;s neighborhood revitalization, especially in southwest Detroit. Southwest Detroit has experienced a thriving economy in recent years, as evidenced by new housing, increased business openings and the recently opened Mexicantown International Welcome Center.

The city has numerous neighborhoods consisting of vacant properties resulting in low inhabited density in those areas, stretching city services and infrastructure. These neighborhoods are concentrated in the northeast and on the city&#x27;s fringes. A 2009 parcel survey found about a quarter of residential lots in the city to be undeveloped or vacant, and about 10% of the city&#x27;s housing to be unoccupied. The survey also reported that most (86%) of the city&#x27;s homes are in good condition with a minority (9%) in fair condition needing only minor repairs.

To deal with vacancy issues, the city has begun demolishing the derelict houses, razing 3,000 of the total 10,000 in 2010, but the resulting low density creates a strain on the city&#x27;s infrastructure. To remedy this, a number of solutions have been proposed including resident relocation from more sparsely populated neighborhoods and converting unused space to urban agricultural use, including Hantz Woodlands, though the city expects to be in the planning stages for up to another two years.

Public funding and private investment have been made with promises to rehabilitate neighborhoods. In April 2008, the city announced a $300 million (~$ in ) stimulus plan to create jobs and revitalize neighborhoods, financed by city bonds and paid for by earmarking about 15% of the wagering tax. The city&#x27;s working plans for neighborhood revitalizations include 7-Mile/Livernois, Brightmoor, East English Village, Grand River/Greenfield, North End, and Osborn. Private organizations have pledged substantial funding to the efforts. Additionally, the city has cleared a section of land for large-scale neighborhood construction, which the city is calling the &quot;Far Eastside Plan&quot;. In 2011, Mayor Dave Bing announced a plan to categorize neighborhoods by their needs and prioritize the most needed services for those neighborhoods.

=== Parks ===

Detroit Parks &amp; Recreation maintains 308 public parks, totaling 4,950 (2,003 ha) acres or about 5.6% of the city&#x27;s land area. Belle Isle Park, Detroit&#x27;s largest and most visited park is the largest city-owned island park in the U.S., covering 982 acres (397 ha).

Grand Circus, the city&#x27;s first municipal park, opened in 1847. In the early 20th century, the city enlisted landscape architect Augustus Woodward to conceive a framework for Detroit&#x27;s modern parks system. Augustus Woodward&#x27;s plan for the city imagined grand boulevards, spacious and elegant common parks, and an orderly, hub-and-spoke city layout.

The Detroit International Riverfront features a 3.5-mile promenade with parks, residential buildings, and commercial areas, extending from Hart Plaza to Belle Isle Park. This area includes Tri-Centennial State Park and Harbor, Michigan&#x27;s first urban state park. Plans for the riverfront&#x27;s second phase will extend the promenade to the Ambassador Bridge, stimulating residential redevelopment along the riverfront. Detroit&#x27;s major parks also include River Rouge, Palmer, and Chene Park, contributing to the city&#x27;s green space and outdoor recreation.

The Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority was created in 1940 by the citizens of Southeast Michigan to serve as a regional park system the park system includes 13 parks totaling more than 24,000 acres (97 km2) arranged along the Huron River and Clinton River forming a partial ring around the Detroit metro area.

===Climate===

Detroit and the rest of southeastern Michigan have a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;) which is influenced by the Great Lakes like other places in the state; the city and close-in suburbs are part of USDA Hardiness zone 6b, while the more distant northern and western suburbs generally are included in zone 6a. Winters are cold, with moderate snowfall and temperatures not rising above freezing on an average 44 days annually, while dropping to or below on an average 4.4 days a year; summers are warm to hot with temperatures exceeding on 12 days. The warm season runs from May to September. The monthly daily mean temperature ranges from in January to in July.

==Demographics==

In the 2020 United States census, the city had 639,111 residents, ranking it the 27th-most populous city in the US. Of the large shrinking cities in the US, Detroit has had the most dramatic decline in the population of the past 70 years (down 1,210,457) and the second-largest percentage decline (down 65.4%). In 1950, Detroit was the fourth-largest city in the US behind New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia. While the drop in Detroit&#x27;s population has been ongoing since 1950, the most dramatic period was the significant 25% decline between the 2000 and 2010 census.

Detroit&#x27;s 639,111 residents represent 269,445 households, and 162,924 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 349,170 housing units at an average density of . Of the 269,445 households, 34.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 21.5% were married couples living together, 31.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 39.5% were non-families, 34.0% were made up of individuals, and 3.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.59, and the average family size was 3.36.

There was a wide distribution of age in the city, with 31.1% under the age of 18, 9.7% from 18 to 24, 29.5% from 25 to 44, 19.3% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 83.5 males.

===Religion===
According to a 2014 study, 67% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 49% professing adherence to Protestant churches, and 16% professing Roman Catholic beliefs, while 24% claim no religious affiliation. Other religions collectively make up about 8% of the population.

===Income and employment===
The loss of industrial and working-class jobs in the city has resulted in high rates of poverty and associated problems. From 2000 to 2009, the city&#x27;s estimated median household income fell from $29,526 to $26,098. , the mean income of Detroit is below the overall U.S. average by several thousand dollars. Of every three Detroit residents, one lives in poverty. Luke Bergmann, author of &quot;Getting Ghost: Two Young Lives and the Struggle for the Soul of an American City&quot;, said in 2010, &quot;Detroit is now one of the poorest big cities in the country&quot;.

In the 2018 American Community Survey, median household income in the city was $31,283, compared with the median for Michigan of $56,697. The median income for a family was $36,842, well below the state median of $72,036. 33.4% of families had income at or below the federally defined poverty level. Out of the total population, 47.3% of those under the age of 18 and 21.0% of those 65 and older had income at or below the federally defined poverty line.

===Race and ethnicity===


Beginning with the rise of the automobile industry, Detroit&#x27;s population increased more than sixfold during the first half of the 20th century as an influx of European, Middle Eastern (Lebanese, Assyrian), and Southern migrants brought their families to the city. With this economic boom following World War I, the African American population grew from a mere 6,000 in 1910 to more than 120,000 by 1930. Perhaps one of the most overt examples of neighborhood discrimination occurred in 1925 when African American physician Ossian Sweet found his home surrounded by an angry mob of his hostile white neighbors violently protesting his new move into a traditionally white neighborhood. Sweet and ten of his family members and friends were put on trial for murder as one of the mob members throwing rocks at the newly purchased house was shot and killed by someone firing out of a second-floor window.

Detroit has a relatively large Mexican-American population. In the early 20th century, thousands of Mexicans came to Detroit to work in agricultural, automotive, and steel jobs. During the Mexican Repatriation of the 1930s many Mexicans in Detroit were willingly repatriated or forced to repatriate. By the 1940s much of the Mexican community began to settle what is now Mexicantown. Immigration from Jalisco significantly increased the Latino population in the 1990s. By 2010 Detroit had 48,679 Hispanics, including 36,452 Mexicans: a 70% increase from 1990. Per the 2023 American Community Survey five-year estimates, the Mexican American population was 35,273 comprising over 75% of the Latino population with Puerto Ricans as the next largest group at 5,887.
After World War II, many people from Appalachia also settled in Detroit. Appalachians formed communities and their children acquired southern accents. Many Lithuanians also settled in Detroit during the World War II era, especially on the city&#x27;s Southwest side in the West Vernor area, where the renovated Lithuanian Hall reopened in 2006.

While African Americans in 2020 comprised 13.5% of Michigan&#x27;s population, they made up nearly 77.2% of Detroit&#x27;s population. The next largest population groups were non-Hispanic whites, at 10.1%, and Hispanics, at 8.0%. In 2001, 103,000 Jews, or about 1.9% of the population, were living in the Detroit area. According to the 2010 census, segregation in Detroit decreased in absolute and relative terms and in the first decade of the 21st century, about two-thirds of the total black population in the metropolitan area resided within the city limits of Detroit. The number of integrated neighborhoods increased from 100 in 2000 to 204 in 2010. After being ranked the most segregated metropolitan area in the United States in 2000, Detroit was ranked fourth most-segregated in 2010. A 2011 op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; attributed the decreased segregation rating to the overall exodus from the city, cautioning that these areas may soon become more segregated. 

There are four areas of Detroit with significant Asian and Asian American populations. Northeast Detroit has a large population of Hmong with a smaller group of Lao people. A portion of Detroit next to eastern Hamtramck includes Bangladeshi Americans, Indian Americans, and Pakistani Americans; nearly all of the Bangladeshi population in Detroit lives in that area. The area north of downtown has transient Asian national origin residents who are university students or hospital workers. Few of them have permanent residency after schooling ends. They are mostly Chinese and Indian but the population also includes Filipinos, Koreans, and Pakistanis. In Southwest and western Detroit there are smaller, scattered Asian communities.

=== Crime ===

Detroit has gained notoriety for its high amount of crime, having struggled with it for decades. The number of homicides in 1974 was 714. The homicide rate in 2022 was the third highest in the nation at 50.0 per 100,000. Downtown typically has lower crime than national and state averages. According to a 2007 analysis, Detroit officials note about 65 to 70 percent of homicides in the city were drug related, with the rate of unsolved murders roughly 70%.

Although the rate of violent crime dropped 11% in 2008, violent crime in Detroit has not declined as much as the national average from 2007 to 2011. The violent crime rate is one of the highest in the United States. Neighborhoodscout.com reported a crime rate of 62.18 per 1,000 residents for property crimes, and 16.73 per 1,000 for violent crimes (compared to national figures of 32 per 1,000 for property crimes and 5 per 1,000 for violent crime in 2008). In 2012, crime in the city was among the reasons for more expensive car insurance.

Areas of the city adjacent to the Detroit River are also patrolled by the United States Border Patrol.

==Economy==


Several major corporations are based in the city, including three Fortune 500 companies. The most heavily represented sectors are manufacturing (particularly automotive), finance, technology, and health care. The most significant companies based in Detroit include General Motors, Rocket Mortgage, Ally Financial, Compuware, Shinola, American Axle, Little Caesars, DTE Energy, Lowe Campbell Ewald, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, and Rossetti Architects.

About 80,500 people work in downtown Detroit, comprising one-fifth of the city&#x27;s employment base. Aside from the numerous Detroit-based companies listed above, downtown contains large offices for Comerica, Chrysler, Fifth Third Bank, HP Enterprise, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, and Ernst &amp; Young. Ford Motor Company is in the adjacent city of Dearborn.

Thousands more employees work in Midtown, north of the central business district. Midtown&#x27;s anchors are the city&#x27;s largest single employer Detroit Medical Center, Wayne State University, and the Henry Ford Health System in New Center. Midtown is also home to watchmaker Shinola and an array of small and startup companies. New Center bases TechTown, a research and business incubator hub that is part of the Wayne State University system. Like downtown, Corktown Is experiencing growth with the new Ford Corktown Campus under development.

Many downtown employers are relatively new, as there has been a marked trend of companies moving from satellite suburbs into the downtown core. Compuware completed its world headquarters in downtown in 2003. OnStar, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and HP Enterprise Services are at the Renaissance Center. PricewaterhouseCoopers Plaza offices are adjacent to Ford Field, and Ernst &amp; Young completed its office building at One Kennedy Square in 2006. Perhaps most prominently, in 2010, Quicken Loans, one of the largest mortgage lenders, relocated its world headquarters and 4,000 employees to downtown Detroit, consolidating its suburban offices. In July 2012, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office opened its Elijah J. McCoy Satellite Office in the Rivertown/Warehouse District as its first location outside Washington, D.C.&#x27;s metropolitan area.

In April 2014, the United States Department of Labor reported the city&#x27;s unemployment rate at 14.5%.

The city of Detroit and other public–private partnerships have attempted to catalyze the region&#x27;s growth by facilitating the building and historical rehabilitation of residential high-rises in the downtown, creating a zone that offers many business tax incentives, creating recreational spaces such as the Detroit RiverWalk, Campus Martius Park, Dequindre Cut Greenway, and Green Alleys in Midtown. The city has cleared sections of land while retaining some historically significant vacant buildings to spur redevelopment; even though it has struggled with finances, the city issued bonds in 2008 to provide funding for ongoing work to demolish blighted properties. Two years earlier, downtown reported $1.3 billion in restorations and new developments which increased the number of construction jobs in the city. In the decade prior to 2006, downtown gained more than $15 billion in new investment from private and public sectors.

Despite the city&#x27;s recent financial issues, many developers remain unfazed by Detroit&#x27;s problems. Midtown is one of the most successful areas within Detroit to have a residential occupancy rate of 96%. Numerous developments have been recently completed or are in various stages of construction. These include the $82 million reconstruction of downtown&#x27;s David Whitney Building (now an Aloft Hotel and luxury residences), the Woodward Garden Block Development in Midtown, the residential conversion of the David Broderick Tower in downtown, the rehabilitation of the Book Cadillac Hotel (now a Westin and luxury condos) and Fort Shelby Hotel (now Doubletree) also in downtown, and various smaller projects.

Downtown&#x27;s population of young professionals is growing, and retail is expanding. A study in 2007 found out that Downtown&#x27;s new residents are predominantly young professionals (57% are ages 25 to 34, 45% have bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and 34% have a master&#x27;s or professional degree), a trend which has hastened over the last decade. Since 2006, $9 billion has been invested in downtown and surrounding neighborhoods; $5.2 billion of which has come in 2013 and 2014. Construction activity, particularly rehabilitation of historic downtown buildings, has increased markedly. As of 2014, the number of vacant downtown buildings has dropped from nearly 50 to around 13.

In 2013 Meijer, a midwestern retail chain, opened its first supercenter store in Detroit; this was a $20 million, 190,000-square-foot store in the northern portion of the city and it also is the centerpiece of a new $72 million shopping center named Gateway Marketplace. In 2015 Meijer opened its second supercenter store in the city. In 2019 JPMorgan Chase announced plans to invest $50 million more in affordable housing, job training, and entrepreneurship by the end of 2022, growing its investment to $200 million.

==Arts and culture==

In the central portions of Detroit, the population of young professionals, artists, and other transplants is growing and retail is expanding. This dynamic is luring additional new residents, and former residents returning from other cities, to the city&#x27;s Downtown along with the revitalized Midtown and New Center areas.

A desire to be closer to the urban scene has attracted some young professionals to reside in inner ring suburbs such as Ferndale and Royal Oak. The proximity to Windsor provides for views and nightlife, along with Ontario&#x27;s minimum drinking age of 19. A 2011 study by Walk Score recognized Detroit for its above average walkability among large U.S. cities. About two-thirds of suburban residents occasionally dine and attend cultural events or take in professional games in the city.

===Nicknames===

Known as the world&#x27;s automotive center, &quot;Detroit&quot; is a metonym for that industry. It is an important source of popular music legacies celebrated by the city&#x27;s two familiar nicknames, the &quot;Motor City&quot; and &quot;Motown&quot;. Other nicknames arose in the 20th century, including &quot;City of Champions&quot;, beginning in the 1930s for its successes in individual and team sport; &quot;The D&quot;; &quot;Hockeytown&quot; (a trademark owned by the Detroit Red Wings); &quot;Rock City&quot; (after the Kiss song &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;); and &quot;The 313&quot; (its telephone area code).

===Music===



Live music has been a prominent feature of Detroit&#x27;s nightlife since the late 1940s, bringing the city recognition under the nickname &quot;Motown&quot;. The metropolitan area has many nationally prominent live music venues. Concerts hosted by Live Nation perform throughout the Detroit area. The theater venue circuit is the United States&#x27; second largest and hosts Broadway performances.

The city has a rich musical heritage and has contributed to many genres over the decades. Important music events include the Detroit International Jazz Festival, the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, the Motor City Music Conference (MC2), the Urban Organic Music Conference, the Concert of Colors, and the hip-hop Summer Jamz festival.

In the 1940s, Detroit blues artist John Lee Hooker became a long-term resident in the Delray neighborhood. Hooker, among other important blues musicians, migrated from his home in Mississippi, bringing the Delta blues to Detroit. Hooker recorded for Fortune Records, the biggest pre-Motown blues/soul label. During the 1950s, the city became a center for jazz, with stars performing in the Black Bottom neighborhood. Prominent emerging jazz musicians included trumpeter Donald Byrd (who attended Cass Tech and performed with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers early in his career) and saxophonist Pepper Adams (who enjoyed a solo career and accompanied Byrd on several albums). The Graystone International Jazz Museum documents jazz in Detroit.

Other prominent Motor City R&amp;B stars in the 1950s and early 1960s were Nolan Strong, Andre Williams, and Nathaniel Mayer—who all scored local and national hits on the Fortune Records label. According to Smokey Robinson, Strong was a primary influence on his voice as a teenager. The Fortune label, a family-operated label on Third Avenue, was owned by the husband-and-wife team of Jack Brown and Devora Brown. Fortune—which also released country, gospel and rockabilly LPs and 45s—laid the groundwork for Motown, which became Detroit&#x27;s most legendary record label.

Berry Gordy, Jr. founded Motown Records, which rose to prominence during the 1960s and early 1970s with acts such as Stevie Wonder, the Temptations, the Four Tops, Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles, Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, the Jackson 5, Martha and the Vandellas, the Spinners, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, the Marvelettes, the Elgins, the Monitors, the Velvelettes, and Marvin Gaye. Artists were backed by in-house vocalists the Andantes and the Funk Brothers.

&quot;The Motown sound&quot; played an important role in the crossover appeal with popular music, since it was the first African American–owned record label to primarily feature African-American artists. Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles in 1972 to pursue film production, but the company has since returned to Detroit. Aretha Franklin, another Detroit R&amp;B star, carried the Motown sound; however, she did not record with Berry&#x27;s Motown label.

Local artists and bands rose to prominence in the 1960s and 70s, including the MC5, Glenn Frey, the Stooges, Bob Seger, Amboy Dukes featuring Ted Nugent, Mitch Ryder and The Detroit Wheels, Rare Earth, Alice Cooper, and Suzi Quatro. The group Kiss emphasized the city&#x27;s connection with rock in the song &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and the movie produced in 1999. In the 1980s, Detroit was an important center of the hardcore punk rock underground with many nationally known bands coming out of the city and its suburbs, such as the Necros, the Meatmen, and Negative Approach.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the city produced many influential hip hop artists, including Eminem, the hip-hop artist with the highest cumulative sales, his rap group D12, hip-hop rapper and producer Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot;, hip-hop producer Denaun Porter, hip-hop producer J Dilla, rapper and musician Kid Rock and rappers Big Sean and Danny Brown. The band Sponge toured and produced music. The city also has an active garage rock scene that has generated national attention with acts such as the White Stripes, the Von Bondies, the Detroit Cobras, the Dirtbombs, Electric Six, and the Hard Lessons. Detroit is cited as the birthplace of techno music in the early 1980s. The city also lends its name to an early and pioneering genre of electronic dance music, &quot;Detroit techno&quot;. Featuring science fiction imagery and robotic themes, its futuristic style was greatly influenced by the geography of Detroit&#x27;s urban decline and its industrial past. Prominent Detroit techno artists include Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, and Jeff Mills. The Detroit Electronic Music Festival, now known as Movement, occurs annually in late May on Memorial Day Weekend, and takes place in Hart Plaza.

===Performing arts===

Major theaters in Detroit include the Fox Theatre (5,174 seats), Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts (1,770 seats), the Gem Theatre (451 seats), Masonic Temple Theatre (4,404 seats), the Detroit Opera House (2,765 seats), the Fisher Theatre (2,089 seats), The Fillmore Detroit (2,200 seats), Saint Andrew&#x27;s Hall, the Majestic Theater, and Orchestra Hall (2,286 seats), which hosts the renowned Detroit Symphony Orchestra. The Nederlander Organization, the largest controller of Broadway productions in New York City, originated with the purchase of the Detroit Opera House in 1922 by the Nederlander family.

Motown Motion Picture Studios with produces movies in Detroit and the surrounding area based at the Pontiac Centerpoint Business Campus for a film industry expected to employ over 4,000 people in the metro area.

===Tourism===
Detroit is home to the world&#x27;s first destination marketing organization, the Detroit Metro Convention and Visitor&#x27;s Bureau, also known as Visit Detroit. Founded in 1896, the organization now operates at 211 West Fort Street as Visit Detroit.

Because of its unique culture, distinctive architecture, and revitalization and urban renewal efforts in the 21st century, Detroit has enjoyed increased prominence as a tourist destination in recent years. &quot;The New York Times&quot; listed Detroit as the ninth-best destination in its list of &quot;52 Places to Go in 2017&quot;, while travel guide publisher &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; named Detroit the second-best city in the world to visit in 2018.&quot;Time&quot; named Detroit as one of the 50 World&#x27;s Greatest Places of 2022 to explore.

Many of the area&#x27;s prominent museums are in the historic cultural center neighborhood around Wayne State University and the College for Creative Studies. These museums include the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Detroit Historical Museum, Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, the Detroit Science Center, as well as the main branch of the Detroit Public Library. Other cultural highlights include Motown Historical Museum, the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant museum, the Pewabic Pottery studio and school, the Tuskegee Airmen Museum, Fort Wayne, the Dossin Great Lakes Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, the Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit, and the Belle Isle Conservatory.

In 2010, the G.R. N&#x27;Namdi Gallery opened in a complex in Midtown. Important history of America and the Detroit area are exhibited at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, the United States&#x27; largest indoor-outdoor museum complex. The Detroit Historical Society provides information about tours of area churches, skyscrapers, and mansions. Inside Detroit hosts tours, educational programming, and a downtown welcome center. Other sites of interest are the Detroit Zoo in Royal Oak, the Cranbrook Art Museum in Bloomfield Hills, the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory on Belle Isle, and Walter P. Chrysler Museum in Auburn Hills.

Greektown and three downtown casino resort hotels serve as part of an entertainment hub. The Eastern Market farmer&#x27;s distribution center is the largest open-air flowerbed market in the United States and has more than 150 foods and specialty businesses. On Saturdays, about 45,000 people shop there. The annual Detroit Festival of the Arts in Midtown draws about 350,000 people.

Annual summer events include the Electronic Music Festival, International Jazz Festival, the Woodward Dream Cruise, the African World Festival, the country music Hoedown, Noel Night, and Dally in the Alley.

River Days, a five-day summer festival on the International Riverfront lead up to the Windsor–Detroit International Freedom Festival fireworks, which draw super sized-crowds ranging from hundreds of thousands to over three million people.

An important civic sculpture is &quot;The Spirit of Detroit&quot; by Marshall Fredericks at the Coleman Young Municipal Center. The image is often used as a symbol of Detroit, and the statue is occasionally dressed in sports jerseys to celebrate when a Detroit team is doing well. A memorial to Joe Louis is located at the intersection of Jefferson and Woodward Avenues. The sculpture, commissioned by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and executed by Robert Graham, is a long arm with a fisted hand suspended by a pyramidal framework.

==Sports==

Detroit is one of four U.S. cities that have venues within the city representing the four major sports in North America. Detroit is the only city to have its four major sports teams play within its downtown district. Venues include: Comerica Park (home of MLB&#x27;s Detroit Tigers), Ford Field (home of the NFL&#x27;s Detroit Lions), and Little Caesars Arena (home of the NHL&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings and the NBA&#x27;s Detroit Pistons).

Detroit has won titles in all four of the major professional sports leagues. The Tigers have won four World Series titles (1935, 1945, 1968, and 1984). The Red Wings have won 11 Stanley Cups (1935–36, 1936–37, 1942–43, 1949–50, 1951–52, 1953–54, 1954–55, 1996–97, 1997–98, 2001–02, 2007–08) (the most by an American NHL franchise). The Lions have won 4 NFL titles (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957). The Pistons have won three NBA titles (1989, 1990, 2004). In the years following the mid-1930s, Detroit was referred to as the &quot;City of Champions&quot; after the Tigers, Lions, and Red Wings captured the three major professional sports championships in existence at the time in a seven-month period (the Tigers won the World Series in October 1935; the Lions won the NFL championship in December 1935; the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in April 1936).

Founded in 2012 as a semi-professional soccer club, Detroit City FC plays professional soccer in the USL Championship. Nicknamed, &quot;Le Rouge&quot;, the club are two-time champions of NISA since joining in 2020. They play their home matches in Keyworth Stadium, which is located in the enclave of Hamtramck.

In college sports, Detroit&#x27;s central location within the Mid-American Conference (MAC) has made it a frequent site for the league&#x27;s championship events. While the MAC Basketball Tournament moved permanently to Cleveland starting in 2000, the MAC Football Championship Game has been played at Ford Field since 2004 and annually attracts 25,000 to 30,000 fans. The University of Detroit Mercy has an NCAA Division I program, and Wayne State University has both NCAA Division I and II programs. The NCAA football GameAbove Sports Bowl (formerly, Quick Lane Bowl) is held at Ford Field each December.

The city hosted the 2005 MLB All-Star Game, Super Bowl XL in 2006, the 2006 and 2012 World Series, WrestleMania 23 in 2007, and the NCAA Final Four in April 2009. The Detroit Indy Grand Prix is held in Belle Isle Park. In 2007, open-wheel racing returned to Belle Isle with both Indy Racing League and American Le Mans Series Racing. From 1982 to 1988, Detroit held the Detroit Grand Prix, at the Detroit street circuit.

In 1932, Eddie &quot;The Midnight Express&quot; Tolan from Detroit won the 100- and 200-meter races and two gold medals at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Joe Louis won the heavyweight championship of the world in 1937. Detroit has made the most bids to host the Summer Olympics without ever being awarded the games, with seven unsuccessful bids for the 1944, 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, 1968, and 1972 summer games.

In 2024, Detroit hosted the NFL draft. Over 775,000 people were present in downtown Detroit over the course of the three-day event, making it the highest attended draft on record.

==Government==

The city is governed pursuant to the home rule &quot;Charter of the City of Detroit&quot;. The government is run by a mayor, the nine-member Detroit City Council, the eleven-member Board of Police Commissioners, and a clerk. All of these officers are elected on a nonpartisan ballot, with the exception of four of the police commissioners, who are appointed by the mayor. Detroit has a &quot;strong mayoral&quot; system, with the mayor approving departmental appointments. The council approves budgets, but the mayor is not obligated to adhere to any earmarking. The city clerk supervises elections and is formally charged with the maintenance of municipal records. City ordinances and substantially large contracts must be approved by the council. The &quot;Detroit City Code&quot; is the codification of Detroit&#x27;s local ordinances.

Presently three Community Advisory Councils advise City Council representatives. Residents of each of Detroit&#x27;s seven districts have the option of electing Community Advisory Councils. The city clerk supervises elections and is formally charged with the maintenance of municipal records. Municipal elections for mayor, city council and city clerk are held at four-year intervals, in the year after presidential elections. Following a November 2009 referendum, seven council members will be elected from districts beginning in 2013 while two will continue to be elected at-large.

Detroit&#x27;s courts are state-administered and elections are nonpartisan. The Probate Court for Wayne County is in the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center in downtown. The Circuit Court is across Gratiot Avenue in the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice. The city is home to the Thirty-Sixth District Court, as well as the First District of the Michigan Court of Appeals and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The city provides law enforcement through the Detroit Police Department and emergency services through the Detroit Fire Department.

===Politics===
Beginning with its incorporation in 1802, Detroit has had a total of 74 mayors. Detroit&#x27;s last mayor from the Republican Party was Louis Miriani, who served from 1957 to 1962. In 1973, the city elected its first black mayor, Coleman Young. Despite development efforts, his combative style during his five terms in office was not well received by many suburban residents. Mayor Dennis Archer, a former Michigan Supreme Court Justice, refocused the city&#x27;s attention on redevelopment with a plan to permit three casinos downtown. By 2008, three major casino resort hotels established operations in the city.

In 2000, the city requested an investigation by the United States Justice Department into the Detroit Police Department which was concluded in 2003 over allegations regarding its use of force and civil rights violations. The city proceeded with a major reorganization of the Detroit Police Department. In 2013, felony bribery charges were brought against seven building inspectors. In 2016, further corruption charges were brought against 12 principals, a former school superintendent and supply vendor for a $12 million (~$ in ) kickback scheme. However, law professor Peter Henning argues Detroit&#x27;s corruption is not unusual for a city its size, especially when compared with Chicago.

Detroit is sometimes referred to as a sanctuary city because it has &quot;anti-profiling ordinances that generally prohibit local police from asking about the immigration status of people who are not suspected of any crime&quot;. The city in recent years has been a stronghold for the Democratic Party, with around 90% of votes in the city going to incumbent vice president, Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate in the 2024 Presidential election.

Detroit is home to several institutions of higher learning, including Wayne State University and the University of Detroit Mercy. Grand Valley State University&#x27;s Detroit Center hosts workshops, seminars, professional development, and other large gatherings. Sacred Heart Major Seminary, founded in 1919, is affiliated with Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; in Rome and offers pontifical degrees as well as civil undergraduate and graduate degrees. Other institutions in the city include the College for Creative Studies and Wayne County Community College. In June 2009, the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine which is based in East Lansing opened a satellite campus at the Detroit Medical Center.

===Primary and secondary schools===

 many K-12 students in Detroit frequently change schools, with some children having been enrolled in seven schools before finishing their K-12 careers. There is a concentration of senior high schools and charter schools in the downtown area, which had wealthier residents and more gentrification relative to other parts of Detroit: Downtown, northwest Detroit, and northeast Detroit have 1,894, 3,742, and 6,018 students of high school age, respectively, while they have 11, three, and two high schools, respectively. because of the lack of public transportation and the lack of school bus services, many Detroit families have to rely on themselves to transport children to school.

With about 66,000 public school students (2011–12), the Detroit Public Schools (DPS) district is the largest school district in Michigan. Detroit has an additional 56,000 charter school students for a combined enrollment of about 122,000 students. there are about as many students in charter schools as there are in district schools. DPS continues to have the majority of the special education pupils. In addition, some Detroit students, as of 2016, attend public schools in other municipalities.

With growing charter schools enrollment as well as a continued exodus of population, the city planned to close many public schools. State officials report a 68% graduation rate for Detroit&#x27;s public schools adjusted for those who change schools. Traditional public and charter school students in the city have performed poorly on standardized tests. and 2011, while Detroit traditional public schools scored a record low on national tests, the publicly funded charter schools did even worse than the traditional public schools. there were 30,000 excess openings in Detroit traditional public and charter schools, bearing in mind the number of K-12-aged children in the city. In 2016, Kate Zernike of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated school performance did not improve despite the proliferation of charters, describing the situation as &quot;lots of choice, with no good choice&quot;.

Detroit public schools students scored the lowest on tests of reading and writing of all major cities in the United States in 2015. Among eighth-graders, only 27% showed basic proficiency in math and 44% in reading. Nearly half of Detroit&#x27;s adults are functionally illiterate.

Detroit is served by various private schools, as well as parochial Roman Catholic schools operated by the Archdiocese of Detroit. there are four Catholic grade schools and three Catholic high schools in the City of Detroit, with all of them in the city&#x27;s west side. The Archdiocese of Detroit lists a number of primary and secondary schools in the metro area as Catholic education has emigrated to the suburbs. Of the three Catholic high schools, two are operated by the Society of Jesus and the third is co-sponsored by the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Congregation of St. Basil.

==Media==


The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; and &quot;The Detroit News&quot; are the major daily newspapers, both broadsheet publications published together under a joint operating agreement called the Detroit Media Partnership. Media philanthropy includes the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; high school journalism program and the Old Newsboys&#x27; Goodfellow Fund of Detroit. In March 2009, the two newspapers reduced home delivery to three days per week, print reduced newsstand issues of the papers on non-delivery days and focus resources on Internet-based news delivery. The &quot;Metro Times&quot;, founded in 1980, is a weekly publication, covering news, arts &amp; entertainment.

Founded in 1935 and based in Detroit, the &quot;Michigan Chronicle&quot; is one of the oldest and most respected African-American weekly newspapers in America, covering politics, entertainment, sports and community events. The Detroit television market is the 11th largest in the United States; according to estimates that do not include audiences in large areas of Ontario (Windsor and its surrounding area on broadcast and cable TV, as well as several other cable markets in Ontario, such as Ottawa) which receive and watch Detroit television stations.

Detroit has the 11th largest radio market in the United States, though this ranking does not take into account Canadian audiences. Nearby Canadian stations such as Windsor&#x27;s CKLW (whose jingles formerly proclaimed &quot;CKLW-the Motor City&quot;) are popular in Detroit.

==Infrastructure==
===Health systems===
There are over a dozen major hospitals, which include the Detroit Medical Center (DMC), Henry Ford Health System, St. John Health System, and the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center. DMC, a regional Level I trauma center, consists of Detroit Receiving Hospital and University Health Center, Children&#x27;s Hospital of Michigan, Harper University Hospital, Hutzel Women&#x27;s Hospital, Kresge Eye Institute, Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan, Sinai-Grace Hospital, and the Karmanos Cancer Institute. DMC has more than 2,000 licensed beds and 3,000 affiliated physicians. It is the largest private employer in the city. The center is staffed by physicians from the Wayne State University School of Medicine, the largest single-campus medical school in the United States and the fourth largest medical school overall.

DMC formally became a part of Vanguard Health Systems on December 30, 2010, as a for-profit corporation. Vanguard has agreed to invest nearly $1.5 B in the DMC complex. Vanguard has agreed to assume all debts and pension obligations. The metro area has many other hospitals including William Beaumont Hospital, St. Joseph&#x27;s, and University of Michigan Medical Center.
In 2011, DMC and Henry Ford Health System substantially increased investments in medical research facilities and hospitals in the city&#x27;s Midtown and New Center. In 2012, two major construction projects were begun in New Center. The Henry Ford Health System started the first phase of a $500 million, 300-acre revitalization project, with the construction of a new $30 million, 275,000-square-foot, &quot;Medical Distribution Center&quot; for Cardinal Health, Inc. and Wayne State University started construction on a new $93 million, 207,000-square-foot, Integrative Biosciences Center (IBio). As many as 500 researchers and staff will work out of the IBio Center.

===Transportation===
With its proximity to Canada and its facilities, ports, major highways, rail connections and international airports, Detroit is an important transportation hub. The city has three international border crossings, the Ambassador Bridge, Detroit–Windsor Tunnel and Michigan Central Railway Tunnel, linking Detroit to Windsor. The Ambassador Bridge is the single busiest border crossing in North America, carrying 27% of the total trade between the U.S. and Canada.

In 2015 Canadian Transport Minister Lisa Raitt announced Canada agreed to pay the entire cost to build a $250 million U.S. Customs plaza adjacent to the planned new Detroit–Windsor bridge, now the Gordie Howe International Bridge. Canada had already planned to pay for 95% of the bridge, which will cost $2.1 billion and is expected to open in 2024. &quot;This allows Canada and Michigan to move the project forward immediately to its next steps which include further design work and property acquisition on the U.S. side of the border&quot;, Raitt said issued after she spoke in the House of Commons.
====Transit systems====
Mass transit in the region is provided by bus services. The Detroit Department of Transportation provides service within city limits up to the outer edges of the city. From there, the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) provides service to the suburbs and the city regionally with local routes and SMART&#x27;s FAST service. FAST is a new service provided by SMART which offers limited stops along major corridors throughout the Detroit metropolitan area connecting the suburbs to downtown. The new high-frequency service travels along three of Detroit&#x27;s busiest corridors, Gratiot, Woodward, and Michigan, and only stops at designated FAST stops. Cross border service between the downtown areas of Windsor and Detroit is provided by Transit Windsor via the Tunnel Bus.

An elevated rail system known as the People Mover, completed in 1987, provides daily service around a loop downtown. The QLINE serves as a link between the People Mover and the Amtrak station via Woodward Avenue. The Ann Arbor–Detroit Regional Rail line will extend from New Center, connecting to Ann Arbor via Dearborn, Wayne, and Ypsilanti when it is opened.

The Regional Transit Authority (RTA) was established by an act of the Michigan legislature in 2012 to oversee and coordinate all existing regional mass transit operations, and to develop new transit services in the region. The RTA&#x27;s first project was the introduction of RelfeX, a limited-stop, cross-county bus service connecting downtown and midtown Detroit with Oakland county via Woodward avenue.

Amtrak provides service to Detroit, operating its &quot;Wolverine&quot; service between Chicago and Pontiac. The Amtrak station is in New Center north of downtown. Intercity bus service is offered at the Detroit Bus Station. Greyhound Lines, Flixbus, Indian Trails, and Barons Bus Lines connect Detroit with numerous cities across the Midwest.

====Car ownership====
The city of Detroit has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2016, 24.7% of Detroit households lacked a car, much higher than the national average of 8.7%. Detroit averaged 1.15 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.

====Freight railroads====
Freight railroad operations in the city of Detroit are provided by Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, Conrail Shared Assets, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway, each of which have local yards within the city. Detroit is also served by the Delray Connecting Railroad and Detroit Connecting Railroad shortlines.

====Airports====

Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), the principal airport serving Detroit, is in nearby Romulus. DTW is a primary hub for Delta Air Lines (following its acquisition of Northwest Airlines), and a secondary hub for Spirit Airlines. The airport is connected to Downtown Detroit by the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) FAST Michigan route.

Coleman A. Young International Airport (DET), previously called Detroit City Airport, is on Detroit&#x27;s northeast side; the airport now maintains only charter service and general aviation. Willow Run Airport, in western Wayne County near Ypsilanti, is a general aviation and cargo airport.

====Freeways====

Metro Detroit has an extensive toll-free network of freeways administered by the Michigan Department of Transportation. Four major Interstate Highways surround the city. Detroit is connected via I-75 and I-96 to Kings Highway 401 and to major Southern Ontario cities such as London, Ontario and the Greater Toronto Area. I-75 (Chrysler and Fisher freeways) is the region&#x27;s main north–south route, serving Flint, Pontiac, Troy, and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Detroit–Toledo and Seaway Freeways) to serve many of the communities along the shore of Lake Erie.

I-94 (Edsel Ford Freeway) runs east–west through Detroit and serves Ann Arbor to the west (where it continues to Chicago) and Port Huron to the northeast. The stretch of the I-94 freeway from Ypsilanti to Detroit was one of America&#x27;s earlier limited-access highways. Henry Ford built it to link the factories at Willow Run and Dearborn during World War II. A portion was known as the Willow Run Expressway. The I-96 freeway runs northwest–southeast through Livingston, Oakland and Wayne counties and (as the Jeffries Freeway through Wayne County) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.

I-275 runs north–south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and I-696 in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit. I-375 is a short spur route in downtown Detroit, an extension of the Chrysler Freeway. I-696 (Reuther Freeway) runs east–west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit. Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit. Michigan state highways designated with the letter M serve to connect major freeways.

===Floating post office===

Detroit has a floating post office, the &quot;J. W. Westcott II&quot;, which serves lake freighters along the Detroit River. Its ZIP Code is 48222. The ZIP Code is used exclusively for the &quot;J. W. Westcott II&quot;, which makes it the only floating ZIP Code in the United States. It has a land-based office at 12 24th Street, just south of the Ambassador Bridge. The J.W. Westcott Company was established in 1874 by Captain John Ward Westcott as a maritime reporting agency to inform other vessels about port conditions, and the &quot;J. W. Westcott II&quot; vessel began service in 1949 and is still in operation today.

<doc id="8688" wikidata="Q55819" url="?curid=8688" title="Deccan Traps">
<text>The Deccan Traps are a large igneous province of west-central India (17–24°N, 73–74°E). They are one of the largest volcanic features on Earth, taking the form of a large shield volcano. They consist of many layers of solidified flood basalt that together are more than about thick, cover an area of about , and have a volume of about . Originally, the Deccan Traps may have covered about , with a correspondingly larger original volume. This volume overlies the Archean age Indian Shield, which is likely the lithology the province passed through during eruption. The province is commonly divided into four subprovinces: the main Deccan, the Malwa Plateau, the Mandla Lobe, and the Saurashtran Plateau.

The eruptions occurred over a 600–800,000 year time period between around 66.3 to 65.6 million years ago, spanning the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. While some authors have suggested that the eruptions were the primary cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction event, which dates to around 66.05 million years ago, this has been strongly disputed, with many authors suggesting that the Chicxulub impact was the primary cause of the extinction. While some scholars suggest that the eruptions may have been a contributing factor in the extinctions, others suggest that the role of the Deccan Traps in the extinction were negligible or even partially negated the effects of the impact.

The Deccan Traps are thought to have been produced in major part by the still active Réunion hotspot, responsible for the creation of the modern Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;trap&quot; has been used in geology since 1785–1795 for such rock formations. It is derived from the Swedish word for stairs () and refers to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region. The name &quot;Deccan&quot; has Sanskrit origins meaning &quot;southern&quot;.

==History==

The Deccan Traps began forming 66.25 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period, although it is possible that some of the oldest material may underlie younger material. The bulk of the volcanic eruption occurred at the Western Ghats between 66 and 65 million years ago when lava began to extrude in fissure eruptions. Determining the exact age for Deccan rock is difficult due to a number of limitations, one being that the transition between eruption events may have lasted only a few thousand years and the resolution of dating methods is not sufficient to pinpoint these events. In this way, determining the rate of magma emplacement is also difficult to constrain. This series of eruptions may have lasted for less than 30,000 years.

The original area covered by the lava flows is estimated to have been as large as , approximately half the size of modern India. The Deccan Traps region was reduced to its current size by erosion and plate tectonics; the present area of directly observable lava flows is around .

The Deccan Traps are segmented into three stratigraphic units: the Upper, Middle, and Lower traps. While it was previously interpreted that these groups represented their own key points in the sequence of events in Deccan extrusion, it is now more widely accepted that these horizons relate more closely to paleotopography and distance from the eruption site.

==Effect on mass extinctions and climate==
The release of volcanic gases, particularly sulfur dioxide, during the formation of the traps may have contributed to climate change. An average drop in temperature of about was recorded during this period.

Because of its magnitude, some scientists (notably Gerta Keller) have speculated that the gases released during the formation of the Deccan Traps played a major role in the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event (also known as the Cretaceous–Tertiary or K–T extinction). It has been theorized that sudden cooling due to sulfurous volcanic gases released by the formation of the traps and toxic gas emissions may have contributed significantly to the K–Pg mass extinction. However, the current consensus among the scientific community is that the extinction was primarily triggered by the Chicxulub impact event in North America, which would have produced a sunlight-blocking dust cloud that killed much of the plant life and reduced global temperature (this cooling is called an impact winter).

A 2014 study suggested the extinction may have been caused by both the volcanism and the impact event. This was followed by a similar study in 2015, both of which consider the hypothesis that the impact exacerbated or induced the Deccan volcanism, since the events occurred approximately at antipodes. A 2020 study questioned the idea that the Deccan Traps were a contributory factor at all, suggesting that the Deccan Traps eruptions may have even partially negated the climatic change induced by the impact.

A major criticism of the Deccan Traps as the primary cause of the extinctions is that the extinction event appears to be globally geologically instantaneous and simultaneous in both marine and terrestrial environments, as would be expected from an impact cause, rather than staggered as would be expected from an LIP cause.

A more recent discovery appears to demonstrate the scope of the destruction from the impact alone, however. In a March 2019 article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, an international team of twelve scientists revealed the contents of the Tanis fossil site discovered near Bowman, North Dakota, that appeared to show a devastating mass destruction of an ancient lake and its inhabitants at the time of the Chicxulub impact. In the paper, the group reports that the geology of the site is strewn with fossilized trees and remains of fish and other animals. The lead researcher, Robert A. DePalma of the University of Kansas, was quoted in the New York Times as stating that &quot;You would be blind to miss the carcasses sticking out... It is impossible to miss when you see the outcrop&quot;. Evidence correlating this find to the Chicxulub impact included tektites bearing &quot;the unique chemical signature of other tektites associated with the Chicxulub event&quot; found in the gills of fish fossils and embedded in amber, an iridium-rich top layer that is considered another signature of the event, and an atypical lack of evidence for scavenging, perhaps suggesting that there were few survivors. The exact mechanism of the site&#x27;s destruction has been debated as either an impact-caused tsunami or lake and river seiche activity triggered by post-impact earthquakes, though there has yet been no firm conclusion upon which researchers have settled. 

A 2024 study of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether levels in fossilized peat found that the Deccan Traps caused long-term warming of around 3°C over the course of the final 100,000 years of the Maastrichtian, as well as about 5°C drop in temperature for less than 10,000 years around 30,000 years prior to the K-Pg boundary (coinciding with the peak of the Poladpur eruptive phase), but by the time of the K-Pg boundary, global temperatures had returned to previous levels. This suggests that the Deccan Traps were not the primary cause of extinction.

==Petrology==

Within the Deccan Traps, at least 95% of the lavas are tholeiitic basalts. Major mineral constituents are olivine, pyroxenes, and plagioclase, as well as certain Fe-Ti-rich oxides. These magmas are &lt;7% MgO. However, many of these minerals are observed as highly altered forms. Other rock types present include alkali basalt, nephelinite, lamprophyre, and carbonatite.

Mantle xenoliths have been described from Kachchh (northwestern India) and elsewhere in the western Deccan and contain spinel lherzolite and pyroxenite constituents.

While the Deccan traps have been categorized in many different ways including the three different stratigraphic groups, geochemically the province can be split into as many as eleven different formations. Many of the petrologic differences in these units are a product of varying degrees of crustal contamination.

==Fossils==
The Deccan Traps are famous for the beds of fossils that have been found between layers of lava. Particularly well-known species include the frog &quot;Oxyglossus pusillus&quot; (Owen) of the Eocene of India and the toothed frog &quot;Indobatrachus&quot;, an early lineage of modern frogs, which is now placed in the Australian family Myobatrachidae. The Infratrappean Beds (Lameta Formation) and Intertrappean Beds also contain fossil freshwater molluscs.

==Theories of formation==
It is postulated that the Deccan Traps eruption was associated with a deep mantle plume. High 3He/4He ratios of the main pulse of the eruption are often seen in magmas with mantle plume origin. The area of long-term eruption (the hotspot), known as the Réunion hotspot, is suspected of both causing the Deccan Traps eruption and opening the rift that separated the Mascarene Plateau from India. Regional crustal thinning supports the theory of this rifting event and likely encouraged the rise of the plume in this area. Seafloor spreading at the boundary between the Indian and African Plates subsequently pushed India north over the plume, which now lies under Réunion island in the Indian Ocean, southwest of India. The mantle plume model has, however, been challenged.

Data continues to emerge that supports the plume model. The motion of the Indian tectonic plate and the eruptive history of the Deccan traps show strong correlations. Based on data from marine magnetic profiles, a pulse of unusually rapid plate motion began at the same time as the first pulse of Deccan flood basalts, which is dated at 67 million years ago. The spreading rate rapidly increased and reached a maximum at the same time as the peak basaltic eruptions. The spreading rate then dropped off, with the decrease occurring around 63 million years ago, by which time the main phase of Deccan volcanism ended. This correlation is seen as driven by plume dynamics.

The motions of the Indian and African plates have also been shown to be coupled, the common element being the position of these plates relative to the location of the Réunion plume head. The onset of accelerated motion of India coincides with a large slowing of the rate of counterclockwise rotation of Africa. The close correlations between the plate motions suggest that they were both driven by the force of the Réunion plume.

When comparing the Na8, Fe8, and Si8 contents of the Deccan to other major igneous provinces, the Deccan appears to have undergone the greatest degree of melting suggesting a deep plume origin. Olivine appears to have fractionated at near-Moho depths with additional fractionation of gabbro ~6 km below the surface. Features such as widespread faulting, frequent diking events, high heat flux, and positive gravity anomalies suggest that the extrusive phase of the Deccan Traps is associated with the existence of a triple junction which may have existed during the Late Cretaceous, having been caused by a deep mantle plume. Not all of these diking events are attributed to large-scale contributions to the overall flow volume. It can be difficult, however, to locate the largest dikes as they are often located towards the west coast and are therefore believed to currently reside under water.

==Suggested link to impact events==
===Chicxulub crater===
Although the Deccan Traps began erupting well before the impact, in a 2015 study it was proposed based on argon–argon dating that the impact may have caused an increase in permeability that allowed magma to reach the surface and produced the most voluminous flows, accounting for around 70% of the volume. The combination of the asteroid impact and the resulting increase in eruptive volume may have been responsible for the mass extinctions that occurred at the time that separates the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods, known as the K–Pg boundary. However this proposal has been questioned by other authors, who describe the suggestion as being &quot;convenient interpretations based on superficial and cursory observations.&quot;

===Shiva crater===
A geological structure that exists in the sea floor off the west coast of India has been suggested as a possible impact crater, in this context called the Shiva crater. It was also dated approximately 66 million years ago, potentially matching the Deccan traps. The researchers claiming that this feature is an impact crater suggest that the impact may have been the triggering event for the Deccan Traps as well as contributing to the acceleration of the Indian plate in the early Paleogene. However, the current consensus in the Earth science community is that this feature is unlikely to be an actual impact crater.

<text>&quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; (DADT) was the official United States policy on military service of homosexual people. Instituted during the Clinton administration, the policy was issued under Department of Defense Directive 1304.26 on December 21, 1993, and was in effect from February 28, 1994, until September 20, 2011. The policy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing closeted homosexual or bisexual service members or applicants, while barring openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons from military service. This relaxation of legal restrictions on service by gays and lesbians in the armed forces was mandated by Public Law 103–160 (Title 10 of the United States Code §654), which was signed November 30, 1993. The policy prohibited people who &quot;demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts&quot; from serving in the armed forces of the United States, because their presence &quot;would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability&quot;.

The act prohibited any non-heterosexual person from disclosing their sexual orientation or from speaking about any same-sex relationships, including marriages or other familial attributes, while serving in the United States armed forces. The act specified that service members who disclose that they are homosexual or engage in homosexual conduct should be separated (discharged) except when a service member&#x27;s conduct was &quot;for the purpose of avoiding or terminating military service&quot; or when it &quot;would not be in the best interest of the armed forces&quot;. Since DADT ended in 2011, persons who are openly homosexual and bisexual have been able to serve.

The &quot;don&#x27;t ask&quot; section of the DADT policy specified that superiors should not initiate an investigation of a service member&#x27;s orientation without witnessing disallowed behaviors. However, evidence of homosexual behavior deemed credible could be used to initiate an investigation. Unauthorized investigations and harassment of suspected servicemen and women led to an expansion of the policy to &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell, don&#x27;t pursue, don&#x27;t harass&quot;.

Beginning in the early 2000s, several legal challenges to DADT were filed, and legislation to repeal DADT was enacted in December 2010, specifying that the policy would remain in place until the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certified that repeal would not harm military readiness, followed by a 60-day waiting period. A July 6, 2011, ruling from a federal appeals court barred further enforcement of the U.S. military&#x27;s ban on openly gay service members. President Barack Obama, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen sent that certification to Congress on July 22, 2011, which set the end of DADT to September 20, 2011.

Even with DADT repealed, the legal definition of marriage as being one man and one woman under the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) meant that, although same-sex partners could get married, their marriage was not recognized by the federal government. This barred partners from access to the same benefits afforded to heterosexual couples such as base access, health care, and United States military pay, including family separation allowance and Basic Allowance for Housing with dependents. The Department of Defense attempted to allow some of the benefits that were not restricted by DOMA, but the Supreme Court decision in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; (2013) made these efforts unnecessary.

==Background==

Engaging in homosexual activity had been grounds for discharge from the American military since the Revolutionary War. Policies based on sexual orientation appeared as the United States prepared to enter World War II. When the military added psychiatric screening to its induction process, it included homosexuality as a disqualifying trait, then seen as a form of psychopathology. When the army issued revised mobilization regulations in 1942, it distinguished &quot;homosexual&quot; recruits from &quot;normal&quot; recruits for the first time. Before the buildup to the war, gay service members were court-martialed, imprisoned, and dishonorably discharged; but in wartime, commanding officers found it difficult to convene court-martial boards of commissioned officers and the administrative blue discharge became the military&#x27;s standard method for handling gay and lesbian personnel. In 1944, a new policy directive decreed that homosexuals were to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists, and discharged under Regulation 615–360, section 8.

In 1947, blue discharges were discontinued and two new classifications were created: &quot;general&quot; and &quot;undesirable&quot;. Under such a system, a serviceman or woman found to be gay but who had not committed any sexual acts while in service would tend to receive an undesirable discharge. Those found guilty of engaging in sexual conduct were usually dishonorably discharged. A 1957 U.S. Navy study known as the Crittenden Report dismissed the charge that homosexuals constitute a security risk, but nonetheless did not advocate for an end to anti-gay discrimination in the navy on the basis that &quot;The service should not move ahead of civilian society nor attempt to set substantially different standards in attitude or action with respect to homosexual offenders.&quot; It remained secret until 1976. Fannie Mae Clackum was the first service member to successfully appeal such a discharge, winning eight years of back pay from the US Court of Claims in 1960.

From the 1950s through the Vietnam War, some notable gay service members avoided discharges despite pre-screening efforts, and when personnel shortages occurred, homosexuals were allowed to serve.

The gay and lesbian rights movement in the 1970s and 1980s raised the issue by publicizing several noteworthy dismissals of gay service members. Air Force TSgt Leonard Matlovich, the first service member to purposely out himself to challenge the ban, appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; in 1975. In 1982 the Department of Defense issued a policy stating that, &quot;Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot; It cited the military&#x27;s need &quot;to maintain discipline, good order, and morale&quot; and &quot;to prevent breaches of security&quot;. In 1988, in response to a campaign against lesbians at the Marines&#x27; Parris Island Depot, activists launched the Gay and Lesbian Military Freedom Project (MFP) to advocate for an end to the exclusion of gays and lesbians from the armed forces. In 1989, reports commissioned by the Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), an arm of the Pentagon, were discovered in the process of Joseph Steffan&#x27;s lawsuit fighting his forced resignation from the U.S. Naval Academy. One report said that &quot;having a same-gender or an opposite-gender orientation is unrelated to job performance in the same way as is being left- or right-handed.&quot; Other lawsuits fighting discharges highlighted the service record of service members like Tracy Thorne and Margarethe (Grethe) Cammermeyer. The MFP began lobbying Congress in 1990, and in 1991 Senator Brock Adams (D-Washington) and Rep. Barbara Boxer introduced the Military Freedom Act, legislation to end the ban completely. Adams and Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colorado) re-introduced it the next year. In July 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, in the context of the outing of his press aide Pete Williams, dismissed the idea that gays posed a security risk as &quot;a bit of an old chestnut&quot; in testimony before the House Budget Committee. In response to his comment, several major newspapers endorsed ending the ban, including &quot;USA Today&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;. In June 1992, the General Accounting Office released a report that members of Congress had requested two years earlier estimating the costs associated with the ban on gays and lesbians in the military at $27 million annually.

During the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign, the civil rights of gays and lesbians, particularly their open service in the military, attracted some press attention, and all candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination supported ending the ban on military service by gays and lesbians, but the Republicans did not make a political issue of that position. In an August cover letter to all his senior officers, General Carl Mundy Jr., Commandant of the Marine Corps, praised a position paper authored by a Marine Corps chaplain that said that &quot;In the unique, intensely close environment of the military, homosexual conduct can threaten the lives, including the physical (e.g. AIDS) and psychological well-being of others&quot;. Mundy called it &quot;extremely insightful&quot; and said it offered &quot;a sound basis for discussion of the issue&quot;. The murder of gay U.S. Navy petty officer Allen R. Schindler Jr. on October 27, 1992 brought calls from advocates for allowing open service by gays and lesbians in the US military, and requested prompt action from the incoming Clinton administration.

==Origin==
The policy was introduced as a compromise measure in 1993 by President Bill Clinton who campaigned in 1992 on the promise to allow all citizens to serve in the military regardless of sexual orientation. Commander Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman, expressed the opposition of many in the military at the time when he said, &quot;Homosexuals are notoriously promiscuous&quot; and that in shared shower situations, heterosexuals would have an &quot;uncomfortable feeling of someone watching&quot;.

During the 1993 policy debate, the National Defense Research Institute prepared a study for the Office of the Secretary of Defense published as &quot;Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military Personnel Policy: Options and Assessment&quot;. It concluded that &quot;circumstances could exist under which the ban on homosexuals could be lifted with little or no adverse consequences for recruitment and retention&quot; if the policy were implemented with care, principally because many factors contribute to individual enlistment and re-enlistment decisions. On May 5, 1993, Gregory M. Herek, associate research psychologist at the University of California at Davis and an authority on public attitudes toward lesbians and gay men, testified before the House Armed Services Committee on behalf of several professional associations. He stated, &quot;The research data show that there is nothing about lesbians and gay men that makes them inherently unfit for military service, and there is nothing about heterosexuals that makes them inherently unable to work and live with gay people in close quarters.&quot; Herek added, &quot;The assumption that heterosexuals cannot overcome their prejudices toward gay people is a mistaken one.&quot;

In Congress, Democratic Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee led the contingent that favored maintaining the absolute ban on gays. Reformers were led by Democratic Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who favored modification (but ultimately voted for the defense authorization bill with the gay ban language), and 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, a former Senator and a retired Major General, who argued on behalf of allowing service by open gays and lesbians but was not allowed to appear before the Committee by Nunn. In a June 1993 &quot;Washington Post&quot; opinion piece, Goldwater wrote: &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be straight to shoot straight&quot;. The White House was also reportedly upset when LGBT activist David Mixner openly described Nunn as an &quot;old-fashioned bigot&quot; for opposing Clinton&#x27;s plan to lift the ban on gays in the military.

Congress rushed to enact the existing gay ban policy into federal law, outflanking Clinton&#x27;s planned repeal effort. Clinton called for legislation to overturn the ban, but encountered intense opposition from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of Congress, and portions of the public. DADT emerged as a compromise policy. Congress included text in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (passed in 1993) requiring the military to abide by regulations essentially identical to the 1982 absolute ban policy. The Clinton administration on December 21, 1993, issued Defense Directive 1304.26, which directed that military applicants were not to be asked about their sexual orientation. This policy is now known as &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot;. The phrase was coined by Charles Moskos, a military sociologist.

In accordance with the December 21, 1993, Department of Defense Directive 1332.14, it was legal policy (10 U.S.C. § 654) that homosexuality was incompatible with military service and that persons who engaged in homosexual acts or stated that they are homosexual or bisexual were to be discharged. The Uniform Code of Military Justice, passed by Congress in 1950 and signed by President Harry S Truman, established the policies and procedures for discharging service members.

The full name of the policy at the time was &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell, Don&#x27;t Pursue&quot;. The &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot; provision mandated that military or appointed officials not ask about or require members to reveal their sexual orientation. The &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; stated that a member may be discharged for claiming to be a homosexual or bisexual or making a statement indicating a tendency towards or intent to engage in homosexual activities. The &quot;Don&#x27;t Pursue&quot; established what was minimally required for an investigation to be initiated. A &quot;Don&#x27;t Harass&quot; provision was added to the policy later. It ensured that the military would not allow harassment or violence against service members for any reason.

The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network was founded in 1993 to advocate an end to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the U.S. Armed Forces.

==Court challenges==
DADT was upheld by five federal Courts of Appeal. The Supreme Court, in &quot;Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.&quot; (2006), unanimously held that the federal government could constitutionally withhold funding from universities, no matter what their nondiscrimination policies might be, for refusing to give military recruiters access to school resources. An association of law schools had argued that allowing military recruiting at their institutions compromised their ability to exercise their free speech rights in opposition to discrimination based on sexual orientation as represented by DADT.

===&quot;McVeigh v. Cohen&quot;===
In January 1998, Senior Chief Petty Officer Timothy R. McVeigh (not to be confused with convicted Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy J. McVeigh) won a preliminary injunction from a U.S. district court that prevented his discharge from the U.S. Navy for &quot;homosexual conduct&quot; after 17 years of service. His lawsuit did not challenge the DADT policy but asked the court to hold the military accountable for adhering to the policy&#x27;s particulars. The Navy had investigated McVeigh&#x27;s sexual orientation based on his AOL email account name and user profile. District Judge Stanley Sporkin ruled in &quot;McVeigh v. Cohen&quot; that the Navy had violated its own DADT guidelines: &quot;Suggestions of sexual orientation in a private, anonymous email account did not give the Navy a sufficient reason to investigate to determine whether to commence discharge proceedings.&quot; He called the Navy&#x27;s investigation &quot;a search and destroy mission&quot; against McVeigh. The case also attracted attention because a navy paralegal had misrepresented himself when querying AOL for information about McVeigh&#x27;s account. Frank Rich linked the two issues: &quot;McVeigh is as clear-cut a victim of a witch hunt as could be imagined, and that witch hunt could expand exponentially if the military wants to add on-line fishing to its invasion of service members&#x27; privacy.&quot; AOL apologized to McVeigh and paid him damages. McVeigh reached a settlement with the Navy that paid his legal expenses and allowed him to retire with full benefits in July. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Sporkin&#x27;s ruling &quot;a victory for gay rights, with implications for the millions of people who use computer on-line services&quot;.

===&quot;Witt v. Department of the Air Force&quot;===
In April 2006, Margaret Witt, a major in the United States Air Force who was being investigated for homosexuality, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that DADT violates substantive due process, the Equal Protection Clause, and procedural due process. In July 2007 the Secretary of the Air Force ordered her honorable discharge. Dismissed by the district court, the case was heard on appeal, and the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling on May 21, 2008. Its decision in &quot;Witt v. Department of the Air Force&quot; reinstated Witt&#x27;s substantive-due-process and procedural-due-process claims and affirmed the dismissal of her Equal Protection claim. The Ninth Circuit, analyzing the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003), determined that DADT had to be subjected to heightened scrutiny, meaning that there must be an &quot;important&quot; governmental interest at issue, that DADT must &quot;significantly&quot; further the governmental interest, and that there can be no less intrusive way for the government to advance that interest.

The Obama administration declined to appeal, allowing a May 3, 2009, deadline to pass, leaving &quot;Witt&quot; as binding on the entire Ninth Circuit, and returning the case to the District Court. On September 24, 2010, District Judge Ronald B. Leighton ruled that Witt&#x27;s constitutional rights had been violated by her discharge and that she must be reinstated to the Air Force.

The government filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit on November 23, but did not attempt to have the trial court&#x27;s ruling stayed pending the outcome. In a settlement announced on May 10, 2011, the Air Force agreed to drop its appeal and remove Witt&#x27;s discharge from her military record. She will retire with full benefits.

===&quot;Log Cabin Republicans v. United States of America&quot;===
In 2010, a lawsuit filed in 2004 by the Log Cabin Republicans (LCR), the nation&#x27;s largest Republican gay organization, went to trial. Challenging the constitutionality of DADT, the plaintiffs stated that the policy violates the rights of gay military members to free speech, due process and open association. The government argued that DADT was necessary to advance a legitimate governmental interest. Plaintiffs introduced statements by President Barack Obama, from prepared remarks, that DADT &quot;doesn&#x27;t contribute to our national security&quot;, &quot;weakens our national security&quot;, and that reversal is &quot;essential for our national security&quot;. According to plaintiffs, these statements alone satisfied their burden of proof on the due process claims.

On September 9, 2010, Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled in &quot;Log Cabin Republicans v. United States of America&quot; that the ban on service by openly gay service members was an unconstitutional violation of the First and Fifth Amendments. On October 12, 2010, she granted an immediate worldwide injunction prohibiting the Department of Defense from enforcing the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy and ordered the military to suspend and discontinue any investigation or discharge, separation, or other proceedings based on it. The Department of Justice appealed her decision and requested a stay of her injunction, which Phillips denied but which the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted on October 20 and stayed pending appeal on November 1. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to overrule the stay. District Court neither anticipated questions of constitutional law nor formulated a rule broader than is required by the facts. The constitutional issues regarding DADT are well-defined, and the District Court focused specifically on the relevant inquiry of whether the statute impermissibly infringed upon substantive due process rights with regard to a protected area of individual liberty. Engaging in a careful and detailed review of the facts presented to it at trial, the District Court concluded that the Government put forward no persuasive evidence to demonstrate that the statute is a valid exercise of congressional authority to legislate in the realm of protected liberty interests. See Log Cabin, 716 F. Supp. 2d at 923. Hypothetical questions were neither presented nor answered in reaching this decision. On October 19, 2010, military recruiters were told they could accept openly gay applicants. On October 20, 2010, Lt. Dan Choi, an openly gay man honorably discharged under DADT, re-enlisted in the U.S. Army.

Following the passage of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, the Justice Department asked the Ninth Circuit to suspend LCR&#x27;s suit in light of the legislative repeal. LCR opposed the request, noting that gay personnel were still subject to discharge. On January 28, 2011, the Court denied the Justice Department&#x27;s request. The Obama administration responded by requesting that the policy be allowed to stay in place while they completed the process of assuring that its end would not impact combat readiness. On March 28, the LCR filed a brief asking that the court deny the administration&#x27;s request.

In 2011, while waiting for certification, several service members were discharged under DADT at their own insistence, until July 6 when a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals re-instated Judge Phillips&#x27; injunction barring further enforcement of the U.S. military&#x27;s ban on openly gay service members. On July 11, the appeals court asked the DOJ to inform the court if it intended to proceed with its appeal. On July 14, the Justice Department filed a motion &quot;to avoid short-circuiting the repeal process established by Congress during the final stages of the implementation of the repeal&quot;. and warning of &quot;significant immediate harms on the government&quot;. On July 15, the Ninth Circuit restored most of the DADT policy, but continued to prohibit the government from discharging or investigating openly gay personnel. Following the implementation of DADT&#x27;s repeal, a panel of three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Phillips ruling.

==Debate==
Following the July 1999 murder of Army Pfc. Barry Winchell, apparently motivated by anti-gay bias, President Clinton issued an executive order modifying the Uniform Code of Military Justice to permit evidence of a hate crime to be admitted during the sentencing phase of a trial. In December, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered a review of DADT to determine if the policy&#x27;s anti-gay harassment component was being observed. When that review found anti-gay sentiments were widely expressed and tolerated in the military, the DOD adopted a new anti-harassment policy in July 2000, though its effectiveness was disputed. On December 7, 1999, Hillary Clinton told an audience of gay supporters that &quot;Gays and lesbians already serve with distinction in our nation&#x27;s armed forces and should not face discrimination. Fitness to serve should be based on an individual&#x27;s conduct, not their sexual orientation.&quot; Later that month, retired General Carl E. Mundy Jr. defended the implementation of DADT against what he called the &quot;politicization&quot; of the issue by both Clintons. He cited discharge statistics for the Marines for the past five years that showed 75% were based on &quot;voluntary admission of homosexuality&quot; and 49% occurred during the first six months of service, when new recruits were most likely to reevaluate their decision to enlist. He also argued against any change in the policy, writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;Conduct that is widely rejected by a majority of Americans can undermine the trust that is essential to creating and maintaining the sense of unity that is critical to the success of a military organization operating under the very different and difficult demands of combat.&quot; The conviction of Winchell&#x27;s murderer, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;galvanized opposition&quot; to DADT, an issue that had &quot;largely vanished from public debate&quot;. Opponents of the policy focused on punishing harassment in the military rather than the policy itself, which Senator Chuck Hagel defended on December 25: &quot;The U.S. armed forces aren&#x27;t some social experiment.&quot;

The principal candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000, Al Gore and Bill Bradley, both endorsed military service by open gays and lesbians, provoking opposition from high-ranking retired military officers, notably the recently retired commandant of the Marine Corps, General Charles C. Krulak. He and others objected to Gore&#x27;s statement that he would use support for ending DADT as a &quot;litmus test&quot; when considering candidates for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The 2000 Democratic Party platform was silent on the issue, while the Republican Party platform that year said: &quot;We affirm that homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot; Following the election of George W. Bush in 2000, observers expected him to avoid any changes to DADT, since his nominee for Secretary of State Colin Powell had participated in its creation.

In February 2004, members of the British Armed Forces, Lt Rolf Kurth and Lt Cdr Craig Jones, along with Aaron Belkin, Director of the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military met with members of Congress and spoke at the National Defense University. They spoke about their experience of the current situation in the UK. The UK lifted the ban on gay members serving in their forces in 2000.

In July 2004, the American Psychological Association issued a statement that DADT &quot;discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation&quot; and that &quot;Empirical evidence fails to show that sexual orientation is germane to any aspect of military effectiveness including unit cohesion, morale, recruitment and retention.&quot; It said that the U.S. military&#x27;s track record overcoming past racial and gender discrimination demonstrated its ability to integrate groups previously excluded. The Republican Party platform that year reiterated its support for the policy—&quot;We affirm traditional military culture, and we affirm that homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;—while the Democratic Party maintained its silence.

In February 2005, the Government Accountability Office released estimates of the cost of DADT. It reported at least $95.4 million in recruiting costs and at least $95.1 million for training replacements for the 9,488 troops discharged from 1994 through 2003, while noting that the true figures might be higher. In September, as part of its campaign to demonstrate that the military allowed open homosexuals to serve when its workforce requirements were greatest, the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military (now the Palm Center) reported that army regulations allowed the active-duty deployment of Army Reservists and National Guard troops who claim to be or who are accused of being gay. A U.S. Army Forces Command spokesperson said the regulation was intended to prevent Reservists and National Guard members from pretending to be gay to escape combat. Advocates of ending DADT repeatedly publicized discharges of highly trained gay and lesbian personnel, especially those in positions with critical shortages, including fifty-nine Arabic speakers and nine Persian speakers. Elaine Donnelly, president of the Center for Military Readiness, later argued that the military&#x27;s failure to ask about sexual orientation at recruitment was the cause of the discharges: [Y]ou could reduce this number to zero or near zero if the Department of Defense dropped Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell. ... We should not be training people who are not eligible to be in the Armed Forces.&quot;

In February 2006, a University of California Blue Ribbon Commission that included Lawrence Korb, a former assistant defense secretary during the Reagan administration, William Perry, Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration, and professors from the United States Military Academy released their assessment of the GAO&#x27;s analysis of the cost of DADT released a year earlier. The commission report stated that the GAO did not take into account the value the military lost from the departures. They said that that total cost was closer to $363 million, including $14.3 million for &quot;separation travel&quot; following a service member&#x27;s discharge, $17.8 million for training officers, $252.4 million for training enlistees, and $79.3 million in recruiting costs.

In 2006, Soulforce, a national LGBT rights organization, organized its Right to Serve Campaign, in which gay men and lesbians in several cities attempted to enlist in the Armed Forces or National Guard. Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness stated in September: &quot;I think the people involved here do not have the best interests of the military at heart. They never have. They are promoting an agenda to normalize homosexuality in America using the military as a battering ram to promote that broader agenda.&quot; She said that &quot;pro-homosexual activists ... are creating media events all over the country and even internationally.&quot;

In 2006, a speaking tour of gay former service members, organized by SLDN, Log Cabin Republicans, and Meehan, visited 18 colleges and universities. Patrick Guerriero, executive director of Log Cabin, thought the repeal movement was gaining &quot;new traction&quot; but &quot;Ultimately&quot;, said, &quot;we think it&#x27;s going to take a Republican with strong military credentials to make a shift in the policy.&quot; Elaine Donnelly called such efforts &quot;a big P.R. campaign&quot; and said that &quot;The law is there to protect good order and discipline in the military, and it&#x27;s not going to change.&quot;

In December 2006, Zogby International released the results of a poll of military personnel conducted in October 2006 that found that 26% favored allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, 37% were opposed, while 37% expressed no preference or were unsure. Of respondents who had experience with gay people in their unit, 6% said their presence had a positive impact on their personal morale, 66% said no impact, and 28% said negative impact. Regarding overall unit morale, 3% said positive impact, 64% no impact, and 27% negative impact.

Retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John Shalikashvili and former Senator and Secretary of Defense William Cohen opposed the policy in January 2007: &quot;I now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces&quot; Shalikashvili wrote. &quot;Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job.&quot; Shalikashvili cited the recent &quot;Zogby poll of more than 500 service members returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, three-quarters of whom said they were comfortable interacting with gay people. The debate took a different turn in March when General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the editorial board of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; he supported DADT because &quot;homosexual acts between two individuals are immoral and ... we should not condone immoral acts.&quot; His remarks became, according to the &quot;Tribune&quot;, &quot;a huge news story on radio, television and the Internet during the day and showed how sensitive the Pentagon&#x27;s policy has become.&quot; Senator John Warner, who backed DADT, said &quot;I respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the chairman&#x27;s view that homosexuality is immoral&quot;, and Pace expressed regret for expressing his personal views and said that DADT &quot;does not make a judgment about the morality of individual acts.&quot; Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, then in the early stages of his campaign for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, defended DADT:

That summer, after U.S. Senator Larry Craig was arrested for lewd conduct in a men&#x27;s restroom, conservative commentator Michael Medved argued that any liberalization of DADT would &quot;compromise restroom integrity and security&quot;. He wrote: &quot;The national shudder of discomfort and queasiness associated with any introduction of homosexual eroticism into public men&#x27;s rooms should make us more determined than ever to resist the injection of those lurid attitudes into the even more explosive situation of the U.S. military.&quot;

In November 2007, 28 retired generals and admirals urged Congress to repeal the policy, citing evidence that 65,000 gay men and women were serving in the armed forces and that there were over a million gay veterans. On November 17, 2008, 104 retired generals and admirals signed a similar statement. In December, SLDN arranged for &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to interview Darren Manzella, an Army medic who served in Iraq after coming out to his unit.

In 2008, former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, who previously stalled efforts to lift the ban on gays serving in military when he was Chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, hinted a shift from his previous political views by endorsing a new Pentagon study to examine the issue of homosexuals serving openly in the military, stating &quot;I think [when] 15 years go by on any personnel policy, it&#x27;s appropriate to take another look at it—see how it&#x27;s working, ask the hard questions, hear from the military. Start with a Pentagon study.&quot;

On May 4, 2008, while Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen addressed the graduating cadets at West Point, a cadet asked what would happen if the next administration were supportive of legislation allowing gays to serve openly. Mullen responded, &quot;Congress, and not the military, is responsible for DADT.&quot; Previously, during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2007, Mullen told lawmakers, &quot;I really think it is for the American people to come forward, really through this body, to both debate that policy and make changes, if that&#x27;s appropriate.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;I&#x27;d love to have Congress make its own decisions&quot; with respect to considering repeal.

In May 2009, when a committee of military law experts at the Palm Center, an anti-DADT research institute, concluded that the President could issue an Executive Order to suspend homosexual conduct discharges, Obama rejected that option and said he wanted Congress to change the law.

On July 5, 2009, Colin Powell told CNN that the policy was &quot;correct for the time&quot; but that &quot;sixteen years have now gone by, and I think a lot has changed with respect to attitudes within our country, and therefore I think this is a policy and a law that should be reviewed.&quot; Interviewed for the same broadcast, Mullen said the policy would continue to be implemented until the law was repealed, and that his advice was to &quot;move in a measured way. ... At a time when we&#x27;re fighting two conflicts there is a great deal of pressure on our forces and their families.&quot; In September, &quot;Joint Force Quarterly&quot; published an article by an Air Force colonel that disputed the argument that unit cohesion is compromised by the presence of openly gay personnel.

In October 2009, the Commission on Military Justice, known as the Cox Commission, repeated its 2001 recommendation that Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which bans sodomy, be repealed, noting that &quot;most acts of consensual sodomy committed by consenting military personnel are not prosecuted, creating a perception that prosecution of this sexual behavior is arbitrary.&quot;

In January 2010, the White House and congressional officials started work on repealing the ban by inserting language into the 2011 defense authorization bill. During Obama&#x27;s State of the Union Address on January 27, 2010, he said that he would work with Congress and the military to enact a repeal of the gay ban law and for the first time set a timetable for repeal.

At a February 2, 2010, congressional hearing, Senator John McCain read from a letter signed by &quot;over one thousand former general and flag officers&quot;. It said: &quot;We firmly believe that this law, which Congress passed to protect good order, discipline and morale in the unique environment of the armed forces, deserves continued support.&quot; The signature campaign had been organized by Elaine Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness, a longtime supporter of a traditional all-male and all-heterosexual military. Servicemembers United, a veterans group opposed to DADT, issued a report critical of the letter&#x27;s legitimacy. They said that among those signing the letter were officers who had no knowledge of their inclusion or who had refused to be included, and even one instance of a general&#x27;s widow who signed her husband&#x27;s name to the letter though he had died before the survey was published. The average age of the officers whose names were listed as signing the letter was 74, the oldest was 98, and Servicemembers United noted that &quot;only a small fraction of these officers have even served in the military during the &#x27;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&#x27; period, much less in the 21st century military.&quot;

The Center for American Progress issued a report in March 2010 that said a smooth implementation of an end to DADT required eight specified changes to the military&#x27;s internal regulations. On March 25, 2010, Defense Secretary Gates announced new rules mandating that only flag officers could initiate discharge proceedings and imposing more stringent rules of evidence on discharge proceedings.

==Repeal==
The underlying justifications for DADT had been subjected to increasing suspicion and outright rejection by the early 21st century. Mounting evidence obtained from the integration efforts of foreign militaries, surveys of U.S. military personnel, and studies conducted by the DoD gave credence to the view that the presence of open homosexuals within the military would not be detrimental at all to the armed forces. A DoD study conducted at the behest of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in 2010 supports this most.

The DoD working group conducting the study considered the impact that lifting the ban would have on unit cohesion and effectiveness, good order and discipline, and military morale. The study included a survey that revealed significant differences between respondents who believed they had served with homosexual troops and those who did not believe they had. In analyzing such data, the DoD working group concluded that it was actually generalized perceptions of homosexual troops that led to the perceived unrest that would occur without DADT. Ultimately, the study deemed the overall risk to military effectiveness of lifting the ban to be low. Citing the ability of the armed forces to adjust to the previous integration of African-Americans and women, the DoD study asserted that the United States military could adjust as had it before in history without an impending serious effect.

In March 2005, Rep. Martin T. Meehan introduced the Military Readiness Enhancement Act in the House. It aimed &quot;to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the readiness of the Armed Forces by replacing the current policy concerning homosexuality in the Armed Forces, referred to as &#x27;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell,&#x27; with a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation&quot;. As of 2006, it had 105 Democrats and 4 Republicans as co-sponsors. He introduced the bill again in 2007 and 2009.

During the 2008 U.S. presidential election campaign, Senator Barack Obama advocated a full repeal of the laws barring gays and lesbians from serving in the military. Nineteen days after his election, Obama&#x27;s advisers announced that plans to repeal the policy might be delayed until 2010, because Obama &quot;first wants to confer with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his new political appointees at the Pentagon to reach a consensus, and then present legislation to Congress&quot;. As president he advocated a policy change to allow gay personnel to serve openly in the armed forces, stating that the U.S. government has spent millions of dollars replacing troops expelled from the military, including language experts fluent in Arabic, because of DADT. On the eve of the National Equality March in Washington, D.C., October 10, 2009, Obama stated in a speech before the Human Rights Campaign that he would end the ban, but he offered no timetable. Obama said in his 2010 State of the Union Address: &quot;This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are.&quot; This statement was quickly followed up by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs chairman Michael Mullen voicing their support for a repeal of DADT.

===Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010===

Democrats in both houses of Congress first attempted to end DADT by amending the Defense Authorization Act. On May 27, 2010, on a 234–194 vote, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the Murphy amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. It provided for repeal of the DADT policy and created a process for lifting the policy, including a U.S. Department of Defense study and certification by key officials that the change in policy would not harm military readiness followed by a waiting period of 60 days. The amended defense bill passed the House on May 28, 2010. On September 21, 2010, John McCain led a successful filibuster against on the Defense Authorization Act, in which 56 Senators voted to end debate, four short of the 60 votes required. Some advocates for repeal, including the Palm Center, OutServe, and Knights Out, opposed any attempt to block the passage of NDAA if it failed to include DADT repeal language. The Human Rights Campaign, the Center for American Progress, Servicemembers United and SLDN refused to concede that possibility.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit, &quot;Collins v. United States&quot;, against the Department of Defense in November 2010 seeking full compensation for those discharged under the policy.

On November 30, 2010, the Joint Chiefs of Staff released the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; Comprehensive Review Working Group (CRWG) report authored by Jeh C. Johnson, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and Army General Carter F. Ham. It outlined a path to the implementation of repeal of DADT. The report indicated that there was a low risk of service disruptions due to repealing the ban, provided time was provided for proper implementation and training. It included the results of a survey of 115,000 active-duty and reserve service members. Across all service branches, 30 percent thought that integrating gays into the military would have negative consequences. In the Marine Corps and combat specialties, the percentage with that negative assessment ranged from 40 to 60 percent. The CRWG also said that 69 percent of all those surveyed believed they had already worked with a gay or lesbian and of those, 92 percent reported that the impact of that person&#x27;s presence was positive or neutral. The same day, in response to the CRWG, 30 professors and scholars, most from military institutions, issued a joint statement saying that the CRWG &quot;echoes more than 20 studies, including studies by military researchers, all of which reach the same conclusion: allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly will not harm the military ... We hope that our collective statement underscores that the debate about the evidence is now officially over&quot;. The Family Research Council&#x27;s president, Tony Perkins, interpreted the CRWG data differently, writing that it &quot;reveals that 40 percent of Marines and 25 percent of the Army could leave&quot;.

Gates encouraged Congress to act quickly to repeal the law so that the military could carefully adjust rather than face a court decision requiring it to lift the policy immediately. The United States Senate held two days of hearings on December 2 and 3, 2010, to consider the CRWG report. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs chairman Michael Mullen urged immediate repeal. The heads of the Marine Corps, Army, and Navy all advised against immediate repeal and expressed varied views on its eventual repeal. Oliver North, writing in &quot;National Review&quot; the next week, said that Gates&#x27; testimony showed &quot;a deeply misguided commitment to political correctness&quot;. He interpreted the CRWG&#x27;s data as indicating a high risk that large numbers of resignations would follow the repeal of DADT. Service members, especially combat troops, he wrote, &quot;deserve better than to be treated like lab rats in Mr. Obama&#x27;s radical social experiment&quot;.

On December 9, 2010, another filibuster prevented debate on the Defense Authorization Act. In response to that vote, Senators Joe Lieberman and Susan Collins introduced a bill that included the policy-related portions of the Defense Authorization Act that they considered more likely to pass as a stand-alone bill. It passed the House on a vote of 250 to 175 on December 15, 2010. On December 18, 2010, the Senate voted to end debate on its version of the bill by a cloture vote of 63–33. The final Senate vote was held later that same day, with the measure passing by a vote of 65–31.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates released a statement following the vote indicating that the planning for implementation of a policy repeal would begin right away and would continue until Gates certified that conditions were met for orderly repeal of the policy. President Obama signed the repeal into law on December 22, 2010.

===Implementation of repeal===
The repeal act established a process for ending the DADT policy. The President, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were required to certify in writing that they had reviewed the Pentagon&#x27;s report on the effects of DADT repeal, that the appropriate regulations had been reviewed and drafted, and that implementation of repeal regulations &quot;is consistent with the standards of military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention of the Armed Forces&quot;. Once certification was given, DADT would be lifted after a 60-day waiting period.

Representative Duncan D. Hunter announced plans in January 2011 to introduce a bill designed to delay the end of DADT. His proposed legislation required all of the chiefs of the armed services to submit the certification at the time required only of the President, Defense Secretary and Joint Chiefs chairman. In April, Perkins of the Family Research Council argued that the Pentagon was misrepresenting its own survey data and that hearings by the House Armed Services Committee, now under Republican control, could persuade Obama to withhold certification. Congressional efforts to prevent the change in policy from going into effect continued into May and June 2011.

On January 29, 2011, Pentagon officials stated that the training process to prepare troops for the end of DADT would begin in February and would proceed quickly, though they suggested that it might not be completed in 2011. On the same day, the DOD announced it would not offer any additional compensation to service members who had been discharged under DADT, who received half of the separation pay other honorably discharged service members received.

In May 2011, the U.S. Army reprimanded three colonels for performing a skit in March 2011 at a function at Yongsan Garrison, South Korea, that mocked the repeal.

In May 2011, revelations that an April Navy memo relating to its DADT training guidelines contemplated allowing same-sex weddings in base chapels and allowing chaplains to officiate if they so chose resulted in a letter of protest from 63 Republican congressman, citing the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as controlling the use of federal property. Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council said the guidelines &quot;make it even more uncomfortable for men and women of faith to perform their duties&quot;. A Pentagon spokesperson replied that DOMA &quot;does not limit the type of religious ceremonies a chaplain may perform in a chapel on a military installation&quot;, and a Navy spokesperson said that &quot;A chaplain can conduct a same-sex ceremony if it is in the tenets of his faith&quot;. A few days later the Navy rescinded its earlier instructions &quot;pending additional legal and policy review and interdepartmental coordination&quot;.

While waiting for certification, several service members were discharged at their own insistence until a July 6 ruling from a federal appeals court barred further enforcement of the U.S. military&#x27;s ban on openly gay service members, which the military promptly did.

Anticipating the lifting of DADT, some active duty service members wearing civilian clothes marched in San Diego&#x27;s gay pride parade on July 16. The DOD noted that participation &quot;does not constitute a declaration of sexual orientation&quot;.

President Obama, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sent the certification required by the Repeal Act to Congress on July 22, 2011, setting the end of DADT for September 20, 2011. A Pentagon spokesman said that service members discharged under DADT would be able to re-apply to rejoin the military then.

At the end of August 2011, the DOD approved the distribution of the magazine produced by OutServe, an organization of gay and lesbian service members, at Army and Air Force base exchanges beginning with the September 20 issue, coinciding with the end of DADT.

On September 20, Air Force officials announced that 22 Air Force Instructions were &quot;updated as a result of the repeal of DADT&quot;. On September 30, 2011, the Department of Defense modified regulations to reflect the repeal by deleting &quot;homosexual conduct&quot; as a ground for administrative separation.

===Day of repeal and aftermath===
On the eve of repeal, US Air Force 1st Lt. Josh Seefried, one of the founders of OutServe, an organization of LGBT troops, revealed his identity after two years of hiding behind a pseudonym. Senior Airman Randy Phillips, after conducting a social media campaign seeking encouragement coming out and already out to his military co-workers, came out to his father on the evening of September 19. When the video of their conversation he posted on YouTube went viral, it made him, in one journalist&#x27;s estimation, &quot;the poster boy for the DADT repeal&quot;. The moment the repeal took effect at midnight on September 19, US Navy Lt. Gary C. Ross married his same-sex partner of eleven and a half years, Dan Swezy, making them the first same-sex military couple to legally marry in the United States. Retired Rear Adm. Alan M. Steinman became the highest-ranking person to come out immediately following the end of DADT. HBO produced a World of Wonder documentary, &quot;The Strange History of Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot;, and premiered it on September 20. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an unapologetic piece of liberal advocacy&quot; and &quot;a testament to what formidable opponents ignorance and prejudice can be&quot;. Discharge proceedings on the grounds of homosexuality, some begun years earlier, came to an end.

In the weeks that followed, a series of firsts attracted press attention to the impact of the repeal. The Marine Corps were the first branch of the armed services to recruit from the LGBTQ community. Reservist Jeremy Johnson became the first person discharged under DADT to re-enlist. Jase Daniels became the first to return to active duty, re-joining the Navy as a third class petty officer. On December 2, Air Force intelligence officer Ginger Wallace became the first open LGBT service member to have a same-sex partner participate in the &quot;pinning-on&quot; ceremony that marked her promotion to colonel. On December 23, after 80 days at sea, US Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Marissa Gaeta won the right to the traditional &quot;first kiss&quot; upon returning to port and shared it with her same-sex partner. On January 20, 2012, U.S. service members deployed to Bagram, Afghanistan, produced a video in support of the It Gets Better Project, which aims to support LGBT at-risk youth. Widespread news coverage continued even months after the repeal date, when a photograph of Marine Sgt. Brandon Morgan kissing his partner at a February 22, 2012, homecoming celebration on Marine Corps Base Hawaii went viral. When asked for a comment, a spokesperson for the Marine Corps said: &quot;It&#x27;s your typical homecoming photo.&quot;

On September 30, 2011, Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley announced the DOD&#x27;s policy that military chaplains are allowed to perform same-sex marriages &quot;on or off a military installation&quot; where local law permits them. His memo noted that &quot;a chaplain is not required to participate in or officiate a private ceremony if doing so would be in variance with the tenets of his or her religion&quot; and &quot;a military chaplain&#x27;s participation in a private ceremony does not constitute an endorsement of the ceremony by DoD&quot;. Some religious groups announced that their chaplains would not participate in such weddings, including an organization of evangelical Protestants, the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty and Roman Catholics led by Archbishop Timothy Broglio of the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA.

In late October 2011, speaking at the Air Force Academy, Colonel Gary Packard, leader of the team that drafted the DOD&#x27;s repeal implementation plan, said: &quot;The best quote I&#x27;ve heard so far is, &#x27;Well, some people&#x27;s Facebook status changed, but that was about it. In late November, discussing the repeal of DADT and its implementation, Marine General James F. Amos said &quot;I&#x27;m very pleased with how it has gone&quot; and called it a &quot;non-event&quot;. He said his earlier public opposition was appropriate based on ongoing combat operations and the negative assessment of the policy given by 56% of combat troops under his command in the Department of Defense&#x27;s November 2010 survey. A Defense Department spokesperson said implementation of repeal occurred without incident and added: &quot;We attribute this success to our comprehensive pre-repeal training program, combined with the continued close monitoring and enforcement of standards by our military leaders at all levels.&quot;

In December 2011, Congress considered two DADT-related amendments in the course of work on the National Defense Authorization Act for 2012. The Senate approved 97–3, an amendment removing the prohibition on sodomy found in Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice as recommended by the Comprehensive Review Working Group (CRWG) a year earlier. The House approved an amendment banning same-sex marriages from being performed at military bases or by military employees, including chaplains and other employees of the military when &quot;acting in an official capacity&quot;. Neither amendment appeared in the final legislation.

In July 2012, the Department of Defense granted permission for military personnel to wear their uniforms while participating in the San Diego Pride Parade. This was the first time that U.S. military personnel were permitted to wear their service uniforms in such a parade.

Marking the first anniversary of the passage of the Repeal Act, television news networks reported no incidents in the three months since DADT ended. One aired video of a social gathering for gay service members at a base in Afghanistan. Another reported on the experience of lesbian and gay troops, including some rejection after coming out to colleagues.

The Palm Center, a think tank that studies issues of sexuality and the military, released a study in September 2012 that found no negative consequences, nor any effect on military effectiveness from DADT repeal. This study began six months following repeal and concluded at the one year mark. The study included surveys of 553 generals and admirals who had opposed repeal, experts who supported DADT, and more than 60 heterosexual, gay, lesbian and bisexual active duty service personnel.

On January 7, 2013, the ACLU reached a settlement with the federal government in &quot;Collins v. United States&quot;. It provided for the payment of full separation pay to service members discharged under DADT since November 10, 2004, who had previously been granted only half that.

==2012 presidential campaign issue==
Several candidates for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination called for the restoration of DADT, including Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry, and Rick Santorum. Newt Gingrich called for an extensive review of DADT&#x27;s repeal.

Ron Paul, having voted for the Repeal Act, maintained his support for allowing military service by open homosexuals. Herman Cain called the issue &quot;a distraction&quot; and opposed reinstating DADT. Mitt Romney said that the winding down of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan obviated his opposition to the repeal and said he was not proposing any change to policy.

On September 22, 2011, the audience at a Republican candidates&#x27; debate booed a U.S. soldier posted in Iraq who asked a question via video about the repeal of DADT, and none of the candidates acknowledged or responded to the crowd&#x27;s behavior. Two days later, Obama commented on the incident while addressing a dinner of the Human Rights Campaign: &quot;You want to be commander in chief? You can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States, even when it&#x27;s not politically convenient&quot;.

In June 2012, Rep. Howard McKeon, Republican chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said he considered the repeal of DADT a settled issue, and that if Romney became president he would not advocate its reinstatement, though others in his party might.

==2021 benefits restoration==

In September 2021, on the 10th anniversary of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell repeal, President Joe Biden announced that the Veterans Administration would start providing benefits for service members who received other-than-honorable discharges (before DADT was enacted and while it was in effect) because of their sexual orientation.

In 2024, more than 800 veterans who had been previously dishonorably discharged under DADT had their cases reviewed and discharge papers automatically updated to honorable discharge status. With this review, nearly all of the 13,500 people who were dishonorably discharged under DADT now have an honorable discharge and as a result, can access benefits for veterans.

==Views of the policy==
===Public opinion===
In 1993, &quot;Time&quot; reported that 44% of those polled supported openly gay service members, and in 1994, a CNN poll indicated 53% of Americans believed gays and lesbians should be permitted to serve openly.

According to a December 2010 &quot;Washington Post&quot;–ABC News poll, 77% of Americans said gays and lesbians who publicly disclose their sexual orientation should be able to serve in the military. That number showed little change from polls over the previous two years, but represented the highest level of support in a Post-ABC poll. The support also cut across partisan and ideological lines, with majorities of Democrats (86%), Republicans (74%), independents (74%), liberals (92%), conservatives (67%), white evangelical Protestants (70%) and non-religious (84%) in favor of homosexuals serving openly.

A November 2010 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 58% of the U.S. public favored allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, while less than half as many (27%) were opposed. According to a November 2010 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, 72% of adult Americans favored permitting people who are openly gay or lesbian to serve in the military, while 23% opposed it. &quot;The main difference between the CNN poll and the Pew poll is in the number of respondents who told pollsters that they didn&#x27;t have an opinion on this topic – 16 percent in the Pew poll compared to only five percent in the CNN survey&quot;, said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. &quot;The two polls report virtually the same number who say they oppose gays serving openly in the military, which suggests that there are some people who favor that change in policy but for some reason were reluctant to admit that to the Pew interviewers. That happens occasionally on topics where moral issues and equal-treatment issues intersect.&quot;

A February 2010 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute national poll showed 57% of American voters favored gays serving openly, compared to 36% opposed, while 66% said not allowing openly gay personnel to serve is discrimination, compared to 31% who did not see it as discrimination. A CBS News/&quot;New York Times&quot; national poll done at the same time showed 58% of Americans favored gays serving openly, compared to 28% opposed.

===Chaplains and religious groups===
Chaplain groups and religious organizations took various positions on DADT. Some felt that the policy needed to be withdrawn to make the military more inclusive. The Southern Baptist Convention battled the repeal of DADT, warning that their endorsements for chaplains might be withdrawn if the repeal took place. They took the position that allowing gay men and women to serve in the military without restriction would have a negative impact on the ability of chaplains who think homosexuality is a sin to speak freely regarding their religious beliefs. The Roman Catholic Church called for the retention of the policy, but had no plans to withdraw its priests from serving as military chaplains. Sixty-five retired chaplains signed a letter opposing repeal, stating that repeal would make it impossible for chaplains whose faith teaches that same-sex behavior is immoral to minister to military service members. Other religious organizations and agencies called the repeal of the policy a &quot;non-event&quot; or &quot;non-issue&quot; for chaplains, saying that chaplains have always supported military service personnel, whether or not they agree with all their actions or beliefs.

==Discharges under DADT==
After the policy was introduced in 1993, the military discharged over 13,000 troops from the military under DADT. The number of discharges per fiscal year under DADT dropped sharply after the September 11 attacks and remained comparatively low through to the repeal. Discharges exceeded 600 every year until 2009.


==State-based gay and lesbian military veteran laws==

In November 2019, both Rhode Island and New York State signed into law and implemented restoring military benefits to gay and lesbian military veterans. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 individuals were discharged between the beginning of World War II and the repeal of the Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell policy in September 2011.

<text>Divination () is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic ritual or practice. Using various methods throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a should proceed by reading signs, events, or omens, or through alleged contact or interaction with supernatural agencies such as spirits, gods, god-like-beings or the &quot;will of the universe&quot;.

Divination can be seen as an attempt to organize what appears to be random so that it provides insight into a problem or issue at hand. Some instruments or practices of divination include Tarot-card reading, rune casting, tea-leaf reading, automatic writing, water scrying, and psychedelics like psilocybin mushrooms and DMT. If a distinction is made between divination and fortune-telling, divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a religious context, as seen in traditional African medicine. Fortune-telling, on the other hand, is a more everyday practice for personal purposes. Particular divination methods vary by culture and religion.

In its functional relation to magic in general, divination can have a preliminary and investigative role:

[...] the diagnosis or prognosis achieved through divination is both temporarily and logically related to the manipulative, protective or alleviative function of magic rituals. In divination one finds the cause of an ailment or a potential danger, in magic one subsequently acts upon this knowledge.
Divination has long attracted criticism. In the modern era, it has been dismissed by the scientific community and by skeptics as being superstitious; experiments do not support the idea that divination techniques can actually predict the future more reliably or precisely than would be possible without it. In antiquity, divination came under attack from philosophers such as the Academic skeptic Cicero in &quot;De Divinatione&quot; (1st century BCE) and the Pyrrhonist Sextus Empiricus in &quot;Against the Astrologers&quot; (2nd century CE). The satirist Lucian ( 125 – after 180) devoted an essay to Alexander the false prophet.

==History==
===Antiquity===
The eternal fire at Nymphaion in southern Illyria (present-day Albania) also functioned as an oracle. The forms of divination practiced in this natural fire sanctuary with peculiar physical properties were widely known to the ancient Greek and Roman authors. The Oracle of Amun at the Siwa Oasis was made famous when Alexander the Great visited it after conquering Egypt from Persia in 332 BC.
 or can be interpreted as categorically forbidding divination. But some biblical practices, such as Urim and Thummim, casting lots and prayer, are considered to be divination. Trevan G. Hatch disputes these comparisons because divination did not consult the &quot;one true God&quot; and manipulated the divine for the diviner&#x27;s self-interest. One of the earliest known divination artifacts, a book called the Sortes Sanctorum, is believed to be of Christian roots, and utilizes dice to provide insight into the future.

Uri Gabbay states that divination was associated with sacrificial rituals in the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamia and Israel. Extispicy was a common example, where diviners would pray to their god(s) before vivisecting a sacrificial animal. Their abominal organs would reveal a divine message, which aligned with cardiocentric views of the mind.

====Oracles and Greek divination====

Both oracles and seers in ancient Greece practiced divination. Oracles were the conduits for the gods on earth; their prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim. Because of the high demand for oracle consultations and the oracles’ limited work schedule, they were not the main source of divination for the ancient Greeks. That role fell to the seers ().

Seers were not in direct contact with the gods; instead, they were interpreters of signs provided by the gods. Seers used many methods to explicate the will of the gods including extispicy, ornithomancy, etc. They were more numerous than the oracles and did not keep a limited schedule; thus, they were highly valued by all Greeks, not just those with the capacity to travel to Delphi or other such distant sites.

The disadvantage of seers was that only direct yes-or-no questions could be answered. Oracles could answer more generalized questions, and seers often had to perform several sacrifices in order to get the most consistent answer. For example, if a general wanted to know if the omens were proper for him to advance on the enemy, he would ask his seer both that question and if it were better for him to remain on the defensive. If the seer gave consistent answers, the advice was considered valid.

During battle, generals would frequently ask seers at both the campground (a process called the &quot;hiera&quot;) and at the battlefield (called the &quot;sphagia&quot;). The hiera entailed the seer slaughtering a sheep and examining its liver for answers regarding a more generic question; the sphagia involved killing a young female goat by slitting its throat and noting the animal&#x27;s last movements and blood flow. The battlefield sacrifice only occurred when two armies prepared for battle against each other. Neither force would advance until the seer revealed appropriate omens.

Because the seers had such power over influential individuals in ancient Greece, many were skeptical of the accuracy and honesty of the seers. The degree to which seers were honest depends entirely on the individual seers. Despite the doubt surrounding individual seers, the craft as a whole was well regarded and trusted by the Greeks, and the Stoics accounted for the validity of divination in their physics.

===Middle Ages and Early Modern period===

The divination method of casting lots (Cleromancy) was used by the remaining eleven disciples of Jesus in to select a replacement for Judas Iscariot. Therefore, divination was arguably an accepted practice in the early church. However, divination became viewed as a pagan practice by Christian emperors during ancient Rome.

In 692 the Quinisext Council, also known as the &quot;Council in Trullo&quot; in the Eastern Orthodox Church, passed canons to eliminate pagan and divination practices. Fortune-telling and other forms of divination were widespread through the Middle Ages. In the constitution of 1572 and public regulations of 1661 of the Electorate of Saxony, capital punishment was used on those predicting the future. Laws forbidding divination practice continue to this day. The Waldensians sect were accused of practicing divination.

Småland is famous for Årsgång, a practice which occurred until the early 19th century in some parts of Småland. Generally occurring on Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve, it is a practice in which one would fast and keep themselves away from light in a room until midnight to then complete a set of complex events to interpret symbols encountered throughout the journey to foresee the coming year.

In Islam, astrology (&quot;‘ilm ahkam al-nujum&quot;), the most widespread divinatory science, is the study of how celestial entities could be applied to the daily lives of people on earth. It is important to emphasize the practical nature of divinatory sciences because people from all socioeconomic levels and pedigrees sought the advice of astrologers to make important decisions in their lives. Astronomy was made a distinct science by intellectuals who did not agree with the former, although distinction may not have been made in daily practice, where astrology was technically outlawed and only tolerated if it was employed in public. Astrologers, trained as scientists and astronomers, were able to interpret the celestial forces that ruled the &quot;sub-lunar&quot; to predict a variety of information from lunar phases and drought to times of prayer and the foundation of cities. The courtly sanction and elite patronage of Muslim rulers benefited astrologers’ intellectual statures.

The “science of the sand” (&quot;‘ilm al-raml&quot;), otherwise translated as geomancy, is “based on the interpretation of figures traced on sand or other surface known as geomantic figures.” It is a good example of Islamic divination at a popular level. The core principle that meaning derives from a unique occupied position is identical to the core principle of astrology.

Like astronomy, geomancy used deduction and computation to uncover significant prophecies as opposed to omens (&quot;‘ilm al-fa’l&quot;), which were process of “reading” visible random events to decipher the invisible realities from which they originated. It was upheld by prophetic tradition and relied almost exclusively on text, specifically the Qur’an (which carried a table for guidance) and poetry, as a development of bibliomancy. The practice culminated in the appearance of the illustrated “Books of Omens” (&quot;Falnama&quot;) in the early 16th century, an embodiment of the apocalyptic fears as the end of the millennium in the Islamic calendar approached.

Dream interpretation, or oneiromancy &quot;(‘ilm ta’bir al-ru’ya&quot;), is more specific to Islam than other divinatory science, largely because of the Qur’an’s emphasis on the predictive dreams of Abraham, Yusuf, and Muhammad. The important delineation within the practice lies between “incoherent dreams” and “sound dreams,” which were “a part of prophecy” or heavenly message. Dream interpretation was always tied to Islamic religious texts, providing a moral compass to those seeking advice. The practitioner needed to be skilled enough to apply the individual dream to general precedent while appraising the singular circumstances.

The power of text held significant weight in the &quot;science of letters&quot; &quot;(‘ilm al-huruf&quot;), the foundational principle being &quot;God created the world through His speech.&quot; The science began with the concept of language, specifically Arabic, as the expression of &quot;the essence of what it signifies.&quot; Once the believer understood this, while remaining obedient to God’s will, they could uncover the essence and divine truth of the objects inscribed with Arabic like amulets and talismans through the study of the letters of the Qur’an with alphanumeric computations.

In Islamic practice in Senegal and Gambia, just like many other West African countries, diviners and religious leaders and healers were interchangeable because Islam was closely related with esoteric practices (like divination), which were responsible for the regional spread of Islam. As scholars learned esoteric sciences, they joined local non-Islamic aristocratic courts, who quickly aligned divination and amulets with the &quot;proof of the power of Islamic religion.&quot; So strong was the idea of esoteric knowledge in West African Islam, diviners and magicians uneducated in Islamic texts and Arabic bore the same titles as those who did.

From the beginning of Islam, there &quot;was (and is) still a vigorous debate about whether or not such [divinatory] practices were actually permissible under Islam,” with some scholars like Abu-Hamid al Ghazili (d. 1111) objecting to the science of divination because he believed it bore too much similarity to pagan practices of invoking spiritual entities that were not God. Other scholars justified esoteric sciences by comparing a practitioner to &quot;a physician trying to heal the sick with the help of the same natural principles.&quot;

===Mesoamerica===

Divination was a central component of ancient Mesoamerican religious life. Many Aztec gods, including central creator gods, were described as diviners and were closely associated with sorcery. Tezcatlipoca is the patron of sorcerers and practitioners of magic. His name means &quot;smoking mirror,&quot; a reference to a device used for divinatory scrying. In the Mayan &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, the creator gods Xmucane and Xpiacoc perform divinatory hand casting during the creation of people. The Aztec &quot;Codex Borbonicus&quot; shows the original human couple, Oxomoco and Cipactonal, engaged in divining with kernels of maize. This primordial pair is associated with the ritual calendar, and the Aztecs considered them to be the first diviners.

Every civilization that developed in pre-Columbian Mexico, from the Olmecs to the Aztecs, practiced divination in daily life, both public and private. Scrying through the use of reflective water surfaces, mirrors, or the casting of lots were among the most widespread forms of divinatory practice. Visions derived from hallucinogens were another important form of divination, and are still widely used among contemporary diviners of Mexico. Among the more common hallucinogenic plants used in divination are morning glory, jimson weed, and peyote.

==Contemporary divination in Asia==

===India and Nepal===
Theyyam or &quot;theiyam&quot; in Malayalam is the process by which a devotee invites a Hindu god or goddess to use his or her body as a medium or channel and answer other devotees&#x27; questions. The same is called &quot;arulvaakku&quot; or &quot;arulvaak&quot; in Tamil, another south Indian language - Adhiparasakthi Siddhar Peetam is famous for arulvakku in Tamil Nadu. The people in and around Mangalore in Karnataka call the same, Buta Kola, &quot;paathri&quot; or &quot;darshin&quot;; in other parts of Karnataka, it is known by various names such as, &quot;prashnaavali&quot;, &quot;vaagdaana&quot;, &quot;asei&quot;, &quot;aashirvachana&quot;, and so on. In Nepal it is known as, &quot;Devta ka dhaamee&quot; or &quot;jhaakri&quot;.

In English, the closest translation for these is, &quot;oracle.&quot; The Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as the &quot;Nechung Oracle&quot;, which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet. The Dalai Lama has according to centuries-old custom, consulted the Nechung Oracle during the new year festivities of Losar.

Although Japan retains a history of traditional and local methods of divination, such as &quot;onmyōdō&quot;, contemporary divination in Japan, called &quot;uranai&quot;, derives from outside sources. Contemporary methods of divination in Japan include both Western and Chinese astrology, geomancy or feng shui, tarot cards, I Ching (Book of Changes) divination, and physiognomy (methods of reading the body to identify traits).

In Japan, divination methods include Futomani from the Shinto tradition.

====Personality types====
Personality typing as a form of divination has been prevalent in Japan since the 1980s. Various methods exist for divining personality type. Each attempt to reveal glimpses of an individual&#x27;s destiny, productive and inhibiting traits, future parenting techniques, and compatibility in marriage. Personality type is increasingly important for young Japanese, who consider personality the driving factor of compatibility, given the ongoing marriage drought and birth rate decline in Japan.

An import to Japan, Chinese zodiac signs based on the birth year in 12 year cycles (rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, cock, dog, and boar) are frequently combined with other forms of divination, such as so-called &#x27;celestial types&#x27; based on the planets (Saturn, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, or Uranus). Personality can also be divined using cardinal directions, the four elements (water, earth, fire, air), and yin-yang. Names can also lend important personality information under name classification which asserts that names bearing certain Japanese vowel sounds (a, i, u, e, o) share common characteristics. Numerology, which utilizes methods of divining &#x27;birth numbers&#x27; from significant numbers such as birth date, may also reveal character traits of individuals.

Individuals can also assess their own and others&#x27; personalities according to physical characteristics. Blood type remains a popular form of divination from physiology. Stemming from Western influences, body reading or &quot;ninsou&quot;, determines personality traits based on body measurements. The face is the most commonly analyzed feature, with eye size, pupil shape, mouth shape, and eyebrow shape representing the most important traits. An upturned mouth may be cheerful, and a triangle eyebrow may indicate that someone is strong-willed.

Methods of assessment in daily life may include self-taken measurements or quizzes. As such, magazines targeted at women in their early-to-mid twenties feature the highest concentration of personality assessment guides. There are approximately 144 different women&#x27;s magazines, known as &quot;nihon zashi koukoku kyoukai&quot;, published in Japan aimed at this audience.

====Japanese tarot====
The adaptation of the Western divination method of tarot cards into Japanese culture presents a particularly unique example of contemporary divination as this adaptation mingles with Japan&#x27;s robust visual culture. Japanese tarot cards are created by professional artists, advertisers, and fans of tarot. One tarot card collector claimed to have accumulated more than 1,500 Japan-made decks of tarot cards.

Japanese tarot cards fall into diverse categories such as:

* Inspiration Tarot ();
* I-Ching Tarot ();
* Spiritual Tarot ();
* Western Tarot (); and
* Eastern Tarot ().

The images on tarot cards may come from images from Japanese popular culture, such as characters from manga and anime including Hello Kitty, or may feature cultural symbols. Tarot cards may adapt the images of Japanese historical figures, such as high priestess Himiko (170–248CE) or imperial court wizard Abe no Seimei (921–1005CE). Still others may feature images of cultural displacement, such as English knights, pentagrams, the Jewish Torah, or invented glyphs. The introduction of such cards began by the 1930s and reached prominence 1970s. Japanese tarot cards were originally created by men, often based on the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot published by the Rider Company in London in 1909. Since, the practice of Japanese tarot has become overwhelmingly feminine and intertwined with kawaii culture. Referring to the cuteness of tarot cards, Japanese model Kuromiya Niina was quoted as saying &quot;because the images are cute, even holding them is enjoyable.&quot; While these differences exist, Japanese tarot cards function similarly to their Western counterparts. Cards are shuffled and cut into piles then used to forecast the future, for spiritual reflection, or as a tool for self-understanding.

===Taiwan===
A common act of divination in Taiwan is called the Poe. “The Poe” translated to English means “moon boards”. It consists of two wood or bamboo blocks cut into the shape of a crescent moon. The one edge is rounded while the other is flat; the two are mirror images. Both crescents are held out in one&#x27;s palms and while kneeling, they are raised to the forehead level. Once in this position, the blocks are dropped and the future can be understood depending on their landing. If both fall flat side up or both fall rounded side up, that can be taken as a failure of the deity to agree. If the blocks land one rounded and one flat, the deity indicates &quot;Yes&quot;, or positive. “Laughing poe” is when rounded sides land down and they rock before coming to a standstill. “Negative poe” is when the flat sides fall downward and abruptly stop; this indicates &quot;No&quot;. When there is a positive fall, it is called “Sacred poe”, although the negative falls are not usually taken seriously. As the blocks are being dropped the question is said in a murmur, and if the answer is yes, the blocks are dropped again. To make sure the answer is definitely a yes, the blocks must fall in a “yes” position three times in a row.
A more serious type of divination is the Kiō-á. There is a small wooden chair, and around the sides of the chair are small pieces of wood that can move up and down in their sockets, this causes a clicking sounds when the chair is moved in any way. Two men hold this chair by its legs before an altar, while the incense is being burned, and the deity is invited to descend onto the chair. It is seen that it is in the chair by an onset of motion. Eventually, the chair crashes onto a table prepared with wood chips and burlap. The characters on the table are then traced and these are said to be written by the deity who possessed the chair, these characters are then interpreted for the devotees.

==Contemporary divination in Africa==

Divination is widespread throughout Africa. Among many examples it is one of the central tenets of Serer religion in Senegal. Only those who have been initiated as Saltigues (the Serer high priests and priestesses) can divine the future. These are the &quot;hereditary rain priests&quot; whose role is both religious and medicinal.

<doc id="8693" wikidata="Q5254561" url="?curid=8693" title="Diets of Nuremberg">
<text>The Diets of Nuremberg, also called the Imperial Diets of Nuremberg, took place at different times between the Middle Ages and the 17th century.

The first Diet of Nuremberg, in 1211, elected the future emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen as German king.

At the Diet of 1356 the Emperor Charles IV issued the Golden Bull of 1356, which required each Holy Roman Emperor to summon the first Imperial Diet after his election at Nuremberg. Apart from that, a number of other diets were held there.

Important to Protestantism were the Diets of 1522 (&quot;First Diet of Nuremberg&quot;), 1524 (&quot;Second Diet of Nuremberg&quot;) and 1532 (&quot;Third Diet of Nuremberg&quot;).

==The 1522 Diet of Nuremberg==
This Diet has become known mostly for the reaction of the papacy to the decision made on Luther at the Diet of Worms the previous year. The new pope, Adrian VI, sent his nuncio Francesco Chieregati to the Diet, to insist both that the Edict of Worms be executed and that action be taken promptly against Luther. This demand, however, was coupled with a promise of thorough reform in the Roman hierarchy, frankly admitting the partial guilt of the Vatican in the decline of the Church.

In the recess drafted on 9 February 1523, however, the German princes rejected this appeal. Using Adrian&#x27;s admissions, they declared that they could not have it appear &#x27;as though they wished to oppress evangelical truth and assist unchristian and evil abuses.&#x27;

==The 1524 Diet of Nuremberg==
This Diet generally took the same line as the previous one. The Estates reiterated their decision from the previous Diet. The Cardinal-legate, Campeggio, who was present, showed his disgust at the behaviour of the Estates. On 18 April, the Estates decided to call &#x27;a general gathering of the German nation&#x27;, to meet at Speyer the following year and to decide what would be done until the meeting of the general council of the Church which they demanded. This resulted in the Diet of Speyer (1526), which in turn was followed by the Diet of Speyer (1529). The latter included the Protestation at Speyer.

<text>Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (known simply and more commonly as Dr. Strangelove) is a 1964 political satire black comedy film co-written, produced, and directed by Stanley Kubrick. It is loosely based on the thriller novel &quot;Red Alert&quot; (1958) by Peter George, who wrote the screenplay with Kubrick and Terry Southern. It stars Peter Sellers in three roles. The film, financed and released by Columbia Pictures, was a co-production between the United States and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; parodies Cold War fears of a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union and stars George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens, and Tracy Reed. The story concerns an insane brigadier general of the United States Air Force who orders a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. It follows the President of the United States (Sellers), his scientific advisor Dr. Strangelove (Sellers), the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a Royal Air Force exchange officer (Sellers) as they attempt to stop the crew of a B-52 from bombing the Soviet Union and starting a nuclear war.

The film is considered one of the best comedy films and one of the greatest films of all time. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it 26th in its list of the best American films (in the 2007 edition, the film ranked 39th), and in 2000, it was listed as number three on its list of the funniest American films. In 1989, the United States Library of Congress included &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; as one of the first 25 films selected for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film received four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor for Sellers. The film was also nominated for seven BAFTA Film Awards, winning Best Film From Any Source, Best British Film, and Best Art Direction (Black and White), and it also won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

== Plot ==
United States Air Force Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper, the commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, orders his executive officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (an exchange officer from the Royal Air Force), to put the base on alert (condition red, the most intense lockdown status), confiscate all privately owned radios from base personnel and issue &quot;Wing Attack Plan R&quot; to the planes of the 843rd Bomb Wing. At the time of issuance of said order, the planes, flying B-52 bombers armed with thermonuclear bombs, are on airborne alert two hours from their targets inside the Soviet Union. 

The aircraft commence attack flights on the USSR and set their radios to allow communications only through their CRM 114 discriminators, which are designed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Happening upon a radio that had been missed earlier and hearing regular civilian broadcasting, Mandrake realizes that no attack order has been issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been fluoridating American water supplies to pollute the &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; of Americans. Mandrake realizes Ripper has gone completely mad.

In the War Room at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how &quot;Plan R&quot; enables a senior officer to launch a retaliatory nuclear attack on the Soviets if all of his superior officers have been killed in a first strike on the United States. Trying every CRM code combination to issue a recall order would require two days, so Muffley orders the U.S. Army to storm the base and arrest General Ripper. Turgidson, noting the slim odds of recalling the planes in time, then proposes that Muffley not only let the attack proceed but send reinforcements. Muffley rejects Turgidson&#x27;s recommendation and instead brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room to telephone Soviet Premier Dimitri Kissov. Muffley warns the premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the targets, flight plans, and defensive systems of the bombers so that the Soviets can protect themselves.

After a heated discussion with Kissov, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union created a doomsday machine as a nuclear deterrent; it consists of many buried cobalt bombs, which are set to detonate automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. The resulting nuclear fallout would render the Earth&#x27;s surface uninhabitable for 93 years. The device cannot be deactivated, as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. The president&#x27;s German scientific adviser, the paraplegic former Nazi Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday machine would only have been an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it; de Sadeski replies that Kissov had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week at the Party Congress.

When the U.S. Army troops gain control of Burpelson, General Ripper commits suicide. Mandrake deduces Ripper&#x27;s CRM code from doodles on his desk blotter and relays it to the Pentagon. Using the code, Strategic Air Command successfully recalls all of the bombers except for one, commanded by Major T. J. &quot;King&quot; Kong. Because its radio equipment was damaged by a Soviet SAM, it is unable to receive or send communications. To conserve fuel, Kong flies below radar and switches targets, thus preventing Soviet air radar from detecting and intercepting their plane. Because the Soviet missile also damaged the bomb bay doors, Kong enters the bay and repairs the electrical wiring. When he is successful, the bomb drops with him straddling it. Kong joyously hoots and waves his cowboy hat as he rides the falling bomb to his death.

In the War Room, Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep underground mines where the radiation will not penetrate. Worried that the Soviets will do the same, Turgidson warns about a &quot;mineshaft gap&quot; while de Sadeski secretly photographs the War Room. Dr. Strangelove prepares to announce his plan for that when he suddenly stands up out of his wheelchair and exclaims, &quot;Mein Führer, I can walk!&quot; The movie ends with a montage of explosions set to &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot; signifying the activation of the doomsday device.

=== Peter Sellers&#x27;s roles ===
Columbia Pictures agreed to finance the film if Peter Sellers played at least four major roles. The condition stemmed from the studio&#x27;s opinion that much of the success of Kubrick&#x27;s previous film &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962) was based on Sellers&#x27;s performance, in which his single character assumes several identities. Sellers also played three roles in &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot; (1959). Kubrick accepted the demand, later saying that &quot;such crass and grotesque stipulations are the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of the motion-picture business.&quot;

Sellers had been expected to play Air Force Major T. J. &quot;King&quot; Kong, the B-52 aircraft commander. Sellers was reluctant; he felt his workload was too heavy and worried he would not properly portray the character&#x27;s Texan accent. Kubrick pleaded with him, and he asked the screenwriter Terry Southern (who had been raised in Texas) to record a tape with Kong&#x27;s lines spoken in his accent, which he practiced using Southern&#x27;s tapes. After the start of shooting in the aircraft, Sellers sprained his ankle and could no longer work in the cramped aircraft mockup.

Sellers improvised much of his dialogue, with Kubrick incorporating the ad-libs into the written screenplay, a practice known as retroscripting. 

==== Group Captain Lionel Mandrake ====
According to film critic Alexander Walker, the author of biographies of both Sellers and Kubrick, the role of Group Captain Lionel Mandrake was the easiest of the three for Sellers to play, since he was aided by his experience of mimicking his superiors while serving in the RAF during World War II. There is also a heavy resemblance to Sellers&#x27;s friend and occasional co-star Terry-Thomas and the prosthetic-limbed RAF flying ace Sir Douglas Bader.

==== President Merkin Muffley ====
For his performance as President Merkin Muffley, Sellers assumed a Midwestern American English accent. Sellers drew inspiration for the role from Adlai Stevenson, a former Illinois governor who was the Democratic candidate for the 1952 and 1956 presidential elections and the U.N. ambassador during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

In early takes, Sellers simulated cold symptoms to emphasize the character&#x27;s apparent weakness. That caused frequent laughter among the film crew, ruining several takes. Kubrick ultimately found this comic portrayal inappropriate, feeling Muffley should be a serious character. In later takes, Sellers played the role straight, though the President&#x27;s cold is still evident in several scenes.

==== Dr. Strangelove ====
Dr. Strangelove is a scientist and former Nazi, suggesting Operation Paperclip, the US effort to recruit top German technical talent at the end of World War II. He serves as President Muffley&#x27;s scientific adviser in the War Room. When General Turgidson wonders aloud to Mr. Staines (Jack Creley), what kind of name &quot;Strangelove&quot; is, possibly a &quot;Kraut name&quot;, Staines responds that Strangelove&#x27;s original German surname was &quot;Merkwürdigliebe&quot; (&quot;strange love&quot; in German) and that &quot;he changed it when he became a citizen&quot;. Strangelove accidentally addresses the president as &quot;Mein Führer&quot; twice in the film. Dr. Strangelove did not appear in the book &quot;Red Alert&quot;.

The character is an amalgamation of RAND Corporation strategist Herman Kahn, rocket scientist Wernher von Braun (a central figure in Nazi Germany&#x27;s rocket development program recruited to the US after the war), and Edward Teller, the &quot;father of the hydrogen bomb&quot;. Rumors claimed the character was based on Henry Kissinger, but Kubrick and Sellers denied this; Sellers said: &quot;Strangelove was never modeled after Kissinger—that&#x27;s a popular misconception. It was always Wernher von Braun.&quot; Furthermore, Henry Kissinger points out in his memoirs that at the time of the writing of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, he was a little-known academic.

The wheelchair-using Strangelove furthers a Kubrick trope of the menacing, seated antagonist, first depicted in &quot;Lolita&quot; through the character Dr. Zaempf. Strangelove&#x27;s accent was influenced by that of Austrian-American photographer Weegee, who worked for Kubrick as a special photographic effects consultant. Strangelove&#x27;s appearance echoes the mad scientist archetype as seen in the character Rotwang in Fritz Lang&#x27;s film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). Sellers&#x27;s Strangelove takes from Rotwang the single black gloved hand (which, in Rotwang&#x27;s case, is mechanical because of a lab accident), the wild hair, and, most importantly, his ability to avoid being controlled by political power. According to Alexander Walker, Sellers improvised Dr. Strangelove&#x27;s lapse into the Nazi salute, borrowing one of Kubrick&#x27;s black leather gloves for the uncontrollable hand that makes the gesture. Dr. Strangelove apparently has alien hand syndrome. Kubrick wore the gloves on the set to avoid being burned when handling hot lights, and Sellers, recognizing the potential connection to Lang&#x27;s work, found them to be menacing.

=== Slim Pickens as Major T. J. &quot;King&quot; Kong ===

Slim Pickens, an established character actor and veteran of many Western films, was eventually chosen to replace Sellers as Major Kong after Sellers&#x27; injury. John Wayne was offered the role after Sellers was injured, but he never responded to Kubrick&#x27;s offer. Dan Blocker of the &quot;Bonanza&quot; western television series was also approached to play the part, but according to Southern, Blocker&#x27;s agent rejected the script as being &quot;too pinko&quot;. Kubrick then recruited Pickens, whom he knew from his brief involvement in a Marlon Brando western film project that was eventually filmed as &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot;.

His fellow actor James Earl Jones recalls, &quot;He was Major Kong on and off the set—he didn&#x27;t change a thing—his temperament, his language, his behavior.&quot; Pickens was not told that the movie was a black comedy, and he was only given the script for scenes he was in to get him to play it &quot;straight&quot;.

Kubrick&#x27;s biographer John Baxter explained, in the documentary &quot;Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove&quot;:
Pickens, who had previously played only supporting and character roles, said that his appearance as Maj. Kong greatly improved his career. He later commented, &quot;After &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, my salary jumped five times, and assistant directors started saying &#x27;Hey, Slim&#x27; instead of &#x27;Hey, you&#x27;.&quot;

=== George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson ===

George C. Scott played the role of General Buck Turgidson, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In this capacity General Turgidson was the nation&#x27;s highest-ranking military officer and the principal military adviser to the president and the National Security Council. He is seen during most of the movie advising President Muffley on the best steps to take in order to stop the fleet of B-52 Stratofortresses that was deployed by Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper to drop nuclear bombs on Soviet soil.

According to James Earl Jones, Kubrick tricked Scott into playing the role of Gen. Turgidson in a much more outlandish manner than Scott was comfortable doing. According to Jones, Kubrick talked Scott into doing absurd &quot;practice&quot; takes, which Kubrick told Scott would never be used, as a way to warm up for the &quot;real&quot; takes. According to Jones, Kubrick used these takes in the final film, rather than the more restrained ones, allegedly causing Scott to swear never to work with Kubrick again.

During the filming, Kubrick and Scott had different opinions regarding certain scenes, but Kubrick obtained Scott&#x27;s compliance largely by beating him at chess, which they played frequently on the set.

== Production ==

=== Novel and screenplay ===
Stanley Kubrick started with nothing but a vague idea to make a thriller about a nuclear accident that built on the widespread Cold War fear for survival. While doing research, Kubrick gradually became aware of the subtle and paradoxical &quot;balance of terror&quot; between nuclear powers. At Kubrick&#x27;s request, Alastair Buchan (the head of the Institute for Strategic Studies) recommended the thriller novel &quot;Red Alert&quot; by Peter George. Kubrick was impressed with the book, which had also been praised by game theorist and future Nobel Prize in Economics winner Thomas Schelling in an article written for the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; and reprinted in &quot;The Observer&quot;, and immediately bought the film rights. In 2006, Schelling wrote that conversations between Kubrick, Schelling, and George in late 1960 about a treatment of &quot;Red Alert&quot; updated with intercontinental missiles eventually led to the making of the film.

In collaboration with George, Kubrick started writing a screenplay based on the book. While writing the screenplay, they benefited from some brief consultations with Schelling and later, Herman Kahn. In following the tone of the book, Kubrick originally intended to film the story as a serious drama. However, he began to see comedy inherent in the idea of mutual assured destruction as he wrote the first draft. He later said:

The title of the film satirically references Carnegie&#x27;s How to Stop Worrying and Start Living. Among the other titles that Kubrick initially considered were &quot;Dr. Doomsday or: How to Start World War III Without Even Trying&quot;, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&#x27;s Secret Uses of Uranus&quot;, and &quot;Wonderful Bomb&quot;. After deciding to make the film a black comedy, Kubrick brought in Terry Southern as a co-writer in late 1962. The choice was influenced by reading Southern&#x27;s comic novel &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;, which Kubrick had received as a gift from Peter Sellers, and which itself became a Sellers film in 1969. Southern made important contributions to the film, but his role led to a rift between Kubrick and Peter George; after &quot;Life&quot; magazine published a photo-essay on Southern in August 1964 which implied that Southern had been the script&#x27;s principal author—a misperception neither Kubrick nor Southern did much to dispel— George wrote a letter to the magazine, published in its September 1964 issue, in which he pointed out that he had both written the film&#x27;s source novel and collaborated on various incarnations of the script over a period of ten months, whereas &quot;Southern was briefly employed ... to do some additional rewriting for Kubrick and myself and fittingly received a screenplay credit in behind Mr. Kubrick and myself.&quot;

=== Sets and filming ===

&quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; was filmed at Shepperton Studios, near London, as Sellers was in the middle of a divorce at the time and unable to leave England. The sets occupied three main sound stages: the Pentagon War Room, the B-52 Stratofortress bomber and the last one containing both the motel room and General Ripper&#x27;s office and outside corridor. The studio&#x27;s buildings were also used as the Air Force base exterior. The film&#x27;s set design was done by Ken Adam, the production designer of several &quot;James Bond&quot; films (at the time he had already worked on &quot;Dr. No&quot;). The black-and-white cinematography was by Gilbert Taylor, and the film was edited by Anthony Harvey and an uncredited Kubrick. The original musical score for the film was composed by Laurie Johnson, and the special effects were done by Wally Veevers. The opening theme is an instrumental version of &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot;. The theme of the chorus from the bomb run scene is a modification of &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;. Sellers and Kubrick got along well during the film&#x27;s production and shared a love of photography.

For the War Room, Ken Adam first designed a two-level set which Kubrick initially liked, only to decide later that it was not what he wanted. Adam next began work on the design that was used in the film, an expressionist set that was compared with &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; and Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot;. It was an enormous concrete room ( long and wide, with a -high ceiling) suggesting a bomb shelter, with a triangular shape (based on Kubrick&#x27;s idea that this particular shape would prove the most resistant against an explosion). One side of the room was covered with gigantic strategic maps reflecting in a shiny black floor inspired by dance scenes in Fred Astaire films. In the middle of the room there was a large circular table lit from above by a circle of lamps, suggesting a poker table. Kubrick insisted that the table would be covered with green baize (although this could not be seen in the black-and-white film) to reinforce the actors&#x27; impression that they are playing &#x27;a game of poker for the fate of the world.&#x27; Kubrick asked Adam to build the set ceiling in concrete to force the director of photography to use only the on-set lights from the circle of lamps. Moreover, each lamp in the circle of lights was carefully placed and tested until Kubrick was happy with the result.

Lacking cooperation from the Pentagon in the making of the film, the set designers reconstructed the aircraft cockpit to the best of their ability by comparing the cockpit of a B-29 Superfortress and a single photograph of the cockpit of a B-52 and relating this to the geometry of the B-52&#x27;s fuselage. The B-52 was state-of-the-art in the 1960s, and its cockpit was off-limits to the film crew. When some United States Air Force personnel were invited to view the reconstructed B-52 cockpit, they said that &quot;it was absolutely correct, even to the little black box which was the CRM.&quot; It was so accurate that Kubrick was concerned about whether Adam&#x27;s team had carried out all its research legally.

In several shots of the B-52 flying over the polar ice en route to Russia, the shadow of the actual camera plane, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, is visible on the icecap below. The B-52 was a scale model composited into the Arctic footage, which was sped up to create a sense of jet speed. Home movie footage included in &quot;Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove&quot; on the 2001 Special Edition DVD release of the film shows clips of the B-17 with a cursive &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; painted over the rear entry hatch on the right side of the fuselage.

In 1967, some of the flying footage from &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; was re-used in The Beatles&#x27; television film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. As told by editor Roy Benson in the BBC radio documentary &quot;Celluloid Beatles&quot;, the production team of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; lacked footage to cover the sequence for the song &quot;Flying&quot;. Benson had access to the aerial footage filmed for the B-52 sequences of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, which was stored at Shepperton Studios. The use of the footage prompted Kubrick to call Benson to complain.

=== &quot;Fail Safe&quot; ===
&quot;Red Alert&quot; author Peter George collaborated on the screenplay with Kubrick and satirist Terry Southern. &quot;Red Alert&quot; was more solemn than its film version, and it did not include the character Dr. Strangelove, though the main plot and technical elements were quite similar. A novelization of the actual film, rather than a reprint of the original novel, was published by Peter George, based on an early draft in which the narrative is bookended by the account of aliens, who, having arrived at a desolated Earth, try to piece together what has happened. It was reissued in October 2015 by Candy Jar Books, featuring never-before-published material on Strangelove&#x27;s early career.

During the filming of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, Stanley Kubrick learned that &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although &quot;Fail Safe&quot; was to be an ultrarealistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot resemblance would damage his film&#x27;s box office potential, especially if it were released first. Indeed, the novel &quot;Fail-Safe&quot; (on which the film is based) is so similar to &quot;Red Alert&quot; that Peter George sued on charges of plagiarism and settled out of court.
What worried Kubrick the most was that &quot;Fail Safe&quot; boasted the acclaimed director Sidney Lumet and the first-rate dramatic actors Henry Fonda as the American president and Walter Matthau as the adviser to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into &quot;Fail Safe&quot;″s production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary &quot;Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove&quot;: &quot;We started casting. Fonda was already set ... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter [Bernstein, the screenwriter] was set ... And suddenly, this lawsuit arrived, filed by Stanley Kubrick and Columbia Pictures.&quot;

Kubrick argued that &quot;Fail Safe&quot;″s own source novel &quot;Fail-Safe&quot; (1962) had been plagiarized from Peter George&#x27;s &quot;Red Alert&quot;, to which Kubrick owned creative rights. He pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between the characters Groeteschele and Strangelove. The plan worked, and the suit was settled out of court, with the agreement that Columbia Pictures, which had financed and was distributing &quot;Strangelove&quot;, also buy &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, which had been an independently financed production. Kubrick insisted that the studio release his movie first, and &quot;Fail Safe&quot; opened eight months after &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, to critical acclaim but mediocre ticket sales.

=== Ending ===
The end of the film shows Dr. Strangelove exclaiming, &quot;&quot;Mein Führer,&quot; I can walk!&quot; before cutting to footage of nuclear explosions, with Vera Lynn and her audience singing &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot;. This footage comes from nuclear tests such as shot &quot;Baker&quot; of Operation Crossroads at Bikini Atoll, the Trinity test, a test from Operation Sandstone and the hydrogen bomb tests from Operation Redwing and Operation Ivy. In some shots, old warships (such as the German heavy cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;), which were used as targets, are plainly visible. In others, the smoke trails of rockets used to create a calibration backdrop can be seen. &quot;Goon Show&quot; writer and friend of Sellers Spike Milligan was credited with suggesting Vera Lynn&#x27;s song for the ending.

=== Original ending ===

It was originally planned for the film to end with a scene that depicted everyone in the War Room involved in a pie fight. Accounts vary as to why the pie fight was cut. In a 1969 interview, Kubrick said, &quot;I decided it was farce and not consistent with the satiric tone of the rest of the film.&quot; Critic Alexander Walker observed that &quot;the cream pies were flying around so thickly that people lost definition, and you couldn&#x27;t really say whom you were looking at.&quot; Nile Southern, son of screenwriter Terry Southern, suggested the fight was intended to be less jovial: &quot;Since they were laughing, it was unusable, because instead of having that totally black, which would have been amazing, like, this blizzard, which in a sense is metaphorical for all of the missiles that are coming, as well, you just have these guys having a good old time. So, as Kubrick later said, &#x27;it was a disaster of Homeric proportions.

=== Effects of the Kennedy assassination on the film ===
A first test screening of the film was scheduled for November 22, 1963, the day of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The film was just weeks from its scheduled premiere, but because of the assassination, the release was delayed until late January 1964, as it was felt that the public was in no mood for such a film any sooner.

During post-production, one line by Slim Pickens, &quot;a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Dallas with all that stuff&quot;, was dubbed to change &quot;Dallas&quot; to &quot;Vegas&quot;, since Dallas was where Kennedy was killed. The original reference to Dallas survives in the English audio of the French-subtitled version of the film.

The assassination also serves as another possible reason that the pie-fight scene was cut. In the scene, after Muffley takes a pie in the face, General Turgidson exclaims: &quot;Gentlemen! Our gallant young president has been struck down in his prime!&quot; Editor Anthony Harvey stated that the scene &quot;would have stayed, except that Columbia Pictures were horrified, and thought it would offend the president&#x27;s family.&quot; Kubrick and others have said that the scene had already been cut before preview night because it was inconsistent with the rest of the film.

=== Re-release in 1994 ===
In 1994, the film was re-released. While the 1964 release used a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the new print was in the slightly squarer 1.66:1 (5:3) ratio that Kubrick had originally intended.

== Themes ==

=== Satirizing the Cold War ===
&quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; ridicules nuclear war planning. It mocks numerous contemporary Cold War attitudes such as the &quot;missile gap&quot; but it primarily directs its satire on the theory of mutually assured destruction (MAD), in which each side is supposed to be deterred from a nuclear war by the prospect of a universal cataclysm regardless of who &quot;won&quot;. Military strategist and former physicist Herman Kahn, in the book &quot;On Thermonuclear War&quot; (1960), used the theoretical example of a &quot;doomsday machine&quot; to illustrate the limitations of MAD, which was developed by John von Neumann.

The concept of such a machine is consistent with MAD doctrine when it is logically pursued to its conclusion. It thus worried Kahn that the military might like the idea of a doomsday machine and build one. Kahn, a leading critic of MAD and the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s doctrine of massive retaliation upon the slightest provocation by the USSR, considered MAD to be foolish bravado, and urged the United States to instead plan for proportionality, and thus even a limited nuclear war. With this reasoning, Kahn became one of the architects of the flexible response doctrine which, while superficially resembling MAD, allowed for the possibility of responding to a limited nuclear strike with a proportional, or calibrated, return of fire (see &quot;Conflict escalation&quot;).

Kahn educated Kubrick on the concept of the semi-realistic &quot;cobalt-thorium G&quot; doomsday machine, and then Kubrick used the concept for the film. Kahn in his writings and talks would often come across as cold and calculating, for example, with his use of the term &quot;megadeaths&quot; and in his willingness to estimate how many human lives the United States could lose and still rebuild economically. Kahn&#x27;s dispassionate attitude towards millions of deaths is reflected in Turgidson&#x27;s remark to the president about the outcome of a preemptive nuclear war: &quot;Mr. President, I&#x27;m not saying we wouldn&#x27;t get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops, uh, depending on the breaks.&quot; Turgidson has a binder that is labelled &quot;World Targets in Megadeaths&quot;, a term coined in 1953 by Kahn and popularized in his 1960 book &quot;On Thermonuclear War&quot;.

The fallout-shelter-network proposal mentioned in the film, with its inherently high radiation protection characteristics, has similarities and contrasts to that of the real Swiss civil defense network. Switzerland has an overcapacity of nuclear fallout shelters for the country&#x27;s population size, and by law, new homes must still be built with a fallout shelter. If the US did that, it would violate the spirit of MAD and, according to MAD adherents, allegedly destabilize the situation because the US could launch a first strike and its population would largely survive a retaliatory second strike (see MAD § Theory).

To rebut early 1960s novels and Hollywood films like &quot;Fail-Safe&quot; and &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, which raised questions about US control over nuclear weapons, the Air Force produced a documentary film, &quot;SAC Command Post&quot;, to demonstrate its responsiveness to presidential command and its tight control over nuclear weapons. However, later academic research into declassified documents showed that U.S. military commanders had been given presidentially authorized pre-delegation for the use of nuclear weapons during the early Cold War, showing that this aspect of the film&#x27;s plot was plausible.

The characters of Buck Turgidson and Jack D. Ripper both satirize the real-life Gen. Curtis LeMay of the Strategic Air Command.

=== Sexual themes ===
In the months following the film&#x27;s release, director Stanley Kubrick received a fan letter from Legrace G. Benson of the Department of History of Art at Cornell University interpreting the film as being sexually layered. The director wrote back to Benson and confirmed the interpretation, &quot;Seriously, you are the first one who seems to have noticed the sexual framework from intromission (the planes going in) to the last spasm (Kong&#x27;s ride down and detonation at target).&quot;

== Release ==

The film was a popular success, earning US$4,420,000 in rentals in North America during its initial theatrical release.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; is Kubrick&#x27;s highest-rated film on Rotten Tomatoes, holding a 98% approval rating based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The site&#x27;s summary states that &quot;Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s brilliant Cold War satire remains as funny and razor-sharp today as it was in 1964.&quot; The film also holds a score of 97 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 32 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The film is ranked number 7 in the All-Time High Scores chart of Metacritic&#x27;s Video/DVD section. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

&quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; is on Roger Ebert&#x27;s list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, and he described it as &quot;arguably the best political satire of the century&quot;. One of the most celebrated of all film comedies, in 1998, &quot;Time Out&quot; conducted a reader&#x27;s poll and &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; was voted the 47th greatest film of all time. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it at No. 14 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. in 2002, it was ranked as the 5th best film in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll of best films. John Patterson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;There had been nothing in comedy like &quot;Dr Strangelove&quot; ever before. All the gods before whom the America of the stolid, paranoid 50s had genuflected—the Bomb, the Pentagon, the National Security State, the President himself, Texan masculinity and the alleged Commie menace of water-fluoridation—went into the wood-chipper and never got the same respect ever again.&quot; It is also listed as number 26 on &quot;Empire&#x27;s 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;, and in 2010 it was listed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 best films since the publication&#x27;s inception in 1923. The Writers Guild of America ranked its screenplay the 12th best ever written.

In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted it the 24th greatest comedic film of all time. The film ranked 42nd in the BBC&#x27;s 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films. The film was selected as the 2nd best comedy of all time in a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017.

=== Studio response ===
Columbia Pictures&#x27; early reaction to &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; was anything but enthusiastic. In &quot;Notes From The War Room&quot;, in the summer 1994 issue of &quot;Grand Street&quot; magazine, co-screenwriter Terry Southern recalled that, as production neared the end, &quot;It was about this time that word began to reach us, reflecting concern as to the nature of the film in production. Was it anti-American? Or just anti-military? And the jackpot question: Was it, in fact, anti-American to whatever extent it was anti-military?&quot;

Southern recalled how Kubrick grew concerned about seeming apathy and distancing by studio heads Abe Schneider and Mo Rothman, and by Columbia&#x27;s characterization of the film as &quot;just a zany, novelty flick which did not reflect the views of the corporation in any way.&quot; Southern noted that Rothman was in &quot;prominent attendance&quot; at a ceremony in 1989 when the Library of Congress announced it as one of the first 25 films on the National Film Registry.

==Accolades==
The film ranked No. 32 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of the 50 Greatest Movies on TV (and Video).

American Film Institute included the film as #26 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies, #3 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs, #64 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (&quot;Gentlemen, you can&#x27;t fight in here! This is the War Room!&quot;) and #39 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).

== Canceled sequel ==
In 1995, Kubrick enlisted Terry Southern to script a sequel titled &quot;Son of Strangelove&quot;. Kubrick had Terry Gilliam in mind to direct. The script was never completed, but index cards laying out the story&#x27;s basic structure were found among Southern&#x27;s papers after he died in October 1995. It was set largely in underground bunkers, where Dr. Strangelove had taken refuge with a group of women.

In 2013, Gilliam commented, &quot;I was told after Kubrick died—by someone who had been dealing with him—that he had been interested in trying to do another &quot;Strangelove&quot; with me directing. I never knew about that until after he died but I would have loved to.&quot;

== Stage adaptation ==

On July 14, 2023, it was announced that a stage adaptation of the film would be produced, co-adapted by Armando Iannucci and Sean Foley and starring Steve Coogan. It premiered in London&#x27;s West End at the Noel Coward Theatre in October 2024. It is the first stage adaptation of Kubrick&#x27;s works.

<text>DNA ligase is a type of enzyme that facilitates the joining of DNA strands together by catalyzing the formation of a phosphodiester bond. It plays a role in repairing single-strand breaks in duplex DNA in living organisms, but some forms (such as DNA ligase IV) may specifically repair double-strand breaks (i.e. a break in both complementary strands of DNA). Single-strand breaks are repaired by DNA ligase using the complementary strand of the double helix as a template, with DNA ligase creating the final phosphodiester bond to fully repair the DNA.

DNA ligase is used in both DNA repair and DNA replication (see &quot;Mammalian ligases&quot;). In addition, DNA ligase has extensive use in molecular biology laboratories for recombinant DNA experiments (see &quot;Research applications&quot;). Purified DNA ligase is used in gene cloning to join DNA molecules together to form recombinant DNA.

== Enzymatic mechanism ==

The mechanism of DNA ligase is to form two covalent phosphodiester bonds between 3&#x27; hydroxyl ends of one nucleotide (&quot;acceptor&quot;), with the 5&#x27; phosphate end of another (&quot;donor&quot;). Two ATP molecules are consumed for each phosphodiester bond formed. AMP is required for the ligase reaction, which proceeds in four steps:

# Reorganization of activity site such as nicks in DNA segments or Okazaki fragments etc.
# Adenylylation (addition of AMP) of a lysine residue in the active center of the enzyme, pyrophosphate is released;
# Transfer of the AMP to the 5&#x27; phosphate of the so-called donor, formation of a pyrophosphate bond;
# Formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 5&#x27; phosphate of the donor and the 3&#x27; hydroxyl of the acceptor.

Ligase will also work with blunt ends, although higher enzyme concentrations and different reaction conditions are required.

== Types ==

=== &quot;E. coli&quot; ===
The &quot;E. coli&quot; DNA ligase is encoded by the &quot;lig&quot; gene. DNA ligase in &quot;E. coli&quot;, as well as most prokaryotes, uses energy gained by cleaving nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to create the phosphodiester bond. It does not ligate blunt-ended DNA except under conditions of molecular crowding with polyethylene glycol, and cannot join RNA to DNA efficiently.

The activity of E. coli DNA ligase can be enhanced by DNA polymerase at the right concentrations. Enhancement only works when the concentrations of the DNA polymerase 1 are much lower than the DNA fragments to be ligated. When the concentrations of Pol I DNA polymerases are higher, it has an adverse effect on E. coli DNA ligase

=== T4 ===
The DNA ligase from bacteriophage T4 (a bacteriophage that infects &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; bacteria). The T4 ligase is the most-commonly used in laboratory research. It can ligate either cohesive or blunt ends of DNA, oligonucleotides, as well as RNA and RNA-DNA hybrids, but not single-stranded nucleic acids. It can also ligate blunt-ended DNA with much greater efficiency than &quot;E. coli&quot; DNA ligase. Unlike &quot;E. coli&quot; DNA ligase, T4 DNA ligase cannot utilize NAD and it has an absolute requirement for ATP as a cofactor. Some engineering has been done to improve the &quot;in vitro&quot; activity of T4 DNA ligase; one successful approach, for example, tested T4 DNA ligase fused to several alternative DNA binding proteins and found that the constructs with either p50 or NF-kB as fusion partners were over 160% more active in blunt-end ligations for cloning purposes than wild type T4 DNA ligase. A typical reaction for inserting a fragment into a plasmid vector would use about 0.01 (sticky ends) to 1 (blunt ends) units of ligase. The optimal incubation temperature for T4 DNA ligase is 37 °C, a temperature at which T4 enzymes are most active. However, it is not uncommon to setup ligation reactions at 16 °C, a trade-off temperature at which the ligase is active as well as one that is suitable for base-pairing of sticky ends. 

Bacteriophage T4 ligase mutants have increased sensitivity to both UV irradiation and the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate indicating that DNA ligase is employed in the repair of the DNA damages caused by these agents.

=== Mammalian ===
In mammals, there are four specific types of ligase.
# DNA ligase 1: ligates the nascent DNA of the lagging strand after the Ribonuclease H has removed the RNA primer from the Okazaki fragments.
# DNA ligase 3: complexes with DNA repair protein XRCC1 to aid in sealing DNA during the process of nucleotide excision repair and recombinant fragments. Of the all known mammalian DNA ligases, only ligase 3 has been found to be present in mitochondria.
# DNA ligase 4: complexes with XRCC4. It catalyzes the final step in the non-homologous end joining DNA double-strand break repair pathway. It is also required for V(D)J recombination, the process that generates diversity in immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor loci during immune system development.
* DNA ligase 2: A purification artifact resulting from proteolytic degradation of DNA ligase 3. Initially, it has been recognized as another DNA ligase and it is the reason for the unusual nomenclature of DNA ligases.

DNA ligase from eukaryotes and some microbes uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) rather than NAD.

===Thermostable===
Derived from a thermophilic bacterium, the enzyme is stable and active at much higher temperatures than conventional DNA ligases. Its half-life is 48 hours at 65 °C and greater than 1 hour at 95 °C. Ampligase DNA Ligase has been shown to be active for at least 500 thermal cycles (94 °C/80 °C) or 16 hours of cycling.10 This exceptional thermostability permits extremely high hybridization stringency and ligation specificity.

==Measurement of activity==
There are at least three different units used to measure the activity of DNA ligase:
* Weiss unit - the amount of ligase that catalyzes the exchange of 1 nmole of 32P from inorganic pyrophosphate to ATP in 20 minutes at 37°C. This is the one most commonly used.
* Modrich-Lehman unit - this is rarely used, and one unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 100 nmoles of d(A-T)n to an exonuclease-III resistant form in 30 minutes under standard conditions.
* Many commercial suppliers of ligases use an arbitrary unit based on the ability of ligase to ligate cohesive ends. These units are often more subjective than quantitative and lack precision.

== Research applications ==

DNA ligases have become indispensable tools in modern molecular biology research for generating recombinant DNA sequences. For example, DNA ligases are used with restriction enzymes to insert DNA fragments, often genes, into plasmids.

Controlling the optimal temperature is a vital aspect of performing efficient recombination experiments involving the ligation of cohesive-ended fragments. Most experiments use T4 DNA Ligase (isolated from bacteriophage T4), which is most active at 37 °C. However, for optimal ligation efficiency with cohesive-ended fragments (&quot;sticky ends&quot;), the optimal enzyme temperature needs to be balanced with the melting temperature Tm of the sticky ends being ligated, the homologous pairing of the sticky ends will not be stable because the high temperature disrupts hydrogen bonding. A ligation reaction is most efficient when the sticky ends are already stably annealed, and disruption of the annealing ends would therefore result in low ligation efficiency. The shorter the overhang, the lower the Tm.

Since blunt-ended DNA fragments have no cohesive ends to anneal, the melting temperature is not a factor to consider within the normal temperature range of the ligation reaction. The limiting factor in blunt end ligation is not the activity of the ligase but rather the number of alignments between DNA fragment ends that occur. The most efficient ligation temperature for blunt-ended DNA would therefore be the temperature at which the greatest number of alignments can occur. The majority of blunt-ended ligations are carried out at 14-25 °C overnight. The absence of stably annealed ends also means that the ligation efficiency is lowered, requiring a higher ligase concentration to be used.

A novel use of DNA ligase can be seen in the field of nano chemistry, specifically in DNA origami.  DNA based self-assembly principles have proven useful for organizing nanoscale objects, such as biomolecules, nanomachines, nanoelectronic and photonic component. Assembly of such nano structure requires the creation of an intricate mesh of DNA molecules. Although DNA self-assembly is possible without any outside help using different substrates such as provision of catatonic surface of Aluminium foil, DNA ligase can provide the enzymatic assistance that is required to make DNA lattice structure from DNA over hangs.

== History ==
The first DNA ligase was purified and characterized in 1967 by the Gellert, Lehman, Richardson, and Hurwitz laboratories. It was first purified and characterized by Weiss and Richardson using a six-step chromatographic-fractionation process beginning with elimination of cell debris and addition of streptomycin, followed by several Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose column washes and a final phosphocellulose fractionation. The final extract contained 10% of the activity initially recorded in the &quot;E. coli &quot;media; along the process it was discovered that ATP and Mg++ were necessary to optimize the reaction. The common commercially available DNA ligases were originally discovered in bacteriophage T4, &quot;E. coli&quot; and other bacteria.

== Disorders ==
Genetic deficiencies in human DNA ligases have been associated with clinical syndromes marked by immunodeficiency, radiation sensitivity, and developmental abnormalities,  LIG4 syndrome (Ligase IV syndrome) is a rare disease associated with mutations in DNA ligase 4 and interferes with dsDNA break-repair mechanisms. Ligase IV syndrome causes immunodeficiency in individuals and is commonly associated with microcephaly and marrow hypoplasia. A list of prevalent diseases caused by lack of or malfunctioning of DNA ligase is as follows.

=== Xeroderma pigmentosum ===

Xeroderma pigmentosum, which is commonly known as XP, is an inherited condition characterized by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight. This condition mostly affects the eyes and areas of skin exposed to the sun. Some affected individuals also have problems involving the nervous system.

=== Ataxia-telangiectasia ===

Mutations in the ATM gene cause ataxia–telangiectasia. The ATM gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control cell division and is involved in DNA repair. This protein plays an important role in the normal development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous system and immune system. The ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands and coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell&#x27;s genetic information. Affected children typically develop difficulty walking, problems with balance and hand coordination, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The movement problems typically cause people to require wheelchair assistance by adolescence. People with this disorder also have slurred speech and trouble moving their eyes to look side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia).

=== Fanconi Anemia ===

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare, inherited blood disorder that leads to bone marrow failure. FA prevents bone marrow from making enough new blood cells for the body to work normally. FA also can cause the bone marrow to make many faulty blood cells. This can lead to serious health problems, such as leukemia.

=== Bloom syndrome ===

Bloom syndrome results in skin that is sensitive to sun exposure, and usually the development of a butterfly-shaped patch of reddened skin across the nose and cheeks. A skin rash can also appear on other areas that are typically exposed to the sun, such as the back of the hands and the forearms. Small clusters of enlarged blood vessels (telangiectases) often appear in the rash; telangiectases can also occur in the eyes. Other skin features include patches of skin that are lighter or darker than the surrounding areas (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation respectively). These patches appear on areas of the skin that are not exposed to the sun, and their development is not related to the rashes.

== As a drug target ==
In recent studies, human DNA ligase I was used in Computer-aided drug design to identify DNA ligase inhibitors as possible therapeutic agents to treat cancer. Since excessive cell growth is a hallmark of cancer development, targeted chemotherapy that disrupts the functioning of DNA ligase can impede adjuvant cancer forms. Furthermore, it has been shown that DNA ligases can be broadly divided into two categories, namely, ATP- and NAD+-dependent. Previous research has shown that although NAD+-dependent DNA ligases have been discovered in sporadic cellular or viral niches outside the bacterial domain of life, there is no instance in which a NAD+-dependent ligase is present in a eukaryotic organism. The presence solely in non-eukaryotic organisms, unique substrate specificity, and distinctive domain structure of NAD+ dependent compared with ATP-dependent human DNA ligases together make NAD+-dependent ligases ideal targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs.

<text>The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) (Dewey pronounced: /do-e/), colloquially known as the Dewey Decimal System, is a proprietary library classification system which allows new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on subject. 
It was first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876. Originally described in a 44-page pamphlet, it has been expanded to multiple volumes and revised through 23 major editions, the latest printed in 2011. It is also available in an abridged version suitable for smaller libraries. OCLC, a non-profit cooperative that serves libraries, currently maintains the system and licenses online access to WebDewey, a continuously updated version for catalogers.

The decimal number classification introduced the concepts of &quot;relative location&quot; and &quot;relative index&quot;. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification&#x27;s notation makes use of three-digit numbers for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Numbers are flexible to the degree that they can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, on the basis of its subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.

==History==
===1873–1885: early development===

Melvil Dewey (1851–1931) was an American librarian and self-declared reformer. He was a founding member of the American Library Association and can be credited with the promotion of card systems in libraries and business. He developed the ideas for his library classification system in 1873 while working at the Amherst College library. He applied the classification to the books in that library, until in 1876 he had a first version of the classification. In 1876, he published the classification in pamphlet form with the title &quot;A Classification and Subject Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library.&quot;
He used the pamphlet, published in more than one version during the year, to solicit comments from other librarians. It is not known who received copies or how many commented as only one copy with comments has survived, that of Ernest Cushing Richardson. His classification system was mentioned in an article in the first issue of the &quot;Library Journal&quot; and in an article by Dewey in the Department of Education publication &quot;Public Libraries in America&quot; in 1876. In March 1876, he applied for, and received, copyright on the first edition of the index. The edition was 44 pages in length, with 2,000 index entries, and was printed in 200 copies.

===1885–1942: period of adoption===

The second edition of the Dewey Decimal system, published in 1885 with the title &quot;&quot;, comprised 314 pages, with 10,000 index entries. Five hundred copies were produced. Editions 3–14, published between 1888 and 1942, used a variant of this same title. Dewey modified and expanded his system considerably for the second edition. In an introduction to that edition Dewey states that &quot;nearly 100 persons hav [spelling of &#x27;have&#x27; per English-language spelling reform, which Dewey championed] contributed criticisms and suggestions&quot;.

One of the innovations of the Dewey Decimal system was that of positioning books on the shelves in relation to other books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book&#x27;s height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.

New editions were readied as supplies of previously published editions were exhausted, even though some editions provided little change from the previous, as they were primarily needed to fulfill demand. In the next decade, three editions followed closely on: the 3rd (1888), 4th (1891), and 5th (1894). Editions 6 through 11 were published from 1899 to 1922. The 6th edition was published in a record 7,600 copies, although subsequent editions were much lower. During this time, the size of the volume grew, and edition 12 swelled to 1,243 pages, an increase of 25% over the previous edition.

In response to the needs of smaller libraries which were finding the expanded classification schedules difficult to use, in 1894, the first abridged edition of the Dewey Decimal system was produced. The abridged edition generally parallels the full edition, and has been developed for most full editions since that date. By popular request, in 1930, the Library of Congress began to print Dewey Classification numbers on nearly all of its cards, thus making the system immediately available to all libraries making use of the Library of Congress card sets.

Dewey&#x27;s was not the only library classification available, although it was the most complete. Charles Ammi Cutter published the Expansive Classification in 1882, with initial encouragement from Melvil Dewey. Cutter&#x27;s system was not adopted by many libraries, with one major exception: it was used as the basis for the Library of Congress Classification system.

In 1895, the International Institute of Bibliography, located in Belgium and led by Paul Otlet, contacted Dewey about the possibility of translating the classification into French, and using the classification system for bibliographies (as opposed to its use for books in libraries). This would have required some changes to the classification, which was under copyright. Dewey gave permission for the creation of a version intended for bibliographies, and also for its translation into French. Dewey did not agree, however, to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification, considering that a violation of their agreement, as well as a violation of Dewey&#x27;s copyright. Shortly after Dewey&#x27;s death in 1931, however, an agreement was reached between the committee overseeing the development of the Decimal Classification and the developers of the French &quot;Classification Decimal&quot;. The English version was published as the Universal Decimal Classification and is still in use today.

According to a study done in 1927, the Dewey system was used in the US in approximately 96% of responding public libraries and 89% of the college libraries. After the death of Melvil Dewey in 1931, administration of the classification was under the Decimal Classification Committee of the Lake Placid Club Education Foundation, and the editorial body was the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee with participation of the American Library Association (ALA), Library of Congress, and Forest Press. By the 14th edition in 1942, the Dewey Decimal Classification index was over 1,900 pages in length and was published in two volumes.

===1942–present: forging an identity===

The growth of the classification to date had led to significant criticism from medium and large libraries which were too large to use the abridged edition but found the full classification overwhelming. Dewey had intended issuing the classification in three editions: the library edition, which would be the fullest edition; the bibliographic edition, in English and French, which was to be used for the organization of bibliographies rather than of books on the shelf; and the abridged edition. In 1933, the bibliographic edition became the Universal Decimal Classification, which left the library and abridged versions as the formal Dewey Decimal Classification editions. The 15th edition, edited by Milton Ferguson, implemented the growing concept of the &quot;standard edition&quot;, designed for the majority of general libraries but not attempting to satisfy the needs of the very largest or of special libraries. It also reduced the size of the Dewey system by over half, from 1,900 to 700 pages. This revision was so radical that an advisory committee was formed right away for the 16th and 17th editions. The 16th and 17th editions, under the editorship of the Library of Congress, grew again to two volumes. However, by then, the Dewey Decimal system had established itself as a classification for general libraries, with the Library of Congress Classification having gained acceptance for large research libraries.

The first electronic version of &quot;Dewey&quot; was created in 1993. Hard-copy editions continue to be issued at intervals; the online WebDewey and Abridged WebDewey are updated quarterly.

== Administration and publication ==

Dewey and a small editorial staff managed the administration of the very early editions. Beginning in 1922, the Lake Placid Club Educational Foundation, a not-for-profit organization founded by Melvil Dewey, managed administrative affairs. The ALA set up a Special Advisory Committee on the Decimal Classification as part of the Cataloging and Classification division of ALA in 1952. The previous Decimal Classification Committee was changed to the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee, with participation of the ALA Division of Cataloging and Classification, and of the Library of Congress.

Melvil Dewey edited the first three editions of the classification system and oversaw the revisions of all editions until his death in 1931. May Seymour became editor in 1891 and served until her death in 1921. She was followed by Dorcas Fellows, who was editor until her death in 1938. Constantin J. Mazney edited the 14th edition. Milton Ferguson functioned as editor from 1949 to 1951. The 16th edition in 1958 was edited under an agreement between the Library of Congress and Forest Press, with David Haykin as director. Editions 16–19 were edited by Benjamin A. Custer and the editor of edition 20 was John P. Comaromi. Joan Mitchell was editor until 2013, covering editions 21 to 23. In 2013 Michael Panzer of OCLC became Editor-in-Chief. The Dewey Editorial Program Manager since 2016 has been Rebecca Green.

Dewey himself held copyright in editions 1 to 6 (1876–1919). Copyright in editions 7–10 was held by the publisher, The Library Bureau. On the death of May Seymour, Dewey conveyed the &quot;copyrights and control of all editions&quot; to the Lake Placid Club Educational Foundation, a non-profit chartered in 1922. The Online Computer Library Center of Dublin, Ohio, U.S., acquired the trademark and copyrights associated with the Dewey Decimal Classification system when it bought Forest Press in 1988. In 2003 the Dewey Decimal Classification came to the attention of the U.S. press when OCLC sued the Library Hotel for trademark infringement for using the classification system as the hotel theme. The case was settled shortly thereafter.

The OCLC has maintained the classification since 1988, and also publishes new editions of the system. The editorial staff responsible for updates is based partly at the Library of Congress and partly at OCLC. Their work is reviewed by the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee, a ten-member international board which meets twice each year. The four-volume unabridged edition was published approximately every six years, with the last edition (DDC 23) published in mid-2011. In 2017 the editorial staff announced that the English edition of DDC will no longer be printed, in favor of using the frequently updated WebDewey. An experimental version of Dewey in RDF was available at dewey.info beginning in 2009, but has not been available since 2015.

In addition to the full version, a single-volume abridged edition designed for libraries with 20,000 titles or fewer has been made available since 1895. The last printed English abridged edition, Abridged Edition 15, was published in early 2012.

==Design==
The Dewey Decimal Classification organizes library materials by discipline or field of study. The scheme comprises ten classes, each divided into ten divisions, each having ten sections. The system&#x27;s notation uses Indo-Arabic numbers, with three whole numbers making up the main classes and sub-classes and decimals designating further divisions. The classification structure is hierarchical and the notation follows the same hierarchy. Libraries not needing the full level of detail of the classification can trim right-most decimal digits from the class number to obtain more general classifications. For example:

:500 Natural sciences and mathematics
:: 510 Mathematics
::: 516 Geometry
:::: 516.3 Analytic geometries
::::: 516.37 Metric differential geometries
:::::: 516.375 Finsler geometry

The classification was originally enumerative, meaning that it listed all of the classes explicitly in the schedules. Over time it added some aspects of a faceted classification scheme, allowing classifiers to construct a number by combining a class number for a topic with an entry from a separate table. Tables cover commonly used elements such as geographical and temporal aspects, language, and bibliographic forms. For example, a class number could be constructed using 330 for economics + .9 for geographic treatment + .04 for Europe to create the class 330.94 European economy. Or one could combine the class 973 (for the United States) + .05 (for periodical publications on the topic) to arrive at the number 973.05 for periodicals concerning the United States generally. The classification also makes use of mnemonics in some areas, such that the number 5 represents the country Italy in classification numbers like 945 (history of Italy), 450 (Italian language), and 195 (Italian philosophy). The combination of faceting and mnemonics makes the classification &quot;synthetic&quot; in nature, with meaning built into parts of the classification number.

The Dewey Decimal Classification has a number for all subjects, including fiction, although many libraries maintain a separate fiction section shelved by alphabetical order of the author&#x27;s surname. Each assigned number consists of two parts: a class number (from the Dewey system) and a book number, which &quot;prevents confusion of different books on the same subject&quot;. A common form of the book number is called a Cutter number, which represents the author.

===Relative Index===

The Relative Index (or, as Dewey spelled it, &quot;Relativ Index&quot;) is an alphabetical index to the classification, for use both by classifiers and by library users when seeking books by topic. The index was &quot;relative&quot; because the index entries pointed to the class numbers, not to the page numbers of the printed classification schedule. In this way, the Dewey Decimal Classification itself had the same relative positioning as the library shelf and could be used either as an entry point to the classification, by catalogers, or as an index to a Dewey-classed library itself.

== Influence and criticism ==
Dewey Decimal Classification numbers formed the basis of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), which combines the basic Dewey numbers with selected punctuation marks (comma, colon, parentheses, etc.). Adaptations of the system for specific regions outside the English-speaking world include the Korean Decimal Classification, the New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries, and the Nippon Decimal Classification in Japan.

Despite its widespread use, the classification has been criticized for its complexity and its limited capability for amendment. This is particularly demonstrated with the literature section (800s): literature in European languages takes the entire range from 810 through 889, while the entire rest of the world&#x27;s literature is relegated to the 890s. In 2007–08, the Maricopa County Library District in Arizona abandoned the DDC in favor of the Book Industry Standards and Communications (BISAC) system commonly used by commercial bookstores, in an effort to make its libraries more accessible for their users. Several other libraries across the United States and other countries (including Canada and the Netherlands) followed suit. 

=== Treatment of homosexuality ===
In 1932, topics relating to homosexuality were first added to the system under 132 (mental derangements) and 159.9 (abnormal psychology). In 1952, homosexuality was also included under 301.424 (the study of sexes in society). In 1989, it was added to 363.49 (social problems), a classification that continues in the current edition.

In 1996, homosexuality was added to 306.7 (sexual relations); this remains the preferred location in the current edition. Although books can also be found under 616.8583 (sexual practices viewed as medical disorders), the official direction states:
=== Treatment of religion ===
The top-level class for religion heavily favors Christianity, dedicating nearly all of the 200 division to it: the world&#x27;s thousands of other religions were listed under the 290s. For example, Islam is under just DDC 297. The entire 200 section has remained largely unchanged since DDC 1, since restructuring would pose a significant amount of work for existing libraries. The motivation for this change is ideological rather than technical, as appending significant figures can add space as needed.

=== Treatment of women ===
It has also been argued by Hope A. Olson that the placement of topics related to women shows implicit bias, but this has been simpler to address than the religion schema. Some changes made so far have been in numerical proximity, altering the placement of topics relative to each other. For example, in older versions of the DDC, some categories regarding women were adjacent to categories on etiquette; the placement of these categories next to each other imposed an association of etiquette with women, rather than treating it as gender-neutral. This was changed in DDC version 17, in 1965.

<doc id="8702" wikidata="Q726297" url="?curid=8702" title="Duḥkha">
<text>Duḥkha (; , ) &quot;suffering&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;unease&quot;, or &quot;unsatisfactoriness&quot;, is an important concept in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism. Its meaning depends on the context, and may refer more specifically to the &quot;unsatisfactoriness&quot; or &quot;unease&quot; of craving for and grasping after transient &#x27;things&#x27; (sense objects, including thoughts), expecting pleasure from them while ignorant of this transientness. In Buddhism, dukkha is part of the first of the Four Noble Truths and one of the three marks of existence. The term also appears in scriptures of Hinduism, such as the Upanishads, in discussions of moksha (spiritual liberation).

While the term &quot;dukkha&quot; has often been derived from the prefix &quot;du-&quot; (&quot;bad&quot; or &quot;difficult&quot;) and the root &quot;kha&quot; (&quot;empty,&quot; &quot;hole&quot;), meaning a badly fitting axle-hole of a cart or chariot giving &quot;a very bumpy ride,&quot; it may actually be derived from &quot;duḥ-stha&quot;, a &quot;dis-/ bad- + stand-&quot;, that is, &quot;standing badly, unsteady,&quot; &quot;unstable.&quot;

==Etymology and meaning==
&quot;Duḥkha&quot; (Sanskrit: दुःख; Pali: &quot;dukkha&quot;) is a term found in the Upanishads and Buddhist texts, meaning anything that is &quot;uneasy, uncomfortable, unpleasant, difficult, causing pain or sadness&quot;. It is also a concept in Indian religions about the nature of transient phenomena which are innately &quot;unpleasant&quot;, &quot;suffering&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;sorrow&quot;, &quot;distress&quot;, &quot;grief&quot; or &quot;misery.&quot; The term &quot;duḥkha&quot; does not have a one-word English translation, and embodies diverse aspects of unpleasant human experiences. It is often understood as the opposite of &quot;sukha&quot;, meaning lasting &quot;happiness,&quot; &quot;comfort&quot; or &quot;ease.&quot;

===Etymology===

====Axle hole====
The word has been explained in recent times as a derivation from Aryan terminology for an axle hole, referring to an axle hole which is not in the center and leads to a bumpy, uncomfortable ride. According to Winthrop Sargeant,
Joseph Goldstein, American vipassana teacher and writer, explains the etymology as follows:
====&#x27;Standing unstable&#x27;====
However, according to Monier Monier-Williams, the actual roots of the Pali term appear to be Sanskrit (&quot;dus-&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;) + (&quot;sthā&quot;, &quot;to stand&quot;). Regular phonological changes in the development of Sanskrit into the various Prakrits led to a shift from &quot;dus-sthā&quot; to &quot;duḥkha&quot; to &quot;dukkha&quot;.

Analayo concurs, stating that &quot;dukkha&quot; as derived from &quot;duḥ-sthā&quot;, &quot;standing badly,&quot; &quot;conveys nuances of &quot;uneasiness&quot; or of being &quot;uncomfortable.&quot; Silk Road philologist Christopher I. Beckwith elaborates on this derivation. According to Beckwith:
===Translation===
The literal meaning of &quot;duḥkha&quot;, as used in a general sense is &quot;suffering&quot; or &quot;painful.&quot; Its exact translation depends on the context. Contemporary translators of Buddhist texts use a variety of English words to convey the aspects of &quot;dukh&quot;. Early Western translators of Buddhist texts (before the 1970s) typically translated the Pali term &quot;dukkha&quot; as &quot;suffering.&quot; Later translators have emphasized that &quot;suffering&quot; is a too limited translation for the term duḥkha, and have preferred to either leave the term untranslated, or to clarify that translation with terms such as anxiety, distress, frustration, unease, unsatisfactoriness, not having what one wants, having what one doesn&#x27;t want, etc. In the sequence &quot;birth is painful,&quot; &quot;dukhka&quot; may be translated as &quot;painful.&quot; When related to vedana, &quot;feeling,&quot; &quot;dukkha&quot; (&quot;unpleasant,&quot; &quot;painful&quot;) is the opposite of &quot;sukkha&quot; (&quot;pleasure,&quot; &quot;pleasant&quot;), yet all feelings are &quot;dukkha&quot; in that they are impermanent, conditioned phenomena, which are unsatisfactory, incapable of providing lasting satisfaction. The term &quot;unsatisfactoriness&quot; then is often used to emphasize the unsatisfactoriness of &quot;life under the influence of afflictions and polluted karma.&quot;

==Buddhism==
===Early Buddhism===
&quot;Duḥkha&quot; is one of the three marks of existence, namely &quot;anitya&quot; (&quot;impermanent&quot;), &quot;duḥkha&quot; (&quot;unsatisfactory&quot;), &quot;anatman&quot; (without a lasting essence).

Various sutras sum up how cognitive processes result in an aversion to unpleasant things and experiences (&quot;duḥkha&quot;), forming a corrupted process together with the complementary process of clinging to and craving for pleasure (&quot;suhkha&quot;). This is expressed as &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, an ongoing process of death and rebirth, but also more pointly and non-metaphysically in the process-formula of the five skandhas:
# Birth is duḥkha, maturation is duḥkha, aging is duḥkha, illness is duḥkha, death is duḥkha;
# Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are duḥkha;
# Association with the unbeloved is duḥkha; separation from the loved is duḥkha;
# Not getting what is wanted is duḥkha.
# In conclusion, the five clinging-aggregates (skandhas) are duḥkha.

Early emphasis is on the importance of developing insight into the nature of &quot;duḥkha&quot;, the corrupted process of clinging and craving which starts with sense-contact, as described in the skandhas, and how this corruption can be overcome, namely by training the mind culminating in the process of the dhyanas. This is summarized in the teachings on the Four Noble Truths and other formulaic expressions of the Buddhist way to awakening.

Within the Buddhist sutras, duḥkha has a broad meaning, and has also been specified in three categories:
* &quot;Dukkha-dukkha&quot;, aversion to physical suffering this includes the physical and mental sufferings of birth, aging, illness, dying; distress due to what is not desirable.
* &quot;Viparinama-dukkha&quot;, the frustration of disappearing happiness this is the duḥkha of pleasant or happy experiences changing to unpleasant when the causes and conditions that produced the pleasant experiences cease.
* &quot;Sankhara-dukkha&quot;, the unsatisfactoriness of changing and impermanent &quot;things&quot; the incapability of conditioned things to give us lasting happiness. This includes &quot;a basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all existence, all forms of life, because all forms of life are changing, impermanent and without any inner core or substance.&quot; On this level, the term indicates a lack of lasting satisfaction, or a sense that things never measure up to our expectations or standards.

===Chinese Buddhism===
Chinese Buddhist tradition has been influenced by Taoism and Confucian theory that advocates that duhkha (古:十Ten directions, 口 hole or opening) is associated to the theory of seven emotions of endogenous disease through the formation of the spirit of the po a term that relates to the Western psychological notion of ego or the theological reference to the human soul. This theory is expounded in the application of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment and prevention of pain and suffering from illness, disease and ignorance. 

===Literal suffering and awakening===
Awakening, that is, awakening to one&#x27;s true mind of emptiness and compassion, does not necessarily end physical suffering. In the Buddhist tradition, suffering after awakening is often explained as the working-out or untangling of karma of one&#x27;s previous present life.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, &quot;duḥkha&quot; encompasses many meanings such as the phenomenological senses of pain and grief, a deep-seated dissatisfaction with the limitations of worldly existence, and the devastation of impermanence.

In Hindu scriptures, the earliest Upaniads — the  and the  — in all likelihood predate the advent of Buddhism. In these scriptures of Hinduism, the Sanskrit word &quot;dukha&quot; (दुःख) appears in the sense of &quot;suffering, sorrow, distress&quot;, and in the context of a spiritual pursuit and liberation through the knowledge of Atman (&#x27;essence&#x27;).

The concept of sorrow and suffering, and self-knowledge as a means to overcome it, appears extensively with other terms in the pre-Buddhist Upanishads. The term &quot;Duhkha&quot; also appears in many other middle and later post-Buddhist Upanishads such as the verse 6.20 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, as well as in the Bhagavad Gita, all in the contexts of moksha and bhakti.

The term also appears in the foundational Sutras of the six schools of Hindu philosophy, such as the opening lines of &quot;Samkhya karika&quot; of the Samkhya school. The Samkhya school identifies three types of suffering. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali state that &quot;for one who has discrimination, everything is suffering&quot; (&quot;duḥkham eva sarvaṁ vivekinaḥ&quot;).

Some of the Hindu scripture verses referring to &quot;duhkha&quot; are:

<doc id="8703" wikidata="Q369961" url="?curid=8703" title="Darwin Awards">
<text>The Darwin Awards are a rhetorical tongue-in-cheek honor that originated in Usenet newsgroup discussions around 1985. They recognize individuals who have supposedly contributed to human evolution by selecting themselves out of the gene pool by dying or becoming sterilized by their own actions.

The project became more formalized with the creation of a website in 1993, followed by a series of books starting in 2000 by Wendy Northcutt. The criterion for the awards states: &quot;In the spirit of Charles Darwin, the Darwin Awards commemorate individuals who protect our gene pool by making the ultimate sacrifice of their own lives. Darwin Award winners eliminate themselves in an extraordinarily idiotic manner, thereby improving our species&#x27; chances of long-term survival.&quot;

Accidental self-sterilization also qualifies, but the site notes: &quot;Of necessity, the award is usually bestowed posthumously.&quot; The candidate is disqualified, though, if &quot;innocent bystanders&quot; are killed in the process, as they might have contributed positively to the gene pool. The logical problem presented by award winners who may have already reproduced is not addressed in the selection process owing to the difficulty of ascertaining whether or not a person has children; the Darwin Award rules state that the presence of offspring does not disqualify a nominee.

==History==

The origin of the Darwin Awards can be traced back to posts on Usenet group discussions as early as 1985. A post on August 7, 1985, describes the awards as being &quot;given posthumously to people who have made the supreme sacrifice to keep their genes out of our pool. Style counts, not everyone who dies from their own stupidity can win.&quot; This early post cites an example of a person who tried to break into a vending machine and was crushed to death when he pulled it over himself. Another widely distributed early story mentioning the Darwin Awards is the JATO Rocket Car, which describes a man who strapped a jet-assisted take-off unit to his Chevrolet Impala in the Arizona desert and who died on the side of a cliff as his car achieved speeds of . This story was later determined to be an urban legend by the Arizona Department of Public Safety. Wendy Northcutt says the official Darwin Awards website run by Northcutt does its best to confirm all stories submitted, listing them as, &quot;confirmed true by Darwin&quot;. Many of the viral emails circulating the Internet, however, are hoaxes and urban legends.

The website and collection of books were started in 1993 by Wendy Northcutt, who at the time was a graduate in molecular biology from the University of California, Berkeley. She went on to study neurobiology at Stanford University, doing research on cancer and telomerase. In her spare time, she organised chain letters from family members into the original Darwin Awards website hosted in her personal account space at Stanford. She eventually left the bench in 1998 and devoted herself full-time to her website and books in September 1999. By 2002, the website received 7 million page hits per month.

Northcutt encountered some difficulty in publishing the first book, since most publishers would only offer her a deal if she agreed to remove the stories from the Internet, but she refused: &quot;It was a community! I could not do that. Even though it might have cost me a lot of money, I kept saying no.&quot; She eventually found a publisher who agreed to print a book containing only 10% of the material gathered for the website. The first book turned out to be a success, and was listed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list for 6 months.

Not all of the feedback from the stories Northcutt published was positive, and she occasionally received email from people who knew the deceased. One such person advised: &quot;This is horrible. It has shocked our community to the core. You should remove this.&quot; Northcutt demurred: &quot;I can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just too stupid.&quot; Northcutt kept the stories on the website and in her books, citing them as a &quot;funny-but-true safety guide&quot;, and mentioning that children who read the book are going to be much more careful around explosives.

The website also awards Honorable Mentions to individuals who survive their misadventures with their reproductive capacity intact. One example of this is Larry Walters, who attached helium-filled weather balloons to a lawn chair and floated far above Long Beach, California, in July 1982. He reached an altitude of , but survived, to be later fined for crossing controlled airspace. (Walters later fell into depression and died by suicide.) Another notable honorable mention was given to the two men who attempted to burgle the home of footballer Duncan Ferguson (who had an infamous reputation for physical aggression on and off the pitch, including four convictions for assault and who had served six months in Glasgow&#x27;s Barlinnie Prison) in 2001, with one burglar requiring three days&#x27; hospitalisation after being confronted by the player.
A 2014 study published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; found that between 1995 and 2014, males represented 88.7% of Darwin Award winners (see figure).

The comedy film &quot;The Darwin Awards&quot; (2006), written and directed by Finn Taylor, was based on the website and many of the Darwin Awards stories.

==Rules==
Northcutt has stated five requirements for a Darwin Award: Two of them are that the event must be verified to have happened, and that the nominee themselves were responsible for the activity. The others are:

=== Nominee must be dead or rendered sterile ===

This may be subject to dispute. Potential awardees may be out of the gene pool because of age; others have already reproduced before their deaths. To avoid debates about the possibility of &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization, artificial insemination, or cloning, the original Darwin Awards book applied the following &quot;deserted island&quot; test to potential winners: If the person were unable to reproduce when stranded on a deserted island with a fertile member of the opposite sex, he or she would be considered sterile. Winners of the award, in general, either are dead or have become unable to use their sexual organs.

=== Astoundingly stupid judgment ===

The candidate&#x27;s foolishness must be unique and sensational, likely because the award is intended to be funny. A number of foolish but common activities, such as smoking in bed, are excluded from consideration. In contrast, self-immolation caused by smoking after being administered a flammable ointment in a hospital and specifically told not to smoke is grounds for nomination. One &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; (a man who attempted suicide by swallowing nitroglycerin pills, and then tried to detonate them by running into a wall) is noted to be in this category, despite being intentional and self-inflicted (i.e. attempted suicide), which would normally disqualify the inductee.

=== Capable of sound judgment ===
In 2011, however, the awards targeted a 16-year-old boy in Leeds who died stealing copper wiring (he was underage at the time of his death; the standard minimum driving age in Great Britain being 17). In 2012, Northcutt made similar light of a 14-year-old girl in Brazil who was killed while leaning out of a school bus window, but she was &quot;disqualified&quot; for the award itself because of the likely public objection owing to the girl&#x27;s age, which Northcutt asserts is based on &quot;magical thinking&quot;.

Under this rule, and for reasons of good taste, individuals whose misfortune was caused by mental impairment or disability are not eligible for a Darwin Award, primarily to avoid mocking or making light of the disabled, and to ensure that the awards do not celebrate or trivialize tragedies involving vulnerable individuals.

== Reception ==
The Darwin Awards have received varying levels of scrutiny from the scientific community. In his book &quot;Encyclopedia of Evolution&quot;, biology professor Stanley A. Rice comments: &quot;Despite the tremendous value of these stories as entertainment, it is unlikely that they represent evolution in action&quot;, citing the nonexistence of &quot;judgment impairment genes&quot;. On an essay in the book &quot;The Evolution of Evil&quot;, professor Nathan Hallanger acknowledges that the Darwin Awards are meant as black humor, but associates them with the eugenics movement of the early 20th century. University of Oxford biophysicist Sylvia McLain, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, says that while the Darwin Awards are &quot;clearly meant to be funny&quot;, they do not accurately represent how genetics work, further noting that &quot;&#x27;smart&#x27; people do stupid things all the time&quot;. Geologist and science communicator Sharon A. Hill has criticized the Darwin Awards on both scientific and ethical grounds, claiming that no genetic traits impact personal intelligence or good judgment to be targeted by natural selection, and calling them an example of &quot;ignorance&quot; and &quot;heartlessness&quot;. However, studies have found hundreds of genes that influence intelligence and the majority of twin studies have found that the heritability of IQ due to genetic variation is greater than 57% and potentially up to 80%. A large study found direct links between genetics and risky behavior.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to dance:

Dance – human movement either used as a form of expression or presented in a social, spiritual or performance setting. Choreography is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on social, cultural, aesthetic, artistic and moral constraints and range from functional movement (such as Folk dance) to codified, virtuoso techniques such as ballet. A great many dances and dance styles are performed to dance music.

==What type of thing is dance?==
Dance (also called &quot;dancing&quot;) can fit the following categories:

* an activity or behavior
** one of the arts – a creative endeavor or discipline.
*** one of the performing arts.
** Hobby – regular activity or interest that is undertaken for pleasure, typically done during one&#x27;s leisure time.
** Exercise – bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.
**Sport—bodily activity that displays physical exertion
**Recreation – leisure time activity
**Ritual

Some other things can be named &quot;dance&quot; metaphorically; see dance (disambiguation)

== Types of dance ==

Type of dance – a particular dance or dance style. There are many varieties of dance. Dance categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, tango is traditionally a &quot;partner dance&quot;. While it is mostly &quot;social dance&quot;, its ballroom form may be &quot;competitive dance&quot;, as in DanceSport. At the same time it is enjoyed as &quot;performance dance&quot;, whereby it may well be a &quot;solo dance&quot;.

<text>DKW (Dampfkraftwagen, – the same initials later also used for &quot;Des Knaben Wunsch&quot;, ; &quot;Das Kleine Wunder&quot;, and &quot;Deutsche Kinderwagen&quot;, ) was a German car- and motorcycle-marque. DKW was one of the four companies that formed Auto Union in 1932 and thus became an ancestor of the modern-day Audi company.

In 1916, Danish engineer Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen founded a factory in Zschopau, Saxony, Germany, to produce steam fittings. That year he attempted to produce a steam-driven car, which he called the DKW. That steam car was unsuccessful, and in 1919 he made toy two-stroke engines under the name &quot;Des Knaben Wunsch&quot; – &quot;the boy&#x27;s wish&quot;. He put a slightly modified version of the toy engine into a motorcycle and called it &quot;Das Kleine Wunder&quot; – &quot;the little wonder&quot;, and by the late 1920s DKW had become the world&#x27;s largest motorcycle manufacturer.

In September 1924, DKW bought , saving them from Germany&#x27;s hyperinflation. Rudolf Slaby became chief engineer at DKW.
In 1932, DKW merged with Audi, Horch and Wanderer to form Auto Union. After World War II, DKW moved to West Germany. The original factory became MZ. Auto Union came under Daimler-Benz ownership in 1957 and was purchased by the Volkswagen Group in 1964. The last German-built DKW car was the F102, which ceased production in 1966. Its successor, the four-stroke F103, was marketed under the Audi brand, another Auto Union marque.

DKW-badged cars continued to be built under license in Brazil and Argentina until 1967 and 1969 respectively. The DKW trademark is currently owned by Auto Union GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Audi AG which also owns the rights to other historical trademarks and intellectual property of the Auto Union combine.

==Automobiles made between 1928 and 1942==

DKW cars were made from 1928 until 1966, apart from the interruption caused by the Second World War. DKWs always used two-stroke engines, reflecting the company&#x27;s position by the end of the 1920s as the world&#x27;s largest producer of motorcycles. The first DKW car, the small and rather crude Typ P, emerged on 7 May 1928 and the model continued to be built at the company&#x27;s Spandau (Berlin) plant, first as a roadster and later as a stylish if basic sports car, until 1931.

More significant was a series of inexpensive cars built 300 km (185 miles) to the south in Zwickau in the plant acquired by the company&#x27;s owner Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen in 1928 when he had become the majority owner in Audi Werke AG. Models F1 to F8 (F for Front) were built between 1931 and 1942, with successor models reappearing after the end of the war in 1945. They were the first volume production cars in Europe with front wheel drive, and were powered by transversely mounted two-cylinder two-stroke engines. Displacement was 584 or 692 cc: claimed maximum power was initially 15 PS, and from 1931 a choice between 18 or . These models had a generator that doubled as a starter, mounted directly on the crankshaft, known as a Dynastart. DKW in Zwickau produced approximately 218,000 units between 1931 and 1942. Most of those cars were sold on the home market and over 85% of DKWs produced in the 1930s were the little F series cars: DKW reached second place in German sales by 1934 and stayed there, accounting for 189,369 of the cars sold between 1931 and 1938, more than 16% of the market.

Between 1929 and 1940, DKW produced a less well remembered but technically intriguing series of rear-wheel drive cars called (among other names) &quot;Schwebeklasse&quot; and &quot;Sonderklasse&quot; with two-stroke V4 engines. Engine displacement was 1,000 cc, later 1,100 cc. The engines had two extra cylinders that acted as air compressors for forced induction, so they had the external appearance of a V6 engine but without spark plugs on the front cylinder pair.

In 1939, DKW made a prototype with the first three-cylinder engine, with a displacement of 900 cc and producing . With a streamlined body, the car could run at . It was put into production after World War II, first as an Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau (IFA) F9 (later Wartburg) in Zwickau, East Germany, and shortly afterwards in DKW-form from Düsseldorf as the 3=6 or F91.

Saab used DKW engines as a model for the Saab two-stroke in their first production car, the Saab 92.

==Automobiles made after 1945==
As Auto Union was based in Saxony in what became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), it took some time for it to regroup after the war. The company was registered in West Germany as Auto Union GmbH in 1949, first as a spare-part provider, but soon to take up production of the RT 125 motorcycle and a new delivery van, called a &quot;Schnellaster&quot; F800. Their first line of production took place in Düsseldorf. This van used the same engine as the last F8 made before the war.

Their first car was the F89 using the body from the prototype F9 made before the war and the two-cylinder two-stroke engine from the last F8. Production went on until it was replaced by the successful three-cylinder engine that came with the F91. The F91 was in production 1953–1955, and was replaced by the larger F93 in 1956. The F91 and F93 had 900 cc three-cylinder two-stroke engines, the first ones delivering , the last . The ignition system comprised three independent sets of points and coils, one for each cylinder, with the points mounted in a cluster around a single cam at the front end of the crankshaft. The cooling system was of the free convection type assisted by a fan driven from a pulley mounted at the front end of the crankshaft.

The F93 was produced until 1959, and was replaced by the Auto-Union 1000. These models were produced with a 1,000 cc two-stroke engine, with a choice between or S versions until 1963. During this transition, production was moved from Düsseldorf to Ingolstadt, where Audi still has its production. From 1957, the cars could be fitted with a saxomat, an automatic clutch, the only small car then offering this feature. The last versions of the Auto-Union 1000S had disc brakes as option, an early development for this technology. A sporting 2+2 seater version was available as the Auto-Union 1000 SP from 1957 to 1964, the first years only as a coupé and from 1962 also as a convertible.

In 1956, the very rare DKW Monza was put into small-scale production on a private initiative, with a sporting two-seater body of glassfiber on a standard F93 frame. It was first called Solitude, but got its final name from the long-distance speed records it made on the Autodromo Nazionale Monza in Italy in December 1956. Running in Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) class G, it set records including 48 hours at an average speed of , 10,000 km at and 72 hours at . The car was first produced by in Stuttgart, then by Massholder in Heidelberg and lastly by Robert Schenk in Stuttgart. The number produced is said to be around 75, 50 survived. Production finished by the end of 1958.
A more successful range of cars was sold from 1959, the Junior/F12 series based on a modern concept from the late 1950s. The range consists of Junior (basic model) made from 1959 to 1961, Junior de Luxe (a little enhanced) from 1961 to 1963, F11 (a little larger) and F12 (larger and bigger engine) from 1963 to 1965, and F12 Roadster from 1964 to 1965. The Junior/F12 series became quite popular, and many cars were produced. An assembly plant was licensed in Ballincollig, County Cork, Ireland between 1952 and c.1964 and roughly 4,000 vehicles were assembled, ranging from saloons, vans and motorbikes to commercial combine harvesters. This was the only DKW factory outside Germany in Europe and for many years after its closure its large DKW sign could be visible on the wall of the factory. The building was demolished in the late 2000s and was redeveloped into a German Aldi store and a McDonald&#x27;s drive-thru.

All the three-cylinder two-stroke post-war cars had some sporting potential and formed the basis for many rally victories in the 1950s and early 1960s. This made DKW the most winning car brand in the European rally league for several years during the fifties.

In 1960, DKW developed a V6 engine by combining two three-cylinder two-stroke engines, with a capacity of 1,000 cc. The capacity was increased and the final V6 in 1966 had a capacity of 1,300 cc, which developed at 5,000 rpm using the standard configuration with two carburettors. A four-carburettor version produced , a six-carburettor one . It weighed only . The V6 was planned to be used in the DKW Munga and the F102. About 100 engines were built for testing purposes and 13 DKW F102 and some Mungas were fitted with the V6 engine in the 1960s.

The last DKW was the F102, coming into production in 1964 as a replacement for the old-looking AU1000. However, the F102 sold poorly, largely due to its two-stroke engine technology which was at the limit of its development. Auto Union&#x27;s parent, Daimler-Benz, decided to offload the company to Volkswagen. The car was re-engineered with a four-stroke engine and relaunched as the Audi F103. This marked the end of the DKW marque for cars, and the rebirth of the Audi name.

From 1956 to 1961, Dutch importer Hart, Nibbrig &amp; Greve assembled cars in an abandoned asphalt factory in Sassenheim, where they employed about 120 workers, two transporter, that collected SKD kits from Duesseldorf and built about 13.500 cars. When the DKW plant moved the import of SKD kits stopped, as it became too expensive.

==DKW in South America==
From 1956 to 1967, DKW cars were made in Brazil by the local company Vemag (&quot;Veículos e Máquinas Agrícolas S.A.&quot;, &quot;Vehicles and Agricultural Machinery Inc.&quot;). Vemag was assembling Scania-Vabis trucks, but Scania Vabis became an independent company in July 1960. The original plans were to build the Candango off-roader (Munga), a utility vehicle and a four-door sedan, called Vemaguet and Belcar respectively. The first model built was the 900 cc F91 Universal but the Belcar and Vemaguet names were applied later.
In 1958, the F94 four-door sedan and station wagon were launched, in the early 1960s renamed Belcar and Vemaguet. The company also produced a luxury coupe (the DKW Fissore) and the off-road Munga (locally called Candango). In 1960 Vemag cars received the larger one-litre, engine from the Auto Union 1000.

Vemag had a successful official racing team, with the coupe GT Malzoni, with fiberglass body. This project was the foundation of the long-lasting Brazilian sports car brand Puma. The Brazilian F94 line has been improved with several cosmetic changes and became more and more different from the German and Argentine models. Vemag had no capital to invest in new products and came under governmental pressure to merge. In 1964–1965 Volkswagen gradually took over Auto Union, a minority holder in Vemag, and in 1967 Volkswagen bought the remainder of the stock. VW quickly began phasing out DKW-Vemag production and introduced the Volkswagen 1600 sedan to the old Vemag plant, after a total of 109,343 DKW-Vemag cars had been built.

DKW vehicles were made in Argentina from 1960 to 1969 by IASF S.A. (Industria Automotriz Santa Fe Sociedad Anónima) in Sauce Viejo, Santa Fe. The most beautiful were the Cupé Fissore, which had many famous owners (Julio Sosa, César Luis Menotti, and others). Other models are the Auto Union 1000 S Sedán (21,797 made until 1969) and the Auto Union 1000 Universal S (6,396 made until 1969). and the Auto Union Combi/Pick-up.
The last version of the Auto Union Combi/Pick-up (DKW F1000 L), launched in 1969, survived a few months and was bought out by IME, which continued production until 1979.

==Vans and utility vehicles==

The DKW Munga was built by Auto Union in Ingolstadt. Production began in October 1956 and ended in December 1968, with 46,750 cars built.

From 1949 to 1962, DKW produced the &quot;Schnellaster&quot; with a trailing-arm rear suspension system with springs in the cross bar assembly. Spanish subsidiary IMOSA produced a modern successor introduced in 1963, the DKW F 1000 L. This van started with the three-cylinder 1,000 cc engine, but later received a Mercedes-Benz Diesel engine and was renamed a Mercedes-Benz in 1975.
==Motorcycles==

During the late 1920s and until WWII broke out, DKW was both the world&#x27;s largest motorcycle manufacturer, as well as Europe&#x27;s pioneer of front-wheel drive automobiles with their successful 1931 and later DKW Front models, before the 1932 Adler Trumpf and the 1934 Citroen Traction Avant. In 1931, Arnold Zoller started building split-singles and this concept made DKW the dominant racing motorcycle in the Lightweight and Junior classes between the wars. This included off-road events like the International Six Days Trial where the marque scored some considerable inter-war year successes alongside Bavarian Motor Works At the same time, the company also had some success with super-charged racing motorcycles which because of their light weight were particularly successful in the ISDT

The motorcycle branch produced famous models such as the RT 125 pre- and post-World War II, and after the war with production at the original factory in GDR becoming MZ it made 175, 250 and 350 (cc) models. As war reparations, the design drawings of the RT125 were given to Harley-Davidson in the US and BSA in the UK. The Harley-Davidson version was known loosely as the Hummer (Hummer is really just a few specific years, but generally people call the Harley lightweights Hummers), while BSA used them for the Bantam. IFA and later MZ models continued in production until the 1990s, when economics brought production of the two stroke to an end. Other manufacturers copied the DKW design, officially or otherwise. This can be seen in the similarity of many small two-stroke motorcycles from the 1950s, including from Yamaha, Voskhod, Maserati and Polish WSK.

<text>The Reverend Doctor Christopher Syn is the smuggler hero of a series of novels by Russell Thorndike. The first book, &quot;Doctor Syn: A Tale of the Romney Marsh&quot; was published in 1915. The story idea came from legendary coastal smuggling in the 18th century around well-known Romney Marsh, where brandy and tobacco were brought in at night by boat from France to avoid the tax. Minor battles were fought, sometimes at night, between gangs of smugglers, such as the Hawkhurst Gang, and His Majesty&#x27;s Customs and Excise / Revenue, supported by the British Army, Royal Navy and local militias in the counties of the South Kent and Sussex.

==Character biography==
Christopher Syn, born 1729, is portrayed as a brilliant scholar from Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, possessing swashbuckling skills such as riding, fencing, and seamanship. He was content to live the quiet life of a Church of England / Anglican country priest / vicar in Dymchurch-under-the-Wall under the patronage of Sir Charles Cobtree, the father of his best friend Anthony Cobtree, until his beautiful young Spanish wife Imogene was seduced by and eloped with Nicholas Tappitt, whom Dr Syn had considered a close friend.

Christopher Syn set out on a quest for revenge, always managing to reach the eloped pair&#x27;s destinations ahead of them just in time to terrify them against landing and facing him in a deliberate campaign of terror. While sailing from Spain to the Americas in pursuit, his ship was captured by the pirate ship &quot;The Sulphur Pit&quot;, commanded by Captain Satan. In a one-on-one fight, Syn defeated and killed Captain Satan to take command of his ship and crew; among them was Mr. Mipps, a former British Royal Navy carpenter with whom Syn had become friends in England after rescuing him from the His Majesty&#x27;s Customs and Excise / Revenue men. Mipps swore loyalty to Syn from that time onward.

With Mipps at his side, Syn turned to piracy and became a great success. Later, when his crew refused to let Syn leave, Syn and Mipps slipped away in one of the ship&#x27;s boats; unknown to Syn, Mipps had arranged a convenient &quot;accident&quot; in the ship&#x27;s powder magazine with an exploding barrel of gunpowder, eliminating witnesses of Syn&#x27;s piratical acts.

Mipps then joined Syn in his quest for revenge, pursuing Tappitt and Imogene throughout the thirteen American colonies of British America (supposedly preaching the gospel to the Indians) and around the world (as part of a whaling voyage) afterwards. Mipps was with him in the Caribbean when Dr. Syn turned again to piracy, assuming the name of Captain Clegg (taking the name &quot;Clegg&quot; from a certain vicious biting fly he had encountered in America). &quot;Clegg&quot; hijacked his enemy Tappitt&#x27;s own ship and crew and sailed off with them (renaming the ship the &quot;Imogene&quot;) to become the most infamous pirate of the day.

However, a mulatto who escaped the destruction of Syn&#x27;s previous ship stowed away in Clegg&#x27;s ship and accused him before the crew; Clegg quelled the potential mutiny by having the mulatto&#x27;s tongue cut out, marooning him on a coral reef and violently killing Yellow Pete, the ship&#x27;s Chinese cook, who represented the crew in their wish to rescue the mulatto. Afterwards, realizing that Clegg had become too notorious, Syn decided to abandon his quest and return to England, and Mipps set up a second &quot;accidental&quot; explosion to destroy the &quot;Imogene&quot; and her crew.

Syn returned to England on the night of a storm (13 November 1775) that wrecked his brig off the English coast in sight of Dymchurch. That night he went to the house of his old friend (and now squire) Anthony Cobtree. When news came that the local vicar had drowned while trying to save victims of the shipwreck, Squire Cobtree offered the post to Christopher Syn. Syn accepted and settled down to a more respectable life as the vicar of Dymchurch and Dean of Peculiars in Romney Marsh, Kent, resuming his original name.

Mipps arrived in Dymchurch with the intent of settling down. Syn made him the village sexton upon condition that Mipps &quot;remember to forget&quot; (that Syn had been Clegg and that they had known each other before), and that Mipps never get involved with the local smugglers.

Syn soon became aware that his parishioners were smuggling goods from France to avoid the excessive customs duties the government charged. Learning from Mipps (who, contrary to Syn&#x27;s orders, had become a leader of the smugglers) that certain townsfolk had been ambushed and captured during a smuggling run, Syn purchased the great black stallion Gehenna from gypsy horse-traders and raced to their rescue. A suit of clothing borrowed from a scarecrow made an improvised disguise, and Syn and Mipps were able to rescue the townsfolk from the Dragoons.

After this, Syn decided that he could only protect his people by becoming their leader. He created a more elaborate scarecrow costume, with eerie luminous paint. Riding Gehenna at night, the respectable Dr. Syn became &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, the feared head of the smugglers. Together with Mipps, he organized the smugglers into a well-organized band of &quot;Night Riders&quot;, also called &quot;The Devil Riders&quot;, with macabre disguises and code-names.

Syn&#x27;s cunning was so great that the smugglers outwitted the government forces for many years. A hidden stable watched over by Mother Handaway, the local &quot;witch&quot; (who believed the Scarecrow to be The Devil in living form), was the hiding place for the horses of the Scarecrow and his lieutenants, Mipps and the local highwayman Jimmie Bone (who, being as good a horseman as Syn and of similar build, was sometimes called upon to impersonate the Scarecrow when Syn either had to be elsewhere or seen in the same place).

Shortly after the first appearances of the Scarecrow, Nicholas Tappitt (using the name &quot;Colonel Delacourt&quot;) and the ailing Imogene returned to England, ending up in Dymchurch. Recognizing Syn as Clegg, Tappitt realized that Syn and the Scarecrow were one and the same person, and helped the authorities set a trap for him, hoping to both rid himself of his enemy and claim the reward for his capture. The trap was sprung, but Squire Cobtree&#x27;s daughter Charlotte, who had fallen in love with Syn and also learned his secret identities as both Clegg and the Scarecrow, was the tragic victim when she dressed in the Scarecrow&#x27;s disguise and was fatally wounded as a result. Tappitt was then suspected of being the Scarecrow, and a Customs officer and three constables came to arrest him. In the ensuing fight, Tappitt killed the Customs man and the constables subdued and arrested Tappitt for murdering the Customs officer.

After Imogene&#x27;s death in Syn&#x27;s arms (during which she revealed to him that he had a son by her who was missing somewhere in North America), Syn fought a final duel with Tappitt in his jail cell, defeating him. Syn then struck a bargain with Tappitt: if Tappitt confessed to being the notorious pirate Clegg, then Syn would look after and care for Tappitt and Imogene&#x27;s new-born infant daughter (also named Imogene). Tappitt agreed, and &quot;Captain Clegg&quot; was hanged and later &quot;buried without benefit of clergy at a cross-roads hard by the Kent Ditch&quot;.

Many years later, Captain Collyer, a Royal Navy officer assigned to smash the local smuggling ring, uncovered the deception and Dr. Syn&#x27;s true identity, thanks in part to the tongueless mulatto (who had been rescued by Collyer years before and who had been serving Collyer as a &quot;ferret&quot; seeking out hidden contraband) who recognized Syn as Clegg. Syn evaded capture while at the same time making sure that Imogene and Squire Cobtree&#x27;s son Denis (who had fallen in love with Imogene) would have a happy life together (they were eventually married), but was murdered in revenge by the mulatto, who then mysteriously managed to escape, leaving Syn harpooned through the neck. As a last mark of respect, Collyer ordered that Syn be buried at sea, rather than have his body hung in chains.

Mipps escaped in the confusion of Syn&#x27;s death and disappeared from England, but it is said that a little man very much like him is living out his days in a Buddhist Monastery somewhere in the Malay Peninsula / Malaya, delighting the monks with recounting the adventures of Doctor Syn and the eerie stories of the Romney Marsh and the mysterious Scarecrow and his Night Riders.

==Publication history==
The Dr. Syn books detail his adventures and attempts to help the people of Dymchurch and the surrounding area evade the Excise tax. There are seven novels in the series:
* &quot;Doctor Syn: A Tale of the Romney Marsh&quot; (1915)
* &quot;Doctor Syn on the High Seas&quot; (1935)
* &quot;Doctor Syn Returns&quot; (1935)
* &quot;Further Adventures of Doctor Syn&quot; (1936)
* &quot;Amazing Quest of Doctor Syn&quot; (1938)
* &quot;Courageous Exploits of Doctor Syn&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Shadow of Doctor Syn&quot; (1944)

Note: the &quot;first&quot; book, &quot;Doctor Syn&quot;, is actually the final story chronologically; the others proceed in published sequence.

An expanded version of &quot;Doctor Syn Returns&quot; titled &quot;The Scarecrow Rides&quot; was published for the U.S. market by The Dial Press in 1935; years later in 2013 it was re-printed in paperback by Black Curtain Press. ().

In 1960, American author William Buchanan reworked Thorndike&#x27;s &quot;Further Adventures of Doctor Syn&quot; under the title &quot;Christopher Syn&quot; (New York, Abelard Schuman), giving Thorndike co-authorship credit; this version provides a different conclusion and some conflation, renaming and even removal of the supporting characters. &quot;Christopher Syn&quot; became the basis for the 1962 Disney production; there was also a novelization of the Disney theatrical version titled &quot;Doctor Syn, Alias the Scarecrow&quot; written by Vic Crume.

==In other media==
===Films===
Three film adaptations have been made of Dr. Syn&#x27;s exploits.

====&quot;Doctor Syn&quot; (1937)====
The first, &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; (1937), starred the actor George Arliss in the title role and was his last film.

====&quot;Captain Clegg&quot; (1962)====
&quot;Captain Clegg&quot; (1962), (known as &quot;Night Creatures&quot; when released in the United States), was produced by Hammer Film Productions with actor Peter Cushing in the lead role, directed by Peter Graham Scott. In the screenplay by Anthony Hinds, the main character&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; to &quot;Parson Blyss&quot; to avoid copyrights problems with Disney&#x27;s forthcoming version, and &quot;Captain Clegg&quot;&#x27;s screenplay follows the novel &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; and the screenplay of the 1937 film closely with the exception of a tightening of the plot. In the Arliss film &quot;Doctor Syn&quot;, Syn escapes to sea with Mipps and the rest of the Dymchurch smugglers, whereas &quot;Captain Clegg&quot; ends more faithfully to the novel, with Parson Blyss being killed by the mulatto (who is then killed by Mipps) and then being carried to and buried in Captain Clegg&#x27;s empty grave by Mipps. &quot;Captain Clegg&quot; was released in the United Kingdom / Great Britain on DVD and Blu-ray in 2014; &quot;Night Creatures&quot; was never released on videotape in the United States, but is included in the 2014 two-disc DVD collection &quot;The Hammer Horror Series&quot;. In North America, the film was released on 6 September 2005 along with seven other Hammer horror films on the 4-DVD set &quot;The Hammer Horror Series&quot; , part of MCA-Universal&#x27;s &quot;Franchise Collection&quot;. This set was re-released on Blu-ray 13 September 2016. A Blu-ray was released in the UK on 23 June 2014 by Final Cut Entertainment. In 2021, Powerhouse Films re-released the film on Blu-Ray, along with &quot;The Shadow of the Cat&quot;, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, and &quot;Nightmare&quot;, as part of &quot;Hammer Volume Six: Night Shadows&quot; boxset.

====&quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; (1963)====
&quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; (1963) was produced for the &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; weekly TV series on Sunday evenings on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC-TV network). It was shot on location in Kent, England (United Kingdom / Great Britain) and was directed by James Neilson. It stars British actor Patrick McGoohan in the title role of the meek, mild, intellectual country priest / vicar of &quot;Doctor Syn&quot;, with George Cole as Mipps and Australian actor Sean Scully, as young John Banks, the younger son of nearby country estate nobleman, Squire Thomas Banks (Michael Hordern). 

In the 18th century, the local Church of England / Anglican parish of St Clement&#x27;s Church in Old Romney in Kent doubled as priest / vicar plus an additional secret life and career. Dr Syn&#x27;s fictional Dymchurch parish church in the production, and the Disney studio funded the additional repair of the building to use it as a filming location.

Part One dealt with the arrival of General Pugh (Geoffrey Keen), who had been ordered by the British Royal government&#x27;s War Office in London, to smash the smuggling ring along that part of the marshy coast of the North Sea and English Channel, of Kent and Sussex in southeastern England, and prevent the Scarecrow from rescuing a Dymchurch man captured by a Royal Navy press gang (drafting / shanghaiing unlucky merchant ships seamen out on the town as forced recruits/sailors on British warships in port), as bait to trap the infamous smuggler gang leader Scarecrow. Part Two of the series depicted The Scarecrow dealing with the traitorous Joe Ransley (Patrick Wymark. Part Three showed how the Scarecrow rescued Harry Banks (David Buck) and American colonialist Simon Bates (Tony Britton) from British Army General Pugh&#x27;s (Geoffrey Keen), clutches in Dover Castle.

While originally conceived and edited for American television (and announced in an advertisement by the NBC network in the Tuesday, 9 July 1963, issue of the noted entertainment industry newspaper &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, published in Los Angeles, California), &quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; was re-edited for first, a 1963 British theatrical release several months before the American prime-time television debut. Retitled as &quot;Dr Syn, Alias the Scarecrow&quot;, the British theatrical version was released on a double bill with the animated &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; a children&#x27;s historical film about legendary young King Arthur. They both ran during the December 1963 Christmas season (advertised in the January 1964 issue of &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine). This version was shown in continental Europe as well, plus also later in Latin America of Central and South America&#x27;s television networks through three years later in 1966.

In the following decade of the 1970s, the &quot;Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; production was re-edited again for its first American theatrical release by the Disney studios, on double bills with both the four-decade old classic of 1937 of the color animated &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; old feature film and also &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950, starring Robert Newton, of author Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s classic sea-faring treasure hunt saga to a distant island, in the original novel published 1883. Both involving British ships and seamen.

The VHS format of video cassette tape release of the 1980s, sharing the removal of the emeScarecrow&#x27;s laugh from Terry Gilkyson&#x27;s memorable title theme song, was expanded to include the story material from all three original broadcast NBC television episodes, while retaining the feature film structure and credits; it was available for a relatively short amount of time. Shortly after the theatrical run in the United States, it was re-edited once more for a two-part presentation and rebroadcast on Disney&#x27;s television series a decade later in the 1970s, simply omitting the middle episode. The original three-part series was first shown as part of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; on three successive Sunday evenings on 9, 16 and 23 February 1964. Twenty years later, it was included in another broadcast late 1980s &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; syndication rerun package, and cablecast in 1990s on the cable television Disney Channel. This version generally followed the storyline of &quot;The Further Adventures of Dr. Syn&quot; and made it clear that the good Doctor Syn did not die or stage his own death: at the film&#x27;s end, he is seen having a cup of tea with the local Squire, (still totally unaware of his true identity and political opinions!!) who admits to now owing a debt of gratitude to the criminal smuggler, outlaw and rebel &quot;Scarecrow&quot;.

On 11 November 2008 The Walt Disney Company released a limited pressing of 39,500 copies of &quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; on the DVD format of video disc for the first time, in a collector&#x27;s metal tin case. This was a part of the newly issued &quot;Disney Treasures&quot; collection and was now titled &quot;Dr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot;. This release sold out in only three weeks. The DVD was made available again for the members of the Disney Movie Club on 17 February 2009. This two-disc set includes the American television version and the original British theatrical release version &quot;Dr Syn, Alias the Scarecrow&quot; in a widescreen format. It also includes the original televised introductions by famed artist / cartoonist and studio founder/owner Walt Disney himself, as was then traditional for the regular Sunday night program of 1963–1964 (in which he erroneously states that Dr. Syn was an actual historical figure, although English smuggling rings along the coasts were a historical fact in those earlier centuries) and also contains a documentary feature on Disney&#x27;s interest in filming the historical fiction story. 

In October 2019, the recently established Disney Movie Club released it on the superior Blu-ray format, this time entitling it as &quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot;. Its single disc of advanced technology contains all three episodes originally broadcast on television in 1964. It also includes Walt Disney&#x27;s taped introductions, but unfortunately, none of the supplemental features that appeared on the earlier 2009 released copy.

====Other adaptations====
Made in 1974, &quot;Carry On Dick&quot;, of the &quot;Carry On&quot; series of films, followed the same premise of a country vicar (Sid James) who is secretly an outlaw, in this case the highwayman Dick Turpin.

===Theatre===
In 2001 a stage adaptation titled &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; was performed at churches throughout the Romney Marsh, the final night being performed in Dymchurch. The cast featured Daniel Thorndike (the author&#x27;s son), Michael Fields, Steven Povey and Ben Barton, along with various amateurs from the area.

British composer Adam Pounds has written an opera, &quot;Syn&quot;, based on the character of Doctor Syn, excerpts of which were performed at the Mumford Theatre in Cambridge, in 2021.

===Audio adaptations===
;&quot;Doctor Syn&quot;
Rufus Sewell read a 10-part audio adaptation combining and abridging &quot;Doctor Syn on the High Seas&quot; and &quot;Doctor Syn Returns&quot; for BBC Radio, broadcast on BBC Radio 7 in December 2006 and repeated in June 2007.

;&quot;The Further Adventures of Doctor Syn&quot;
A 10-part audio adaptation of &quot;The Further Adventures of Doctor Syn&quot; (combining and abridging &quot;The Further Adventures of Doctor Syn&quot; and &quot;The Shadow of Doctor Syn&quot;) read by Rufus Sewell was performed on BBC Radio 7 in December 2007.

;&quot;The Last of Doctor Syn&quot; 
BBC Radio 7 broadcast the six-part series, an abridged reading by Rufus Sewell of the original &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; novel, from 4–11 January 2010.

;No Quarter 
John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin reinterpreted elements of the Doctor Syn story as his &quot;No Quarter&quot; fantasy sequence in Led Zeppelin&#x27;s concert film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;.

===Comic books===
A three-issue adaptation of the Disney production was published by Gold Key Comics under the &quot;Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; title, spanning April 1964 through October 1965.

A much abridged revision of the adventures of Dr. Syn appeared as a short comic serialized in the monthly publication &quot;Disney Adventures&quot;. The new story features the heroic Doctor and his young sidekick protecting innocent villagers from corrupt government officials and soldiers. &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; would also produce a crossover story with the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film franchise, where coincidentally the meek, mild intellectual country priest / vicar &quot;Dr. Syn&quot; (secretly infamous English smuggler gang leader and rebel in the &quot;Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot;), meets up with Captain Jack Sparrow.

Doctor Syn appears in the &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; series as a member of the league gathered by Lemuel Gulliver. His alter ego, Captain Clegg, also makes appearances, where he is mentioned to have had a brief romantic liaison with future teammate Fanny Hill. In the 2003 film adaptation of &quot;League&quot;, Dr. Syn can be spotted in one of the portraits hanging on the wall in M&#x27;s library.

== Cultural legacy ==
A &quot;Days of Syn&quot; festival is held even-numbered years by Dymchurch residents for fund-raising. The 2006 &quot;Days of Syn&quot; was on 26–28 August (UK August Bank Holiday weekend) and featured a talk on Dr. Syn at the Anglican church at 6:30 pm. On Sunday at 3 p.m. there was a church service where Dr. Syn and the cast appeared in period costume. On Monday, starting at the Bowery Hall, scenes were reenacted from &quot;Doctor Syn&quot;, and again during the day along the Dymchurch shoreline and in the Ocean pub.

In 2009, discussions took place to build a 100 ft high statue of &quot;The Scarecrow&quot; on a site in the centre of Romney Marsh. This had not been done by 2016.

Doctor Syn is also the name given to one of the locomotives on the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.

Doctor Syn also inspired novelist George Chittenden, who captured smuggling on the Kent coast in his debut novel &quot;The Boy Who Led Them&quot;, which follows the rise and fall of a smuggling gang leader further down the coast in the town of Deal.

In 2009, an playfully erotic Afrikaans-language novel, &quot;Dagtaak&quot;, was published pseudonymously by D R Syn. The author&#x27;s name and some of the traits of the main character in this novel, allude to the Dr Syn series. Initial advances to produce an arthouse circuit movie from the novel did not come to fruition.

Two rooms in the Mermaid Inn, Rye (Dr. Syn&#x27;s Bed Chamber and Dr. Syn&#x27;s Lounge) are named after the character.

<doc id="8709" wikidata="Q1207761" url="?curid=8709" title="Dhrystone">
<text>Dhrystone is a synthetic computing benchmark program developed in 1984 by Reinhold P. Weicker intended to be representative of system (integer) programming. The Dhrystone grew to become representative of general processor (CPU) performance. The name &quot;Dhrystone&quot; is a pun on a different benchmark algorithm called Whetstone, which emphasizes floating point performance.

With Dhrystone, Weicker gathered meta-data from a broad range of software, including programs written in FORTRAN, PL/1, SAL, ALGOL 68, and Pascal. He then characterized these programs in terms of various common constructs: procedure calls, pointer indirections, assignments, etc. From this he wrote the Dhrystone benchmark to correspond to a representative mix. Dhrystone was published in Ada, with the C version for Unix developed by Rick Richardson (&quot;version 1.1&quot;) greatly contributing to its popularity.

==Dhrystone vs. Whetstone ==
The Dhrystone benchmark contains no floating point operations, thus the name is a pun on the then-popular Whetstone benchmark for floating point operations. The output from the benchmark is the number of Dhrystones per second (the number of iterations of the main code loop per second).

Both Whetstone and Dhrystone are &quot;synthetic&quot; benchmarks, meaning that they are simple programs that are carefully designed to statistically mimic the processor usage of some common set of programs. Whetstone, developed in 1972, originally strove to mimic typical Algol 60 programs based on measurements from 1970, but eventually became most popular in its Fortran version, reflecting the highly numerical orientation of computing in the 1960s.

==Issues addressed by Dhrystone==

Dhrystone&#x27;s eventual importance as an indicator of general-purpose (&quot;integer&quot;) performance of new computers made it a target for commercial compiler writers. Various modern compiler static code analysis techniques (such as elimination of dead code: for example, code which uses the processor but produces internal results which are not used or output) make the use and design of synthetic benchmarks more difficult. Version 2.0 of the benchmark, released by Weicker and Richardson in March 1988, had a number of changes intended to foil a range of compiler techniques. Yet it was carefully crafted so as not to change the underlying benchmark. This effort to foil compilers was only partly successful. Dhrystone 2.1, released in May of the same year, had some minor changes and remains the current definition of Dhrystone.

Other than issues related to compiler optimization, various other issues have been cited with the Dhrystone. Most of these, including the small code size and small data set size, were understood at the time of its publication in 1984. More subtle is the slight over-representation of string operations, which is largely language-related: both Ada and Pascal have strings as normal variables in the language, whereas C does not, so what was simple variable assignment in reference benchmarks became buffer copy operations in the C library. Another issue is that the score reported does not include information which is critical when comparing systems such as which compiler was used, and what optimizations.

Dhrystone remains remarkably resilient as a simple benchmark, but its continuing value in establishing true performance is questionable. It is easy to use, well documented, fully self-contained, well understood, and can be made to work on almost any system. In particular, it has remained in broad use in the embedded computing world, though the recently developed EEMBC benchmark suite, the CoreMark standalone benchmark, HINT, Stream, and even Bytemark are widely quoted and used, as well as more specific benchmarks for the memory subsystem (Cachebench), TCP/IP (TTCP), and many others.

==Results ==
Dhrystone may represent a result more meaningfully than MIPS (million instructions per second) because instruction count comparisons between different instruction sets (e.g. RISC vs. CISC) can confound simple comparisons. For example, the same high-level task may require many more instructions on a RISC machine, but might execute faster than a single CISC instruction. Thus, the Dhrystone score counts only the number of program iteration completions per second, allowing individual machines to perform this calculation in a machine-specific way. Another common representation of the Dhrystone benchmark is the DMIPS (Dhrystone MIPS) obtained when the Dhrystone score is divided by 1757 (the number of Dhrystones per second obtained on the VAX 11/780, nominally a 1 MIPS machine).

Another way to represent results is in DMIPS/MHz, where DMIPS result is further divided by CPU frequency, to allow for easier comparison of CPUs running at different clock rates.

==Shortcomings==
Using Dhrystone as a benchmark has pitfalls: 
* It features unusual code that is not usually representative of modern real-life programs.
* It is susceptible to compiler optimizations. For example, it does a lot of string copying in an attempt to measure string copying performance. However, the strings in Dhrystone are of known constant length and their starts are aligned on natural boundaries, two characteristics usually absent from real programs. Therefore, an optimizer can replace a string copy with a sequence of word moves without any loops, which will be much faster. This optimization consequently overstates system performance, sometimes by more than 30%.
* Dhrystone&#x27;s small code size may fit in the instruction cache of a modern CPU, so that instruction fetch performance is not rigorously tested. Similarly, Dhrystone may also fit completely in the data cache, thus not exercising data cache miss performance. To counter fits-in-the-cache problem, the SPECint benchmark was created in 1988 to include a suite of (initially 8) much larger programs (including a compiler) which could not fit into L1 or L2 caches of that era.

<text>Dave Winer (born May 2, 1955, in Queens, New York City) is an American software developer, entrepreneur, and writer who resides in New York City. Winer is noted for his contributions to outliners, scripting, content management, and web services, as well as blogging and podcasting. He is the founder of the software companies Living Videotext, Userland Software and Small Picture Inc., a former contributing editor for the Web magazine HotWired, the author of the &quot;Scripting News&quot; weblog, a former research fellow at Harvard Law School, and current visiting scholar at New York University&#x27;s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute.

==Early life and education==

Winer was born on May 2, 1955, in Queens, New York City, the son of Eve Winer, PhD, a school psychologist, and Leon Winer, PhD, a former professor of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. Winer is also the grandnephew of German novelist Arno Schmidt and a relative of Hedy Lamarr. He graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1972. Winer received a BA in Mathematics from Tulane University in New Orleans in 1976. In 1978 he received an MS in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

==Career==
===Early work in outliners===
In 1979 Dave Winer became an employee of Personal Software, where he worked on his own product idea named VisiText, which was his first attempt to build a commercial product around an &quot;expand and collapse&quot; outline display and which ultimately established outliners as a software product. In 1981 he left the company and founded Living Videotext to develop this still-unfinished product. The company was based in Mountain View, CA, and grew to more than 50 employees.

ThinkTank, which was based on VisiText, was released in 1983 for Apple II and was promoted as an &quot;idea processor.&quot; It became the &quot;first popular outline processor, the one that made the term generic.&quot; A ThinkTank release for the IBM PC followed in 1984, as well as releases for the Macintosh 128K and 512K. Ready, a RAM resident outliner for the IBM PC released in 1985, was commercially successful but soon succumbed to the competing Sidekick product by Borland. MORE, released for Apple&#x27;s Macintosh in 1986, combined an outliner and a presentation program. It became &quot;uncontested in the marketplace&quot; and won the MacUser&#x27;s Editor&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Best Product&quot; in 1986.

In 1987, at the height of the company&#x27;s success, Winer sold Living Videotext to Symantec for an undisclosed but substantial transfer of stock that &quot;made his fortune.&quot; Winer continued to work at Symantec&#x27;s Living Videotext division, but after six months he left the company in pursuit of other challenges.

===Years at UserLand===
Winer founded UserLand Software in 1988 and served as the company&#x27;s CEO until 2002.

UserLand&#x27;s original flagship product, Frontier, was a system-level scripting environment for the Mac. Winer&#x27;s pioneering weblog, &quot;Scripting News&quot;, takes its name from this early interest. Frontier was an outliner-based scripting language, echoing Winer&#x27;s longstanding interest in outliners and anticipating code-folding editors of the late 1990s.
Winer became interested in web publishing while helping automate the production process of the strikers&#x27; online newspaper during San Francisco&#x27;s newspaper strike of November 1994, According to Newsweek, through this experience, he &quot;revolutionized Net publishing.&quot; Winer subsequently shifted the company&#x27;s focus to online publishing products, enthusiastically promoting and experimenting with these products while building his websites and developing new features. One of these products was Frontier&#x27;s NewsPage Suite of 1997, which supported the publication of Winer&#x27;s &quot;Scripting News&quot; and was adopted by a handful of users who &quot;began playing around with their own sites in the Scripting News vein.&quot; These users included notably Chris Gulker and Jorn Barger, who envisaged blogging as a networked practice among users of the software.

Winer was named a Seybold Fellow in 1997, to assist the executives and editors that comprised the Seybold Institute in ensuring &quot;the highest quality and topicality&quot; in their educational program, the Seybold Seminars; the honor was bestowed for his &quot;pioneering work in web-based publishing systems.&quot; Keen to enter the &quot;competitive arena of high-end Web development,&quot; Winer then came to collaborate with Microsoft and jointly developed the XML-RPC protocol. This led to the creation of SOAP, which he co-authored with Microsoft&#x27;s Don Box, Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein.

In December 1997, acting on the desire to &quot;offer much more timely information,&quot; Winer designed and implemented an XML syndication format for use on his &quot;Scripting News&quot; weblog, thus making an early contribution to the history of web syndication technology. By December 2000, competing dialects of RSS included several varieties of Netscape&#x27;s RSS, Winer&#x27;s RSS 0.92, and an RDF-based RSS 1.0. Winer continued to develop the branch of the RSS fork originating from RSS 0.92, releasing in 2002 a version called RSS 2.0. Winer&#x27;s advocacy of web syndication in general and RSS 2.0 in particular convinced many news organizations to syndicate their news content in that format. For example, in early 2002 &quot;The New York Times&quot; entered an agreement with UserLand to syndicate many of their articles in RSS 2.0 format. Winer resisted calls by technologists to have the shortcomings of RSS 2.0 improved. Instead, he froze the format and turned its ownership over to Harvard University.

With products and services based on UserLand&#x27;s Frontier system, Winer became a leader in blogging tools from 1999 onward, as well as a &quot;leading evangelist of weblogs.&quot; In 2000 Winer developed the Outline Processor Markup Language OPML, an XML format for outlines, which originally served as the native file format for Radio UserLand&#x27;s outliner application and has since been adopted for other uses, the most common being to exchange lists of web feeds between web feed aggregators. UserLand was the first to add an &quot;enclosure&quot; tag in its RSS, modifying its blog software and its aggregator so that bloggers could easily link to an audio file (see podcasting and history of podcasting).

In February 2002 Winer was named one of the &quot;Top Ten Technology Innovators&quot; by InfoWorld.

In June 2002 Winer underwent life-saving bypass surgery to prevent a heart attack and as a consequence stepped down as CEO of UserLand shortly after. He remained the firm&#x27;s majority shareholder, however, and claimed personal ownership of Weblogs.com.

===Writer===
As &quot;one of the most prolific content generators in Web history,&quot; Winer has enjoyed a long career as a writer and has come to be counted among Silicon Valley&#x27;s &quot;most influential web voices.&quot;

Winer started &quot;DaveNet&quot;, &quot;a stream-of-consciousness newsletter distributed by e-mail&quot; in November 1994 and maintained Web archives of the &quot;goofy and informative&quot; 800-word essays since January 1995, which earned him a Cool Site of the Day award in March 1995. From the start, the &quot;Internet newsletter&quot; &quot;DaveNet&quot; was widely read among industry leaders and analysts, who experienced it as a &quot;real community.&quot; Dissatisfied with the quality of the coverage that the Mac and, especially, his own Frontier software received in the trade press, Winer saw &quot;DaveNet&quot; as an opportunity to &quot;bypass&quot; the conventional news channels of the software business. Satisfied with his success, he &quot;reveled in the new direct email line he had established with his colleagues and peers, and in his ability to circumvent the media.&quot; In the early years, Winer often used &quot;DaveNet&quot; to vent his grievances against Apple&#x27;s management, and as a consequence of his strident criticism came to be seen as &quot;the most notorious of the disgruntled Apple developers.&quot; Redacted &quot;DaveNet&quot; columns were published weekly by the web magazine &quot;HotWired&quot; between June 1995 and May 1996. &quot;DaveNet&quot; was discontinued in 2004.

Winer&#x27;s &quot;Scripting News&quot;, described as &quot;one of the [web&#x27;s] oldest blogs,&quot; launched in February 1997 and earned him titles such as &quot;protoblogger&quot; and &quot;forefather of blogging.&quot; &quot;Scripting News&quot; started as &quot;a home for links, offhand observations, and ephemera&quot; and allowed Winer to mix &quot;his roles as a widely read pundit and an ambitious entrepreneur.&quot; Offering an &quot;as-it-happened portrait of the work of writing software for the Web in the 1990s,&quot; the site became an &quot;established must-read for industry insiders.&quot; &quot;Scripting News&quot; continues to be updated regularly.

===Visiting scholar positions===
Winer spent one year as a resident fellow at the Harvard Law School&#x27;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, where he worked on using weblogs in education. While there, he launched &quot;Weblogs at Harvard Law School&quot; using UserLand software, and held the first BloggerCon conferences. Winer&#x27;s fellowship ended in June 2004.

In 2010 Winer was appointed visiting scholar at New York University&#x27;s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute.

===Return to outliners===
On December 19, 2012, Winer co-founded Small Picture, Inc. with Kyle Shank; Small Picture is a corporation that builds two outlining products, Little Outliner and Fargo. Little Outliner, an entry-level outliner designed to teach new users about outliners, which launched on March 25, 2013. Fargo, the company&#x27;s &quot;primary product&quot;, launched less than a month later, on April 17, 2013. Fargo is a free browser-based outliner which syncs with a user&#x27;s Dropbox account. Small Picture has stated that in future it may offer paid-for services to Fargo users. Fargo was retired at the end of September 2017.

==Projects and activities==
===24 Hours of Democracy===
In February 1996, while working as a columnist for HotWired, Winer organized 24 Hours of Democracy, an online protest against the recently passed Communications Decency Act. As part of the protest, over 1,000 people, among them Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, posted essays to the Web on the subject of democracy, civil liberty and freedom of speech.

===Edit This Page===
In December 1999, Winer became the &quot;proprietor of a growing free blog service&quot; at EditThisPage.com, hosting &quot;approximately 20,000 sites&quot; in February 2001. The service closed in December 2005.

===Podcasting===

Winer has been given &quot;credit for the invention of the podcasting model.&quot; Having received user requests for audioblogging features since October 2000, especially from Adam Curry, Winer decided to include new functionality in RSS 0.92 by defining a new element called &quot;enclosure,&quot; which would pass the address of a media file to the RSS aggregator. He demonstrated the RSS enclosure feature on January 11, 2001, by enclosing a Grateful Dead song in his &quot;Scripting News&quot; weblog.

Winer&#x27;s weblogging product, Radio Userland, the program favored by Curry, had a built-in aggregator and thus provided both the &quot;send&quot; and &quot;receive&quot; components of what was then called audioblogging. In July 2003 Winer challenged other aggregator developers to provide support for enclosures. In October 2003, Kevin Marks demonstrated a script to download RSS enclosures and pass them to iTunes for transfer to an iPod. Curry then offered an RSS-to-iPod script that moved MP3 files from Radio UserLand to iTunes. The term &quot;podcasting&quot; was suggested by Ben Hammersley in February 2004.

Winer also has an occasional podcast, Morning Coffee Notes, which has featured guests such as Doc Searls, Mike Kowalchik, Jason Calacanis, Steve Gillmor, Peter Rojas, Cecile Andrews, Adam Curry, Betsy Devine and others.

=== BloggerCon ===

BloggerCon is a user-focused conference for the blogger community. BloggerCon I (October 2003) and II (April 2004), were organized by Dave Winer and friends at Harvard Law School&#x27;s Berkman Center for the Internet and Society in Cambridge, Mass. BloggerCon III met at Stanford Law School on November 6, 2004.

===Weblogs.com===

Weblogs.com provided a free ping-server used by many blogging applications, as well as free hosting to many bloggers. After leaving Userland, Winer claimed personal ownership of the site, and in mid-June 2004 he shut down its free blog-hosting service, citing lack of resources and personal problems. A swift and orderly migration off Winer&#x27;s server was facilitated by Rogers Cadenhead, whom Winer then hired to port the server to a more stable platform. In October 2005, VeriSign bought the Weblogs.com ping-server from Winer and promised that its free services would remain free. The podcasting-related web site audio.weblogs.com was also included in the $2.3 million deal.

===Share your OPML===
Winer opened his self-described &quot;commons for sharing outlines, feeds, and taxonomy&quot; in May 2006. The site allowed users to publish and syndicate blogrolls and aggregator subscriptions using OPML. Winer suspended its service in January 2008.

===Rebooting the News===
Since 2009, Winer has collaborated with New York University&#x27;s associate professor of journalism Jay Rosen on &quot;Rebooting the News&quot;, a weekly podcast on technology and innovation in journalism. It was announced on July 1, 2011, that the show would be on break, as NYU itself was, from June to September. However, no new episodes have been released since, making show #94 released on May 23, 2011, the last.
