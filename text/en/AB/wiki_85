<text>Edvard Hagerup Grieg ( , ; 15 June 18434 September 1907) was a Norwegian composer and pianist. He is widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide. His use of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions brought the music of Norway to fame, as well as helping to develop a national identity, much as Jean Sibelius did in Finland and Bedřich Smetana in Bohemia.

Grieg is the most celebrated person from the city of Bergen, with numerous statues that depict his image and many cultural entities named after him: the city&#x27;s largest concert building (Grieg Hall), its most advanced music school (Grieg Academy) and its professional choir (Edvard Grieg Kor). The Edvard Grieg Museum at Grieg&#x27;s former home, Troldhaugen, is dedicated to his legacy.

==Background==
Edvard Hagerup Grieg was born in Bergen, Norway (then part of Sweden–Norway). His parents were Alexander Grieg (1806–1875), a merchant and the British Vice-Consul in Bergen, and Gesine Judithe Hagerup (1814–1875), a music teacher and daughter of solicitor and politician Edvard Hagerup. The family name, originally spelled Greig, is associated with the Scottish Clann Ghriogair (Clan Gregor). After the Battle of Culloden in Scotland in 1746, Grieg&#x27;s great-grandfather, Alexander Greig (1739–1803), travelled widely before settling in Norway about 1770 and establishing business interests in Bergen. Grieg&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandparents, John (1702–1774) and Anne (1704–1784), are buried in the abandoned churchyard of the ruined Church of St Ethernan in Rathen, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

Edvard Grieg was raised in a musical family. His mother was his first piano teacher and taught him to play when he was age six. He studied in several schools, including Tanks Upper Secondary School.

During the summer of 1858, Grieg met the eminent Norwegian violinist Ole Bull, who was a family friend; Bull&#x27;s brother was married to Grieg&#x27;s aunt. Bull recognized the 15-year-old boy&#x27;s talent and persuaded his parents to send him to the Leipzig Conservatory, the piano department of which was directed by Ignaz Moscheles.

Grieg enrolled in the conservatory, concentrating on piano, and enjoyed the many concerts and recitals given in Leipzig. He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study. An exception was the organ, which was mandatory for piano students. About his study in the conservatory, he wrote to his biographer, Aimar Grønvold, in 1881: &quot;I must admit, unlike Svendsen, that I left Leipzig Conservatory just as stupid as I entered it. Naturally, I did learn something there, but my individuality was still a closed book to me.&quot;

During the spring of 1860, he survived two life-threatening lung diseases, pleurisy and tuberculosis. Throughout his life, Grieg&#x27;s health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine. He suffered from numerous respiratory infections, and ultimately developed combined lung and heart failure. Grieg was admitted many times to spas and sanatoria both in Norway and abroad. Several of his doctors became his friends.

==Career==
During 1861, Grieg made his debut as a concert pianist in Karlshamn, Sweden. In 1862, he finished his studies in Leipzig and had his first concert in his hometown, where his program included Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pathétique&quot; sonata.
In 1863, Grieg went to Copenhagen, Denmark, and stayed there for three years. He met the Danish composers J. P. E. Hartmann and Niels Gade. He also met his fellow Norwegian composer Rikard Nordraak (composer of the Norwegian national anthem), who became a good friend and source of inspiration. Nordraak died in 1866, and Grieg composed a funeral march in his honor.

On 11 June 1867, Grieg married his first cousin, Nina Hagerup (1845–1935), a lyric soprano. The next year, their only child, Alexandra, was born. Alexandra died in 1869 from meningitis. During the summer of 1868, Grieg wrote his Piano Concerto in A minor while on holiday in Denmark. Edmund Neupert gave the concerto its premiere performance on 3 April 1869 at the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen. Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in Christiania (now Oslo).

During 1868, Franz Liszt, who had not yet met Grieg, wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education, which resulted in Grieg&#x27;s obtaining a travel grant. The two men met in Rome in 1870. During Grieg&#x27;s first visit, they examined Grieg&#x27;s Violin Sonata No. 1, which pleased Liszt greatly. On his second visit in April, Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto, which Liszt proceeded to sightread (including the orchestral arrangement). Liszt&#x27;s rendition greatly impressed his audience, although Grieg said gently to him that he played the first movement too quickly. Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on orchestration (for example, to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet, which Grieg himself chose not to accept).

In the 1870s, he became friends with poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, who shared his interests in Norwegian self-government. Grieg set several of his poems to music, including &quot;Landkjenning&quot; and &quot;Sigurd Jorsalfar&quot;. Eventually, they decided on an opera based on King Olav Trygvason, but a dispute as to whether the music or lyrics should be created first led to Grieg being diverted to working on incidental music for Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, which naturally offended Bjørnson. Eventually, their friendship resumed.

The incidental music composed for &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; at the request of the author contributed to its success and separately became some of the composer&#x27;s most familiar music arranged as orchestral suites.

Grieg had close ties with the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra (Harmonien), and later became music director of the orchestra from 1880 to 1882. In 1888, Grieg met Tchaikovsky in Leipzig. Grieg was impressed by Tchaikovsky, who thought very highly of Grieg&#x27;s music, praising its beauty, originality and warmth.

On 6 December 1897, Grieg and his wife performed some of his music at a private concert at Windsor Castle for Queen Victoria and her court.

Grieg was awarded two honorary doctorates, first by the University of Cambridge in 1894 and the next from the University of Oxford in 1906.

===Later years===

The Norwegian government provided Grieg with a pension as he reached retirement age. During the spring of 1903, Grieg made nine 78-rpm gramophone recordings of his piano music in Paris. All of these discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs, despite limited fidelity. Grieg recorded player piano music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and Welte-Mignon reproducing system, all of which survive and can be heard today. He also worked with the Aeolian Company for its &#x27;Autograph Metrostyle&#x27; piano roll series wherein he indicated the tempo mapping for many of his pieces.

In 1899, Grieg cancelled his concerts in France in protest of the Dreyfus affair, an antisemitic scandal that was roiling French politics at the time. Regarding this scandal, Grieg had written that he hoped that the French might &quot;Soon return to the spirit of 1789, when the French republic declared that it would defend basic human rights.&quot; As a result of his statements concerning the affair, he became the target of much French hate mail that day.

During 1906, he met the composer and pianist Percy Grainger in London. Grainger was a great admirer of Grieg&#x27;s music and a strong empathy was quickly established. In a 1907 interview, Grieg stated: &quot;I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.&quot;

Edvard Grieg died at the Municipal Hospital in Bergen, Norway on 4 September 1907 at age 64 from heart failure. He had suffered a long period of illness. His last words were &quot;Well, if it must be so.&quot;

The funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people to the streets of his home town to honor him. Obeying his wish, his own &quot;Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak&quot; was played with orchestration by his friend Johan Halvorsen, who had married Grieg&#x27;s niece. In addition, the &quot;Funeral March&quot; movement from Chopin&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 2 was played. Grieg was cremated in the first Norwegian crematorium opened in Bergen just that year, and his ashes were entombed in a mountain crypt near his house, Troldhaugen. After the death of his wife, her ashes were placed alongside his.

Edvard Grieg and his wife were Unitarians and Nina attended the Unitarian church in Copenhagen after his death.

A century after his death, Grieg&#x27;s legacy extends beyond the field of music. There is a large sculpture of Grieg in Seattle, while one of the largest hotels in Bergen (his hometown) is named Quality Hotel Edvard Grieg and a large crater on the planet Mercury is named after Grieg.

==Music==
Some of Grieg&#x27;s early works include a symphony (which he later suppressed) and a piano sonata. He wrote three violin sonatas and a cello sonata.
Grieg composed the incidental music for Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, which includes the excerpts &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; and &quot;Morning Mood.&quot; In an 1874 letter to his friend Frants Beyer, Grieg expressed his unhappiness with &quot;Dance of the Mountain King&#x27;s Daughter,&quot; one of the movements in the &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; incidental music, writing &quot;I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King – something that I literally can&#x27;t bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies, exaggerated Norwegian nationalism, and trollish self-satisfaction! But I have a hunch that the irony will be discernible.&quot;

Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Holberg Suite&quot; was originally written for the piano, and later arranged by the composer for string orchestra. Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets Heinrich Heine, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Henrik Ibsen, Hans Christian Andersen, Rudyard Kipling and others. Russian composer Nikolai Myaskovsky used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet. Norwegian pianist Eva Knardahl recorded the composer&#x27;s complete piano music on 13 LPs for BIS Records from 1977 to 1980. The recordings were reissued during 2006 on 12 compact discs, also on BIS Records. Grieg himself recorded many of these piano works before his death in 1907. Pianist Bertha Tapper edited Grieg&#x27;s piano works for publication in America by Oliver Ditson.

<text>The Emancipation Proclamation, officially Proclamation 95, was a presidential proclamation and executive order issued by United States President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, during the American Civil War. The Proclamation had the effect of changing the legal status of more than 3.5 million enslaved African Americans in the secessionist Confederate states from enslaved to free. As soon as slaves escaped the control of their enslavers, either by fleeing to Union lines or through the advance of federal troops, they were permanently free. In addition, the Proclamation allowed for former slaves to &quot;be received into the armed service of the United States&quot;. The Emancipation Proclamation played a significant part in the end of slavery in the United States.

On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. Its third paragraph begins:

On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the final Emancipation Proclamation. It stated:

Lincoln then listed the ten states still in rebellion, excluding parts of states under Union control, and continued:

The proclamation provided that the executive branch, including the Army and Navy, &quot;will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons&quot;. Even though it excluded states not in rebellion, as well as parts of Louisiana and Virginia under Union control, it still applied to more than 3.5 million of the 4 million enslaved people in the country. Around 25,000 to 75,000 were immediately emancipated in those regions of the Confederacy where the US Army was already in place. It could not be enforced in the areas still in rebellion, but, as the Union army took control of Confederate regions, the Proclamation provided the legal framework for the liberation of more than three and a half million enslaved people in those regions by the end of the war. The Emancipation Proclamation outraged white Southerners and their sympathizers, who saw it as the beginning of a race war. It energized abolitionists, and undermined those Europeans who wanted to intervene to help the Confederacy. The Proclamation lifted the spirits of African Americans, both free and enslaved. It encouraged many to escape from slavery and flee toward Union lines, where many joined the Union Army. The Emancipation Proclamation became a historic document because it &quot;would redefine the Civil War, turning it [for the North] from a struggle [solely] to preserve the Union to one [also] focused on ending slavery, and set a decisive course for how the nation would be reshaped after that historic conflict.&quot;

The Emancipation Proclamation was never challenged in court. To ensure the abolition of slavery in all of the U.S., Lincoln also insisted that Reconstruction plans for Southern states require them to enact laws abolishing slavery (which occurred during the war in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana); Lincoln encouraged border states to adopt abolition (which occurred during the war in Maryland, Missouri, and West Virginia) and pushed for passage of the 13th Amendment. The Senate passed the 13th Amendment by the necessary two-thirds vote on April 8, 1864; the House of Representatives did so on January 31, 1865; and the required three-fourths of the states ratified it on December 6, 1865. The amendment made slavery and involuntary servitude unconstitutional, &quot;except as a punishment for a crime&quot;.

==Authority==

The United States Constitution of 1787 did not use the word &quot;slavery&quot; but included several provisions about unfree persons. The Three-Fifths Compromise (in Article I, Section 2) allocated congressional representation based &quot;on the whole Number of free Persons&quot; and &quot;three-fifths of all other Persons&quot;. Under the Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2), &quot;No person held to Service or Labour in one State&quot; would become legally free by escaping to another. Article I, Section 9 allowed Congress to pass legislation to outlaw the &quot;Importation of Persons&quot;, but not until 1808. However, for purposes of the Fifth Amendment—which states that, &quot;No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law&quot;—slaves were understood to be property. Although abolitionists used the Fifth Amendment to argue against slavery, it was made part of the legal basis for treating slaves as property by &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; (1857). Slavery was also supported in law and in practice by a pervasive culture of white supremacy. Nonetheless, between 1777 and 1804, every Northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery. No Southern state did so, and the slave population of the South continued to grow, peaking at almost four million people at the beginning of the Civil War, when most slave states sought to break away from the United States.

Lincoln understood that the federal government&#x27;s power to end slavery in peacetime was limited by the Constitution, which, before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. During the Civil War, however, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation under his authority as &quot;Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy&quot; under Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution. As such, in the Emancipation Proclamation he claimed to have the authority to free persons held as slaves in those states that were in rebellion &quot;as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion&quot;. In the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln said &quot;attention is hereby called&quot; to two 1862 statutes, namely &quot;An Act to Make an Additional Article of War&quot; and the Confiscation Act of 1862, but he didn&#x27;t mention any statute in the Final Emancipation Proclamation and, in any event, the source of his authority to issue the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and the Final Emancipation Proclamation was his &quot;joint capacity as President and Commander-in-Chief&quot;. Lincoln therefore did not have such authority over the four border slave-holding states that were not in rebellion—Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware—so those states were not named in the Proclamation. The fifth border jurisdiction, West Virginia, where slavery remained legal but was in the process of being abolished, was, in January 1863, still part of the legally recognized &quot;reorganized&quot; state of Virginia, based in Alexandria, which was in the Union (as opposed to the Confederate state of Virginia, based in Richmond).

==Coverage==

The Emancipation Proclamation did not free all slaves in the U.S., contrary to a common misconception; it applied in the ten states that were still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, but it did not cover the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slaveholding border states (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware) or in parts of Virginia and Louisiana that were no longer in rebellion. Those slaves were freed by later separate state and federal actions. The areas covered were &quot;Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana (except the Parishes of St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James, Ascension, Assumption, Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans, including the city of New Orleans), Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia (except the forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Ann, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth).&quot;

The state of Tennessee had already mostly returned to Union control, under a recognized Union government, so it was not named and was exempted. Virginia was named, but exemptions were specified for the 48 counties then in the process of forming the new state of West Virginia, and seven additional counties and two cities in the Union-controlled Tidewater region of Virginia. Also specifically exempted were New Orleans and 13 named parishes of Louisiana, which were mostly under federal control at the time of the Emancipation Proclamation. These exemptions left unemancipated an additional 300,000 slaves.

The Emancipation Proclamation has been ridiculed, notably by Richard Hofstadter, who wrote that it &quot;had all the moral grandeur of a bill of lading&quot; and &quot;declared free all slaves ... precisely where its effect could not reach&quot;. Disagreeing with Hofstadter, William W. Freehling wrote that Lincoln&#x27;s asserting his power as Commander-in-Chief to issue the proclamation &quot;reads not like an entrepreneur&#x27;s bill for past services but like a warrior&#x27;s brandishing of a new weapon&quot;.

The Emancipation Proclamation resulted in the emancipation of a substantial percentage of the slaves in the Confederate states as the Union armies advanced through the South and slaves escaped to Union lines, or slave owners fled, leaving slaves behind. The Emancipation Proclamation also committed the Union to ending slavery in addition to preserving the Union.

Although the Emancipation Proclamation resulted in the gradual freeing of most slaves, it did not make slavery illegal. Of the states that were exempted from the Emancipation Proclamation, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee, and West Virginia prohibited slavery before the war ended. In 1863, President Lincoln proposed a moderate plan for the Reconstruction of the captured Confederate State of Louisiana. Only 10 percent of the state&#x27;s electorate had to take the loyalty oath. The state was also required to accept the Emancipation Proclamation and abolish slavery in its new constitution. By December 1864, the Lincoln plan abolishing slavery had been enacted not only in Louisiana, but also in Arkansas and Tennessee. In Kentucky, Union Army commanders relied on the proclamation&#x27;s offer of freedom to slaves who enrolled in the Army and provided freedom for an enrollee&#x27;s entire family; for this and other reasons, the number of slaves in the state fell by more than 70 percent during the war. However, in Delaware and Kentucky, slavery continued to be legal until December 18, 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment went into effect.

==Background==
===Military action prior to emancipation===
The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required individuals to return runaway slaves to their owners. During the war, in May 1861, Union general Benjamin Butler declared that three slaves who escaped to Union lines were contraband of war, and accordingly he refused to return them, saying to a man who sought their return, &quot;I am under no constitutional obligations to a foreign country, which Virginia now claims to be&quot;. On May 30, after a cabinet meeting called by President Lincoln, &quot;Simon Cameron, the secretary of war, telegraphed Butler to inform him that his contraband policy &#x27;is approved.&#x27;&quot; This decision was controversial because it could have been taken to imply recognition of the Confederacy as a separate, independent sovereign state under international law, a notion that Lincoln steadfastly denied. In addition, as contraband, these people were legally designated as &quot;property&quot; when they crossed Union lines and their ultimate status was uncertain.

===Governmental action toward emancipation===

In December 1861, Lincoln sent his first annual message to Congress (the State of the Union Address, but then typically given in writing and not referred to as such). In it he praised the free labor system for respecting human rights over property rights; he endorsed legislation to address the status of contraband slaves and slaves in loyal states, possibly through buying their freedom with federal money; and he endorsed federal funding of voluntary colonization. In January 1862, Thaddeus Stevens, the Republican leader in the House, called for total war against the rebellion to include emancipation of slaves, arguing that emancipation, by forcing the loss of enslaved labor, would ruin the rebel economy. On March 13, 1862, Congress approved an Act Prohibiting the Return of Slaves, which prohibited &quot;All officers or persons in the military or naval service of the United States&quot; from returning fugitive slaves to their owners. Pursuant to a law signed by Lincoln, slavery was abolished in the District of Columbia on April 16, 1862, and owners were compensated.

On June 19, 1862, Congress prohibited slavery in all current and future United States territories (though not in the states), and President Lincoln quickly signed the legislation. This act effectively repudiated the 1857 opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case that Congress was powerless to regulate slavery in U.S. territories. It also rejected the notion of popular sovereignty that had been advanced by Stephen A. Douglas as a solution to the slavery controversy, while completing the effort first legislatively proposed by Thomas Jefferson in 1784 to confine slavery within the borders of existing states.

On August 6, 1861, the First Confiscation Act freed the slaves who were employed &quot;against the Government and lawful authority of the United States.&quot; On July 17, 1862, the Second Confiscation Act freed the slaves &quot;within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by forces of the United States.&quot; The Second Confiscation Act, unlike the First Confiscation Act, explicitly provided that all slaves covered by it would be permanently freed, stating in section 10 that &quot;all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of the United States, or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto, escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army; and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the United States; and all slaves of such person found on [or] being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the United States, shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves.&quot; However, Lincoln&#x27;s position continued to be that, although Congress lacked the power to free the slaves in rebel-held states, he, as commander in chief, could do so if he deemed it a proper military measure. By this time, in the summer of 1862, Lincoln had drafted the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he issued on September 22, 1862. It declared that, on January 1, 1863, he would free the slaves in states still in rebellion.

===Public opinion of emancipation===
Abolitionists had long been urging Lincoln to free all slaves. In the summer of 1862, Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; wrote a famous editorial entitled &quot;The Prayer of Twenty Millions&quot; demanding a more aggressive attack on the Confederacy and faster emancipation of the slaves: &quot;On the face of this wide earth, Mr. President, there is not one ... intelligent champion of the Union cause who does not feel ... that the rebellion, if crushed tomorrow, would be renewed if slavery were left in full vigor and that every hour of deference to slavery is an hour of added and deepened peril to the Union.&quot; Lincoln responded in his open of August 22, 1862:

Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer wrote about Lincoln&#x27;s letter: &quot;Unknown to Greeley, Lincoln composed this after he had already drafted a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he had determined to issue after the next Union military victory. Therefore, this letter, was in truth, an attempt to position the impending announcement in terms of saving the Union, not freeing slaves as a humanitarian gesture. It was one of Lincoln&#x27;s most skillful public relations efforts, even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator.&quot; Historian Richard Striner argues that &quot;for years&quot; Lincoln&#x27;s letter has been misread as &quot;Lincoln only wanted to save the Union.&quot; However, within the context of Lincoln&#x27;s entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong, according to Striner. Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both, at the same time. In effect, then, Lincoln may have already chosen the third option he mentioned to Greeley: &quot;freeing some and leaving others alone&quot;; that is, freeing slaves in the states still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, but leaving enslaved those in the border states and Union-occupied areas.

Nevertheless, in the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation itself, Lincoln said that he would recommend to Congress that it compensate states that &quot;adopt, immediate, or gradual abolishment of slavery&quot;. In addition, during the hundred days between September 22, 1862, when he issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, and January 1, 1863, when he issued the Final Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln took actions that suggest that he continued to consider the first option he mentioned to Greeley — saving the Union without freeing any slave — a possibility. Historian William W. Freehling wrote, &quot;From mid-October to mid-November 1862, he sent personal envoys to Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas&quot;. Each of these envoys carried with him a letter from Lincoln stating that if the people of their state desired &quot;to avoid the unsatisfactory&quot; terms of the Final Emancipation Proclamation &quot;and to have peace again upon the old terms&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, with slavery intact), they should rally &quot;the largest number of the people possible&quot; to vote in &quot;elections of members to the Congress of the United States ... friendly to their object&quot;. Later, in his Annual Message to Congress of December 1, 1862, Lincoln proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution providing that any state that abolished slavery before January 1, 1900, would receive compensation from the United States in the form of interest-bearing U.S. bonds. Adoption of this amendment, in theory, could have ended the war without ever permanently ending slavery, because the amendment provided, &quot;Any State having received bonds ... and afterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein, shall refund to the United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon&quot;.

In his 2014 book, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Gamble&quot;, journalist and historian Todd Brewster asserted that Lincoln&#x27;s desire to reassert the saving of the Union as his sole war goal was, in fact, crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation. Since slavery was protected by the Constitution, the only way that he could free the slaves was as a tactic of war—not as the mission itself. But that carried the risk that when the war ended, so would the justification for freeing the slaves. Late in 1862, Lincoln asked his Attorney General, Edward Bates, for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war-related proclamation of emancipation could be re-enslaved once the war was over. Bates had to work through the language of the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision to arrive at an answer, but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free. Still, a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment.

Conflicting advice as to whether to free the slaves was presented to Lincoln in public and private. Thomas Nast, a cartoon artist during the Civil War and the late 1800s considered &quot;Father of the American Cartoon&quot;, composed many works, including a two-sided spread that showed the transition from slavery into civilization after President Lincoln signed the Proclamation. Nast believed in equal opportunity and equality for all people, including enslaved Africans or free blacks. A mass rally in Chicago on September 7, 1862, demanded immediate and universal emancipation of slaves. A delegation headed by William W. Patton met the president at the White House on September 13. Lincoln had declared in peacetime that he had no constitutional authority to free the slaves. Even used as a war power, emancipation was a risky political act. Public opinion as a whole was against it. There would be strong opposition among Copperhead Democrats and an uncertain reaction from loyal border states. Delaware and Maryland already had a high percentage of free blacks: 91.2% and 49.7%, respectively, in 1860.

==Drafting and issuance of the proclamation==
Lincoln first discussed the proclamation with his cabinet in July 1862. He drafted his preliminary proclamation and read it to Secretary of State William Seward and Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, on July 13. Seward and Welles were at first speechless, then Seward referred to possible anarchy throughout the South and resulting foreign intervention; Welles apparently said nothing. On July 22, Lincoln presented it to his entire cabinet as something he had determined to do and he asked their opinion on wording. Although Secretary of War Edwin Stanton supported it, Seward advised Lincoln to issue the proclamation after a major Union victory, or else it would appear as if the Union was giving &quot;its last shriek of retreat&quot;. Walter Stahr, however, writes, &quot;There are contemporary sources, however, that suggest others were involved in the decision to delay&quot;, and Stahr quotes them.

In September 1862, the Battle of Antietam gave Lincoln the victory he needed to issue the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. In the battle, though the Union suffered heavier losses than the Confederates and General McClellan allowed the escape of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s retreating troops, Union forces turned back a Confederate invasion of Maryland, eliminating more than a quarter of Lee&#x27;s army in the process. This marked a turning point in the Civil War.

On September 22, 1862, five days after Antietam, and while residing at the Soldier&#x27;s Home, Lincoln called his cabinet into session and issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. According to Civil War historian James M. McPherson, Lincoln told cabinet members, &quot;I made a solemn vow before God, that if General Lee was driven back from Pennsylvania, I would crown the result by the declaration of freedom to the slaves.&quot; Lincoln had first shown an early draft of the proclamation to Vice President Hannibal Hamlin, an ardent abolitionist, who was more often kept in the dark on presidential decisions. Lincoln issued the final proclamation, as he had promised in the preliminary proclamation, on January 1, 1863. Although implicitly granted authority by Congress, Lincoln used his powers as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy to issue the proclamation &quot;as a necessary war measure.&quot; Therefore, it was not the equivalent of a statute enacted by Congress or a constitutional amendment, because Lincoln or a subsequent president could revoke it. One week after issuing the final Proclamation, Lincoln wrote to Major General John McClernand: &quot;After the commencement of hostilities I struggled nearly a year and a half to get along without touching the &#x27;institution&#x27;; and when finally I conditionally determined to touch it, I gave a hundred days fair notice of my purpose, to all the States and people, within which time they could have turned it wholly aside, by simply again becoming good citizens of the United States. They chose to disregard it, and I made the peremptory proclamation on what appeared to me to be a military necessity. And being made, it must stand&quot;. Lincoln continued, however, that the states included in the proclamation could &quot;adopt systems of apprenticeship for the colored people, conforming substantially to the most approved plans of gradual emancipation; and ... they may be nearly as well off, in this respect, as if the present trouble had not occurred&quot;. He concluded by asking McClernand not to &quot;make this letter public&quot;.

Initially, the Emancipation Proclamation effectively freed only a small percentage of the slaves, namely those who were behind Union lines in areas not exempted. Most slaves were still behind Confederate lines or in exempted Union-occupied areas. Secretary of State William H. Seward commented, &quot;We show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free.&quot; Had any slave state ended its secession attempt before January 1, 1863, it could have kept slavery, at least temporarily. The Proclamation freed the slaves only in areas of the South that were still in rebellion on January 1, 1863. But as the Union army advanced into the South, slaves fled to behind its lines, and &quot;[s]hortly after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, the Lincoln administration lifted the ban on enticing slaves into Union lines.&quot; These events contributed to the destruction of slavery.

The Emancipation Proclamation also allowed for the enrollment of freed slaves into the United States military. During the war nearly 200,000 black men, most of them ex-slaves, joined the Union Army. Their contributions were significant in winning the war. The Confederacy did not allow slaves in their army as soldiers until the last month before its defeat.

Though the counties of Virginia that were soon to form West Virginia were specifically exempted from the Proclamation (Jefferson County being the only exception), a condition of the state&#x27;s admittance to the Union was that its constitution provide for the gradual abolition of slavery (an immediate emancipation of all slaves was also adopted there in early 1865). Slaves in the border states of Maryland and Missouri were also emancipated by separate state action before the Civil War ended. In Maryland, a new state constitution abolishing slavery in the state went into effect on November 1, 1864. The Union-occupied counties of eastern Virginia and parishes of Louisiana, which had been exempted from the Proclamation, both adopted state constitutions that abolished slavery in April 1864. In early 1865, Tennessee adopted an amendment to its constitution prohibiting slavery.

==Implementation==

The Proclamation was issued in a preliminary version and a final version. The former, issued on September 22, 1862, was a preliminary announcement outlining the intent of the latter, which took effect 100 days later on January 1, 1863, during the second year of the Civil War. The preliminary Emancipation Proclamation was Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s declaration that all slaves would be permanently freed in all areas of the Confederacy that were still in rebellion on January 1, 1863. The ten affected states were individually named in the final Emancipation Proclamation (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina). Not included were the Union slave states of Maryland, Delaware, Missouri and Kentucky. Also not named was the state of Tennessee, in which a Union-controlled military government had already been set up, based in the capital, Nashville. Specific exemptions were stated for areas also under Union control on January 1, 1863, namely 48 counties that would soon become West Virginia, seven other named counties of Virginia including Berkeley and Hampshire counties, which were soon added to West Virginia, New Orleans and 13 named parishes nearby.

Union-occupied areas of the Confederate states where the proclamation was put into immediate effect by local commanders included Winchester, Virginia, Corinth, Mississippi, the Sea Islands along the coasts of the Carolinas and Georgia, Key West, Florida, and Port Royal, South Carolina.

===Immediate impact===
On New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1862, African Americans – enslaved and free – gathered across the United States to hold Watch Night ceremonies for &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Eve&quot;, looking toward the stroke of midnight and the promised fulfillment of the Proclamation. It has been inaccurately claimed that the Emancipation Proclamation did not free a single slave; historian Lerone Bennett Jr. alleged that the proclamation was a hoax deliberately designed not to free any slaves. However, as a result of the Proclamation, most slaves became free during the course of the war, beginning on the day it took effect; eyewitness accounts at places such as Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, and Port Royal, South Carolina record celebrations on January 1 as thousands of blacks were informed of their new legal status of freedom. &quot;Estimates of the number of slaves freed immediately by the Emancipation Proclamation are uncertain. One contemporary estimate put the &#x27;contraband&#x27; population of Union-occupied North Carolina at 10,000, and the Sea Islands of South Carolina also had a substantial population. Those 20,000 slaves were freed immediately by the Emancipation Proclamation.&quot; This Union-occupied zone where freedom began at once included parts of eastern North Carolina, the Mississippi Valley, northern Alabama, the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, a large part of Arkansas, and the Sea Islands of Georgia and South Carolina. Although some counties of Union-occupied Virginia were exempted from the Proclamation, the lower Shenandoah Valley and the area around Alexandria were covered. Emancipation was immediately enforced as Union soldiers advanced into the Confederacy. Slaves fled their masters and were often assisted by Union soldiers.
On the other hand, Robert Gould Shaw wrote to his mother on September 25, 1862, &quot;So the &#x27;Proclamation of Emancipation&#x27; has come at last, or rather, its forerunner. I suppose you all are very much excited about it. For my part, I can&#x27;t see what &quot;practical&quot; good it can do now. Wherever our army has been, there remain no slaves, and the Proclamation will not free them where we don&#x27;t go.&quot; Ten days later, he wrote her again, &quot;Don&#x27;t imagine, from what I said in my last that I thought Mr. Lincoln&#x27;s &#x27;Emancipation Proclamation&#x27; not right ... but still, as a &quot;war-measure&quot;, I don&#x27;t see the immediate benefit of it, ... as the slaves are &quot;sure&quot; of being free at any rate, with or without an Emancipation Act.&quot;

Booker T. Washington, as a boy of 9 in Virginia, remembered the day in early 1865:


Runaway slaves who had escaped to Union lines had previously been held by the Union Army as &quot;contraband of war&quot; under the Confiscation Acts. The Sea Islands off the coast of Georgia had been occupied by the Union Navy earlier in the war. The whites had fled to the mainland while the blacks stayed. An early program of Reconstruction was set up for the former slaves, including schools and training. Naval officers read the proclamation and told them they were free.

Slaves had been part of the &quot;engine of war&quot; for the Confederacy. They produced and prepared food; sewed uniforms; repaired railways; worked on farms and in factories, shipping yards, and mines; built fortifications; and served as hospital workers and common laborers. News of the Proclamation spread rapidly by word of mouth, arousing hopes of freedom, creating general confusion, and encouraging thousands to escape to Union lines. George Washington Albright, a teenage slave in Mississippi, recalled that like many of his fellow slaves, his father escaped to join Union forces. According to Albright, plantation owners tried to keep news of the Proclamation from slaves, but they learned of it through the grapevine. The young slave became a &quot;runner&quot; for an informal group they called the &quot;4Ls&quot; (&quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Legal Loyal League&quot;) bringing news of the proclamation to secret slave meetings at plantations throughout the region.

Confederate general Robert E. Lee saw the Emancipation Proclamation as a way for the Union to increase the number of soldiers it could place on the field, making it imperative for the Confederacy to increase its own numbers. Writing on the matter after the sack of Fredericksburg, Lee wrote, &quot;In view of the vast increase of the forces of the enemy, of the savage and brutal policy he has proclaimed, which leaves us no alternative but success or degradation worse than death, if we would save the honor of our families from pollution [and] our social system from destruction, let every effort be made, every means be employed, to fill and maintain the ranks of our armies, until God in his mercy shall bless us with the establishment of our independence.&quot;

The Emancipation Proclamation marked a significant turning point in the war as it made the goal of the North not only preserving the Union, but also freeing the slaves. The Proclamation also rallied support from abolitionists and Europeans, while encouraging enslaved individuals to escape to the North. This weakened the South&#x27;s labor force while bolstering the North&#x27;s ranks.

===Political impact===


The Proclamation was immediately denounced by Copperhead Democrats, who opposed the war and advocated restoring the union by allowing slavery. Horatio Seymour, while running for governor of New York, cast the Emancipation Proclamation as a call for slaves to commit extreme acts of violence on all white southerners, saying it was &quot;a proposal for the butchery of women and children, for scenes of lust and rapine, and of arson and murder, which would invoke the interference of civilized Europe&quot;. The Copperheads also saw the Proclamation as an unconstitutional abuse of presidential power. Editor Henry A. Reeves wrote in Greenport&#x27;s &quot;Republican Watchman&quot; that &quot;In the name of freedom for Negroes, [the proclamation] imperils the liberty of white men; to test an utopian theory of equality of races which Nature, History and Experience alike condemn as monstrous, it overturns the Constitution and Civil Laws and sets up Military Usurpation in their stead.&quot;

Racism remained pervasive on both sides of the conflict and many in the North supported the war only as an effort to force the South to stay in the Union. The promises of many Republican politicians that the war was to restore the Union and not about black rights or ending slavery were declared lies by their opponents, who cited the Proclamation. In Columbiana, Ohio, Copperhead David Allen told a crowd, &quot;Now fellow Democrats I ask you if you are going to be forced into a war against your Britheren of the Southern States for the Negro. I answer No!&quot; The Copperheads saw the Proclamation as irrefutable proof of their position and the beginning of a political rise for their members; in Connecticut, H. B. Whiting wrote that the truth was now plain even to &quot;those stupid thickheaded persons who persisted in thinking that the President was a conservative man and that the war was for the restoration of the Union under the Constitution.&quot;

War Democrats, who rejected the Copperhead position within their party, found themselves in a quandary. While throughout the war they had continued to espouse the racist positions of their party and their disdain of the concerns of slaves, they did see the Proclamation as a viable military tool against the South and worried that opposing it might demoralize troops in the Union army. The question would continue to trouble them and eventually lead to a split within their party as the war progressed.

Lincoln further alienated many in the Union two days after issuing the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation by suspending habeas corpus. His opponents linked these two actions in their claims that he was becoming a despot. In light of this and a lack of military success for the Union armies, many War Democrat voters who had previously supported Lincoln turned against him and joined the Copperheads in the off-year elections held in October and November.

In the 1862 elections, the Democrats gained 28 seats in the House as well as the governorship of New York. Lincoln&#x27;s friend Orville Hickman Browning told the president that the Proclamation and the suspension of habeas corpus had been &quot;disastrous&quot; for his party by handing the Democrats so many weapons. Lincoln made no response. Copperhead William Jarvis of Connecticut pronounced the election the &quot;beginning of the end of the utter downfall of Abolitionism&quot;.

Historians James M. McPherson and Allan Nevins state that though the results looked very troubling, they could be seen favorably by Lincoln; his opponents did well only in their historic strongholds and &quot;at the national level their gains in the House were the smallest of any minority party&#x27;s in an off-year election in nearly a generation. Michigan, California, and Iowa all went Republican... Moreover, the Republicans picked up five seats in the Senate.&quot; McPherson states, &quot;If the election was in any sense a referendum on emancipation and on Lincoln&#x27;s conduct of the war, a majority of Northern voters endorsed these policies.&quot;

====Confederate response====

The initial Confederate response was outrage. The Proclamation was seen as vindication of the rebellion and proof that Lincoln would have abolished slavery even if the states had remained in the Union. It intensified the fear of slaves revolting and undermined morale, especially spurring fear among slave owners who saw it as a threat to their business. In an August 1863 letter to President Lincoln, U.S. Army general Ulysses S. Grant observed that the proclamation&#x27;s &quot;arming the negro&quot;, together with &quot;the emancipation of the negro, is the heavyest [&quot;sic&quot;] blow yet given the Confederacy. The South rave a greatdeel [&quot;sic&quot;] about it and profess to be very angry.&quot; In May 1863, a few months after the Proclamation took effect, the Confederacy passed a law demanding &quot;full and ample retaliation&quot; against the U.S. for such measures. The Confederacy stated that black U.S. soldiers captured while fighting against the Confederacy would be tried as slave insurrectionists in civil courts—a capital offense with an automatic sentence of death. Less than a year after the law&#x27;s passage, the Confederates massacred black U.S. soldiers at Fort Pillow.

Confederate President Jefferson Davis reacted to the Emancipation Proclamation with outrage and in an address to the Confederate Congress on January 12 threatened to send any U.S. military officer captured in Confederate territory covered by the proclamation to state authorities to be charged with &quot;exciting servile insurrection&quot;, which was a capital offense.

Confederate General Robert E. Lee called the Proclamation a &quot;savage and brutal policy he has proclaimed, which leaves us no alternative but success or degradation worse than death.&quot;

However, some Confederates welcomed the Proclamation, because they believed it would strengthen pro-slavery sentiment in the Confederacy and thus lead to greater enlistment of white men into the Confederate army. According to one Confederate cavalry sergeant from Kentucky, &quot;The Proclamation is worth three hundred thousand soldiers to our Government at least... It shows exactly what this war was brought about for and the intention of its damnable authors.&quot; Even some Union soldiers concurred with this view and expressed reservations about the Proclamation, not on principle, but rather because they were afraid it would increase the Confederacy&#x27;s determination to fight on and maintain slavery. One Union soldier from New York stated worryingly after the Proclamation&#x27;s issuance, &quot;I know enough of the southern spirit that I think they will fight for the institution of slavery even to extermination.&quot;

As a result of the Proclamation, the price of slaves in the Confederacy increased in the months after its issuance, with one Confederate from South Carolina opining in 1865 that &quot;now is the time for Uncle to buy some negro women and children...&quot;

===International impact===
As Lincoln had hoped, the proclamation turned foreign popular opinion in favor of the Union by gaining the support of anti-slavery countries and countries that had already abolished slavery (especially the developed countries in Europe such as the United Kingdom and France). This shift ended the Confederacy&#x27;s hopes of gaining official recognition.

Since the Emancipation Proclamation made the eradication of slavery an explicit Union war goal, it linked support for the South to support for slavery. Public opinion in Britain would not tolerate support for slavery. As Henry Adams noted, &quot;The Emancipation Proclamation has done more for us than all our former victories and all our diplomacy.&quot; In Italy, Giuseppe Garibaldi hailed Lincoln as &quot;the heir of the aspirations of John Brown&quot;. On August 6, 1863, Garibaldi wrote to Lincoln: &quot;Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure&quot;.

Mayor Abel Haywood, a representative for workers from Manchester, England, wrote to Lincoln saying, &quot;We joyfully honor you for many decisive steps toward practically exemplifying your belief in the words of your great founders: &#x27;All men are created free and equal.&#x27;&quot; The Emancipation Proclamation served to ease tensions with Europe over the North&#x27;s conduct of the war, and combined with the recent failed Southern offensive at Antietam, to remove any practical chance for the Confederacy to receive foreign military intervention in the war.

However, in spite of the Emancipation Proclamation, arms sales to the Confederacy through blockade running, from British firms and dealers, continued, with knowledge of the British government. The Confederacy was able to sustain the fight for two more years largely thanks to the weapons supplied by British blockade runners. As a result, the blockade runners operating from Britain were responsible for killing 400,000 additional soldiers and civilians on both sides.

==Gettysburg Address==
Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address on November 19, 1863 made indirect reference to the Proclamation and the ending of slavery as a war goal with the phrase &quot;new birth of freedom&quot;. The Proclamation solidified Lincoln&#x27;s support among the rapidly growing abolitionist elements of the Republican Party and ensured that they would not block his renomination in 1864.

==Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction (1863)==
In December 1863, Lincoln issued his &quot;Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction&quot;, which dealt with the ways the rebel states could reconcile with the Union. Key provisions required that the states accept the Emancipation Proclamation and thus the freedom of their slaves, and accept the Confiscation Acts, as well as the Act banning slavery in United States territories.

==Postbellum==
Near the end of the war, abolitionists were concerned that the Emancipation Proclamation would be construed solely as a war measure, as Lincoln intended, and would no longer apply once fighting ended. They also were increasingly anxious to secure the freedom of all slaves, not just those freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Thus pressed, Lincoln staked a large part of his 1864 presidential campaign on a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery throughout the United States. Lincoln&#x27;s campaign was bolstered by votes in both Maryland and Missouri to abolish slavery in those states. Maryland&#x27;s new constitution abolishing slavery took effect on November 1, 1864. Slavery in Missouri ended on January 11, 1865, when a state convention approved an ordinance abolishing slavery by a vote of 60-4, and later the same day, Governor Thomas C. Fletcher followed up with his own &quot;Proclamation of Freedom.&quot;

Winning re-election, Lincoln pressed the lame duck 38th Congress to pass the proposed amendment immediately rather than wait for the incoming 39th Congress to convene. In January 1865, Congress sent to the state legislatures for ratification what became the Thirteenth Amendment, banning slavery in all U.S. states and territories, except as punishment for a crime. The amendment was ratified by the legislatures of enough states by December 6, 1865, and proclaimed 12 days later. There were approximately 40,000 slaves in Kentucky and 1,000 in Delaware who were liberated then.

==Critiques==

Lincoln&#x27;s proclamation has been called &quot;one of the most radical emancipations in the history of the modern world.&quot; Nonetheless, as over the years American society continued to be deeply unfair towards black people, cynicism towards Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation increased. One attack was Lerone Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s White Dream&quot; (2000), which claimed that Lincoln was a white supremacist who issued the Emancipation Proclamation in lieu of the real racial reforms for which radical abolitionists pushed. To this, one scholarly review states that &quot;Few Civil War scholars take Bennett and DiLorenzo seriously, pointing to their narrow political agenda and faulty research.&quot; In his &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation&quot;, Allen C. Guelzo noted professional historians&#x27; lack of substantial respect for the document, since it has been the subject of few major scholarly studies. He argued that Lincoln was the U.S.&#x27;s &quot;last Enlightenment politician&quot; and as such had &quot;allegiance to &#x27;reason, cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason&#x27;... But the most important among the Enlightenment&#x27;s political virtues for Lincoln, and for his Proclamation, was prudence&quot;.

Other historians have given more credit to Lincoln for what he accomplished toward ending slavery and for his own growth in political and moral stature. More might have been accomplished if he had not been assassinated. As Eric Foner wrote:
Lincoln was not an abolitionist or Radical Republican, a point Bennett reiterates innumerable times. He did not favor immediate abolition before the war, and held racist views typical of his time. But he was also a man of deep convictions when it came to slavery, and during the Civil War displayed a remarkable capacity for moral and political growth.

Kal Ashraf wrote:
Perhaps in rejecting the critical dualism—Lincoln as individual emancipator pitted against collective self-emancipators—there is an opportunity to recognise the greater persuasiveness of the combination. In a sense, yes: a racist, flawed Lincoln did something heroic, and not in lieu of collective participation, but next to, and enabled, by it. To venerate a singular &#x27;Great Emancipator&#x27; may be as reductive as dismissing the significance of Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;actions&quot;. Who he was as a man, no one of us can ever really know. So it is that the version of Lincoln we keep is also the version we make.

==Legacy in the civil rights era==

===Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.===
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. made many references to the Emancipation Proclamation during the civil rights movement. These include an &quot;Emancipation Proclamation Centennial Address&quot; he gave in New York City on September 12, 1962, in which he placed the Proclamation alongside the Declaration of Independence as an &quot;imperishable&quot; contribution to civilization and added, &quot;All tyrants, past, present and future, are powerless to bury the truths in these declarations...&quot; He lamented that despite a history where the United States &quot;proudly professed the basic principles inherent in both documents,&quot; it &quot;sadly practiced the antithesis of these principles.&quot; He concluded, &quot;There is but one way to commemorate the Emancipation Proclamation. That is to make its declarations of freedom real; to reach back to the origins of our nation when our message of equality electrified an unfree world, and reaffirm democracy by deeds as bold and daring as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.&quot;

King&#x27;s most famous invocation of the Emancipation Proclamation was in a speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom (often referred to as the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech). King began the speech saying &quot;Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.&quot;

====The &quot;Second Emancipation Proclamation&quot;====

In the early 1960s, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates called on President John F. Kennedy to bypass Southern segregationist opposition in the Congress by issuing an executive order to put an end to segregation. This envisioned document was referred to as the &quot;Second Emancipation Proclamation&quot;. Kennedy, however, did not issue a second Emancipation Proclamation &quot;and noticeably avoided all centennial celebrations of emancipation.&quot; Historian David W. Blight points out that, although the idea of an executive order to act as a second Emancipation Proclamation &quot;has been virtually forgotten,&quot; the manifesto that King and his associates produced calling for an executive order showed his &quot;close reading of American politics&quot; and recalled how moral leadership could have an effect on the American public through an executive order. Despite its failure &quot;to spur a second Emancipation Proclamation from the White House, it was an important and emphatic attempt to combat the structured forgetting of emancipation latent within Civil War memory.&quot;

===President John F. Kennedy===
On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy spoke on national television about civil rights. Kennedy, who had been routinely criticized as timid by some civil rights activists, reminded Americans that two black students had been peacefully enrolled in the University of Alabama with the aid of the National Guard, despite the opposition of Governor George Wallace.

John Kennedy called it a &quot;moral issue.&quot; Invoking the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation he said,

In the same speech, Kennedy announced he would introduce a comprehensive civil rights bill in the United States Congress, which he did a week later. Kennedy pushed for its passage until he was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Historian Peniel E. Joseph holds Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s ability to get that bill, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, signed into law on July 2, 1964, to have been aided by &quot;the moral forcefulness of the June 11 speech&quot;, which had turned &quot;the narrative of civil rights from a regional issue into a national story promoting racial equality and democratic renewal.&quot;

===President Lyndon B. Johnson===
During the civil rights movement of the 1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson invoked the Emancipation Proclamation, holding it up as a promise yet to be fully implemented.

As vice president, while speaking from Gettysburg on May 30, 1963 (Memorial Day), during the centennial year of the Emancipation Proclamation, Johnson connected it directly with the ongoing civil rights struggles of the time, saying &quot;One hundred years ago, the slave was freed. One hundred years later, the Negro remains in bondage to the color of his skin... In this hour, it is not our respective races which are at stake—it is our nation. Let those who care for their country come forward, North and South, white and Negro, to lead the way through this moment of challenge and decision... Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with color of men&#x27;s skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact. To the extent that the proclamation of emancipation is not fulfilled in fact, to that extent we shall have fallen short of assuring freedom to the free.&quot;

As president, Johnson again invoked the proclamation in a speech presenting the Voting Rights Act at a joint session of Congress on Monday, March 15, 1965. This was one week after violence had been inflicted on peaceful civil rights marchers during the Selma to Montgomery marches. Johnson said &quot;it&#x27;s not just Negroes, but really it&#x27;s all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome. As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil, I know how agonizing racial feelings are. I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society. But a century has passed—more than 100 years—since the Negro was freed. And he is not fully free tonight. It was more than 100 years ago that Abraham Lincoln—a great President of another party—signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact. A century has passed—more than 100 years—since equality was promised, and yet the Negro is not equal. A century has passed since the day of promise, and the promise is unkept. The time of justice has now come, and I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back. It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come, and when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the 1963 episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Andy Discovers America&quot;, Andy asks Barney to explain the Emancipation Proclamation to Opie who is struggling with history at school. Barney brags about his history expertise, yet it is apparent he cannot answer Andy&#x27;s question. He finally becomes frustrated and explains it is a proclamation for certain people who wanted emancipation. In addition, the Emancipation Proclamation was also a main item of discussion in the movie &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012) directed by Steven Spielberg.

The Emancipation Proclamation is celebrated around the world, including on stamps of nations such as the Republic of Togo. The United States commemorative was issued on August 16, 1963, the opening day of the Century of Negro Progress Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Designed by Georg Olden, an initial printing of 120 million stamps was authorized.

<doc id="9516" wikidata="Q14060" url="?curid=9516" title="Erwin Rommel">
<text>Johannes Erwin Eugen Rommel (; 15 November 1891 – 14 October 1944), popularly known as The Desert Fox (, ), was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (field marshal) during World War II. He served in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (armed forces) of Nazi Germany, as well as in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; of the Weimar Republic, and the army of Imperial Germany.

Rommel was a highly decorated officer in World War I and was awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; for his actions on the Italian Front. In 1937, he published his classic book on military tactics, &quot;Infantry Attacks&quot;, drawing on his experiences in that war. In World War II, he commanded the 7th Panzer Division during the 1940 invasion of France. His leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African campaign established his reputation as one of the ablest tank commanders of the war, and earned him the nickname &quot;der Wüstenfuchs&quot;, &quot;the Desert Fox&quot;. Among his British adversaries he had a reputation for chivalry, and his phrase &quot;war without hate&quot; has been uncritically used to describe the North African campaign. A number of historians have since rejected the phrase as a myth and uncovered numerous examples of German war crimes and abuses towards enemy soldiers and native populations in Africa during the conflict. Other historians note that there is no clear evidence Rommel was involved in or aware of these crimes, with some pointing out that the war in the desert, as fought by Rommel and his opponents, still came as close to a clean fight as there was in World War II. He later commanded the German forces opposing the Allied cross-channel invasion of Normandy in June 1944.

After the Nazis gained power in Germany, Rommel gradually accepted the new regime. Historians have given different accounts of the specific period and his motivations. He was a supporter of Adolf Hitler, at least until near the end of the war, if not necessarily sympathetic to the party and the paramilitary forces associated with it. In 1944, Rommel was implicated in the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. Because of Rommel&#x27;s status as a national hero, Hitler wanted to eliminate him quietly instead of having him immediately executed, as many other plotters were. Rommel was given a choice between suicide, in return for assurances that his reputation would remain intact and that his family would not be persecuted following his death, or facing a trial that would result in his disgrace and execution; he chose the former and took a cyanide pill. Rommel was given a state funeral, and it was announced that he had succumbed to his injuries from the strafing of his staff car in Normandy.

Rommel became a larger-than-life figure in both Allied and Nazi propaganda, and in postwar popular culture. Numerous authors portray him as an apolitical, brilliant commander and a victim of Nazi Germany, although other authors have contested this assessment and called it the &quot;Rommel myth&quot;. Rommel&#x27;s reputation for conducting a clean war was used in the interest of the West German rearmament and reconciliation between the former enemies – the United Kingdom and the United States on one side and the new Federal Republic of Germany on the other. Several of Rommel&#x27;s former subordinates, notably his chief of staff Hans Speidel, played key roles in German rearmament and integration into NATO in the postwar era. The German Army&#x27;s largest military base, the Field Marshal Rommel Barracks, Augustdorf, and a third ship of Lütjens-class destroyer of the German Navy are both named in his honour. His son Manfred Rommel was the longtime mayor of Stuttgart, Germany and namesake of Stuttgart Airport.

== Early life and career ==
Rommel was born on 15 November 1891 in Heidenheim, from Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg, Southern Germany, then part of the German Empire. He was the third of five children to Erwin Rommel Senior (1860–1913) and his wife Helene von Luz. Her father, Karl von Luz, headed the local government council. As a young man, Rommel&#x27;s father had been an artillery lieutenant. Rommel had one older sister who was an art teacher and his favourite sibling, one older brother named Manfred who died in infancy, and two younger brothers, of whom one became a successful dentist and the other an opera singer.

At age 18, Rommel joined the Württemberg Infantry Regiment No. 124 in Weingarten as a &quot;Fähnrich&quot; (ensign), in 1910, studying at the Officer Cadet School in Danzig. He graduated in November 1911 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in January 1912 and was assigned to the 124th Infantry in Weingarten. He was posted to Ulm in March 1914 to the 49th Field Artillery Regiment, XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps, as a battery commander. He returned to the 124th when war was declared. While at Cadet School, Rommel met his future wife, 17-year-old Lucia (Lucie) Maria Mollin (1894–1971), of Italian and Polish descent.

== World War I ==
During World War I, Rommel fought in France as well as in the Romanian (notably at the Second Battle of the Jiu Valley) and Italian campaigns. He successfully employed the tactics of penetrating enemy lines with heavy covering fire coupled with rapid advances, as well as moving forward rapidly to a flanking position to arrive at the rear of hostile positions, to achieve tactical surprise. His first combat experience was on 22 August 1914 as a platoon commander near Verdun, when – catching a French garrison unprepared – Rommel and three men opened fire on them without ordering the rest of his platoon forward. The armies continued to skirmish in open engagements throughout September, as the static trench warfare typical of the First World War was still in the future. For his actions in September 1914 and January 1915, Rommel was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class. Rommel was promoted to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; (first lieutenant) and transferred to the newly created Royal Wurttemberg Mountain Battalion of the &quot;Alpenkorps&quot; in September 1915, as a company commander. In November 1916 in Danzig, Rommel and Lucia married.

In August 1917, his unit was involved in the battle for Mount Cosna, a heavily fortified objective on the border between Hungary and Romania, which they took after two weeks of difficult uphill fighting. The Mountain Battalion was next assigned to the Isonzo front, in a mountainous area in Italy. The offensive, known as the Battle of Caporetto, began on 24 October 1917. Rommel&#x27;s battalion, consisting of three rifle companies and a machine gun unit, was part of an attempt to take enemy positions on three mountains: Kolovrat, Matajur, and Stol. In two and a half days, from 25 to 27 October, Rommel and his 150 men captured 81 guns and 9,000 men (including 150 officers), at a loss of six dead and 30 wounded. Rommel achieved this remarkable success by taking advantage of the terrain to outflank the Italian forces, attacking from unexpected directions or behind enemy lines, and taking the initiative to attack when he had orders to the contrary. In one instance, the Italian forces, taken by surprise and believing that their lines had collapsed, surrendered after a brief firefight. In this battle, Rommel helped pioneer infiltration tactics, a new form of manoeuvre warfare just being adopted by German armies, and later by foreign armies, and later described by some as Blitzkrieg without tanks. But he played no role in the early adoption of Blitzkrieg in World War II.

Acting as advance guard in the capture of Longarone on 9 November, Rommel again decided to attack with a much smaller force. Convinced that they were surrounded by an entire German division, the 1st Italian Infantry Division – 10,000 men – surrendered to Rommel. For this and his actions at Matajur, he received the order of Pour le Mérite.

In January 1918, Rommel was promoted to &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (captain) and assigned to a staff position in the 64th Army Corps, where he served for the remainder of the war.

== Between the wars ==
Rommel remained with the 124th Regiment until October 1920. The regiment was involved in quelling riots and civil disturbances that were occurring throughout Germany at this time. Wherever possible, Rommel avoided the use of force in these confrontations. In 1919, he was briefly sent to Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, where he restored order by &quot;sheer force of personality&quot; in the 32nd Internal Security Company, which was composed of rebellious and pro-communist sailors. He decided against storming the nearby city of Lindau, which had been taken by revolutionary communists. Instead, Rommel negotiated with the city council and managed to return it to the legitimate government through diplomatic means. This was followed by his defence of Schwäbisch Gmünd, again bloodless. He was then posted to the Ruhr, where a Red Army was responsible for fomenting unrest. Historian praises Rommel as a coolheaded and moderate mind, exceptional amid the many takeovers of revolutionary cities by regular and irregular units and the associated massive violence.

According to Reuth, this period gave Rommel the indelible impression that &quot;Everyone in this Republic was fighting each other&quot;, along with the direct experience of people who attempted to convert Germany into a socialist republic on Soviet lines. There are similarities with Hitler&#x27;s experiences: like Rommel, Hitler had known the solidarity of trench warfare and then had participated in the Reichswehr&#x27;s suppression of the First and Second Bavarian Soviet Republics. The need for national unity thus became a decisive legacy of the first World War. Brighton notes that while both believed in the Stab-in-the-back myth, Rommel was able to succeed using peaceful methods because he saw the problem as related to economic problems and empty stomachs, rather than to Judeo-Bolshevism – which right-wing soldiers such as Hitler blamed for the chaos in Germany.

On 1 October 1920, Rommel was appointed to a company command with the 13th Infantry Regiment in Stuttgart, a post he held for the next nine years. He was then assigned to an instruction position at the Dresden Infantry School from 1929 to 1933; during this time, in April 1932, he was promoted to major. While at Dresden, he wrote a manual on infantry training, published in 1934. In October 1933, he was promoted to &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; (lieutenant colonel) and given his next command, the 3rd &quot;Jäger&quot; Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, stationed at Goslar. Here he first met Hitler, who inspected his troops on 30 September 1934.

In September 1935, Rommel was moved to the War Academy in Potsdam as an instructor, serving for the next three years. His book &quot;Infanterie greift an&quot; (&quot;Infantry Attacks&quot;), a description of his wartime experiences along with his analysis, was published in 1937. It became a best-seller, which, according to Scheck, later &quot;enormously influenced&quot; many armies of the world. Adolf Hitler was one of many people who owned a copy.

Hearing of Rommel&#x27;s reputation as an outstanding military instructor, in February 1937 Hitler assigned him as the War Ministry liaison officer to the Hitler Youth in charge of military training. Here Rommel clashed with Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler Youth leader, over the training that the boys should receive. Trying to fulfil a mission assigned to him by the Ministry of War, Rommel had twice proposed a plan that would have effectively subordinated Hitler Youth to the army, removing it from NSDAP control. That went against Schirach&#x27;s express wishes. Schirach appealed directly to Hitler; consequently, Rommel was quietly removed from the project in 1938. He had been promoted to &quot;Oberst&quot; (colonel), on 1 August 1937, and in 1938, following the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, he was appointed commandant of the Theresian Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt.

In October 1938, Hitler specially requested that Rommel be seconded to command the &quot;Führerbegleitbatallion&quot; (his escort battalion). This unit accompanied Hitler whenever he travelled outside of Germany. During this period, Rommel indulged his interest in engineering and mechanics by learning about the inner workings and maintenance of internal combustion engines and heavy machine guns. He memorised logarithm tables in his spare time, and enjoyed skiing and other outdoor sports. Ian F. Beckett writes that by 1938, Rommel drifted towards uncritical acceptance of Nazi regime, quoting Rommel&#x27;s letter to his wife in which he stated &quot;The German Wehrmacht is the sword of the new German world view&quot;, as a reaction to a speech by Hitler.

During his visit to Switzerland in 1938, Rommel reported that Swiss soldiers who he met showed &quot;remarkable understanding of our Jewish problem&quot;. American writer and Rommel biographer Daniel Allen Butler comments that he did share the view (popular in Germany and many European countries during that time) that as a people, the Jews were loyal to themselves rather than the nations in which they lived. Despite this fact, other pieces of evidence show that he considered the Nazi racial ideologies to be rubbish. Historian Alaric Searle comments that Rommel knew the official stand of the regime, but in this case, the phrase was ambiguous and there is no evidence after or before this event that he ever sympathised with the antisemitism of the Nazi movement. Rommel&#x27;s son Manfred Rommel stated in the documentary &quot;The Real Rommel&quot;, released in 2001 by Channel 4, that his father would &quot;look the other way&quot; when faced with anti-Jewish violence on the streets. But, according to the documentary, Rommel requested proof of &quot;Aryan descent&quot; from the Italian boyfriend of his illegitimate daughter Gertrud. According to Remy, during the time Rommel was posted in Goslar, he repeatedly clashed with the SA whose members terrorised the Jews and dissident Goslar citizens. After the Röhm Purge, he mistakenly believed that the worst was over, although restrictions on Jewish businesses were still being imposed and agitation against their community continued. According to Remy, Manfred Rommel recounts that his father knew about and privately disagreed with the government&#x27;s antisemitism, but by this time, he had not actively campaigned on behalf of the Jews. However, Uri Avnery notes that even when Rommel was a low-ranking officer, he protected the Jews who lived in his district. Manfred Rommel tells the &quot;Stuttgarter Nachrichten&quot; that their family lived in isolated military lands but knew about the discrimination against the Jews which was occurring on the outside. They could not foresee the enormity of the impending atrocities, about which they only knew much later.

At one point, Rommel wrote to his wife that Hitler had a &quot;magnetic, maybe hypnotic, strength&quot; that had its origin in Hitler&#x27;s belief that he &quot;was called upon by God&quot;, and Hitler sometimes &quot;spoke from the depth of his being [...] like a prophet&quot;.

== World War II ==
=== Poland 1939 ===
Rommel was promoted to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; on 23 August 1939 and assigned as commander of the &quot;Führerbegleitbatallion&quot;, tasked with guarding Hitler and his field headquarters during the invasion of Poland, which began on 1 September. According to Remy, Rommel&#x27;s private letters at this time show that he did not understand Hitler&#x27;s true nature and intentions, as he quickly went from predicting a swift peaceful settlement of tensions to approving Hitler&#x27;s reaction (&quot;bombs will be retaliated with bombs&quot;) to the Gleiwitz incident (a false flag operation staged by Hitler and used as a pretext for the invasion). Hitler took a personal interest in the campaign, often moving close to the front in the &quot;Führersonderzug&quot; (headquarters train). Rommel attended Hitler&#x27;s daily war briefings and accompanied him everywhere, making use of the opportunity to observe first-hand the use of tanks and other motorised units. On 26 September Rommel returned to Berlin to set up a new headquarters for his unit in the Reich Chancellery. Rommel briefly returned to occupied Warsaw on 5 October in order to prepare for the German victory parade. In a letter to his wife he claimed that the occupation by Nazi Germany was &quot;probably welcomed with relief&quot; by the inhabitants of the ruined city and that they were &quot;rescued&quot;.

Following the invasion of Poland, Rommel began lobbying for command of one of Germany&#x27;s panzer divisions, of which there were then only ten. Rommel&#x27;s successes in World War I were based on surprise and manoeuvre, two elements for which the new panzer units were ideally suited. Rommel received a promotion to a general&#x27;s rank from Hitler ahead of more senior officers. Rommel obtained the command he aspired to, despite having been earlier turned down by the army&#x27;s personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division instead. According to Peter Caddick-Adams, he was backed by Hitler, the influential Fourteenth Army commander Wilhelm List (a fellow Württemberger middle-class &quot;military outsider&quot;) and likely Heinz Guderian, the commander of XIX Army Corps, as well.

Going against military protocol, this promotion added to Rommel&#x27;s growing reputation as one of Hitler&#x27;s favoured commanders, although his later outstanding leadership in France quelled complaints about his self-promotion and political scheming. The 7th Panzer Division had recently been converted to an armoured division consisting of 218 tanks in three battalions (thus, one tank regiment, instead of the two assigned to a standard panzer division), with two rifle regiments, a motorcycle battalion, an engineer battalion, and an anti-tank battalion. Upon taking command on 10 February 1940, Rommel quickly set his unit to practising the manoeuvres they would need in the upcoming campaign.

==== Invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium and France ====

The invasion began on 10 May 1940. By the third day Rommel and the advance elements of his division, together with a detachment of the 5th Panzer Division, had reached the Meuse, where they found the bridges had already been destroyed (Guderian and Georg-Hans Reinhardt reached the river on the same day). Rommel was active in the forward areas, directing the efforts to make a crossing, which were initially unsuccessful because of suppressive fire by the French on the other side of the river. Rommel brought up tanks and flak units to provide counter-fire and had nearby houses set on fire to create a smokescreen. He sent infantry across in rubber boats, appropriated the bridging tackle of the 5th Panzer Division, personally grabbed a light machine gun to fight off a French counterattack supported by tanks, and went into the water himself, encouraging the sappers and helping lash together the pontoons. By 16 May Rommel reached Avesnes, and contravening orders, he pressed on to Cateau. That night, the French II Army Corps was shattered and on 17 May, Rommel&#x27;s forces took 10,000 prisoners, losing 36 men in the process. He was surprised to find out only his vanguard had followed his tempestuous surge. The High Command and Hitler had been extremely nervous about his disappearance, although they awarded him the Knight&#x27;s Cross. Rommel&#x27;s (and Guderian&#x27;s) successes and the new possibilities offered by the new tank arm were welcomed by a small number of generals, but worried and paralysed the rest.

On 20 May, Rommel reached Arras. General Hermann Hoth received orders that the town should be bypassed and its British garrison thus isolated. He ordered the 5th Panzer Division to move to the west and the 7th Panzer Division to the east, flanked by the SS Division Totenkopf. The following day, the British launched a counterattack in the Battle of Arras. It failed and the British withdrew.

On 24 May, &quot;Generaloberst&quot; (Colonel General) Gerd von Rundstedt and &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Günther von Kluge issued a halt order, which Hitler approved. The reason for this decision is still a matter of debate. The halt order was lifted on 26 May. 7th Panzer continued its advance, reaching Lille on 27 May. The Siege of Lille continued until 31 May, when the French garrison of 40,000 men surrendered. Rommel was summoned to Berlin to meet with Hitler. He was the only divisional commander present at the planning session for &quot;Fall Rot&quot; (Case Red), the second phase of the invasion of France. By this time the Dunkirk evacuation was complete; over 338,000 Allied troops had been evacuated across the Channel, though they had to leave behind all their heavy equipment and vehicles.

==== Drive for the Channel ====

Rommel, resuming his advance on 5 June, drove for the River Seine to secure the bridges near Rouen. Advancing in two days, the division reached Rouen to find it defended by three French tanks which managed to destroy a number of German tanks before being taken out. The German force, enraged by this resistance, forbade fire brigades access to the burning district of the old Norman capital, and as a result, most of the historic quarter was reduced to ashes. According to David Fraser, Rommel instructed the German artillery to bombard the city as a &quot;fire demonstration&quot;. According to one witness report, the smoke from burning Rouen was intense enough that it reached Paris. Daniel Allen Butler states that the bridges to the city were already destroyed. After the fall of the city, both black civilians and colonial troops were summarily executed on 9 June by unknown German units. The number of black civilians and prisoners killed is estimated at 100. According to Butler and Showalter, Rouen fell to the 5th Panzer Division, while Rommel advanced from the Seine towards the Channel. On 10 June, Rommel reached the coast near Dieppe, sending Hoth the message &quot;Bin an der Küste&quot; (&quot;Am on the coast&quot;). On 17 June, 7th Panzer was ordered to advance on Cherbourg, where additional British evacuations were under way. The division advanced in 24 hours, and after two days of shelling, the French garrison surrendered on 19 June. The speed and surprise that it was consistently able to achieve, to the point at which both the enemy and the &quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; (OKH; German &quot;High Command of the Army&quot;) at times lost track of its whereabouts, earned the 7th Panzers the nickname &quot;Gespensterdivision&quot; (&quot;ghost division&quot;).

After the armistice with the French was signed on 22 June, the division was placed in reserve, being sent first to the Somme and then to Bordeaux to re-equip and prepare for &quot;Unternehmen Seelöwe&quot; (Operation Sea Lion), the planned invasion of Britain. This invasion was later cancelled, as Germany was not able to acquire the air superiority needed for a successful outcome, while the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; was massively outnumbered by the Royal Navy.

=== North Africa 1941–1943 ===

On 6 February 1941, Rommel was appointed commander of the new Afrika Korps (&quot;Deutsches Afrika Korps&quot;; DAK), consisting of the 5th Light Division (later renamed 21st Panzer Division) and of the 15th Panzer Division. He was promoted to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; three days later and flew to Tripoli on 12 February. The DAK had been sent to Libya in Operation Sonnenblume to support Italian troops who had been roundly defeated by British Commonwealth forces in Operation Compass. His efforts in the Western Desert Campaign earned Rommel the nickname the &quot;Desert Fox&quot; from journalists on both sides of the war. Allied troops in Africa were commanded by General Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief, Middle East Command.

==== First Axis offensive ====
Rommel and his troops were technically subordinate to Italian commander-in-chief General Italo Gariboldi. Disagreeing with the orders of the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW, German armed forces high command) to assume a defensive posture along the front line at Sirte, Rommel resorted to subterfuge and insubordination to take the war to the British. According to Remy, the General Staff tried to slow him down but Hitler encouraged him to advance—an expression of the conflict that had existed between Hitler and the army leadership since the invasion of Poland. He decided to launch a limited offensive on 24 March with the 5th Light Division, supported by two Italian divisions. This thrust was not anticipated by the British, who had Ultra intelligence showing that Rommel had orders to remain on the defensive until at least May when the 15th Panzer Division were due to arrive.

The British Western Desert Force had meanwhile been weakened by the transfer in mid-February of three divisions for the Battle of Greece. They fell back to Mersa El Brega and started constructing defensive works. After a day of fierce fighting on 31 March, the Germans captured Mersa El Brega. Splitting his force into three groups, Rommel resumed the advance on 3 April. Benghazi fell that night as the British pulled out of the city. Gariboldi, who had ordered Rommel to stay in Mersa El Brega, was furious. Rommel was equally forceful in his response, telling Gariboldi, &quot;One cannot permit unique opportunities to slip by for the sake of trifles.&quot; A signal arrived from General Franz Halder reminding Rommel that he was to halt in Mersa El Brega. Knowing Gariboldi could not speak German, Rommel told him the message gave him complete freedom of action. Gariboldi backed down. Throughout the campaign, fuel supply was problematic, as no petrol was available locally; it had to be brought from Europe by tanker and then carried by road to where it was needed. Food and fresh water were also in short supply, and it was difficult to move tanks and other equipment off-road through the sand. Cyrenaica was captured by 8 April, except for the port city of Tobruk, which was besieged on 11 April.

==== Siege of Tobruk ====

The siege of Tobruk was not technically a siege, as the defenders were still able to move supplies and reinforcements into the city via the port. Rommel knew that by capturing the port he could greatly reduce the length of his supply lines and increase his overall port capacity, which was insufficient even for day-to-day operations and only half that needed for offensive operations. The city, which had been heavily fortified by the Italians during their 30-year occupation, was garrisoned by 36,000 Commonwealth troops, commanded by Australian Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead. Hoping to catch the defenders off-guard, Rommel launched a failed attack on 14 April.

Rommel requested reinforcements, but the OKW, then completing preparations for Operation Barbarossa, refused. General Friedrich Paulus, head of the Operations Branch of the OKH, arrived on 25 April to review the situation. He was present for a second failed attack on the city on 30 April. On 4 May, Paulus ordered that no further attempts should be made to take Tobruk via a direct assault. Following a failed counter-attack in Operation Brevity in May, Wavell launched Operation Battleaxe on 15 June; this attack was also defeated. The defeat resulted in Churchill replacing Wavell with General Claude Auchinleck as theatre commander.

In August, Rommel was appointed commander of the newly created Panzer Army Africa, with Fritz Bayerlein as his chief of staff. The Afrika Korps, comprising the 15th Panzer Division and the 5th Light Division, now reinforced and redesignated 21st Panzer Division, was put under command of Generalleutnant Ludwig Crüwell. In addition to the Afrika Korps, Rommel&#x27;s Panzer Group had the 90th Light Division and four Italian divisions, three infantry divisions investing Tobruk, and one holding Bardia. The two Italian armoured divisions, formed into the Italian XX Motorized Corps under the command of General Gastone Gambara, were under Italian control. Two months later Hitler decided he must have German officers in better control of the Mediterranean theatre, and appointed Field Marshal Albert Kesselring as Commander in Chief, South. Kesselring was ordered to get control of the air and sea between Africa and Italy.

Following his success in Battleaxe, Rommel returned his attention to the capture of Tobruk. He made preparations for a new offensive, to be launched between 15 and 20 November. Meanwhile, Auchinleck reorganised Allied forces and strengthened them to two corps, XXX and XIII, which formed the British Eighth Army. It was placed under the command of Alan Cunningham. Auchinleck launched Operation Crusader, a major offensive to relieve Tobruk, on 18 November 1941. Rommel reluctantly decided on 20 November to call off his planned attack on Tobruk.
In four days of heavy fighting, the Eighth Army lost 530 tanks and Rommel only 100. Wanting to exploit the British halt and their apparent disorganisation, on 24 November Rommel counterattacked near the Egyptian border in an operation that became known as the &quot;dash to the wire&quot;. Cunningham asked Auchinleck for permission to withdraw into Egypt, but Auchinleck refused and soon replaced Cunningham as commander of the Eighth Army with Major General Neil Ritchie. The German counterattack stalled as it outran its supplies and met stiffening resistance, and was criticised by the German High Command and some of Rommel&#x27;s staff officers.

While Rommel drove into Egypt, the remaining Commonwealth forces east of Tobruk threatened the weak Axis lines there. Unable to reach Rommel for several days, Rommel&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Siegfried Westphal, ordered the 21st Panzer Division to withdraw to support the siege of Tobruk. On 27 November, the British attack on Tobruk linked up with the defenders, and Rommel, having suffered losses that could not easily be replaced, had to concentrate on regrouping the divisions that had attacked into Egypt. By 7 December, Rommel fell back to a defensive line at Gazala, just west of Tobruk, all the while under heavy attack from the Desert Air Force. The Allies kept up the pressure, and Rommel was forced to retreat all the way back to the starting positions he had held in March, reaching El Agheila in December 1941. The British had retaken almost all of Cyrenaica, but Rommel&#x27;s retreat dramatically shortened his supply lines.

==== Battle of Gazala and capture of Tobruk ====

On 5 January 1942, the Afrika Korps received 55 tanks and new supplies and Rommel started planning a counterattack, which he launched on 21 January. Caught by surprise, the Allies lost over 110 tanks and other heavy equipment. The Axis forces retook Benghazi on 29 January and Timimi on 3 February, with the Allies pulling back to a defensive line just before the Tobruk area south of the coastal town of Gazala. Between December 1941 and June 1942, Rommel had excellent information about the disposition and intentions of the Commonwealth forces. Bonner Fellers, US military attaché in Egypt, was sending detailed reports to the US State Department using a compromised code.

Following Kesselring&#x27;s successes in creating local air superiority around the British naval and air bases at Malta in April 1942, an increased flow of supplies reached the Axis forces in Africa. With his forces strengthened, Rommel contemplated a major offensive operation for the end of May. He knew the British were planning offensive operations as well, and he hoped to pre-empt them. Early in the afternoon of 26 May 1942, Rommel attacked first and the Battle of Gazala commenced. Under the cover of darkness, the bulk of Rommel&#x27;s motorised and armoured forces drove south to skirt the left flank of the British, coming up behind them and attacking to the north the following morning.

On 30 May, Rommel resumed the offensive, and on 1 June, Rommel accepted the surrender of some 3,000 Commonwealth soldiers. On 6 June, Rommel&#x27;s forces assaulted the Free French strongpoint in the Battle of Bir Hakeim, but the defenders continued to thwart the attack until finally evacuating on 10 June. Rommel then shifted his attack north; threatened with being completely cut off, the British began a retreat eastward toward Egypt on 14 June, the so-called &quot;Gazala Gallop&quot;.

The assault on Tobruk proper began at dawn on 20 June, and the British surrendered at dawn the following day. Rommel&#x27;s forces captured 32,000 Commonwealth troops, the port, and huge quantities of supplies. Only at the fall of Singapore, earlier that year, had more British Commonwealth troops been captured at one time. On 22 June, Hitler promoted Rommel to Generalfeldmarschall for this victory. Following his success at Gazala and Tobruk, Rommel wanted to seize the moment and not allow the 8th Army a chance to regroup. He strongly argued that the Panzerarmee should advance into Egypt and drive on to Alexandria and the Suez Canal, as this would place almost all the Mediterranean coastline in Axis hands and, according to Rommel, potentially lead to the capture from the south of the oil fields in the Caucasus and Middle East.

Rommel&#x27;s success at Tobruk worked against him, as Hitler no longer felt it was necessary to proceed with Operation Herkules, the proposed attack on Malta. Auchinleck relieved Ritchie of command of the Eighth Army on 25 June, and temporarily took command himself. Rommel knew that delay would only benefit the British, who continued to receive supplies at a faster rate than Rommel could hope to achieve. He pressed an attack on the heavily fortified town of Mersa Matruh, which Auchinleck had designated as the fall-back position, surrounding it on 28 June. The fortress fell to the Germans on 29 June. In addition to stockpiles of fuel and other supplies, the British abandoned hundreds of tanks and trucks. Those that were functional were put into service by the Panzerarmee which by now relied on British trucks for half its transport.

==== El Alamein ====
===== First Battle of El Alamein =====

Rommel continued his pursuit of the Eighth Army, which had fallen back to heavily prepared defensive positions at El Alamein. This region is a natural choke point, where the Qattara Depression creates a relatively short line to defend that could not be outflanked to the south because of the steep escarpment. During this time Germans prepared numerous propaganda postcards and leaflets for the Egyptian and Syrian populations urging them to &quot;chase English out of the cities&quot;, warning them about &quot;Jewish peril&quot; and with one leaflet printed in 296,000 copies and aimed at Syria stating among others

On 1 July, the First Battle of El Alamein began. Rommel had around 100 available tanks. The Allies were able to achieve local air superiority, with heavy bombers attacking the 15th and 21st Panzers, who had also been delayed by a sandstorm. The 90th Light Division veered off course and were pinned down by South African artillery fire. Rommel continued to attempt to advance for two more days, but repeated sorties by the Desert Air Force meant he could make no progress. On 3 July, he wrote in his diary that his strength had &quot;faded away&quot;. Attacks by 21st Panzer on 13 and 14 July were repulsed, and an Australian attack on 16–17 July was held off with difficulty. Throughout the first half of July, Auchinleck concentrated attacks on the Italian 60th Infantry Division Sabratha at Tel el Eisa. The ridge was captured by the 26th Australian Brigade on 16 July. Both sides suffered similar losses throughout the month, but the Axis supply situation remained less favourable. Rommel realised that the tide was turning. A break in the action took place at the end of July as both sides rested and regrouped.

Preparing for a renewed drive, the British replaced Auchinleck with General Harold Alexander on 8 August. Bernard Montgomery was made the new commander of the Eighth Army that same day. The Eighth Army had initially been assigned to General William Gott, but he was killed when his plane was shot down on 7 August. Rommel knew that a British convoy carrying over 100,000 tons of supplies was due to arrive in September. He decided to launch an attack at the end of August with the 15th and 21st Panzer Division, 90th Light Division, and the Italian XX Motorized Corps in a drive through the southern flank of the El Alamein lines. Expecting an attack sooner rather than later, Montgomery fortified the Alam el Halfa ridge with the 44th Division, and positioned the 7th Armoured Division about to the south.

===== Battle of Alam El Halfa =====

The Battle of Alam el Halfa was launched on 30 August. The terrain left Rommel with no choice but to follow a similar tactic as he had at previous battles: the bulk of the forces attempted to sweep around from the south while secondary attacks were launched on the remainder of the front. It took much longer than anticipated to get through the minefields in the southern sector, and the tanks got bogged down in unexpected patches of quicksand (Montgomery had arranged for Rommel to acquire a falsified map of the terrain). Under heavy fire from British artillery and aircraft, and in the face of well-prepared positions that Rommel could not hope to outflank for lack of fuel, the attack stalled. By 2 September, Rommel realised the battle was unwinnable, and decided to withdraw.

On the night of 3 September, the 2nd New Zealand Division and 7th Armoured Division positioned to the north engaged in an assault, but they were repelled in a fierce rearguard action by the 90th Light Division. Montgomery called off further action to preserve his strength and allow for further desert training for his forces. In the attack, Rommel had suffered 2,940 casualties and lost 50 tanks, a similar number of guns, and 400 lorries, vital for supplies and movement. The British losses, except tank losses of 68, were much less, further adding to the numerical inferiority of Panzer Army Africa. The Desert Air Force inflicted the highest proportions of damage on Rommel&#x27;s forces. He now realised the war in Africa could not be won. Physically exhausted and suffering from a liver infection and low blood pressure, Rommel flew home to Germany to recover his health. General Georg Stumme was left in command in Rommel&#x27;s absence.

===== Second Battle of El Alamein =====


Improved decoding by British intelligence (see Ultra) meant that the Allies had advance knowledge of virtually every Mediterranean convoy, and only 30 per cent of shipments were getting through. In addition, Mussolini diverted supplies intended for the front to his garrison at Tripoli and refused to release any additional troops to Rommel. The increasing Allied air superiority and lack of fuel meant Rommel was forced to take a more defensive posture than he would have liked for the second Battle of El Alamein. The German defences to the west of the town included a minefield deep with the main defensive line—itself several thousand yards deep—to its west. This, Rommel hoped, would allow his infantry to hold the line at any point until motorised and armoured units in reserve could move up and counterattack any Allied breaches. The British offensive began on 23 October. Stumme, in command in Rommel&#x27;s absence, died of an apparent heart attack while examining the front on 24 October, and Rommel was ordered to return from his medical leave, arriving on the 25th. Montgomery&#x27;s intention was to clear a narrow path through the minefield at the northern part of the defences, at the area called Kidney Ridge, with a feint to the south. By the end of 25 October, the 15th Panzer, the defenders in this sector, had only 31 serviceable tanks remaining of their initial force of 119. Rommel brought the 21st Panzer and Ariete Divisions north on 26 October, to bolster the sector. On 28 October, Montgomery shifted his focus to the coast, ordering his 1st and 10th Armoured Divisions to attempt to swing around and cut off Rommel&#x27;s line of retreat. Meanwhile, Rommel concentrated his attack on the Allied salient at Kidney Ridge, inflicting heavy losses. However, Rommel had only 150 operational tanks remaining, and Montgomery had 800, many of them Shermans.

Montgomery, seeing his armoured brigades losing tanks at an alarming rate, stopped major attacks until the early hours of 2 November, when he opened Operation Supercharge, with a massive artillery barrage. Due to heavy losses in tanks, towards the end of the day, Rommel ordered his forces to disengage and begin to withdraw. At midnight, he informed the OKW of his decision, and received a reply directly from Hitler the following afternoon: he ordered Rommel and his troops to hold their position to the last man. Rommel, who believed that the lives of his soldiers should never be squandered needlessly, was stunned. Rommel initially complied with the order, but after discussions with Kesselring and others, he issued orders for a retreat on 4 November. The delay proved costly in terms of his ability to get his forces out of Egypt. He later said the decision to delay was what he most regretted from his time in Africa. Meanwhile, the British 1st and 7th Armoured Division had broken through the German defences and were preparing to swing north and surround the Axis forces. On the evening of the 4th, Rommel finally received word from Hitler authorising the withdrawal.

==== End of Africa campaign ====
As Rommel attempted to withdraw his forces before the British could cut off his retreat, he fought a series of delaying actions. Heavy rains slowed movements and grounded the Desert Air Force, which aided the withdrawal, yet Rommel&#x27;s troops were under pressure from the pursuing Eighth Army and had to abandon the trucks of the Italian forces, leaving them behind. Rommel continued to retreat west, aiming for &#x27;Gabes gap&#x27; in Tunisia. Kesselring strongly criticised Rommel&#x27;s decision to retreat all the way to Tunisia, as each airfield the Germans abandoned extended the range of the Allied bombers and fighters. Rommel defended his decision, pointing out that if he tried to assume a defensive position the Allies would destroy his forces and take the airfields anyway; the retreat saved the lives of his remaining men and shortened his supply lines. By now, Rommel&#x27;s remaining forces fought in reduced-strength combat groups, whereas the Allied forces had great numerical superiority and control of the air. On his arrival in Tunisia, Rommel noted with some bitterness the reinforcements, including the 10th Panzer Division, arriving in Tunisia following the Allied invasion of Morocco.

Having reached Tunisia, Rommel launched an attack against the U.S. II Corps which was threatening to cut his lines of supply north to Tunis. Rommel inflicted a sharp defeat on the American forces at the Kasserine Pass in February, his last battlefield victory of the war, and his first engagement against the United States Army.

Rommel immediately turned back against the British forces, occupying the Mareth Line (old French defences on the Libyan border). While Rommel was at Kasserine at the end of January 1943, the Italian General Giovanni Messe was appointed commander of Panzer Army Africa, renamed the Italo-German Panzer Army in recognition of the fact that it consisted of one German and three Italian corps. Though Messe replaced Rommel, he diplomatically deferred to him, and the two coexisted in what was theoretically the same command. On 23 February Army Group Afrika was created with Rommel in command. It included the Italo-German Panzer Army under Messe (renamed 1st Italian Army) and the German 5th Panzer Army in the north of Tunisia under General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim.

The last Rommel offensive in North Africa was on 6 March 1943, when he attacked the Eighth Army at the Battle of Medenine. The attack was made with 10th, 15th, and 21st Panzer Divisions. Alerted by Ultra intercepts, Montgomery deployed large numbers of anti-tank guns in the path of the offensive. After losing 52 tanks, Rommel called off the assault. On 9 March he returned to Germany. Command was handed over to General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim. Rommel never returned to Africa. The fighting there continued for another two months, until 13 May 1943, when Messe surrendered the army group to the Allies.

=== Italy 1943 ===
On 23 July 1943, Rommel was moved to Greece as commander of Army Group E to counter a possible British invasion. He arrived in Greece on 25 July but was recalled to Berlin the same day following Mussolini&#x27;s dismissal from office. This caused the German High Command to review the defensive integrity of the Mediterranean and it was decided that Rommel should be posted to Italy as commander of the newly formed Army Group B. On 16 August 1943, Rommel&#x27;s headquarters moved to Lake Garda in northern Italy and he formally assumed command of the group, consisting of the 44th Infantry Division, the 26th Panzer Division and the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler. When Italy announced its armistice with the Allies on 8 September, Rommel&#x27;s group took part in Operation Achse, disarming the Italian forces.

Hitler met with Rommel and Kesselring to discuss future operations in Italy on 30 September 1943. Rommel insisted on a defensive line north of Rome, while Kesselring was more optimistic and advocated holding a line south of Rome. Hitler preferred Kesselring&#x27;s recommendation, and therefore revoked his previous decision for the subordination of Kesselring&#x27;s forces to Rommel&#x27;s army group. On 19 October, Hitler decided that Kesselring would be the overall commander of the forces in Italy, sidelining Rommel.

Rommel had wrongly predicted that the collapse of the German line in Italy would be fast. On 21 November, Hitler gave Kesselring overall command of the Italian theatre, moving Rommel and Army Group B to Normandy in France with responsibility for defending the French coast against the long-anticipated Allied invasion.

=== Atlantic Wall 1944 ===

On 4 November 1943, Rommel became General Inspector of the Western Defences. He was given a staff that befitted an army group commander, and the powers to travel, examine and make suggestions on how to improve the defences. Hitler, who was having a disagreement with him over military matters, intended to use Rommel as a psychological trump card.

There was broad disagreement in the German High Command as to how best to meet the expected Allied invasion of Northern France. The Commander-in-Chief West, Gerd von Rundstedt, believed there was no way to stop the invasion near the beaches because of the Allied navies&#x27; firepower, as had been experienced at Salerno. He argued that the German armour should be held in reserve well inland near Paris, where they could be used to counter-attack in force in a more traditional military doctrine. The allies could be allowed to extend themselves deep into France, where a battle for control would be fought, allowing the Germans to envelop the allied forces in a pincer movement, cutting off their avenue of retreat. He feared the piecemeal commitment of their armoured forces would cause them to become caught in a battle of attrition which they could not hope to win.

The notion of holding the armour inland to use as a mobile reserve force from which they could mount a powerful counterattack applied the classic use of armoured formations as seen in France in 1940. These tactics were still effective on the Eastern Front, where control of the air was important but did not dominate the action. Rommel&#x27;s own experiences at the end of the North African campaign revealed to him that the Germans would not be able to preserve their armour from air attack for this type of mass assault. Rommel believed their only opportunity would be to oppose the landings directly at the beaches, and to counterattack there before the invaders could become well-established. Though there had been some defensive positions established and gun emplacements made, the Atlantic Wall was a token defensive line. Rundstedt had confided to Rommel that it was for propaganda purposes only.

Upon arriving in Northern France, Rommel was dismayed by the lack of completed works. According to Ruge, Rommel was in a staff position and could not issue orders, but he made every effort to explain his plan to commanders down to the platoon level, who took up his words eagerly, but &quot;more or less open&quot; opposition from the above slowed down the process. Rundstedt intervened and supported Rommel&#x27;s request for being made a commander. It was granted on 15 January 1944.

He and his staff set out to improve the fortifications along the Atlantic Wall with great energy and engineering skill. This was a compromise: Rommel now commanded the 7th and 15th armies; he also had authority over a 20-kilometre-wide strip of coastal land between Zuiderzee and the mouth of the Loire. The chain of command was convoluted: the air force and navy had their own chiefs, as did the South and Southwest France and the Panzer group; Rommel also needed Hitler&#x27;s permission to use the tank divisions. Rommel had millions of mines laid and thousands of tank traps and obstacles set up on the beaches and throughout the countryside, including in fields suitable for glider aircraft landings, the so-called Rommel&#x27;s asparagus (the Allies would later counter these with Hobart&#x27;s Funnies). In April 1944, Rommel promised Hitler that the preparations would be complete by 1 May, a promise he failed to deliver. By the time of the Allied invasion, the preparations were far from finished. The quality of some of the troops manning them was poor and many bunkers lacked sufficient stocks of ammunition.

Rundstedt expected the Allies to invade in the Pas-de-Calais because it was the shortest crossing point from Britain, its port facilities were essential to supplying a large invasion force, and the distance from Calais to Germany was relatively short. Rommel and Hitler&#x27;s views on the matter are a matter of debate between authors, with both seeming to change their positions.
Hitler vacillated between the two strategies. In late April, he ordered the I SS Panzer Corps placed near Paris, far enough inland to be useless to Rommel, but not far enough for Rundstedt. Rommel moved those armoured formations under his command as far forward as possible, ordering General Erich Marcks, commanding the 84th Corps defending the Normandy section, to move his reserves into the frontline. Rundstedt was willing to delegate a majority of the responsibilities to Rommel (the central reserve was Rundstedt&#x27;s idea but he did not oppose some form of coastal defence), Rommel&#x27;s strategy of an armour-supported coastal defence line was opposed by some officers, most notably Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg, who was supported by Guderian. Hitler compromised and gave Rommel three divisions (the 2nd, the 21st and the 116th Panzer), let Rundstedt retain four and turned the other three to Army Group G, pleasing no one.

The Allies staged elaborate deceptions for D-Day (see Operation Fortitude), giving the impression that the landings would be at Calais. Although Hitler himself expected a Normandy invasion for a while, Rommel and most Army commanders in France believed there would be two invasions, with the main invasion coming at the Pas-de-Calais. Rommel drove defensive preparations all along the coast of Northern France, particularly concentrating on fortification building in the River Somme estuary. By D-Day on 6 June 1944 nearly all the German staff officers, including Hitler&#x27;s staff, believed that Pas-de-Calais was going to be the main invasion site, and continued to believe so even after the landings in Normandy had occurred.
The 5 June storm in the channel seemed to make a landing very unlikely, and a number of the senior officers left their units for training exercises and various other efforts. On 4 June the chief meteorologist of the 3 Air Fleet reported that weather in the channel was so poor there could be no landing attempted for two weeks. Rommel left France on 5 June, and on the next day he was at home celebrating his wife&#x27;s 50th birthday. He was recalled and returned to his headquarters at 10pm. Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Rundstedt had requested the reserves be transferred to his command. At 10am Keitel advised that Hitler declined to release the reserves but that Rundstedt could move the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend closer to the coast, with the Panzer-Lehr-Division placed on standby. Later in the day, Rundstedt received authorisation to move additional units in preparation for a counterattack, which Rundstedt decided to launch on 7 June. Upon arrival, Rommel concurred with the plan. By nightfall, Rundstedt, Rommel and Speidel continued to believe that the Normandy landing might have been a diversionary attack, as the Allied deception measures still pointed towards Calais. The 7 June counterattack did not take place because Allied air bombardments prevented the 12th SS&#x27;s timely arrival. All this made the German command structure in France in disarray during the opening hours of the D-Day invasion.

The Allies secured five beachheads by nightfall of 6 June, landing 155,000 troops. The Allies pushed ashore and expanded their beachhead despite strong German resistance. Rommel believed that if his armies pulled out of range of Allied naval fire, it would give them a chance to regroup and re-engage them later with a better chance of success. While he managed to convince Rundstedt, they still needed to win over Hitler. At a meeting with Hitler at his Wolfsschlucht II headquarters in Margival in northern France on 17 June, Rommel warned Hitler about the inevitable collapse in the German defences but was rebuffed and told to focus on military operations.

By mid-July the German position was crumbling. On 17 July 1944, as Rommel was returning from visiting the headquarters of the I SS Panzer Corps, a fighter plane piloted by either Charley Fox of 412 Squadron RCAF, Jacques Remlinger of No. 602 Squadron RAF, or Johannes Jacobus le Roux of No. 602 Squadron RAF strafed his staff car near Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery. The driver sped up and attempted to get off the main roadway, but a 20 mm round shattered his left arm, causing the vehicle to veer off the road and crash into trees. Rommel was thrown from the car, suffering injuries to the left side of his face from glass shards and three fractures to his skull. He was hospitalised with major head injuries (assumed to be almost certainly fatal).

=== Plot against Hitler ===

The role that Rommel played in the military&#x27;s resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain as most of the leaders who were directly involved did not survive, and limited documentation exists on the conspirators&#x27; plans and preparations. One piece of evidence that points to the possibility that Rommel came to support the assassination plan was General Eberbach&#x27;s confession to his son (eavesdropped on by British agencies) while in British captivity which stated that Rommel explicitly said to him that Hitler and his close associates had to be killed because this would be the only way out for Germany. This conversation occurred about a month before Rommel was coerced into suicide.

Other notable evidence includes the papers of Rudolf Hartmann (who survived the later purge) and Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel, who were among the leaders of the military resistance (alongside Rommel&#x27;s chief of staff General Hans Speidel, Colonel Karl-Richard Koßmann, Colonel Eberhard Finckh and Lieutenant Colonel Caesar von Hofacker). These papers, accidentally discovered by historian Christian Schweizer in 2018 while doing research on Rudolf Hartmann, include Hartmann&#x27;s eyewitness account of a conversation between Rommel and Stülpnagel in May 1944, as well as photos of the mid-May 1944 meeting between the inner circle of the resistance and Rommel at Koßmann&#x27;s house. According to Hartmann, by the end of May, in another meeting at Hartmann&#x27;s quarters in Mareil–Marly, Rommel showed &quot;decisive determination&quot; and clear approval of the inner circle&#x27;s plan. In a post-war account by Karl Strölin, three of Rommel&#x27;s friends—the &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; of Stuttgart, Strölin (who had served with Rommel in the First World War), Alexander von Falkenhausen and Stülpnagel—began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler conspiracy in early 1944. According to Strölin, sometime in February, Rommel agreed to lend his support to the resistance.
On 15 April 1944, Rommel&#x27;s new chief of staff, Hans Speidel, arrived in Normandy and reintroduced Rommel to Stülpnagel. Speidel had previously been connected to Carl Goerdeler, the civilian leader of the resistance, but not to the plotters led by Claus von Stauffenberg, and came to Stauffenberg&#x27;s attention only upon his appointment to Rommel&#x27;s headquarters. The conspirators felt they needed the support of a field marshal on active duty. Erwin von Witzleben, who would have become commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht had the plot succeeded, was a field marshal, but had been inactive since 1942. The conspirators gave instructions to Speidel to bring Rommel into their circle. Speidel met with former foreign minister Konstantin von Neurath and Strölin on 27 May in Germany, ostensibly at Rommel&#x27;s request, although the latter was not present. Neurath and Strölin suggested opening immediate surrender negotiations in the West, and, according to Speidel, Rommel agreed to further discussions and preparations. Around the same timeframe, the plotters in Berlin were not aware that Rommel had allegedly decided to take part in the conspiracy. On 16 May, they informed Allen Dulles, through whom they hoped to negotiate with the Western Allies, that Rommel could not be counted on for support.

At least initially, Rommel opposed assassinating Hitler. According to some authors, he gradually changed his attitude. After the war, his widow—among others—maintained that Rommel believed an assassination attempt would spark a civil war in Germany and Austria, and Hitler would have become a martyr for a lasting cause. Instead, Rommel reportedly suggested that Hitler be arrested and brought to trial for his crimes; he did not attempt to implement this plan when Hitler visited Margival, France, on 17 June. The arrest plan would have been highly improbable as Hitler&#x27;s security was extremely tight. Rommel would have known this, having commanded Hitler&#x27;s army protection detail in 1939. He was in favour of peace negotiations and repeatedly urged Hitler to negotiate with the Allies which is dubbed by some as &quot;hopelessly naive&quot; considering no one would trust Hitler. &quot;As naive as it was idealistic, the attitude he showed to the man he had sworn loyalty&quot;.

According to Reuth, the reason Lucie Rommel did not want her husband to be associated with any conspiracy was that even after the war, the German population neither grasped nor wanted to comprehend the reality of the genocide, thus conspirators were still treated as traitors and outcasts. On the other hand, the resistance depended on the reputation of Rommel to win over the population. Some officers who had worked with Rommel also recognised the relationship between Rommel and the resistance: Westphal said that Rommel did not want any more senseless sacrifices. Butler, using Ruge&#x27;s recollections, reports that when told by Hitler himself that &quot;no one will make peace with me&quot;, Rommel told Hitler that if he was the obstacle to peace, he should resign or kill himself, but Hitler insisted on fanatical defence.

Reuth, based on Jodl&#x27;s testimony, reports that Rommel forcefully presented the situation and asked for political solutions from Hitler, who rebuffed that Rommel should leave politics to him. Brighton comments that Rommel seemed devoted, even though he did not have much faith in Hitler anymore considering he kept informing Hitler in person and by letter about his changing beliefs despite facing a military dilemma as well as a personal struggle. Lieb remarks that Rommel&#x27;s attitude in describing the situation honestly and requiring political solutions was almost without precedent and contrary to the attitude of many other generals. Remy comments that Rommel put himself and his family (which he had briefly considered evacuating to France, but refrained from doing so) at risk for the resistance out of a combination of his concern for the fate of Germany, his indignation at atrocities and the influence of people around him.

On 15 July, Rommel wrote a letter to Hitler giving him a &quot;last chance&quot; to end the hostilities with the Western Allies, urging Hitler to &quot;draw the proper conclusions without delay&quot;. What Rommel did not know was that the letter took two weeks to reach Hitler because of Kluge&#x27;s precautions. Various authors report that many German generals in Normandy, including some SS officers like Hausser, Bittrich, Dietrich (a hard-core Nazi and Hitler&#x27;s long-time supporter) and Rommel&#x27;s former opponent Geyr von Schweppenburg, pledged support to him even against Hitler&#x27;s orders, while Kluge supported him with much hesitation. Rundstedt encouraged Rommel to carry out his plans but refused to do anything himself, remarking that it had to be a man who was still young and loved by the people, while Erich von Manstein was also approached by Rommel but categorically refused, although he did not report them to Hitler either. Peter Hoffmann reports that he also attracted into his orbit officials who had previously refused to support the conspiracy, like Julius Dorpmüller and Karl Kaufmann (according to Russell A. Hart, reliable details of the conversations are now lost, although they certainly met).

On 17 July 1944, Rommel was incapacitated by an Allied air attack, which many authors describe as a fateful event that drastically altered the outcome of the bomb plot. Writer Ernst Jünger commented: &quot;The blow that felled Rommel ... robbed the plan of the shoulders that were to be entrusted the double weight of war and civil war—the only man who had enough naivety to counter the simple terror that those he was about to go against possessed.&quot; After the failed bomb attack of 20 July, many conspirators were arrested and the dragnet expanded to thousands. Rommel was first implicated when Stülpnagel, after his suicide attempt, repeatedly muttered &quot;Rommel&quot; in delirium. Under torture, Hofacker named Rommel as one of the participants. Additionally, Goerdeler had written down Rommel&#x27;s name on a list as potential Reich President (according to Stroelin. They had not managed to announce this intention to Rommel yet and he probably never heard of it until the end of his life).

On 27 September, Martin Bormann submitted to Hitler a memorandum which claimed that &quot;the late General Stülpnagel, Colonel Hofacker, Kluge&#x27;s nephew who has been executed, Lieutenant Colonel Rathgens, and several ... living defendants have testified that Field Marshal Rommel was perfectly in the picture about the assassination plan and has promised to be at the disposal of the New Government.&quot; Gestapo agents were sent to Rommel&#x27;s house in Ulm and placed him under surveillance. Historian Peter Lieb considers the memorandum, as well as Eberbach&#x27;s conversation and the testimonies of surviving resistance members (including Hartmann), to be the three key sources that indicate Rommel&#x27;s support of the assassination plan. He further notes that while Speidel had an interest in promoting his own post-war career, his testimonies should not be dismissed, considering his bravery as an early resistance figure. Remy writes that even more important than Rommel&#x27;s attitude to the assassination is the fact Rommel had his own plan to end the war. He began to contemplate this plan some months after El Alamein and carried it out with a lonely decision and conviction, and in the end, had managed to bring military leaders in the West to his side.

== Death ==

Rommel&#x27;s case was turned over to the &quot;Court of Military Honour&quot;—a drumhead court-martial convened to decide the fate of officers involved in the conspiracy. The court included Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian, General der Infanterie Walther Schroth and Generalleutnant Karl-Wilhelm Specht, with General der Infanterie Karl Kriebel and Generalleutnant Heinrich Kirchheim (whom Rommel had fired after Tobruk in 1941) as deputy members and Generalmajor Ernst Maisel as protocol officer. The Court acquired information from Speidel, Hofacker and others that implicated Rommel, with Keitel and Ernst Kaltenbrunner assuming that he had taken part in the subversion. Keitel and Guderian then made the decision that favoured Speidel&#x27;s case and at the same time shifted the blame to Rommel. By normal procedure, this would lead to Rommel&#x27;s being brought to Roland Freisler&#x27;s People&#x27;s Court, a kangaroo court that always decided in favour of the prosecution. However, Hitler knew that having Rommel branded and executed as a traitor would severely damage morale on the home front. He thus decided to offer Rommel the chance to take his own life.

Two generals from Hitler&#x27;s headquarters, Wilhelm Burgdorf and Ernst Maisel, visited Rommel at his home on 14 October 1944. Burgdorf informed him of the charges against him and offered him three options: (a.) he could choose to defend himself personally in front of Hitler in Berlin, or he could refuse to do so (but, having done so, would be taken as an admission of guilt); (b.) he could face the People&#x27;s Court (which would have been tantamount to a death sentence); or (c.) choose death by suicide. In the former case (b.), his family would have suffered even before the all-but-certain conviction and execution, and his staff would have been arrested and executed as well. In the latter case (c.), the government would claim that he died a hero and bury him with full military honours, and his family would receive full pension payments. In support of the suicide option, Burgdorf had brought a cyanide capsule.

Rommel chose suicide, and explained his decision to his wife and son. Wearing his Afrika Korps jacket and carrying his field marshal&#x27;s baton, he got into Burgdorf&#x27;s car, driven by SS-Stabsscharführer Heinrich Doose, and was driven out of the village. After stopping, Doose and Maisel walked away from the car leaving Rommel with Burgdorf. Five minutes later Burgdorf gestured to the two men to return to the car, and Doose noticed that Rommel was slumped over, having taken the cyanide. He died before being taken to the Wagner-Schule field hospital. Ten minutes later, the group telephoned Rommel&#x27;s wife to inform her of his death.
The official notice of Rommel&#x27;s death as reported to the public stated that he had died of either a heart attack or a cerebral embolism—a complication of the skull fractures he had suffered in the earlier strafing of his staff car. To strengthen the story, Hitler ordered an official day of mourning in commemoration of his death. As promised, Rommel was given a state funeral, but it was held in Ulm instead of Berlin as had been requested by Rommel. Hitler sent Field Marshal Rundstedt (who was unaware that Rommel had died as a result of Hitler&#x27;s orders) as his representative to the funeral.

The truth behind Rommel&#x27;s death became known to the Allies when intelligence officer Charles Marshall interviewed Rommel&#x27;s widow, Lucia Rommel, as well as from a letter by Rommel&#x27;s son Manfred in April 1945.

Rommel&#x27;s grave is located in Herrlingen, a short distance west of Ulm. For decades after the war on the anniversary of his death, veterans of the Africa campaign, including former opponents, would gather at his tomb in Herrlingen.

== Style as military commander ==
On the Italian front in the First World War, Rommel was a successful tactician in fast-developing mobile battle and this shaped his subsequent style as a military commander. He found that taking initiative and not allowing the enemy forces to regroup led to victory. Some authors argue that his enemies were often less organised, second-rate, or depleted, and his tactics were less effective against adequately led, trained and supplied opponents and proved insufficient in the later years of the war. Others point out that through his career, he frequently fought while outnumbered and outgunned, sometimes overwhelmingly so, while having to deal with internal opponents in Germany who hoped that he would fail.

Rommel is praised by numerous authors as a great leader of men. The historian and journalist Basil Liddell Hart concludes that he was a strong leader worshipped by his troops, respected by his adversaries and deserving to be named as one of the &quot;Great Captains of History&quot;. Owen Connelly concurs, writing that &quot;No better exemplar of military leadership can be found&quot; and quoting Friedrich von Mellenthin on the inexplicable mutual understanding that existed between Rommel and his troops. Hitler, though, remarked that, &quot;Unfortunately Field-Marshal Rommel is a very great leader full of drive in times of success, but an absolute pessimist when he meets the slightest problems.&quot; Telp criticises Rommel for not extending the benevolence he showed in promoting his own officers&#x27; careers to his peers, whom he ignored or slighted in his reports.

Taking his opponents by surprise and creating uncertainty in their minds were key elements in Rommel&#x27;s approach to offensive warfare: he took advantage of sand storms and the dark of night to conceal the movement of his forces. He was aggressive and often directed the battle from the front or piloted a reconnaissance aircraft over the lines to get a view of the situation. When the British mounted a commando raid deep behind German lines in an effort to kill Rommel and his staff on the eve of their Crusader offensive, Rommel was indignant that the British expected to find his headquarters behind his front. Mellenthin and Harald Kuhn write that at times in North Africa his absence from a position of communication made command of the battles of the Afrika Korps difficult. Mellenthin lists Rommel&#x27;s counterattack during Operation Crusader as one such instance. Butler concurred, saying that leading from the front is a good concept but Rommel took it so far—he frequently directed the actions of a single company or battalion—that he made communication and coordination between units problematic, as well as risking his life to the extent that he could easily have been killed even by his own artillery. Albert Kesselring also complained about Rommel cruising about the battlefield like a division or corps commander; but Gause and Westphal, supporting Rommel, replied that in the African desert, only this method would work and that it was useless to try to restrain Rommel anyway. His staff officers, although admiring towards their leader, complained about the self-destructive Spartan lifestyle that made life harder, diminished his effectiveness and forced them to &quot;bab[y] him as unobtrusively as possible&quot;.

For his leadership during the French campaign, Rommel received both praise and criticism. Many, such as General Georg Stumme, who had previously commanded the 7th Panzer Division, were impressed with the speed and success of Rommel&#x27;s drive. Others were reserved or critical: Kluge, his commanding officer, argued that Rommel&#x27;s decisions were impulsive and that he claimed too much credit, by falsifying diagrams or by not acknowledging contributions of other units, especially the Luftwaffe. Some pointed out that Rommel&#x27;s division took the highest casualties in the campaign. Others point out that in exchange for 2,160 casualties and 42 tanks, it captured more than 100,000 prisoners and destroyed nearly two divisions&#x27; worth of enemy tanks (about 450 tanks), vehicles and guns.

Rommel spoke German with a pronounced southern German or Swabian accent. He was not a part of the Prussian aristocracy that dominated the German high command, and as such was looked upon somewhat suspiciously by the Wehrmacht&#x27;s traditional power structure. Rommel felt a commander should be physically more robust than the troops he led, and should always show them an example. He expected his subordinate commanders to do the same.

Rommel was direct, unbending, tough in his manners, to superiors and subordinates alike, and disobedient even to Hitler whenever he saw fit, although gentle and diplomatic to the lower ranks. Despite being publicity-friendly, he was also shy, introverted, clumsy and overly formal even to his closest aides, judging people only on their merits, although loyal and considerate to those who had proved reliability, and he displayed a surprisingly passionate and devoted side to a very small few (including Hitler) with whom he had dropped the seemingly impenetrable barriers.

=== Relationship with Italian forces ===
Rommel&#x27;s relationship with the Italian High Command in North Africa was generally poor. Although he was nominally subordinate to the Italians, he enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy from them; since he was directing their troops in battle as well as his own, this was bound to cause hostility among Italian commanders. Conversely, as the Italian command had control over the supplies of the forces in Africa, they resupplied Italian units preferentially, which was a source of resentment for Rommel and his staff. Rommel&#x27;s direct and abrasive manner did nothing to smooth these issues.

While certainly much less proficient than Rommel in their leadership, aggression, tactical outlook and mobile warfare skills, Italian commanders were competent in logistics, strategy and artillery doctrine: their troops were ill-equipped but well-trained. As such, the Italian commanders were repeatedly at odds with Rommel over concerns with issues of supply. Field Marshal Kesselring was assigned Supreme Commander Mediterranean, at least in part to alleviate command problems between Rommel and the Italians. This effort resulted only in partial success, with Kesselring&#x27;s own relationship with the Italians being unsteady and Kesselring claiming Rommel ignored him as readily as he ignored the Italians. Rommel often went directly to Hitler with his needs and concerns, taking advantage of the favouritism that the Führer displayed towards him and adding to the distrust that Kesselring and the German High Command already had of him.

According to Scianna, the opinion among the Italian military leaders was not unanimous. In general, Rommel was a target of criticism and a scapegoat for defeat rather than a glorified figure, with certain generals also trying to replace him as the heroic leader or hijack the Rommel myth for their own benefit. Nevertheless, he never became a hated figure, although the &quot;abandonment myth&quot;, despite being repudiated by officers of the X Corps themselves, was long-lived. Many found Rommel&#x27;s chaotic leadership and emotional character hard to work with, yet the Italians held him in higher regard than other German senior commanders, militarily and personally.

Very different, however, was the perception of Rommel by Italian common soldiers and NCOs, who, like the German field troops, had the deepest trust and respect for him. Paolo Colacicchi, an officer in the Italian Tenth Army recalled that Rommel &quot;became sort of a myth to the Italian soldiers&quot;. Rommel himself held a much more generous view about the Italian soldier than about their leadership, towards whom his disdain, deeply rooted in militarism, was not atypical, although unlike Kesselring he was incapable of concealing it. Unlike many of his superiors and subordinates who held racist views, he was usually &quot;kindly disposed&quot; to the Italians in general.

James J. Sadkovich cites examples of Rommel abandoning his Italian units, refusing cooperation, rarely acknowledging their achievements and other improper behaviour towards his Italian allies, Giuseppe Mancinelli, who was the liaison between German and Italian command, accused Rommel of blaming Italians for his own errors. Sadkovich names Rommel as &quot;arrogantly ethnocentric&quot; and disdainful towards Italians.

=== Views on the conduct of war ===
==== Combat ====
Many authors describe Rommel as having a reputation of being a chivalrous, humane, and professional officer, and that he earned the respect of both his own troops and his enemies.
Gerhard Schreiber quotes Rommel&#x27;s orders, issued together with Kesselring: &quot;Sentimentality concerning the Badoglio following gangs (&quot;Banden&quot; in the original, indicating a mob-like crowd) in the uniforms of the former ally is misplaced. Whoever fights against the German soldier has lost any right to be treated well and shall experience toughness reserved for the rabble which betrays friends. Every member of the German troop has to adopt this stance.&quot;
Schreiber writes that this is exceptionally harsh and, according to him, &quot;hate fuelled&quot; order brutalised the war and was clearly aimed at Italian soldiers, not just partisans. Dennis Showalter writes that &quot;Rommel was not involved in Italy&#x27;s partisan war, though the orders he issued prescribing death for Italian soldiers taken in arms and Italian civilians sheltering escaped British prisoners do not suggest he would have behaved significantly different from his Wehrmacht counterparts.&quot;

According to Maurice Remy, orders issued by Hitler during Rommel&#x27;s stay in a hospital resulted in massacres in the course of Operation Achse, disarming the Italian forces after the armistice with the Allies in 1943. Remy also states that Rommel treated his Italian opponents with his usual fairness, requiring that the prisoners should be accorded the same conditions as German civilians. Remy opines that an order in which Rommel, in contrast to Hitler&#x27;s directives, called for no &quot;sentimental scruples&quot; against &quot;Badoglio-dependent bandits in uniforms of the once brothers-in-arms&quot; should not be taken out of context. Peter Lieb agrees that the order did not radicalise the war and that the disarmament in Rommel&#x27;s area of responsibility happened without major bloodshed. Italian internees were sent to Germany for forced labour, but Rommel was unaware of this. Klaus Schmider comments that the writings of Lieb and others succeed in vindicating Rommel &quot;both with regards to his likely complicity in the July plot as well as his repeated refusal to carry out illegal orders.&quot;
Rommel withheld Hitler&#x27;s Commando Order to execute captured commandos from his Army Group B, with his units reporting that they were treating commandos as regular POWs. It is likely that he had acted similarly in North Africa. Historian Szymon Datner argues that Rommel may have been simply trying to conceal the atrocities of Nazi Germany from the Allies. Remy states that although Rommel had heard rumours about massacres while fighting in Africa, his personality, combined with special circumstances, meant that he was not fully confronted with the reality of atrocities before 1944. When Rommel learned about the atrocities that &quot;SS Division Leibstandarte&quot; committed in Italy in September 1943, he allegedly forbade his son from joining the Waffen-SS.

==== Attitude toward colonial troops ====
By the time of the Second World War, French colonial troops were portrayed as a symbol of French depravity in Nazi propaganda; Canadian historian Myron Echenberg writes that Rommel, just like Hitler, viewed black French soldiers with particular disdain. According to author Ward Rutherford, Rommel also held racist views towards British colonial troops from India; Rutherford in his &quot;The biography of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel&quot; writes: &quot;Not even his most sycophantic apologists have been able to evade the conclusion, fully demonstrated by his later behaviour, that Rommel was a racist who, for example, thought it desperately unfair that the British should employ &#x27;black&#x27;—by which he meant Indian—troops against a white adversary.&quot; Vaughn Raspberry writes that Rommel and other officers considered it an insult to fight against black Africans because they considered black people to be members of &quot;inferior races&quot;.

Bruce Watson comments that whatever racism Rommel might have had in the beginning, it was washed away when he fought in the desert. When he saw that they were fighting well, he gave the members of the 4th Division of the Indian Army high praise. Rommel and the Germans acknowledge the Gurkhas&#x27; fighting ability, although their style leaned more towards ferocity. Once he witnessed German soldiers with throats cut by a khukri knife. Originally, he did not want Chandra Bose&#x27;s Indian formation (composed of the Allied Indian soldiers), captured by his own troops, to work under his command. In Normandy though, when they had already become the Indische Freiwilligen Legion der Waffen SS, he visited them and praised them for their efforts (while they still suffered general disrespect within the Wehrmacht). A review on Rutherford&#x27;s book by the &quot;Pakistan Army Journal&quot; says that the statement is one of many that Rutherford uses, which lack support in authority and analysis. Rommel saying that using the Indians was unfair should also be put in perspective, considering the disbandment of the battle-hardened 4th Division by the Allies. Rommel praised the colonial troops in the battle of France: &quot;The (French) colonial troops fought with extraordinary determination. The anti-tank teams and tank crews performed with courage and caused serious losses,&quot; though that might be an example of generals honouring their opponents so that &quot;their own victories appear the more impressive.&quot; Reuth comments that Rommel ensured that he and his command would act decently (shown by his treatment of the Free French prisoners who were considered partisans by Hitler, the Jews and the coloured men), while he was distancing himself from Hitler&#x27;s racist war in the East and deluding himself into believing that Hitler was good, only the Party big shots were evil. The black South African soldiers recount that when they were held as POWs after they were captured by Rommel, they initially slept and queued for food away from the whites, until Rommel saw this and told them that brave soldiers should all queue together. Finding this strange coming from a man fighting for Hitler, they adopted this behaviour until they went back to the Union of South Africa, where they were separated again.

There are reports that Rommel acknowledged the Maori soldiers&#x27; fighting skills, yet at the same time he complained about their methods which were unfair from the European perspective. When he asked the commander of the New Zealand 6th Infantry Brigade about his division&#x27;s massacres of the wounded and POWs, the commander attributed these incidents to the Maoris in his unit. Hew Strachan notes that lapses in practising the warriors&#x27; code of war were usually attributed to ethnic groups which lived outside Europe with the implication that those ethnic groups which lived in Europe knew how to behave (although Strachan opines that such attributions were probably true). Nevertheless, according to the website of the 28th Maori Battalion, Rommel always treated them fairly and he also showed understanding with regard to war crimes.

==== Politics ====
Some authors cite, among other cases, Rommel&#x27;s naive reaction to events in Poland while he was there: he paid a visit to his wife&#x27;s uncle, famous Polish priest and patriotic leader, who was murdered within days, but Rommel never understood this and, at his wife&#x27;s urgings, kept writing letter after letter to Himmler&#x27;s adjutants asking them to keep track and take care of their relative. Knopp and Mosier agree that he was naive politically, citing his request for a Jewish Gauleiter in 1943. Despite this, Lieb finds it hard to believe that a man in Rommel&#x27;s position could have known nothing about atrocities, while accepting that locally he was separated from the places where these atrocities occurred. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; comments that Rommel was simply in denial about what happened around him. Alaric Searle points out that it was the early diplomatic successes and bloodless expansion that blinded Rommel to the true nature of his beloved Führer, whom he then naively continued to support. Scheck believes it may be forever unclear whether Rommel recognised the unprecedented depraved character of the regime.

==== Civilians ====
Historian Richard J. Evans has stated that German soldiers in Tunisia raped Jewish women, and the success of Rommel&#x27;s forces in capturing or securing Allied, Italian and Vichy French territory in North Africa led to many Jews in these areas being killed by other German institutions as part of the Holocaust. Anti-Jewish and Anti-Arab violence erupted in North Africa when Rommel and Ettore Bastico regained territory there in February 1941 and then again in April 1942. While committed by Italian forces, Patrick Bernhard writes &quot;the Germans were aware of Italian reprisals behind the front lines. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, they seem to have exercised little control over events.

The German consul general in Tripoli consulted with Italian state and party officials about possible countermeasures against the natives, but this was the full extent of German involvement. Rommel did not directly intervene, though he advised the Italian authorities to do whatever was necessary to eliminate the danger of riots and espionage; for the German general, the rear areas were to be kept &quot;quiet&quot; at all costs. Thus, according to Bernhard, although he had no direct hand in the atrocities, Rommel made himself complicit in war crimes by failing to point out that international laws of war strictly prohibited certain forms of retaliation. By giving carte blanche to the Italians, Rommel implicitly condoned, and perhaps even encouraged, their war crimes&quot;. Gershom reports that the recommendation came from officers &quot;speaking for Rommel&quot;, and comments, &quot;Perhaps Rommel did not know or care about the specifics; perhaps his motivation was not hate but dispassionate efficiency. The distinctions would have escaped the men hanging from hooks.&quot;

In his article &quot;Im Rücken Rommels. Kriegsverbrechen, koloniale Massengewalt und Judenverfolgung in Nordafrika&quot;, Bernhard writes that North African campaign was hardly &quot;war without hate&quot; as Rommel described it, and points out rapes of women, ill-treatment and executions of captured POWs, as well as racially motivated murders of Arabs, Berbers and Jews, in addition to the establishment of concentration camps. Bernhard again cites discussion among the German and Italian authorities about Rommel&#x27;s position regarding countermeasures against local insurrection (according to them, Rommel wanted to eliminate the danger at all costs) to show that Rommel fundamentally approved of Italian policy in the matter. Bernhard opines that Rommel had informal power over the matter because his military success brought him influence on the Italian authorities.

United States Holocaust Memorial Museum describes relationship between Rommel and the proposed Einsatzgruppen Egypt as &quot;problematic&quot;. The Museum states that this unit was to be tasked with murdering the Jewish population of North Africa, and Palestine, and it was to be attached directly to Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps. According to the museum Rauff met with Rommel&#x27;s staff in 1942 as part of preparations for this plan. The Museum states that Rommel was certainly aware that planning was taking place, even if his reaction to it isn&#x27;t recorded, and while the main proposed Einsatzgruppen were never set in action, smaller units did murder Jews in North Africa.

On the other hand, Christopher Gabel remarks that Richards Evans seems to attempt to prove that Rommel was a war criminal by association but fails to produce evidence that he had actual or constructive knowledge about said crimes. Ben H. Shepherd comments that Rommel showed insight and restraint when dealing with the nomadic Arabs, the only civilians who occasionally intervened in the war and thus risked reprisals as a result. Shepherd cites a request by Rommel to the Italian High Command, in which he complained about excesses against the Arabic population and noted that reprisals without identifying the real culprits were never expedient.

The documentary &quot;Rommel&#x27;s War&quot; (&quot;Rommels Krieg&quot;), made by Caron and Müllner with advice from Sönke Neitzel, states that even though it is not clear whether Rommel knew about the crimes (in Africa) or not, &quot;his military success made possible forced labour, torture and robbery. Rommel&#x27;s war is always part of Hitler&#x27;s war of worldviews, whether Rommel wanted it or not.&quot; More specifically, several German historians have revealed the existence of plans to exterminate Jews in Egypt and Palestine, if Rommel had succeeded in his goal of invading the Middle East during 1942 by SS unit embedded to Afrika Korps.

According to Mallmann and Cüppers, a post-war CIA report described Rommel as having met with Walther Rauff, who was responsible for the unit, and been disgusted after learning about the plan from him and as having sent him on his way; but they conclude that such a meeting is hardly possible as Rauff was sent to report to Rommel at Tobruk on 20 July and Rommel was then 500 km away conducting the First El Alamein. On 29 July, Rauff&#x27;s unit was sent to Athens, expecting to enter Africa when Rommel crossed the Nile. However, in view of the Axis&#x27; deteriorating situation in Africa it returned to Germany in September.

Historian Jean-Christoph Caron opines that there is no evidence that Rommel knew or would have supported Rauff&#x27;s mission; he also believes Rommel bore no direct responsibility regarding the SS&#x27;s looting of gold in Tunisia. Historian Haim Saadon, Director of the Center of Research on North African Jewry in WWII, goes further, stating that there was no extermination plan: Rauff&#x27;s documents show that his foremost concern was helping the Wehrmacht to win, and he came up with the idea of forced labour camps in the process. By the time these labour camps were in operation, according to Ben H. Shepherd, Rommel had already been retreating and there is no proof of his contact with the Einsatzkommando.

&quot;Haaretz&quot; comments that the CIA report is most likely correct regarding both the interaction between Rommel and Rauff and Rommel&#x27;s objections to the plan: Rauff&#x27;s assistant Theodor Saevecke, and declassified information from Rauff&#x27;s file, both report the same story. &quot;Haaretz&quot; also remarks that Rommel&#x27;s influence probably softened the Nazi authorities&#x27; attitude to the Jews and to the civilian population generally in North Africa.

Rolf-Dieter Müller comments that the war in North Africa, while as bloody as any other war, differed considerably from the war of annihilation in eastern Europe, because it was limited to a narrow coastline and hardly affected the population.

Showalter writes that: 
Joachim Käppner writes that while the conflict in North Africa was not as bloody as in Eastern Europe, the Afrika Korps committed some war crimes. Historian Martin Kitchen states that the reputation of the Afrika Korps was preserved by circumstances: The sparsely populated desert areas did not lend themselves to ethnic cleansing; the German forces never reached the large Jewish populations in Egypt and Palestine; and in the urban areas of Tunisia and Tripolitania the Italian government constrained the German efforts to discriminate against or eliminate Jews who were Italian citizens. Despite this, the North African Jews themselves believed that it was Rommel who prevented the &quot;Final Solution&quot; from being carried out against them when Germany might dominate North Africa from Egypt to Morocco. According to Curtis and Remy, 120,000 Jews lived in Algeria, 200,000 in Morocco, about 80,000 in Tunisia. Remy writes that this number was unchanged following the German invasion of Tunisia in 1942 while Curtis notes that 5000 of these Jews would be sent to forced labour camps. and 26,000 in Libya.

Hein Klemann writes that the confiscations in the &quot;foraging zone&quot; of Afrika Korps threatened the survival chances of local civilians, just as plunder enacted by the Wehrmacht in the Soviet Union.

In North Africa, Rommel&#x27;s troops laid down landmines, which in decades to come killed and maimed thousands of civilians. Since statistics started in the 1980s, 3,300 people have lost their lives, and 7,500 maimed There are disputed whether the landmines in El Alamein, which constitute the most notable portion of landmines left over from World War II, were left by the Afrika Korps or the British Army led by Field Marshal Montgomery. Egypt has not joined the Mine Ban Treaty until this day.

Rommel sharply protested the Jewish policies and other immoralities and was an opponent of the Gestapo He also refused to comply with Hitler&#x27;s order to execute Jewish POWs. Controversial author Bryan Mark Rigg writes: &quot;The only place in the army where one might find a place of refuge was in the Deutsches Afrika-Korps (DAK) under the leadership of the &#x27;Desert Fox,&#x27; Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. According to this study&#x27;s files, his half-Jews were not as affected by the racial laws as most others serving on the European continent.&quot; He notes, though, that &quot;Perhaps Rommel failed to enforce the order to discharge half-Jews because he was unaware of it&quot;.

Captain Horst van Oppenfeld (a staff officer to Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and a quarter-Jew) says that Rommel did not concern himself with the racial decrees and he had never experienced any trouble caused by his ancestry during his time in the DAK even if Rommel never personally interfered on his behalf. Another quarter-Jew, Fritz Bayerlein, became a famous general and Rommel&#x27;s chief-of-staff, despite also being a bisexual, which made his situation even more precarious.

Building the Atlantic Wall was officially the responsibility of the Organisation Todt, which was not under Rommel&#x27;s command, but he enthusiastically joined the task, protesting slave labour and suggesting that they should recruit French civilians and pay them good wages. Despite this, French civilians and Italian prisoners of war held by the Germans were forced by officials under the Vichy government, the Todt Organization and the SS forces to work on building some of the defences Rommel requested, in appalling conditions according to historian Will Fowler. Although they got basic wages, the workers complained because it was too little and there was no heavy equipment. 

German troops worked almost round-the-clock under very harsh conditions, with Rommel&#x27;s rewards being accordions.

Rommel was one of the commanders who protested the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre.

== Reputation as a military commander ==
Rommel was famous in his lifetime, including among his adversaries. His tactical prowess and decency in the treatment of Allied prisoners earned him the respect of opponents including Claude Auchinleck, Archibald Wavell, George S. Patton, and Bernard Montgomery.

Rommel&#x27;s military reputation has been controversial. While nearly all military practitioners acknowledge Rommel&#x27;s excellent tactical skills and personal bravery, some, such as U.S. major general and military historian David T. Zabecki of the United States Naval Institute, consider Rommel&#x27;s performance as an operational level commander to be highly overstated and that other officers share this belief. General Klaus Naumann, who served as Chief of Staff of the Bundeswehr, agrees with the military historian Charles Messenger that Rommel had challenges at the operational level, and states that Rommel&#x27;s violation of the unity of command principle, bypassing the chain of command in Africa, was unacceptable and contributed to the eventual operational and strategic failure in North Africa. The German biographer Wolf Heckmann describes Rommel as &quot;the most overrated commander of an army in world history&quot;.

Nevertheless, there is also a notable number of officers who admire his methods, like Norman Schwarzkopf who described Rommel as a genius at battles of movement saying &quot;Look at Rommel. Look at North Africa, the Arab-Israeli wars, and all the rest of them. A war in the desert is a war of mobility and lethality. It&#x27;s not a war where straight lines are drawn in the sand and [you] say, &#x27;I will defend here or die.&quot; Ariel Sharon deemed the German military model used by Rommel to be superior to the British model used by Montgomery. His compatriot Moshe Dayan likewise considered Rommel a model and icon. Wesley Clark states that &quot;Rommel&#x27;s military reputation, though, has lived on, and still sets the standard for a style of daring, charismatic leadership to which most officers aspire.&quot; During the recent desert wars, Rommel&#x27;s military theories and experiences attracted great interest from policymakers and military instructors. Chinese military leader Sun Li-jen had the laudatory nickname &quot;Rommel of the East&quot;.
Certain modern military historians, such as Larry T. Addington, Niall Barr, Douglas Porch and Robert Citino, are sceptical of Rommel as an operational, let alone strategic level commander. They point to Rommel&#x27;s lack of appreciation for Germany&#x27;s strategic situation, his misunderstanding of the relative importance of his theatre to the German High Command, his poor grasp of logistical realities, and, according to the historian Ian Beckett, his &quot;penchant for glory hunting&quot;. Citino credits Rommel&#x27;s limitations as an operational level commander as &quot;materially contributing&quot; to the eventual demise of the Axis forces in North Africa, while Addington focuses on the struggle over strategy, whereby Rommel&#x27;s initial brilliant success resulted in &quot;catastrophic effects&quot; for Germany in North Africa. Porch highlights Rommel&#x27;s &quot;offensive mentality&quot;, symptomatic of the Wehrmacht commanders as a whole in the belief that the tactical and operational victories would lead to strategic success. Compounding the problem was the Wehrmacht&#x27;s institutional tendency to discount logistics, industrial output and their opponents&#x27; capacity to learn from past mistakes.

The historian Geoffrey P. Megargee points out Rommel&#x27;s playing the German and Italian command structures against each other to his advantage. Rommel used the confused structure—the High command of the armed forces, the OKH (Supreme High Command of the Army) and the &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; (Italian Supreme Command)—to disregard orders that he disagreed with or to appeal to whatever authority he felt would be most sympathetic to his requests.
Some historians take issue with Rommel&#x27;s absence from Normandy on the day of the Allied invasion, 6 June 1944. He had left France on 5 June and was at home on the 6th celebrating his wife&#x27;s birthday. (According to Rommel, he planned to proceed to see Hitler the next day to discuss the situation in Normandy). Zabecki calls his decision to leave the theatre in view of an imminent invasion &quot;an incredible lapse of command responsibility&quot;. Lieb remarks that Rommel displayed real mental agility, but the lack of an energetic commander, together with other problems, caused the battle largely not to be conducted in his concept (which is the opposite of the German doctrine), although the result was still better than Geyr&#x27;s plan. Lieb also opines that while his harshest critics (who mostly came from the General Staff) often said that Rommel was overrated or not suitable for higher commands, envy was a big factor here.

T.L. McMahon argues that while Rommel no doubt possessed operational vision, he did not have the strategic resources to effect his operational choices while his forces provided the tactical ability to accomplish his goals, and the German staff and system of staff command were designed for commanders who led from the front, and in some cases he might have chosen the same options as Montgomery (a reputedly strategy-oriented commander) had he been put in the same conditions. According to Steven Zaloga, tactical flexibility was a great advantage of the German system, but in the final years of the war, Hitler and his cronies like Himmler and Goering had usurped more and more authority at the strategic level, leaving professionals like Rommel increasing constraints on their actions. Martin Blumenson considers Rommel a general with a compelling view of strategy and logistics, which was demonstrated through his many arguments with his superiors over such matters, although Blumenson also thinks that what distinguished Rommel was his boldness, his intuitive feel for the battlefield.(Upon which Schwarzkopf also comments &quot;Rommel had a feel for the battlefield like no other man.&quot;)

Joseph Forbes comments that: &quot;The complex, conflict-filled interaction between Rommel and his superiors over logistics, objectives and priorities should not be used to detract from Rommel&#x27;s reputation as a remarkable military leader&quot;, because Rommel was not given powers over logistics, and because if only generals who attain strategic-policy goals are great generals, such highly regarded commanders as Robert E. Lee, Hannibal, Charles XII would have to be excluded from that list. General Siegfried F. Storbeck, Deputy Inspector General of the Bundeswehr (1987–1991), remarks that, Rommel&#x27;s leadership style and offensive thinking, although carrying inherent risks like losing the overview of the situation and creating overlapping of authority, have been proved effective, and have been analysed and incorporated in the training of officers by &quot;us, our Western allies, the Warsaw Pact, and even the Israel Defense Forces&quot;. Maurice Remy defends his strategic decision regarding Malta as, although risky, the only logical choice.

Rommel was among the few Axis commanders (the others being Isoroku Yamamoto and Reinhard Heydrich) who were targeted for assassination by Allied planners. Two attempts were made, the first being Operation Flipper in North Africa in 1941, and the second being Operation Gaff in Normandy in 1944.

Research by Norman Ohler claims that Rommel&#x27;s behaviours were heavily influenced by Pervitin which he reportedly took in heavy doses, to such an extent that Ohler refers to him as &quot;the Crystal Fox&quot; (&quot;Kristallfuchs&quot;)—playing off the nickname &quot;Desert Fox&quot; famously given to him by the British.

==Debate about atrocities==
=== Executions of prisoners in France ===
In France, Rommel ordered the execution of one French officer who refused three times to cooperate when being taken prisoner; there are disputes as to whether this execution was justified. Caddick-Adams comments that this would make Rommel a war criminal condemned by his own hand, and that other authors overlook this episode. Butler notes that the officer refused to surrender three times and thus died in a courageous but foolhardy way. French historian Petitfrère remarks that Rommel was in a hurry and had no time for useless palavers, although this act was still debatable. Telp remarks that, &quot;he treated prisoners of war with consideration. On one occasion, he was forced to order the shooting of a French lieutenant-colonel for refusing to obey his captors.&quot; Scheck says, &quot;Although there is no evidence incriminating Rommel himself, his unit did fight in areas where German massacres of black French prisoners of war were extremely common in June 1940.&quot;

Historian David Stone notes that acts of shooting surrendered prisoners were carried out by Rommel&#x27;s 7th Panzer Division and observes contradictory statements in Rommel&#x27;s account of the events; Rommel initially wrote that &quot;any enemy troops were wiped out or forced to withdraw&quot; but also added that &quot;many prisoners taken were hopelessly drunk.&quot; Stone attributes the massacres of soldiers from the &quot;53ème Regiment d&#x27;Infanterie Coloniale&quot; (N&#x27;Tchoréré&#x27;s unit) on 7 June to the 5th Infantry Division. Historian Daniel Butler agrees that it was possible that the massacre at Le Quesnoy happened given the existence of Nazis, such as Hanke, in Rommel&#x27;s division, while stating that in comparison with other German units, few sources regarding such actions of the men of the 7th Panzer exist. Butler believes that &quot;it&#x27;s almost impossible to imagine&quot; Rommel authorising or countenancing such actions. He also writes that &quot;Some accusers have twisted a remark in Rommel&#x27;s own account of the action in the village of Le Quesnoy as proof that he at least tacitly condoned the executions—&#x27;any enemy troops were either wiped out or forced to withdraw&#x27;—but the words themselves as well as the context of the passage hardly support the contention.&quot;

===Treatment of Jews and other civilians in North Africa===

Giordana Terracina writes that: &quot;On April 3, the Italians recaptured Benghazi and a few months later the Afrika Korps led by Rommel was sent to Libya and began the deportation of the Jews of Cyrenaica in the Giado concentration camp and other smaller towns in Tripolitania. This measure was accompanied by shooting, also in Benghazi, of some Jews guilty of having welcomed the British troops, on their arrival, treating them as liberators.&quot; Gershom states that Italian authorities were responsible for bringing Jews into their concentration camps, which were &quot;not built to exterminate its inmates&quot;, yet as the water and food supply was meagre, were not built to keep humans alive either. Also according to Gershom, the German consul in Tripoli knew about the process and trucks used to transport supplies to Rommel were sometimes used to transport Jews, despite all the problems the German forces were having. The &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;&#x27;s review of Gershom Gorenberg&#x27;s &quot;War of shadows&quot; writes that: &quot;The Italians were far more brutal with civilians, including Libyan Jews, than Rommel’s Afrika Korps, which by all accounts abided by the laws of war. But nobody worried that the Italians who sent Jews to concentration camps in Libya, would invade British-held Egypt, let alone Mandatory Palestine.&quot;

According to German historian , Rommel forbade his soldiers from buying anything from the Jewish population of Tripoli, used Jewish slave labour and commanded Jews to clear out minefields by walking on them ahead of his forces. According to Proske, some of the Libyan Jews were eventually sent to concentration camps. Historians Christian Schweizer and Peter Lieb note that: &quot;Over the last few years, even though the social science teacher Wolfgang Proske has sought to participate in the discussion [on Rommel] with very strong opinions, his biased submissions are not scientifically received.&quot; The &quot;Heidenheimer Zeitung&quot; notes that Proske was the publisher of his main work &quot;Täter, Helfer, Trittbrettfahrer – NS-Belastete von der Ostalb&quot;, after failing to have it published by another publisher.

According to historian Michael Wolffsohn, during the Africa campaign, preparations for committing genocide against the North African Jews were in full swing and a thousand of them were transported to East European concentration camps. At the same time, he recommends the Bundeswehr to keep the names and traditions associated with Rommel (although Wolffsohn opines that focus should be put on the politically thoughtful soldier he became at the end of his life, rather than the swashbuckler and the humane rogue).

Robert Satloff writes in his book &quot;Among the Righteous: Lost Stories from the Holocaust&#x27;s Long Reach into Arab Lands&quot; that as the German and Italian forces retreated across Libya towards Tunisia, the Jewish population became victim upon which they released their anger and frustration. According to Satloff Afrika Korps soldiers plundered Jewish property all along the Libyan coast. This violence and persecution only came to an end with the arrival of General Montgomery in Tripoli on 23 January 1943. According to Maurice Remy, although there were antisemitic individuals in the Afrika Korps, actual cases of abuse are not known, even against the Jewish soldiers of the Eighth Army. Remy quotes Isaac Levy, the Senior Jewish Chaplain of the Eighth Army, as saying that he had never seen &quot;any sign or hint that the soldiers [of the Afrika Korps] are antisemitic.&quot;. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; comments: &quot;Accounts suggest that it was not Field Marshal Erwin Rommel but the ruthless SS colonel Walter Rauff who stripped Tunisian Jews of their wealth.&quot;

Commenting on Rommel&#x27;s conquest of Tunisia, Marvin Perry writes that: &quot;The bridgehead Rommel established in Tunisia enabled the SS to herd Jews into slave labor camps.&quot;

Jan Friedmann writes that: &quot;The SS had established a network of labor camps in Tunisia. More than 2,500 Tunisian Jews died in six months of German rule, and the regular army was also involved in executions.&quot; Caron writes in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; that the camps were organised in early December 1942 by Nehring, the commander in Tunisia, and Rauff, while Rommel was retreating. As commander of the German Afrika Korps, Nehring would continue to use Tunisian forced labour. According to Caddick-Adams, no Waffen-SS served under Rommel in Africa at any time and most of the activities of Rauff&#x27;s detachment happened after Rommel&#x27;s departure. Shepherd notes that during this time Rommel was retreating and there is no evidence that he had contact with the &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot;. Addressing the call of some authors to contextualise Rommel&#x27;s actions in Italy and North Africa, Wolfgang Mährle argues that while it is undeniable that Rommel played the role of a &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; in a criminal war, this only illustrates in a limited way his personal attitude and the actions resulted from that.

===Alleged treasure and spoils===
According to several historians, allegations and stories that associate Rommel and the Afrika Korps with the harassing and plundering of Jewish gold and property in Tunisia are usually known under the name &quot;Rommel&#x27;s treasure&quot; or &quot;Rommel&#x27;s gold&quot;. Michael FitzGerald comments that the treasure should be named more accurately as Rauff&#x27;s gold, as Rommel had nothing to do with its acquisition or removal. Jean-Christoph Caron comments that the treasure legend has a real core and that Jewish property was looted by the SS in Tunisia and later might have been hidden or sunken around the port city of Corsica, where Rauff was stationed in 1943. The person who gave birth to the full-blown legend was the SS soldier Walter Kirner, who presented a false map to the French authorities. Caron and Jörg Müllner, his co-author of the ZDF documentary &quot;Rommel&#x27;s treasure&quot; (Rommels Schatz) tell Die Welt that &quot;Rommel had nothing to do with the treasure, but his name is assocỉated with everything that happened in the war in Africa.&quot;

Rick Atkinson criticises Rommel for gaining a looted stamp collection (a bribe from Sepp Dietrich) and a villa taken from Jews. Lucas, Matthews and Remy though describe the contemptuous and angry reaction of Rommel towards Dietrich&#x27;s act and the lootings and other brutal behaviours of the SS that he had discovered in Italy. Claudia Hecht also explains that although the Stuttgart and Ulm authorities did arrange for the Rommel family to use a villa whose Jewish owners had been forced out two years earlier, for a brief period after their own house had been destroyed by Allied bombing, ownership of it was never transferred to them. Butler notes that Rommel was one of the few who refused large estates and gifts of cash Hitler gave to his generals.

== In Nazi and Allied propaganda ==
At the beginning, although Hitler and Goebbels took particular notice of Rommel, the Nazi elites had no intent to create one major war symbol (partly out of fear that he would offset Hitler), generating huge propaganda campaigns for not only Rommel but also Gerd von Rundstedt, Walther von Brauchitsch, Eduard Dietl, Sepp Dietrich (the latter two were party members and also strongly supported by Hitler), etc. Nevertheless, a multitude of factors—including Rommel&#x27;s unusual charisma, his talents both in military matters and public relations, the efforts of Goebbels&#x27;s propaganda machine, and the Allies&#x27; participation in mythologising his life (either for political benefits, sympathy for someone who evoked a romantic archetype, or genuine admiration for his actions)—gradually contributed to Rommel&#x27;s fame. Spiegel wrote, &quot;Even back then his fame outshone that of all other commanders.&quot;

Rommel&#x27;s victories in France were featured in the German press and in the February 1941 film &quot;Sieg im Westen (Victory in the West),&quot; in which Rommel personally helped direct a segment re-enacting the crossing of the Somme River.According to Scheck, although there is no evidence of Rommel committing crimes, during the shooting of the movie, African prisoners of war, were forced to take part in its making, and forced to carry out humiliating acts. Stills from the re-enactment are found in &quot;Rommel Collection&quot;; it was filmed by Hans Ertl, assigned to this task by Dr. Kurt Hesse, a personal friend of Rommel, who worked for Wehrmacht Propaganda Section V Rommel&#x27;s victories in 1941 were played up by the Nazi propaganda, even though his successes in North Africa were achieved in arguably one of Germany&#x27;s least strategically important theatres of World War II. In November 1941, Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote about &quot;the urgent need&quot; to have Rommel &quot;elevated to a kind of popular hero.&quot; Rommel, with his innate abilities as a military commander and love of the spotlight, was a perfect fit for the role Goebbels designed for him.

=== Successes in North Africa ===
In North Africa, Rommel received help in cultivating his image from Alfred Ingemar Berndt, a senior official at the Reich Propaganda Ministry who had volunteered for military service. Seconded by Goebbels, Berndt was assigned to Rommel&#x27;s staff and became one of his closest aides. Berndt often acted as a liaison between Rommel, the Propaganda Ministry, and the Führer Headquarters. He directed Rommel&#x27;s photo shoots and filed radio dispatches describing the battles.

In the spring of 1941, Rommel&#x27;s name began to appear in the British media. In the autumn of 1941 and early winter of 1941/1942, he was mentioned in the British press almost daily. Toward the end of the year, the Reich propaganda machine also used Rommel&#x27;s successes in Africa as a diversion from the Wehrmacht&#x27;s challenging situation in the Soviet Union with the stall of Operation Barbarossa. The American press soon began to take notice of Rommel as well, following the country&#x27;s entry into the war on 11 December 1941, writing that &quot;The British (...) admire him because he beat them and were surprised to have beaten in turn such a capable general.&quot; General Auchinleck distributed a directive to his commanders seeking to dispel the notion that Rommel was a &quot;superman&quot;. Rommel, no matter how hard the situation was, made a deliberate effort at always spending some time with soldiers and patients, his own and POWs alike, which contributed greatly to his reputation of not only being a great commander but also &quot;a decent chap&quot; among the troops.

The attention of the Western and especially the British press thrilled Goebbels, who wrote in his diary in early 1942: &quot;Rommel continues to be the recognized darling of even the enemies&#x27; news agencies.&quot; The Field Marshal was pleased by the media attention, although he knew the downsides of having a reputation. Hitler took note of the British propaganda as well, commenting in the summer of 1942 that Britain&#x27;s leaders must have hoped &quot;to be able to explain their defeat to their own nation more easily by focusing on Rommel&quot;.

The Field Marshal was the German commander most frequently covered in the German media and the only one to be given a press conference, which took place in October 1942. The press conference was moderated by Goebbels and was attended by both domestic and foreign media. Rommel declared: &quot;Today we (...) have the gates of Egypt in hand, and with the intent to act!&quot; Keeping the focus on Rommel distracted the German public from Wehrmacht losses elsewhere as the tide of the war began to turn. He became a symbol that was used to reinforce the German public&#x27;s faith in an ultimate Axis victory.

=== Military reverses ===
In the wake of the successful British offensive in November 1942 and other military reverses, the Propaganda Ministry directed the media to emphasise Rommel&#x27;s invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. To ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel&#x27;s name, Goebbels had the Army High Command announce in May 1943 that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons. Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress with Rommel at the helm of this success. After the radio programme ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.

Although Rommel then entered a period without a significant command, he remained a household name in Germany, synonymous with the aura of invincibility. Hitler then made Rommel part of his defensive strategy for Fortress Europe (&quot;Festung Europa&quot;) by sending him to the West to inspect fortifications along the Atlantic Wall. Goebbels supported the decision, noting in his diary that Rommel was &quot;undoubtedly the suitable man&quot; for the task. The propaganda minister expected the move to reassure the German public and at the same time to have a negative impact on the Allied forces&#x27; morale.

In France, a Wehrmacht propaganda company frequently accompanied Rommel on his inspection trips to document his work for both domestic and foreign audiences. In May 1944 the German newsreels reported on Rommel&#x27;s speech at a Wehrmacht conference, where he stated his conviction that &quot;every single German soldier will make his contribution against the Anglo-American spirit that it deserves for its criminal and bestial air war campaign against our homeland.&quot; The speech led to an upswing in morale and sustained confidence in Rommel.

When Rommel was seriously wounded on 17 July 1944, the Propaganda Ministry undertook efforts to conceal the injury so as not to undermine domestic morale. Despite those, the news leaked to the British press. To counteract the rumours of a serious injury and even death, Rommel was required to appear at a 1 August press conference. On 3 August, the German press published an official report that Rommel had been injured in a car accident. Rommel noted in his diary his dismay at this twisting of the truth, belatedly realising how much the Reich propaganda was using him for its own ends.

=== Rommel&#x27;s views on propaganda ===
Rommel was interested in propaganda beyond the promotion of his own image. In 1944, after visiting Rommel in France and reading his proposals on counteracting Allied propaganda, Alfred-Ingemar Berndt remarked: &quot;He is also interested in this propaganda business and wants to develop it by all means. He has even thought and brought out practical suggestions for each program and subject.&quot;

Rommel saw the propaganda and education values in his and his nation&#x27;s deeds (He also did value justice itself; according to Admiral Ruge&#x27;s diary, Rommel told Ruge: &quot;Justice is the indispensable foundation of a nation. Unfortunately, the higher-ups are not clean. The slaughterings are grave sins.&quot;) The key to the successful creating of an image, according to Rommel, was leading by example: He urged Axis authorities to treat the Arab with the utmost respect to prevent uprisings behind the front. He protested the use of propaganda at the cost of explicit military benefits though, criticising Hitler&#x27;s headquarters for being unable to tell the German people and the world that El Alamein had been lost and preventing the evacuation of the German forces in Northern Africa in the process. Ruge suggests that his chief treated his own fame as a kind of weapon.

In 1943, he surprised Hitler by proposing that a Jew should be made into a &quot;Gauleiter&quot; to prove to the world that Germany was innocent of accusations that Rommel had heard from the enemy&#x27;s propaganda regarding the mistreatment of Jews. Hitler replied, &quot;Dear Rommel, you understand nothing about my thinking at all.&quot;

== Relationship with Nazism ==
Rommel was not a member of the Nazi Party. Rommel and Hitler had a close and genuine, if complicated, personal relationship. Rommel, as other &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; officers, welcomed the Nazi rise to power. Numerous historians state that Rommel was one of Hitler&#x27;s favourite generals and that his close relationship with the dictator benefited both his inter-war and war-time career. Robert Citino describes Rommel as &quot;not apolitical&quot; and writes that he owed his career to Hitler, to whom Rommel&#x27;s attitude was &quot;worshipful&quot;, with Messenger agreeing that Rommel owed his tank command, his hero status and other promotions to Hitler&#x27;s interference and support.

Kesselring described Rommel&#x27;s own power over Hitler as &quot;hypnotic&quot;. In 1944, Rommel himself told Ruge and his wife that Hitler had a kind of irresistible magnetic aura (&quot;Magnetismus&quot;) and was always seemingly in an intoxicated condition. Maurice Remy identifies that the point at which their relationship became a personal one was 1939 when Rommel proudly announced to his friend Kurt Hesse that he had &quot;sort of forced Hitler to go with me (to the Hradschin Castle in Prague, in an open top car, without another bodyguard), under my personal protection ... He had entrusted himself to me and would never forget me for my excellent advice.&quot;

The close relationship between Rommel and Hitler continued following the Western campaign; after Rommel sent him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, he received a letter of thanks from the dictator. (According to Speer, he would normally send extremely unclear reports which annoyed Hitler greatly.) According to Maurice Remy, the relationship, which Remy calls &quot;a dream marriage&quot;, showed the first crack only in 1942, and later gradually turned into, in the words of German writer Ernst Jünger (in contact with Rommel in Normandy), &quot;Haßliebe&quot; (a love-hate relationship). Ruge&#x27;s diary and Rommel&#x27;s letters to his wife show his mood fluctuating wildly regarding Hitler: while he showed disgust towards the atrocities and disappointment towards the situation, he was overjoyed to welcome a visit from Hitler, only to return to depression the next day when faced with reality.

Hitler displayed the same emotions. Amid growing doubts and differences, he would remain eager for Rommel&#x27;s calls (they had almost daily, hour-long, highly animated conversations, with the preferred topic being technical innovations): he once almost grabbed the telephone out of Linge&#x27;s hand. But, according to Linge, seeing Rommel&#x27;s disobedience Hitler also realised his mistake in building up Rommel, whom not only the Afrika Korps but also the German people in general now considered the German God. Hitler tried to fix the dysfunctional relationship many times without results, with Rommel calling his attempts &quot;Sunlamp Treatment&quot;, although later he said that &quot;Once I have loved the Führer, and I still do.&quot; Remy and &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; remark that the statement was very much genuine, while Watson notes that Rommel believed he deserved to die for his treasonable plan.

Rommel was an ambitious man who took advantage of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. On one hand, he wanted personal promotion and the realisation of his ideals. On the other hand, being elevated by the traditional system that gave preferential treatment to aristocratic officers would be betrayal of his aspiration &quot;to remain a man of the troops&quot;. In 1918, Rommel refused an invitation to a prestigious officer training course, and with it, the chance to be promoted to general. Additionally, he had no inclination towards the political route, preferring to remain a soldier (&quot;Nur-Soldat&quot;). He was thus attracted by the Common Man theme which promised to level German society, the glorification of the national community, and the idea of a soldier of common background who served the Fatherland with talent and got rewarded by another common man who embodied the will of the German people. While he had much indignation towards Germany&#x27;s contemporary class problem, this self-association with the Common Man went along well with his desire to simulate the knights of the past, who also led from the front. Rommel seemed to enjoy the idea of peace, as shown by his words to his wife in August 1939: &quot;You can trust me, we have taken part in one World War, but as long as our generation live, there will not be a second&quot;, as well as his letter sent to her the night before the Invasion of Poland, in which he expressed (in Maurice Remy&#x27;s phrase) &quot;boundless optimism&quot;: &quot;I still believe the atmosphere will not become more bellicose.&quot; Butler remarks that Rommel was centre in his politics, leaning a little to the left in his attitude.

Messenger argues that Rommel&#x27;s attitude towards Hitler changed only after the Allied invasion of Normandy when Rommel came to realise that the war could not be won, while Maurice Remy suggests that Rommel never truly broke away from the relationship with Hitler but praises him for &quot;always [having] the courage to oppose him whenever his conscience required so&quot;. The historian Peter Lieb states that it was not clear whether the threat of defeat was the only reason Rommel wanted to switch sides. The relationship seemed to go significantly downhill after a conversation in July 1943, in which Hitler told Rommel that if they did not win the war, the Germans could rot. Rommel even began to think that it was lucky that his Afrika Korps were now safe as POWs and could escape Hitler&#x27;s Wagnerian ending. &quot;Die Welt&quot; commented in 2011 that Hitler chose Rommel as his favourite because he was apolitical, and that the combination of his military expertise and circumstances allowed Rommel to remain clean.

Rommel&#x27;s political inclinations were a controversial matter even among the contemporary Nazi elites. Rommel himself, while showing support to some facets of the Nazi ideology and enjoying the propaganda machine that the Nazis had built around him, was enraged by the Nazi media&#x27;s effort to portray him as an early Party member and son of a mason, forcing them to correct this misinformation. The Nazi elites were not comfortable with the idea of a national icon who did not wholeheartedly support the regime. Hitler and Goebbels, his main supporters, tended to defend him. When Rommel was being considered for appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Army in the summer of 1942, Goebbels wrote in his diary that Rommel &quot;is ideologically sound, is not just sympathetic to the National Socialists. He is a National Socialist; he is a troop leader with a gift for improvisation, personally courageous and extraordinarily inventive. These are the kinds of soldiers we need.&quot; Despite this, they gradually saw that his grasp of political realities and his views could be very different from theirs. Hitler knew, though, that Rommel&#x27;s optimistic and combative character was indispensable for his war efforts. When Rommel lost faith in the final victory and Hitler&#x27;s leadership, Hitler and Goebbels tried to find an alternative in Manstein to remedy the fighting will and &quot;political direction&quot; of other generals but did not succeed.

Meanwhile, officials who did not like Rommel, such as Bormann and Schirach, whispered to each other that he was not a Nazi at all. Rommel&#x27;s relationship to the Nazi elites, other than Hitler and Goebbels, was mostly hostile, although even powerful people like Bormann and Himmler had to tread carefully around Rommel. Himmler, who played a decisive role in Rommel&#x27;s death, tried to blame Keitel and Jodl for the deed. And in fact the deed was initiated by them. They deeply resented Rommel&#x27;s meteoric rise and had long feared that he would become the Commander-in-Chief. (Hitler also played innocent by trying to erect a monument for the national hero, on 7 March 1945) Franz Halder, after concocting several schemes to rein in Rommel through people like Paulus and Gause to no avail (even willing to undermine German operations and strategy in the process for the sole purpose of embarrassing him), concluded that Rommel was a madman with whom no one dared to cross swords because of &quot;his brutal methods and his backing from the highest levels&quot;. (Rommel imposed a high number of courts-martial, but according to Westphal, he never signed the final order. Owen Connelly comments that he could afford easy discipline because of his charisma). Rommel for his part was highly critical of Himmler, Halder, the High Command and particularly Goering who Rommel at one point called his &quot;bitterest enemy&quot;. Hitler realised that Rommel attracted the elites&#x27; negative emotions to himself, in the same way he generated optimism in the common people. Depending on the case, Hitler manipulated or exacerbated the situation in order to benefit himself, although he originally had no intent of pushing Rommel to the point of destruction. (Even when informed of Rommel&#x27;s involvement in the plot, hurt and vengeful, Hitler at first wanted to retire Rommel, and eventually offered him a last-minute chance to explain himself and refute the claims, which Rommel apparently did not take advantage of.) Ultimately Rommel&#x27;s enemies worked together to bring him down.

Maurice Remy concludes that, unwillingly and probably without ever realising it, Rommel was part of a murderous regime, although he never actually grasped the core of Nazism. Peter Lieb sees Rommel as a person who could not be put into a single drawer, although problematic by modern moral standards, and suggests people should personally decide for themselves whether Rommel should remain a role model or not. He was a Nazi general in some aspects, considering his support for the leader cult (Führerkult) and the Volksgemeinschaft, but he was not an antisemite, nor a war criminal, nor a radical ideological fighter. Historian Cornelia Hecht remarks &quot;It is really hard to know who the man behind the myth was,&quot; noting that in numerous letters he wrote to his wife during their almost 30-year marriage, he commented little on political issues as well as his personal life as a husband and a father.

== Rommel myth ==

According to some revisionist authors, an assessment of Rommel&#x27;s role in history has been hampered by views of Rommel that were formed, at least in part, for political reasons, creating what these historians have called the &quot;Rommel myth&quot;. The interpretation considered by some historians to be a myth is the depiction of the Field Marshal as an apolitical, brilliant commander and a victim of Nazi Germany who participated in the 20 July plot against Adolf Hitler. There are a notable number of authors who refer to &quot;Rommel Myth&quot; or &quot;Rommel Legend&quot; in a neutral or positive manner though. The seeds of the myth can be found first in Rommel&#x27;s drive for success as a young officer in World War I and then in his popular 1937 book &quot;Infantry Attacks,&quot; which was written in a style that diverged from the German military literature of the time and became a best-seller.

The myth then took shape during the opening years of World War II, as a component of Nazi propaganda to praise the Wehrmacht and instil optimism in the German public, with Rommel&#x27;s willing participation. When Rommel came to North Africa, it was picked up and disseminated in the West by the British press as the Allies sought to explain their continued inability to defeat the Axis forces in North Africa. The British military and political figures contributed to the heroic image of the man as Rommel resumed offensive operations in January 1942 against the British forces weakened by redeployments to the Far East. During parliamentary debate following the fall of Tobruk, Churchill described Rommel as an &quot;extraordinary bold and clever opponent&quot; and a &quot;great field commander&quot;.

According to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; following the war&#x27;s end, West Germany yearned for father figures who were needed to replace the former ones who had been unmasked as criminals. Rommel was chosen because he embodied the decent soldier, cunning yet fair-minded, and if guilty by association, not so guilty that he became unreliable, and additionally, former comrades reported that he was close to the Resistance. While everyone else was disgraced, his star became brighter than ever, and he made the historically unprecedented leap over the threshold between eras: from Hitler&#x27;s favourite general to the young republic&#x27;s hero. Cornelia Hecht notes that despite the change of times, Rommel has become the symbol of different regimes and concepts, which is paradoxical, whoever the man he really was.

At the same time, the Western Allies, and particularly the British, depicted Rommel as the &quot;good German&quot;. His reputation for conducting a clean war was used in the interest of the West German rearmament and reconciliation between the former enemies—Britain and the United States on one side and the new Federal Republic of Germany on the other. When Rommel&#x27;s alleged involvement in the plot to kill Hitler became known after the war, his stature was enhanced in the eyes of his former adversaries. Rommel was often cited in Western sources as a patriotic German willing to stand up to Hitler. Churchill wrote about him in 1950: &quot;[Rommel] (...) deserves our respect because, although a loyal German soldier, he came to hate Hitler and all his works and took part in the conspiracy of 1944 to rescue Germany by displacing the maniac and tyrant.&quot;

== Family life ==
While at Cadet School in 1911, Rommel met and became engaged to 17-year-old Lucia (Lucie) Maria Mollin (1894–1971). While stationed in Weingarten in 1913, Rommel developed a relationship with Walburga Stemmer, which produced a daughter, Gertrud, born 8 December 1913. Because of elitism in the officer corps, Stemmer&#x27;s working-class background made her unsuitable as an officer&#x27;s wife, and Rommel felt honour-bound to uphold his previous commitment to Mollin. With Mollin&#x27;s cooperation, he accepted financial responsibility for the child. Rommel and Mollin were married in November 1916 in Danzig. Rommel&#x27;s marriage was a happy one, and he wrote his wife at least one letter every day while he was in the field.

After the end of the First World War, the couple settled initially in Stuttgart, and Stemmer and her child lived with them. Gertrud was referred to as Rommel&#x27;s niece, a fiction that went unquestioned because of the enormous number of women widowed during the war. Walburga died suddenly in October 1928, and Gertrud remained a member of the household until Rommel&#x27;s death in 1944. The incident with Walburga seemed to affect Rommel for the rest of his life: he would always keep women distant. A son, Manfred Rommel, was born on 24 December 1928, and later served as Mayor of Stuttgart from 1974 to 1996.

== Commemoration ==
The German Army&#x27;s largest base, the Field Marshal Rommel Barracks, Augustdorf, is named in his honour; at the dedication in 1961, his widow Lucie and son Manfred Rommel were guests of honour. The Rommel Barracks, Dornstadt, was also named for him in 1965. A third base named for him, the Field Marshal Rommel Barracks, Osterode, closed in 2004. The was named for him in 1969 and christened by his widow; the ship was decommissioned in 1998.

The Rommel Memorial was erected in Heidenheim in 1961. In 2020, a sculpture of a landmine victim was placed next to the Rommel Memorial in Heidenheim. The city mayor Bernhard Ilg comments that, regarding &quot;the great son of Heidenheim&quot;, &quot;there are many opinions&quot;. Heidenheim eventually dedicated the Memorial towards a stand against war, militarism and extremism, stating that when the memorial was erected in 1961, statements were added that now are not compatible with modern knowledge about Rommel. Deutsche Welle noted that the 17 million mines the British, Italian, and German armies left continue to claim lives to this day.

In Aalen, after a discussion on renaming a street named after him, a new place of commemoration was created, where stelae with information on the lives of Rommel and three opponents of the regime (Eugen Bolz, Friedrich Schwarz and Karl Mikeller) stand together (Rommel&#x27;s stele is dark blue and rusty red while the others are light-coloured). The History Association of Aalen, together with an independent commission of historians from Düsseldorf, welcomes the keeping of the street&#x27;s name and notes that Rommel was neither a war criminal nor a resistance fighter, but a perpetrator and victim at the same time – he willingly served as figurehead for the regime, then lately recognised his mistake and paid for that with his life. An education program named &quot;Erwin Rommel and Aalen&quot; for schoolchildren in Aalen is also established.

In 2021, the Student Council of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) decided to change the name of their Süd-Campus (South Campus, Erlangen) into Rommel-Campus, emphasising that the city of Erlangen stands behind the name and the university needs to do the same. The university&#x27;s branch of the Education and Science Workers&#x27; Union (GEW) describes the decision as problematic considering Rommel&#x27;s history of supporting the Nazi regime militarily and propagandistically.

Numerous streets in Germany, especially in Rommel&#x27;s home state of Baden-Württemberg, are named in his honour, including the street near where his last home was located. The Rommel Museum opened in 1989 in the Villa Lindenhof in Herrlingen. The museum now operates under the name Museum Lebenslinien (Lifelines Museum), which presents the lives of Rommel and other notable residents of Herrlingen, including the poet Gertrud Kantorowicz (whose collection is presented together with the Rommel Archive inside a building on a road named after Rommel), the educators Anna Essinger and Hugo Rosenthal. There is also a Rommel Museum in Mersa Matruh in Egypt which opened in 1977, and which is located in one of Rommel&#x27;s former headquarters; various other localities and establishments in Mersa Matruh, including Rommel Beach, are also named for Rommel. The reason for the naming is that he respected the Bedouins&#x27; traditions and the sanctity of their homes (he always kept his troops at least 2 kilometres from their houses) and refused to poison the wells against the Allies, fearing doing so would harm the population.

In Italy, the annual marathon tour &quot;Rommel Trail&quot;, which is sponsored by the Protezione Civile and the autonomous region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia through its tourism agency, celebrates Rommel and the Battle of Caporetto. The naming and sponsoring (at that time by the centre-left PD) was criticised by the politician Giuseppe Civati in 2017.

<text>Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl ( , ; ; 8 April 1859 – 27 April 1938) was an Austrian-German philosopher and mathematician who established the school of phenomenology.

In his early work, he elaborated critiques of historicism and of psychologism in logic based on analyses of intentionality. In his mature work, he sought to develop a systematic foundational science based on the so-called phenomenological reduction. Arguing that transcendental consciousness sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl redefined phenomenology as a transcendental-idealist philosophy. Husserl&#x27;s thought profoundly influenced 20th-century philosophy, and he remains a notable figure in contemporary philosophy and beyond.

Husserl studied mathematics, taught by Karl Weierstrass and Leo Königsberger, and philosophy taught by Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf. He taught philosophy as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Halle from 1887, then as professor, first at Göttingen from 1901, then at Freiburg from 1916 until he retired in 1928, after which he remained highly productive. In 1933, under racial laws of the Nazi Party, Husserl was banned from using the library of the University of Freiburg due to his Jewish family background and months later resigned from the Deutsche Akademie. Following an illness, he died in Freiburg in 1938.

== Life and career ==
=== Youth and education ===
Husserl was born in 1859 in Proßnitz in the Margraviate of Moravia in the Austrian Empire (today Prostějov in the Czech Republic). He was born into a Jewish family, the second of four children. His father was a milliner. His childhood was spent in Prostějov, where he attended the secular primary school. Then Husserl traveled to Vienna to study at the &quot;Realgymnasium&quot; there, followed next by the Staatsgymnasium in Olmütz.

At the University of Leipzig from 1876 to 1878, Husserl studied mathematics, physics, and astronomy. At Leipzig, he was inspired by philosophy lectures given by Wilhelm Wundt, one of the founders of modern psychology. Then he moved to the Frederick William University of Berlin (the present-day Humboldt University of Berlin) in 1878 where he continued his study of mathematics under Leopold Kronecker and Karl Weierstrass. In Berlin he found a mentor in Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, then a former philosophy student of Franz Brentano and later the first president of Czechoslovakia. There Husserl also attended Friedrich Paulsen&#x27;s philosophy lectures. In 1881 he left for the University of Vienna to complete his mathematics studies under the supervision of Leo Königsberger (a former student of Weierstrass). At Vienna in 1883 he obtained his PhD with the work &quot;Beiträge zur Variationsrechnung&quot; (&quot;Contributions to the Calculus of variations&quot;).

Evidently as a result of his becoming familiar with the New Testament during his twenties, Husserl asked to be baptized into the Lutheran Church in 1886. Husserl&#x27;s father Adolf had died in 1884. Herbert Spiegelberg writes, &quot;While outward religious practice never entered his life any more than it did that of most academic scholars of the time, his mind remained open for the religious phenomenon as for any other genuine experience.&quot; At times Husserl saw his goal as one of moral &quot;renewal&quot;. Although a steadfast proponent of a radical and rational &quot;autonomy&quot; in all things, Husserl could also speak &quot;about his vocation and even about his mission under God&#x27;s will to find new ways for philosophy and science,&quot; observes Spiegelberg.

Following his PhD in mathematics, Husserl returned to Berlin to work as the assistant to Karl Weierstrass. Yet already Husserl had felt the desire to pursue philosophy. Then professor Weierstrass became very ill. Husserl became free to return to Vienna where, after serving a short military duty, he devoted his attention to philosophy. In 1884 at the University of Vienna he attended the lectures of Franz Brentano on philosophy and philosophical psychology. Brentano introduced him to the writings of Bernard Bolzano, Hermann Lotze, J. Stuart Mill, and David Hume. Husserl was so impressed by Brentano that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy; indeed, Franz Brentano is often credited as being his most important influence, e.g., with regard to intentionality. Following academic advice, two years later in 1886 Husserl followed Carl Stumpf, a former student of Brentano, to the University of Halle, seeking to obtain his habilitation which would qualify him to teach at the university level. There, under Stumpf&#x27;s supervision, he wrote &quot;Über den Begriff der Zahl&quot; (&quot;On the Concept of Number&quot;) in 1887, which would serve later as the basis for his first important work, &quot;Philosophie der Arithmetik&quot; (1891).

In 1887 Husserl married Malvine Steinschneider, a union that would last over fifty years. In 1892 their daughter Elizabeth was born, in 1893 their son Gerhart, and in 1894 their son Wolfgang. Elizabeth would marry in 1922, and Gerhart in 1923; Wolfgang, however, became a casualty of the First World War. Gerhart would become a philosopher of law, contributing to the subject of comparative law, teaching in the United States and after the war in Austria.

=== Professor of philosophy ===

Following his marriage Husserl began his long teaching career in philosophy. He started in 1887 as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at the University of Halle. In 1891 he published his &quot;Philosophie der Arithmetik. Psychologische und logische Untersuchungen&quot; which, drawing on his prior studies in mathematics and philosophy, proposed a psychological context as the basis of mathematics. It drew the adverse notice of Gottlob Frege, who criticized its psychologism.

In 1901 Husserl with his family moved to the University of Göttingen, where he taught as &quot;extraordinarius professor&quot;. Just prior to this a major work of his, &quot;Logische Untersuchungen&quot; (Halle, 1900–1901), was published. Volume One contains seasoned reflections on &quot;pure logic&quot; in which he carefully refutes &quot;psychologism&quot;. This work was well received and became the subject of a seminar given by Wilhelm Dilthey; Husserl in 1905 traveled to Berlin to visit Dilthey. Two years later in Italy he paid a visit to Franz Brentano, his inspiring old teacher, and to the mathematician Constantin Carathéodory. Kant and Descartes were also now influencing his thought. In 1910 he became joint editor of the journal &quot;Logos&quot;. During this period Husserl had delivered lectures on &quot;internal time consciousness&quot;, which several decades later his former students Edith Stein and Martin Heidegger edited for publication.

In 1912 at Freiburg the journal &quot;Jahrbuch für Philosophie und Phänomenologische Forschung&quot; (&quot;Yearbook for Philosophy and Phenomenological Research&quot;) was founded by Husserl and his school, and which published articles of their phenomenological movement from 1913 to 1930. His important work &quot;Ideen&quot; was published in its first issue (Vol. 1, Issue 1, 1913). Before beginning &quot;Ideen&quot;, Husserl&#x27;s thought had reached the stage where &quot;each subject is &#x27;presented&#x27; to itself, and to each all others are &#x27;presentiated&#x27; (&quot;Vergegenwärtigung&quot;), not as parts of nature but as pure consciousness&quot;. &quot;Ideen&quot; advanced his transition to a &quot;transcendental interpretation&quot; of phenomenology, a view later criticized by, among others, Jean-Paul Sartre. In &quot;Ideen&quot; Paul Ricœur sees the development of Husserl&#x27;s thought as leading &quot;from the psychological cogito to the transcendental cogito&quot;. As phenomenology further evolves, it leads (when viewed from another vantage point in Husserl&#x27;s &#x27;labyrinth&#x27;) to &quot;transcendental subjectivity&quot;. Also in &quot;Ideen&quot; Husserl explicitly elaborates the phenomenological and eidetic reductions. Ivan Ilyin and Karl Jaspers visited Husserl at Göttingen.

In October 1914 both his sons were sent to fight on the Western Front of World War I, and the following year one of them, Wolfgang Husserl, was badly injured. On 8 March 1916, on the battlefield of Verdun, Wolfgang was killed in action. The next year his other son Gerhart Husserl was wounded in the war but survived. His own mother Julia died. In November 1917 one of his outstanding students and later a noted philosophy professor in his own right, Adolf Reinach, was killed in the war while serving in Flanders.

Husserl had transferred in 1916 to the University of Freiburg (in Freiburg im Breisgau) where he continued bringing his work in philosophy to fruition, now as a full professor. Edith Stein served as his personal assistant during his first few years in Freiburg, followed later by Martin Heidegger from 1920 to 1923. The mathematician Hermann Weyl began corresponding with him in 1918. Husserl gave four lectures on Phenomenological method at University College London in 1922. The University of Berlin in 1923 called on him to relocate there, but he declined the offer. In 1926 Heidegger dedicated his book &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot; (&quot;Being and Time&quot;) to him &quot;in grateful respect and friendship.&quot; Husserl remained in his professorship at Freiburg until he requested retirement, teaching his last class on 25 July 1928. A &quot;Festschrift&quot; to celebrate his seventieth birthday was presented to him on 8 April 1929.

Despite retirement, Husserl gave several notable lectures. The first, at Paris in 1929, led to &quot;Méditations cartésiennes&quot; (Paris 1931). Husserl here reviews the phenomenological epoché (or phenomenological reduction), presented earlier in his pivotal &quot;Ideen&quot; (1913), in terms of a further reduction of experience to what he calls a &#x27;sphere of ownness.&#x27; From within this sphere, which Husserl enacts to show the impossibility of solipsism, the transcendental ego finds itself always already paired with the lived body of another ego, another monad. This &#x27;a priori&#x27; interconnection of bodies, given in perception, is what founds the interconnection of consciousnesses known as transcendental intersubjectivity, which Husserl would go on to describe at length in volumes of unpublished writings. There has been a debate over whether or not Husserl&#x27;s description of ownness and its movement into intersubjectivity is sufficient to reject the charge of solipsism, to which Descartes, for example, was subject. One argument against Husserl&#x27;s description works this way: instead of infinity and the Deity being the ego&#x27;s gateway to the Other, as in Descartes, Husserl&#x27;s ego in the &quot;Cartesian Meditations&quot; itself becomes transcendent. It remains, however, alone (unconnected). Only the ego&#x27;s grasp &quot;by analogy&quot; of the Other (e.g., by conjectural reciprocity) allows the possibility for an &#x27;objective&#x27; intersubjectivity, and hence for community.

In 1933, the racial laws of the new National Socialist German Workers Party were enacted. On 6 April Husserl was banned from using the library at the University of Freiburg, or any other academic library; the following week, after a public outcry, he was reinstated. Yet his colleague Heidegger was elected Rector of the university on 21–22 April, and joined the Nazi Party. By contrast, in July Husserl resigned from the Deutsche Akademie.
Later Husserl lectured at Prague in 1935 and Vienna in 1936, which resulted in a very differently styled work that, while innovative, is no less problematic: &quot;Die Krisis&quot; (Belgrade 1936). Husserl describes here the cultural crisis gripping Europe, then approaches a philosophy of history, discussing Galileo, Descartes, several British philosophers, and Kant. The apolitical Husserl before had specifically avoided such historical discussions, pointedly preferring to go directly to an investigation of consciousness. Merleau-Ponty and others question whether Husserl here does not undercut his own position, in that Husserl had attacked in principle historicism, while specifically designing his phenomenology to be rigorous enough to transcend the limits of history. On the contrary, Husserl may be indicating here that historical traditions are merely features given to the pure ego&#x27;s intuition, like any other. A longer section follows on the &quot;lifeworld&quot; [&quot;Lebenswelt&quot;], one not observed by the objective logic of science, but a world seen through subjective experience. Yet a problem arises similar to that dealing with &#x27;history&#x27; above, a chicken-and-egg problem. Does the lifeworld contextualize and thus compromise the gaze of the pure ego, or does the phenomenological method nonetheless raise the ego up transcendent? These last writings presented the fruits of his professional life. Since his university retirement Husserl had &quot;worked at a tremendous pace, producing several major works.&quot;

After suffering a fall in the autumn of 1937, the philosopher became ill with pleurisy. Edmund Husserl died in Freiburg on 27 April 1938, having just turned 79. His wife Malvine survived him. Eugen Fink, his research assistant, delivered his eulogy. Gerhard Ritter was the only Freiburg faculty member to attend the funeral, as an anti-Nazi protest.

=== Heidegger and the Nazi era ===
Husserl was rumoured to have been denied the use of the library at Freiburg as a result of the anti-Jewish legislation of April 1933. Relatedly, among other disabilities, Husserl was unable to publish his works in Nazi Germany [see above footnote to &quot;Die Krisis&quot; (1936)]. It was also rumoured that his former pupil Martin Heidegger informed Husserl that he was discharged, but it was actually the previous rector.
Apparently Husserl and Heidegger had moved apart during the 1920s, which became clearer after 1928 when Husserl retired and Heidegger succeeded to his university chair. In the summer of 1929 Husserl had studied carefully selected writings of Heidegger, coming to the conclusion that on several of their key positions they differed: e.g., Heidegger substituted &quot;Dasein&quot; [&quot;Being-there&quot;] for the pure ego, thus transforming phenomenology into an anthropology, a type of psychologism strongly disfavored by Husserl. Such observations of Heidegger, along with a critique of Max Scheler, were put into a lecture Husserl gave to various &quot;Kant Societies&quot; in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Halle during 1931 entitled &quot;Phänomenologie und Anthropologie&quot;.

In the war-time 1941 edition of Heidegger&#x27;s primary work, &quot;Being and Time&quot; (&quot;&quot;, first published in 1927), the original dedication to Husserl was removed. This was not due to a negation of the relationship between the two philosophers, however, but rather was the result of a suggested censorship by Heidegger&#x27;s publisher who feared that the book might otherwise be banned by the Nazi regime. The dedication can still be found in a footnote on page 38, thanking Husserl for his guidance and generosity. Husserl had died three years earlier. In post-war editions of &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot; the dedication to Husserl is restored. The complex, troubled, and sundered philosophical relationship between Husserl and Heidegger has been widely discussed.

On 4 May 1933, Professor Edmund Husserl addressed the recent regime change in Germany and its consequences:The future alone will judge which was the true Germany in 1933, and who were the true Germans—those who subscribe to the more or less materialistic-mythical racial prejudices of the day, or those Germans pure in heart and mind, heirs to the great Germans of the past whose tradition they revere and perpetuate.After his death, Husserl&#x27;s manuscripts, amounting to approximately 40,000 pages of &quot;Gabelsberger&quot; stenography and his complete research library, were in 1939 smuggled to the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium by the Franciscan priest Herman Van Breda. There they were deposited at Leuven to form the &quot;Husserl-Archives&quot; of the Higher Institute of Philosophy. Much of the material in his research manuscripts has since been published in the Husserliana critical edition series.

== Development of his thought ==

=== Several early themes ===
In his first works, Husserl combined mathematics, psychology, and philosophy with the goal of providing a sound foundation for mathematics. He analyzed the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then built up a theory on this analysis. He used methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass he derived the idea of generating
the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects. From Brentano and Stumpf he took the distinction between &quot;proper&quot; and &quot;improper&quot; presenting. In an example, Husserl explained this in the following way: if someone is standing in front of a house, they have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if they are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e.g. the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, the person can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic, as Husserl also calls it) one if they only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc. Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Logical Investigations&quot; (1900–1901) is considered the starting point for the formal theory of wholes and their parts known as mereology.

Another important element that Husserl took over from Brentano was intentionality, the notion that the main characteristic of consciousness is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarised as &quot;aboutness&quot; or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of &quot;mental phenomena&quot;, by which they could be distinguished from &quot;physical phenomena&quot;. Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act, has a content, is directed at an object (the &quot;intentional object&quot;). Every belief, desire, etc. has an object that it is about: the believed, the wanted. Brentano used the expression &quot;intentional inexistence&quot; to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind. The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish mental phenomena and physical phenomena, because physical phenomena lack intentionality altogether.

=== The elaboration of phenomenology ===
Some years after the 1900–1901 publication of his main work, the &quot;Logische Untersuchungen&quot; (&quot;Logical Investigations&quot;), Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed (the objects as intended). Knowledge of essences would only be possible by &quot;bracketing&quot; all assumptions about the existence of an external world. This procedure he called &quot;epoché&quot;. These new concepts prompted the publication of the &quot;Ideen&quot; (&quot;Ideas&quot;) in 1913, in which they were at first incorporated, and a plan for a second edition of the &quot;Logische Untersuchungen&quot;.

From the &quot;Ideen&quot; onward, Husserl concentrated on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. The metaphysical problem of establishing the reality of what people perceive, as distinct from the perceiving subject, was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a transcendental idealist. Husserl proposed that the world of objects—and of ways in which people direct themselves toward and perceive those objects—is normally conceived of in what he called the &quot;natural attitude&quot;, which is characterized by a belief that objects exist distinct from the perceiving subject and exhibit properties that people see as emanating from them (this attitude is also called physicalist objectivism). Husserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how people, in their many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually &quot;constitute&quot; them (to be distinguished from materially creating objects or objects merely being figments of the imagination); in the Phenomenological standpoint, the object ceases to be something simply &quot;external&quot; and ceases to be seen as providing indicators about what it is, and becomes a grouping of perceptual and functional aspects that imply one another under the idea of a particular object or &quot;type&quot;. The notion of objects as real is not expelled by phenomenology, but &quot;bracketed&quot; as a way in which people regard objectsinstead of a feature that inheres in an object&#x27;s essence founded in the relation between the object and the perceiver. To better understand the world of appearances and objects, phenomenology attempts to identify the invariant features of how objects are perceived and pushes attributions of reality into their role as an attribution about the things people perceive (or an assumption underlying how people perceive objects). The major dividing line in Husserl&#x27;s thought is the turn to transcendental idealism.

In a later period, Husserl began to wrestle with the complicated issues of intersubjectivity, specifically, how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity (&quot;Cartesian Meditations&quot;, Meditation V). Husserl tries new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of phenomenology to scientific inquiry (and specifically to psychology) and what it means to &quot;bracket&quot; the natural attitude. &quot;The Crisis of the European Sciences&quot; is Husserl&#x27;s unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues. In it, Husserl for the first time attempts a historical overview of the development of Western philosophy and science, emphasizing the challenges presented by their increasingly one-sidedly empirical and naturalistic orientation. Husserl declares that mental and spiritual reality possess their own reality independent of any physical basis, and that a science of the mind (&#x27;Geisteswissenschaft&#x27;) must be established on as scientific a foundation as the natural sciences have managed: &quot;It is my conviction that intentional phenomenology has for the first time made spirit as spirit the field of systematic scientific experience, thus effecting a total transformation of the task of knowledge.&quot;

Husserl&#x27;s thought is revolutionary in several ways, most notably in the distinction between &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;phenomenological&quot; modes of understanding. In the former, sense-perception in correspondence with the material realm constitutes the known reality, and understanding is premised on the accuracy of the perception and the objective knowability of what is called the &quot;real world&quot;. Phenomenological understanding strives to be rigorously &quot;presuppositionless&quot; by means of what Husserl calls &quot;phenomenological reduction&quot;. This reduction is not conditioned but rather transcendental: in Husserl&#x27;s terms, pure consciousness of absolute Being. In Husserl&#x27;s work, consciousness of any given thing calls for discerning its meaning as an &quot;intentional object&quot;. Such an object does not simply strike the senses, to be interpreted or misinterpreted by mental reason; it has already been selected and grasped, grasping being an etymological connotation, of &quot;percipere&quot;, the root of &quot;perceive&quot;.

=== Meaning and object ===
From &quot;Logical Investigations&quot; (1900/1901) to &quot;Experience and Judgment&quot; (published in 1939), Husserl expressed clearly the difference between meaning and object. He identified several different kinds of names. For example, there are names that have the role of properties that uniquely identify an object. Each of these names expresses a meaning and designates the same object. Examples of this are &quot;the victor in Jena&quot; and &quot;the loser in Waterloo&quot;, or &quot;the equilateral triangle&quot; and &quot;the equiangular triangle&quot;; in both cases, both names express different meanings, but designate the same object. There are names which have no meaning, but have the role of designating an object: &quot;Aristotle&quot;, &quot;Socrates&quot;, and so on. Finally, there are names which designate a variety of objects. These are called &quot;universal names&quot;; their meaning is a &quot;concept&quot; and refers to a series of objects (the extension of the concept). The way people know sensible objects is called &quot;sensible intuition&quot;.

Husserl also identifies a series of &quot;formal words&quot; which are necessary to form sentences and have no sensible . Examples of formal words are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;more than&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, &quot;under&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;group&quot;, and so on. Every sentence must contain formal words to designate what Husserl calls &quot;formal categories&quot;. There are two kinds of categories: meaning categories and formal-ontological categories. Meaning categories relate judgments; they include forms of conjunction, disjunction, forms of plural, among others. Formal-ontological categories relate objects and include notions such as set, cardinal number, ordinal number, part and whole, relation, and so on. The way people know these categories is through a faculty of understanding called &quot;categorial intuition&quot;.

Through sensible intuition, consciousness constitutes what Husserl calls a &quot;situation of affairs&quot; (). It is a passive constitution where objects themselves are presented. To this situation of affairs, through categorial intuition, people are able to constitute a &quot;state of affairs&quot; (). One situation of affairs through objective acts of consciousness (acts of constituting categorially) can serve as the basis for constituting multiple states of affairs. For example, suppose &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are two sensible objects in a certain situation of affairs. It can be used as the basis to say, &quot;&quot;a&quot;&lt;&quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&quot;, two judgments which designate the same state of affairs. For Husserl a sentence has a proposition or judgment as its meaning, and refers to a state of affairs which has a situation of affairs as a reference base.

=== Formal and regional ontology ===
Husserl sees ontology as a &quot;science of essences&quot;. &quot;Sciences of essences&quot; are contrasted with &quot;factual sciences&quot;: the former are knowable a priori and provide the foundation for the later, which are knowable a posteriori. Ontology as a science of essences is not interested in &quot;actual facts&quot;, but in the essences themselves, whether they &quot;have instances or not&quot;. Husserl distinguishes between &quot;formal ontology&quot;, which investigates the essence of &quot;objectivity in general&quot;, and &quot;regional ontologies&quot;, which study &quot;regional essences&quot; that are shared by all entities belonging to the region. Regions correspond to the highest genera of concrete entities: material nature, personal consciousness and interpersonal spirit. Husserl&#x27;s method for studying ontology and sciences of essence in general is called eidetic variation. It involves imagining an object of the kind under investigation and varying its features. The changed feature is &quot;inessential&quot; to this kind if the object can survive its change, otherwise it belongs to the &quot;kind&#x27;s essence&quot;. For example, a triangle remains a triangle if one of its sides is extended but it ceases to be a triangle if a fourth side is added. Regional ontology involves applying this method to the essences corresponding to the highest genera.

=== Philosophy of logic and mathematics ===
Husserl believed that &quot;truth-in-itself&quot; has as ontological correlate &quot;being-in-itself&quot;, just as meaning categories have formal-ontological categories as correlates. Logic is a formal theory of judgment, that studies the formal &quot;a priori&quot; relations among judgments using meaning categories. Mathematics, on the other hand, is formal ontology; it studies all the possible forms of being (of objects). Hence for both logic and mathematics, the different formal categories are the objects of study, not the sensible objects themselves. The problem with the psychological approach to mathematics and logic is that it fails to account for the fact that this approach is about formal categories, and not simply about abstractions from sensibility alone. The reason why sensible objects are not dealt with in mathematics is because of another faculty of understanding called &quot;categorial abstraction.&quot; Through this faculty people are able to get rid of sensible components of judgments, and just focus on formal categories themselves.

Thanks to &quot;eidetic reduction&quot; (or &quot;essential intuition&quot;), people are able to grasp the possibility, impossibility, necessity and contingency among concepts and among formal categories. Categorial intuition, along with categorial abstraction and eidetic reduction, are the basis for logical and mathematical knowledge.

Husserl criticized the logicians of his day for not focusing on the relation between subjective processes that offer objective knowledge of pure logic. All subjective activities of consciousness need an ideal correlate, and objective logic (constituted noematically) as it is constituted by consciousness needs a noetic correlate (the subjective activities of consciousness).

Husserl stated that logic has three strata, each further away from consciousness and psychology than those that precede it.
* The first stratum is what Husserl called a &quot;morphology of meanings&quot; concerning &quot;a priori&quot; ways to relate judgments to make them meaningful. In this stratum people elaborate a &quot;pure grammar&quot; or a logical syntax, and he would call its rules &quot;laws to prevent non-sense&quot;, which would be similar to what logic calls today &quot;formation rules&quot;. Mathematics, as logic&#x27;s ontological correlate, also has a similar stratum, a &quot;morphology of formal-ontological categories&quot;.
* The second stratum would be called by Husserl &quot;logic of consequence&quot; or the &quot;logic of non-contradiction&quot; which explores all possible forms of true judgments. He includes here syllogistic classic logic, propositional logic and that of predicates. This is a semantic stratum, and the rules of this stratum would be the &quot;laws to avoid counter-sense&quot; or &quot;laws to prevent contradiction&quot;. They are very similar to today&#x27;s logic &quot;transformation rules&quot;. Mathematics also has a similar stratum which is based among others on pure theory of pluralities, and a pure theory of numbers. They provide a science of the conditions of possibility of any theory whatsoever. Husserl also talked about what he called &quot;logic of truth&quot; which consists of the formal laws of possible truth and its modalities, and precedes the third logical third stratum.
* The third stratum is metalogical, what he called a &quot;theory of all possible forms of theories.&quot; It explores all possible theories in an &quot;a priori&quot; fashion, rather than the possibility of theory in general. Theories of possible relations between pure forms of theories could be established; these logical relations could in turn be investigated using deduction. The logician is free to see the extension of this deductive, theoretical sphere of pure logic.

The ontological correlate to the third stratum is the &quot;theory of manifolds&quot;. In formal ontology, it is a free investigation where a mathematician can assign several meanings to several symbols, and all their possible valid deductions in a general and indeterminate manner. It is, properly speaking, the most universal mathematics of all. Through the posit of certain indeterminate objects (formal-ontological categories) as well as any combination of mathematical axioms, mathematicians can explore the apodeictic connections between them, as long as consistency is preserved.

According to Husserl, this view of logic and mathematics accounted for the objectivity of a series of mathematical developments of his time, such as &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifolds (both Euclidean and non-Euclidean), Hermann Grassmann&#x27;s theory of extensions, William Rowan Hamilton&#x27;s Hamiltonians, Sophus Lie&#x27;s theory of transformation groups, and Cantor&#x27;s set theory.

Jacob Klein was one student of Husserl who pursued this line of inquiry, seeking to &quot;desedimentize&quot; mathematics and the mathematical sciences.

== Husserl and psychologism ==

=== Philosophy of arithmetic and Frege ===
After obtaining his PhD in mathematics, Husserl began analyzing the foundations of mathematics from a psychological point of view. In his habilitation thesis, &quot;On the Concept of Number&quot; (1886) and in his &quot;Philosophy of Arithmetic&quot; (1891), Husserl sought, by employing Brentano&#x27;s descriptive psychology, to define the natural numbers in a way that advanced the methods and techniques of Karl Weierstrass, Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor, Gottlob Frege, and other contemporary mathematicians. Later, in the first volume of his &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;, the &quot;Prolegomena of Pure Logic&quot;, Husserl, while attacking the psychologistic point of view in logic and mathematics, also appears to reject much of his early work, although the forms of psychologism analysed and refuted in the &quot;Prolegomena&quot; did not apply directly to his &quot;Philosophy of Arithmetic&quot;. Some scholars question whether Frege&#x27;s negative review of the &quot;Philosophy of Arithmetic&quot; helped turn Husserl towards modern Platonism, but he had already discovered the work of Bernard Bolzano independently around 1890/91. In his &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;, Husserl explicitly mentioned Bolzano, G. W. Leibniz and Hermann Lotze as inspirations for his newer position.

Husserl&#x27;s review of Ernst Schröder, published before Frege&#x27;s landmark 1892 article, clearly distinguishes sense from reference; thus Husserl&#x27;s notions of noema and object also arose independently. Likewise, in his criticism of Frege in the &quot;Philosophy of Arithmetic&quot;, Husserl remarks on the distinction between the content and the extension of a concept. Moreover, the distinction between the subjective mental act, namely the content of a concept, and the (external) object, was developed independently by Brentano and his school, and may have surfaced as early as Brentano&#x27;s 1870s lectures on logic.

Scholars such as J. N. Mohanty, Claire Ortiz Hill, and Guillermo E. Rosado Haddock, among others, have argued that Husserl&#x27;s so-called change from psychologism to Platonism came about independently of Frege&#x27;s review.
For example, the review falsely accuses Husserl of subjectivizing everything, so that no objectivity is possible, and falsely attributes to him a notion of abstraction whereby objects disappear until all that remains are numbers as mere ghosts. Contrary to what Frege states, in Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Arithmetic&quot; there are already two different kinds of representations: subjective and objective. Moreover, objectivity is clearly defined in that work. Frege&#x27;s attack seems to be directed at certain foundational doctrines then current in Weierstrass&#x27;s Berlin School, of which Husserl and Cantor cannot be said to be orthodox representatives.

Furthermore, various sources indicate that Husserl changed his mind about psychologism as early as 1890, a year before he published the &quot;Philosophy of Arithmetic&quot;. Husserl stated that by the time he published that book, he had already changed his mind—that he had doubts about psychologism from the very outset. He attributed this change of mind to his reading of Leibniz, Bolzano, Lotze, and David Hume. Husserl makes no mention of Frege as a decisive factor in this change. In his &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;, Husserl mentions Frege only twice, once in a footnote to point out that he had retracted three pages of his criticism of Frege&#x27;s &quot;The Foundations of Arithmetic&quot;, and again to question Frege&#x27;s use of the word &quot;&quot; to designate &quot;reference&quot; rather than &quot;meaning&quot; (sense).

In a letter dated 24 May 1891, Frege thanked Husserl for sending him a copy of the &quot;Philosophy of Arithmetic&quot; and Husserl&#x27;s review of Ernst Schröder&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. In the same letter, Frege used the review of Schröder&#x27;s book to analyze Husserl&#x27;s notion of the sense of reference of concept words. Hence Frege recognized, as early as 1891, that Husserl distinguished between sense and reference. Consequently, Frege and Husserl independently elaborated a theory of sense and reference before 1891.

Commentators argue that Husserl&#x27;s notion of noema has nothing to do with Frege&#x27;s notion of sense, because &quot;noemata&quot; are necessarily fused with noeses which are the conscious activities of consciousness. &quot;Noemata&quot; have three different levels:
* The substratum, which is never presented to the consciousness, and is the support of all the properties of the object;
* The &quot;noematic&quot; senses, which are the different ways the objects are presented to us;
* The modalities of being (possible, doubtful, existent, non-existent, absurd, and so on).
Consequently, in intentional activities, even non-existent objects can be constituted, and form part of the whole noema. Frege, however, did not conceive of objects as forming parts of senses: If a proper name denotes a non-existent object, it does not have a reference, hence concepts with no objects have no truth value in arguments. Moreover, Husserl did not maintain that predicates of sentences designate concepts. According to Frege the reference of a sentence is a truth value; for Husserl it is a &quot;state of affairs.&quot; Frege&#x27;s notion of &quot;sense&quot; is unrelated to Husserl&#x27;s noema, while the latter&#x27;s notions of &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;object&quot; differ from those of Frege.

In detail, Husserl&#x27;s conception of logic and mathematics differs from that of Frege, who held that arithmetic could be derived from logic. For Husserl this is not the case: mathematics (with the exception of geometry) is the ontological correlate of logic, and while both fields are related, neither one is strictly reducible to the other.

=== Husserl&#x27;s criticism of psychologism ===
Reacting against authors such as John Stuart Mill, Christoph von Sigwart and his own former teacher Brentano, Husserl criticised their psychologism in mathematics and logic, i.e. their conception of these abstract and &quot;a priori&quot; sciences as having an essentially empirical foundation and a prescriptive or descriptive nature. According to psychologism, logic would not be an autonomous discipline, but a branch of psychology, either proposing a prescriptive and practical &quot;art&quot; of correct judgement (as Brentano and some of his more orthodox students did) or a description of the factual processes of human thought. Husserl pointed out that the failure of anti-psychologists to defeat psychologism was a result of being unable to distinguish between the foundational, theoretical side of logic, and the applied, practical side. Pure logic does not deal at all with &quot;thoughts&quot; or &quot;judgings&quot; as mental episodes but about &quot;a priori&quot; laws and conditions for any theory and any judgments whatsoever, conceived as propositions in themselves.

:&quot;Here &#x27;Judgement&#x27; has the same meaning as &#x27;proposition&#x27;, understood, not as a grammatical, but as an ideal unity of meaning. This is the case with all the distinctions of acts or forms of judgement, which provide the foundations for the laws of pure logic. Categorial, hypothetical, disjunctive, existential judgements, and however else we may call them, in pure logic are not names for classes of judgements, but for ideal forms of propositions.&quot;

Since &quot;truth-in-itself&quot; has &quot;being-in-itself&quot; as ontological correlate, and since psychologists reduce truth (and hence logic) to empirical psychology, the inevitable consequence is scepticism. Psychologists have not been successful either in showing how induction or psychological processes can justify the absolute certainty of logical principles, such as the principles of identity and non-contradiction. It is therefore futile to base certain logical laws and principles on uncertain processes of the mind.

This confusion made by psychologism (and related disciplines such as biologism and anthropologism) can be due to three specific prejudices:

# The first prejudice is the supposition that logic is somehow normative in nature. Husserl argues that logic is theoretical, i.e., that logic itself proposes &quot;a priori&quot; laws which are themselves the basis of the normative side of logic. Since mathematics is related to logic, he cites an example from mathematics: a formula like &quot;(a + b)(a – b) = a² – b²&quot; does not offer any insight into how to think mathematically. It just expresses a truth. A proposition that says: &quot;The product of the sum and the difference of a and b &quot;should&quot; give the difference of the squares of a and b&quot; does express a normative proposition, but this normative statement &quot;is based on&quot; the theoretical statement &quot;(a + b)(a – b) = a² – b²&quot;.
# For psychologists, the acts of judging, reasoning, deriving, and so on, are all psychological processes. Therefore, it is the role of psychology to provide the foundation of these processes. Husserl states that this effort made by psychologists is a &quot;metábasis eis állo génos&quot; (). It is a metábasis because psychology cannot provide any foundations for &quot;a priori&quot; laws which themselves are the basis for all correct thought. Psychologists have the problem of confusing intentional activities with the object of these activities. It is important to distinguish between the act of judging and the judgment itself, the act of counting and the number itself, and so on. Counting five objects is undeniably a psychological process, but the number 5 is not.
# Judgments can be true or not true. Psychologists argue that judgments are true because they become &quot;evidently&quot; true to us. This evidence, a psychological process that &quot;guarantees&quot; truth, is indeed a psychological process. Husserl responds by saying that truth itself, as well as logical laws, always remain valid regardless of psychological &quot;evidence&quot; that they are true. No psychological process can explain the &quot;a priori&quot; objectivity of these logical truths.

From this criticism to psychologism, the distinction between psychological acts and their intentional objects, and the difference between the normative side of logic and the theoretical side, derives from a Platonist conception of logic. This means that logical and mathematical laws should be regarded as being independent of the human mind, and also as an autonomy of meanings. It is essentially the difference between the real (everything subject to time) and the ideal or irreal (everything that is atemporal), such as logical truths, mathematical entities, mathematical truths and meanings in general.

== Influence ==

David Carr commented on Husserl following in his 1970 dissertation at Yale: &quot;It is well known that Husserl was always disappointed at the tendency of his students to go their own way, to embark upon fundamental revisions of phenomenology rather than engage in the communal task&quot; as originally intended by the radical new science. Notwithstanding, he did attract philosophers to phenomenology.

Martin Heidegger is the best known of Husserl&#x27;s students, the one whom Husserl chose as his successor at Freiburg. Heidegger&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Being and Time&quot; was dedicated to Husserl. They shared their thoughts and worked alongside each other for over a decade at the University of Freiburg, Heidegger being Husserl&#x27;s assistant during 1920–1923. Heidegger&#x27;s early work followed his teacher, but with time he began to develop new insights distinctively variant. Husserl became increasingly critical of Heidegger&#x27;s work, especially in 1929, and included pointed criticism of Heidegger in lectures he gave during 1931. Heidegger, while acknowledging his debt to Husserl, followed a political position offensive and harmful to Husserl after the Nazis came to power in 1933, Husserl being of Jewish origin and Heidegger infamously being then a Nazi proponent. Academic discussion of Husserl and Heidegger is extensive.

At Göttingen in 1913 Adolf Reinach (1884–1917) &quot;was now Husserl&#x27;s right hand. He was above all the mediator between Husserl and the students, for he understood extremely well how to deal with other persons, whereas Husserl was pretty much helpless in this respect.&quot; He was an original editor of Husserl&#x27;s new journal, &quot;Jahrbuch&quot;; one of his works (giving a phenomenological analysis of the law of obligations) appeared in its first issue. Reinach was widely admired and a remarkable teacher. Husserl, in his 1917 obituary, wrote, &quot;He wanted to draw only from the deepest sources, he wanted to produce only work of enduring value. And through his wise restraint he succeeded in this.&quot;

Edith Stein was Husserl&#x27;s student at Göttingen and Freiburg while she wrote her doctoral thesis &quot;The Empathy Problem as it Developed Historically and Considered Phenomenologically&quot; (1916). She then became his assistant at Freiburg in 1916–18. She later adapted her phenomenology to the modern school of modern Thomism.

Ludwig Landgrebe became assistant to Husserl in 1923. From 1939 he collaborated with Eugen Fink at the Husserl-Archives in Leuven. In 1954 he became leader of the Husserl-Archives. Landgrebe is known as one of Husserl&#x27;s closest associates, but also for his independent views relating to history, religion and politics as seen from the viewpoints of existentialist philosophy and metaphysics.

Eugen Fink was a close associate of Husserl during the 1920s and 1930s. He wrote the &quot;Sixth Cartesian Meditation&quot; which Husserl said was the truest expression and continuation of his own work. Fink delivered the eulogy for Husserl in 1938.

Roman Ingarden, an early student of Husserl at Freiburg, corresponded with Husserl into the mid-1930s. Ingarden did not accept, however, the later transcendental idealism of Husserl which he thought would lead to relativism. Ingarden has written his work in German and Polish. In his &quot;Spór o istnienie świata&quot; (Ger.: &quot;Der Streit um die Existenz der Welt&quot;, Eng.: &quot;Dispute about existence of the world&quot;) he created his own realistic position, which also helped to spread phenomenology in Poland.

Max Scheler met Husserl in Halle in 1901 and found in his phenomenology a methodological breakthrough for his own philosophy. Scheler, who was at Göttingen when Husserl taught there, was one of the original few editors of the journal &quot;Jahrbuch für Philosophie und Phänomenologische Forschung&quot; (1913). Scheler&#x27;s work &quot;Formalism in Ethics and Nonformal Ethics of Value&quot; appeared in the new journal (1913 and 1916) and drew acclaim. The personal relationship between the two men, however, became strained, due to Scheler&#x27;s legal troubles, and Scheler returned to Munich. Although Scheler later criticised Husserl&#x27;s idealistic logical approach and proposed instead a &quot;phenomenology of love&quot;, he states that he remained &quot;deeply indebted&quot; to Husserl throughout his work.

Nicolai Hartmann was once thought to be at the center of phenomenology, but perhaps no longer. In 1921 the prestige of Hartmann the Neo-Kantian, who was Professor of Philosophy at Marburg, was added to the Movement; he &quot;publicly declared his solidarity with the actual work of &quot;die Phänomenologie&quot;.&quot; Yet Hartmann&#x27;s connections were with Max Scheler and the Munich circle; Husserl himself evidently did not consider him as a phenomenologist. His philosophy, however, is said to include an innovative use of the method.

Emmanuel Levinas in 1929 gave a presentation at one of Husserl&#x27;s last seminars in Freiburg. Also that year he wrote on Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Ideen&quot; (1913) a long review published by a French journal. With Gabrielle Peiffer, Levinas translated into French Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Méditations cartésiennes&quot; (1931). He was at first impressed with Heidegger and began a book on him, but broke off the project when Heidegger became involved with the Nazis. After the war he wrote on Jewish spirituality; most of his family had been murdered by the Nazis in Lithuania. Levinas then began to write works that would become widely known and admired.

Alfred Schutz&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of the Social World&quot; seeks to rigorously ground Max Weber&#x27;s interpretive sociology in Husserl&#x27;s phenomenology. Husserl was impressed by this work and asked Schutz to be his assistant.

Jean-Paul Sartre was also largely influenced by Husserl, although he later came to disagree with key points in his analyses. Sartre rejected Husserl&#x27;s transcendental interpretations begun in his &quot;Ideen&quot; (1913) and instead followed Heidegger&#x27;s ontology.

Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Perception&quot; is influenced by Edmund Husserl&#x27;s work on perception, intersubjectivity, intentionality, space, and temporality, including Husserl&#x27;s theory of retention and protention. Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s description of &#x27;motor intentionality&#x27; and sexuality, for example, retain the important structure of the noetic/noematic correlation of &quot;Ideen I&quot;, yet further concretize what it means for Husserl when consciousness particularizes itself into modes of intuition. Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s most clearly Husserlian work is, perhaps, &quot;the Philosopher and His Shadow.&quot; Depending on the interpretation of Husserl&#x27;s accounts of eidetic intuition, given in Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenological Psychology&quot; and &quot;Experience and Judgment&quot;, it may be that Merleau-Ponty did not accept the &quot;eidetic reduction&quot; nor the &quot;pure essence&quot; said to result. Merleau-Ponty was the first student to study at the Husserl-archives in Leuven.

Gabriel Marcel explicitly rejected existentialism, due to Sartre, but not phenomenology, which has enjoyed a wide following among French Catholics. He appreciated Husserl, Scheler, and (but with apprehension) Heidegger. His expressions like &quot;ontology of sensability&quot; when referring to the body, indicate influence by phenomenological thought.

Kurt Gödel is known to have read &quot;Cartesian Meditations&quot;. He expressed very strong appreciation for Husserl&#x27;s work, especially with regard to &quot;bracketing&quot; or &quot;epoché&quot;.

Hermann Weyl&#x27;s interest in intuitionistic logic and impredicativity appears to have resulted from his reading of Husserl. He was introduced to Husserl&#x27;s work through his wife, Helene Joseph, herself a student of Husserl at Göttingen.

Colin Wilson has used Husserl&#x27;s ideas extensively in developing his &quot;New Existentialism,&quot; particularly in regards to his &quot;intentionality of consciousness,&quot; which he mentions in a number of his books.

Rudolf Carnap was also influenced by Husserl, not only concerning Husserl&#x27;s notion of essential insight that Carnap used in his &quot;Der Raum&quot;, but also his notion of &quot;formation rules&quot; and &quot;transformation rules&quot; is founded on Husserl&#x27;s philosophy of logic.

Karol Wojtyla, who would later become Pope John Paul II, was influenced by Husserl. Phenomenology appears in his major work, &quot;The Acting Person&quot; (1969). Originally published in Polish, it was translated by Andrzej Potocki and edited by Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka in the &quot;Analecta Husserliana&quot;. &quot;The Acting Person&quot; combines phenomenological work with Thomistic ethics.
Paul Ricœur has translated many works of Husserl into French and has also written many of his own studies of the philosopher. Among other works, Ricœur employed phenomenology in his &quot;Freud and Philosophy&quot; (1965).

Jacques Derrida wrote several critical studies of Husserl early in his academic career. These included his dissertation, &quot;The Problem of Genesis in Husserl&#x27;s Philosophy,&quot; and also his introduction to &quot;The Origin of Geometry&quot;. Derrida continued to make reference to Husserl in works such as &quot;Of Grammatology&quot;.

Stanisław Leśniewski and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz were inspired by Husserl&#x27;s formal analysis of language. Accordingly, they employed phenomenology in the development of categorial grammar.

José Ortega y Gasset visited Husserl at Freiburg in 1934. He credited phenomenology for having &#x27;liberated him&#x27; from a narrow neo-Kantian thought. While perhaps not a phenomenologist himself, he introduced the philosophy to Iberia and Latin America.

Wilfrid Sellars, an influential figure in the so-called &quot;Pittsburgh School&quot; (Robert Brandom, John McDowell) had been a student of Marvin Farber, a pupil of Husserl, and was influenced by phenomenology through him:

In his 1942 essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, absurdist philosopher Albert Camus acknowledges Husserl as a previous philosopher who described and attempted to deal with the feeling of the absurd, but claims he committed &quot;philosophical suicide&quot; by elevating reason and ultimately arriving at ubiquitous Platonic forms and an abstract god.

Hans Blumenberg received his habilitation in 1950, with a dissertation on ontological distance, an inquiry into the crisis of Husserl&#x27;s phenomenology.

Roger Scruton, despite some disagreements with Husserl, drew upon his work in &quot;Sexual Desire&quot; (1986).

The influence of the Husserlian phenomenological tradition in the 21st century extends beyond the confines of the European and North American legacies. It has already started to impact (indirectly) scholarship in Eastern and Oriental thought, including research on the impetus of philosophical thinking in the history of ideas in Islam.

<text>Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems that use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after the commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.

Electrical engineering is divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics/control, and electrical materials science.

Electrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering, electronic or electrical and electronic engineering. Practicing engineers may have professional certification and be members of a professional body or an international standards organization. These include the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET, formerly the IEE).

Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from circuit theory to the management skills of a project manager. The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple voltmeter to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.

==History==
Electricity has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early 17th century. William Gilbert was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity. He is credited with establishing the term &quot;electricity&quot;. He also designed the versorium: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor Johan Wilcke invented a device later named electrophorus that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 Alessandro Volta had developed the voltaic pile, a forerunner of the electric battery.

===19th century===
In the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of Hans Christian Ørsted, who discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle; of William Sturgeon, who in 1825 invented the electromagnet; of Joseph Henry and Edward Davy, who invented the electrical relay in 1835; of Georg Ohm, who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the electric current and potential difference in a conductor; of Michael Faraday, the discoverer of electromagnetic induction in 1831; and of James Clerk Maxwell, who in 1873 published a unified theory of electricity and magnetism in his treatise &quot;Electricity and Magnetism&quot;.

In 1782, Georges-Louis Le Sage developed and presented in Berlin probably the world&#x27;s first form of electric telegraphy, using 24 different wires, one for each letter of the alphabet. This telegraph connected two rooms. It was an electrostatic telegraph that moved gold leaf through electrical conduction.

In 1795, Francisco Salva Campillo proposed an electrostatic telegraph system. Between 1803 and 1804, he worked on electrical telegraphy, and in 1804, he presented his report at the Royal Academy of Natural Sciences and Arts of Barcelona. Salva&#x27;s electrolyte telegraph system was very innovative though it was greatly influenced by and based upon two discoveries made in Europe in 1800—Alessandro Volta&#x27;s electric battery for generating an electric current and William Nicholson and Anthony Carlyle&#x27;s electrolysis of water. Electrical telegraphy may be considered the first example of electrical engineering. Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century. Practitioners had created a global electric telegraph network, and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and the US to support the new discipline. Francis Ronalds created an electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity. Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the Institution of Electrical Engineers) where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort. By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development of land-lines, submarine cables, and, from about 1890, wireless telegraphy.

Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardized units of measure. They led to the international standardization of the units volt, ampere, coulomb, ohm, farad, and henry. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893. The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardization in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.

During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of physics since early electrical technology was considered electromechanical in nature. The Technische Universität Darmstadt founded the world&#x27;s first department of electrical engineering in 1882 and introduced the first-degree course in electrical engineering in 1883. The first electrical engineering degree program in the United States was started at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, though it was Cornell University to produce the world&#x27;s first electrical engineering graduates in 1885. The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell&#x27;s Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts.

In about 1885, Cornell President Andrew Dickson White established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States. In the same year, University College London founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain. Professor Mendell P. Weinbach at University of Missouri established the electrical engineering department in 1886. Afterwards, universities and institutes of technology gradually started to offer electrical engineering programs to their students all over the world.

During these decades the use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, Thomas Edison switched on the world&#x27;s first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts—direct current (DC)—to 59 customers on Manhattan Island in New York City. In 1884, Sir Charles Parsons invented the steam turbine allowing for more efficient electric power generation. Alternating current, with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of transformers, developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (later called ZBD transformers), Lucien Gaulard, John Dixon Gibbs and William Stanley Jr. Practical AC motor designs including induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla and further developed into a practical three-phase form by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown. Charles Steinmetz and Oliver Heaviside contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering. The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been called the &quot;war of the currents&quot; between a George Westinghouse backed AC system and a Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall standard.

===Early 20th century===
During the development of radio, many scientists and inventors contributed to radio technology and electronics. The mathematical work of James Clerk Maxwell during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of electromagnetic radiation including the possibility of invisible airborne waves (later called &quot;radio waves&quot;). In his classic physics experiments of 1888, Heinrich Hertz proved Maxwell&#x27;s theory by transmitting radio waves with a spark-gap transmitter, and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, Guglielmo Marconi began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these &quot;Hertzian waves&quot; into a purpose-built commercial wireless telegraphic system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, a distance of .

Millimetre wave communication was first investigated by Jagadish Chandra Bose during 18941896, when he reached an extremely high frequency of up to 60GHz in his experiments. He also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves, when he patented the radio crystal detector in 1901.

In 1897, Karl Ferdinand Braun introduced the cathode-ray tube as part of an oscilloscope, a crucial enabling technology for electronic television. John Fleming invented the first radio tube, the diode, in 1904. Two years later, Robert von Lieben and Lee De Forest independently developed the amplifier tube, called the triode.

In 1920, Albert Hull developed the magnetron which would eventually lead to the development of the microwave oven in 1946 by Percy Spencer. In 1934, the British military began to make strides toward radar (which also uses the magnetron) under the direction of Dr Wimperis, culminating in the operation of the first radar station at Bawdsey in August 1936.

In 1941, Konrad Zuse presented the Z3, the world&#x27;s first fully functional and programmable computer using electromechanical parts. In 1943, Tommy Flowers designed and built the Colossus, the world&#x27;s first fully functional, electronic, digital and programmable computer. In 1946, the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) of John Presper Eckert and John Mauchly followed, beginning the computing era. The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives.

In 1948, Claude Shannon published &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot; which mathematically describes the passage of information with uncertainty (electrical noise).

===Solid-state electronics ===


The first working transistor was a point-contact transistor invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain while working under William Shockley at the Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) in 1947. They then invented the bipolar junction transistor in 1948. While early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, they opened the door for more compact devices.

The first integrated circuits were the hybrid integrated circuit invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and the monolithic integrated circuit chip invented by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959.

The MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at BTL in 1959. It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. It revolutionized the electronics industry, becoming the most widely used electronic device in the world.

The MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuit chips. The earliest experimental MOS IC chip to be fabricated was built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA Laboratories in 1962. MOS technology enabled Moore&#x27;s law, the doubling of transistors on an IC chip every two years, predicted by Gordon Moore in 1965. Silicon-gate MOS technology was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in 1968. Since then, the MOSFET has been the basic building block of modern electronics. The mass-production of silicon MOSFETs and MOS integrated circuit chips, along with continuous MOSFET scaling miniaturization at an exponential pace (as predicted by Moore&#x27;s law), has since led to revolutionary changes in technology, economy, culture and thinking.

The Apollo program which culminated in landing astronauts on the Moon with Apollo 11 in 1969 was enabled by NASA&#x27;s adoption of advances in semiconductor electronic technology, including MOSFETs in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) and silicon integrated circuit chips in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC).

The development of MOS integrated circuit technology in the 1960s led to the invention of the microprocessor in the early 1970s. The first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released in 1971. The Intel 4004 was designed and realized by Federico Faggin at Intel with his silicon-gate MOS technology, along with Intel&#x27;s Marcian Hoff and Stanley Mazor and Busicom&#x27;s Masatoshi Shima. The microprocessor led to the development of microcomputers and personal computers, and the microcomputer revolution.

==Subfields==
One of the properties of electricity is that it is very useful for energy transmission as well as for information transmission. These were also the first areas in which electrical engineering was developed. Today, electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes, certain fields, such as electronic engineering and computer engineering, are considered disciplines in their own right.

===Power and energy===

Power &amp; Energy engineering deals with the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include transformers, electric generators, electric motors, high voltage engineering, and power electronics. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a power grid that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it. Such systems are called &quot;on-grid&quot; power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called &quot;off-grid&quot; power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems.

===Telecommunications===
Telecommunications engineering focuses on the transmission of information across a communication channel such as a coax cable, optical fiber or free space. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier signal to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; this is known as modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a transceiver. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their power consumption as this is closely related to their signal strength. Typically, if the power of the transmitted signal is insufficient once the signal arrives at the receiver&#x27;s antenna(s), the information contained in the signal will be corrupted by noise, specifically static.

===Control engineering===

Control engineering focuses on the modeling of a diverse range of dynamic systems and the design of controllers that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner. To implement such controllers, electronics control engineers may use electronic circuits, digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airliners to the cruise control present in many modern automobiles. It also plays an important role in industrial automation.

Control engineers often use feedback when designing control systems. For example, in an automobile with cruise control the vehicle&#x27;s speed is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor&#x27;s power output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, control theory can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.

Control engineers also work in robotics to design autonomous systems using control algorithms which interpret sensory feedback to control actuators that move robots such as autonomous vehicles, autonomous drones and others used in a variety of industries.

===Electronics===

Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of electronic circuits that use the properties of components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and transistors to achieve a particular functionality. The tuned circuit, which allows the user of a radio to filter out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner.

Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as &quot;radio engineering&quot; and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and radar, commercial radio, and early television. Later, in post-war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, computers, and microprocessors. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term &quot;radio engineering&quot; gradually gave way to the name &quot;electronic engineering&quot;.

Before the invention of the integrated circuit in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and power and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, integrated circuits packed a large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly transistors, into a small chip around the size of a coin. This allowed for the powerful computers and other electronic devices we see today.

===Microelectronics and nanoelectronics===
Microelectronics engineering deals with the design and microfabrication of very small electronic circuit components for use in an integrated circuit or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component. The most common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors, although all main electronic components (resistors, capacitors etc.) can be created at a microscopic level.

Nanoelectronics is the further scaling of devices down to nanometer levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100 nm processing having been standard since around 2002.

Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, compound semiconductors like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of quantum mechanics.

===Signal processing===
Signal processing deals with the analysis and manipulation of signals. Signals can be either analog, in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or digital, in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the compression, error detection and error correction of digitally sampled signals.

Signal processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of digital signal processing and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, audio engineering, broadcast engineering, power electronics, and biomedical engineering as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. Analog signal processing is still important in the design of many control systems.

DSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as digital television sets, radios, hi-fi audio equipment, mobile phones, multimedia players, camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, noise cancelling headphones, digital spectrum analyzers, missile guidance systems, radar systems, and telematics systems. In such products, DSP may be responsible for noise reduction, speech recognition or synthesis, encoding or decoding digital media, wirelessly transmitting or receiving data, triangulating positions using GPS, and other kinds of image processing, video processing, audio processing, and speech processing.

===Instrumentation===
Instrumentation engineering deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as pressure, flow, and temperature. The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of physics that often extends beyond electromagnetic theory. For example, flight instruments measure variables such as wind speed and altitude to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, thermocouples use the Peltier-Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two points.

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the sensors of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace&#x27;s temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.

===Computers===
Computer engineering deals with the design of computers and computer systems. This may involve the design of new hardware. Computer engineers may also work on a system&#x27;s software. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of software engineering, which is usually considered a separate discipline. Desktop computers represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of embedded devices including video game consoles and DVD players. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing. Robots are one of the applications of computer engineering.

===Photonics and optics===

Photonics and optics deals with the generation, transmission, amplification, modulation, detection, and analysis of electromagnetic radiation. The application of optics deals with design of optical instruments such as lenses, microscopes, telescopes, and other equipment that uses the properties of electromagnetic radiation. Other prominent applications of optics include electro-optical sensors and measurement systems, lasers, fiber-optic communication systems, and optical disc systems (e.g. CD and DVD). Photonics builds heavily on optical technology, supplemented with modern developments such as optoelectronics (mostly involving semiconductors), laser systems, optical amplifiers and novel materials (e.g. metamaterials).

==Related disciplines==

Mechatronics is an engineering discipline that deals with the convergence of electrical and mechanical systems. Such combined systems are known as electromechanical systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include automated manufacturing systems, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, and various subsystems of aircraft and automobiles.
&quot;Electronic systems design&quot; is the subject within electrical engineering that deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electrical and mechanical systems.

The term &quot;mechatronics&quot; is typically used to refer to macroscopic systems but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell airbags when to deploy, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in inkjet printers to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve optical communication.

In aerospace engineering and robotics, an example is the most recent electric propulsion and ion propulsion.

==Education==
Electrical engineers typically possess an academic degree with a major in electrical engineering, electronics engineering, electrical engineering technology, or electrical and electronic engineering. The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Science in Electrical/Electronics Engineering Technology, Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Technology, or Bachelor of Applied Science, depending on the university. The bachelor&#x27;s degree generally includes units covering physics, mathematics, computer science, project management, and a variety of topics in electrical engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. 

At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic), but in others, electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.

Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a Master of Engineering/Master of Science (MEng/MSc), a Master of Engineering Management, a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Engineering, an Engineering Doctorate (Eng.D.), or an Engineer&#x27;s degree. The master&#x27;s and engineer&#x27;s degrees may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to academia. In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than a standalone postgraduate degree.

==Professional practice==

In most countries, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering represents the first step towards professional certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), Chartered engineer or Incorporated Engineer (in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or European Engineer (in much of the European Union).
The advantages of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada &quot;only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients&quot;. This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec&#x27;s Engineers Act. In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion. In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer&#x27;s work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. An engineer&#x27;s work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law.

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world&#x27;s literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually. The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe. Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. An MIET(Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) is recognised in Europe as an Electrical and computer (technology) engineer.

In Australia, Canada, and the United States, electrical engineers make up around 0.25% of the labor force.

==Tools and work==

From the Global Positioning System to electric power generation, electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test, and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of telecommunications systems, the operation of electric power stations, the lighting and wiring of buildings, the design of household appliances, or the electrical control of industrial machinery.
Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use computer-aided design programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others.
Although most electrical engineers will understand basic circuit theory (that is, the interactions of elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunications systems that use off-the-shelf components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong numerical skills, computer literacy, and the ability to understand the technical language and concepts that relate to electrical engineering.

A wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers. For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic multimeter measuring voltage, current, and resistance may suffice. Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the oscilloscope is also an ubiquitous instrument. In RF engineering and high-frequency telecommunications, spectrum analyzers and network analyzers are used. In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation. For instance, medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids. Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although voltmeters may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different. Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline. Audio electronics engineers use audio test sets consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as harmonic distortion and noise. Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting.
For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important.

The workplaces of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a fabrication plant, on board a Naval ship, the offices of a consulting firm or on site at a mine. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists, electricians, computer programmers, and other engineers.

Electrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences. For instance, the physicist Lord Kelvin played a major role in the engineering of the first transatlantic telegraph cable. Conversely, the engineer Oliver Heaviside produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables. Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects. For instance, large particle accelerators such as CERN need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project including the power distribution, the instrumentation, and the manufacture and installation of the superconducting electromagnets.

<text>In physics, electromagnetism is an interaction that occurs between particles with electric charge via electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is the dominant force in the interactions of atoms and molecules. Electromagnetism can be thought of as a combination of electrostatics and magnetism, which are distinct but closely intertwined phenomena. Electromagnetic forces occur between any two charged particles. Electric forces cause an attraction between particles with opposite charges and repulsion between particles with the same charge, while magnetism is an interaction that occurs between charged particles in relative motion. These two forces are described in terms of electromagnetic fields. Macroscopic charged objects are described in terms of Coulomb&#x27;s law for electricity and Ampère&#x27;s force law for magnetism; the Lorentz force describes microscopic charged particles.

The electromagnetic force is responsible for many of the chemical and physical phenomena observed in daily life. The electrostatic attraction between atomic nuclei and their electrons holds atoms together. Electric forces also allow different atoms to combine into molecules, including the macromolecules such as proteins that form the basis of life. Meanwhile, magnetic interactions between the spin and angular momentum magnetic moments of electrons also play a role in chemical reactivity; such relationships are studied in spin chemistry. Electromagnetism also plays several crucial roles in modern technology: electrical energy production, transformation and distribution; light, heat, and sound production and detection; fiber optic and wireless communication; sensors; computation; electrolysis; electroplating; and mechanical motors and actuators.

Electromagnetism has been studied since ancient times. Many ancient civilizations, including the Greeks and the Mayans, created wide-ranging theories to explain lightning, static electricity, and the attraction between magnetized pieces of iron ore. However, it was not until the late 18th century that scientists began to develop a mathematical basis for understanding the nature of electromagnetic interactions. In the 18th and 19th centuries, prominent scientists and mathematicians such as Coulomb, Gauss and Faraday developed namesake laws which helped to explain the formation and interaction of electromagnetic fields. This process culminated in the 1860s with the discovery of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, a set of four partial differential equations which provide a complete description of classical electromagnetic fields. Maxwell&#x27;s equations provided a sound mathematical basis for the relationships between electricity and magnetism that scientists had been exploring for centuries, and predicted the existence of self-sustaining electromagnetic waves. Maxwell postulated that such waves make up visible light, which was later shown to be true. Gamma-rays, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible, infrared radiation, microwaves and radio waves were all determined to be electromagnetic radiation differing only in their range of frequencies.

In the modern era, scientists continue to refine the theory of electromagnetism to account for the effects of modern physics, including quantum mechanics and relativity. The theoretical implications of electromagnetism, particularly the requirement that observations remain consistent when viewed from various moving frames of reference (relativistic electromagnetism) and the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the medium of propagation (permeability and permittivity), helped inspire Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity in 1905. Quantum electrodynamics (QED) modifies Maxwell&#x27;s equations to be consistent with the quantized nature of matter. In QED, changes in the electromagnetic field are expressed in terms of discrete excitations, particles known as photons, the quanta of light.

==History==
===Ancient world===
Investigation into electromagnetic phenomena began about 5,000 years ago. There is evidence that the ancient Chinese, Mayan, and potentially even Egyptian civilizations knew that the naturally magnetic mineral magnetite had attractive properties, and many incorporated it into their art and architecture. Ancient people were also aware of lightning and static electricity, although they had no idea of the mechanisms behind these phenomena. The Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus discovered around 600 B.C.E. that amber could acquire an electric charge when it was rubbed with cloth, which allowed it to pick up light objects such as pieces of straw. Thales also experimented with the ability of magnetic rocks to attract one other, and hypothesized that this phenomenon might be connected to the attractive power of amber, foreshadowing the deep connections between electricity and magnetism that would be discovered over 2,000 years later. Despite all this investigation, ancient civilizations had no understanding of the mathematical basis of electromagnetism, and often analyzed its impacts through the lens of religion rather than science (lightning, for instance, was considered to be a creation of the gods in many cultures).

===19th century===

Electricity and magnetism were originally considered to be two separate forces. This view changed with the publication of James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s 1873 &quot;A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism&quot; in which the interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be mediated by one force. There are four main effects resulting from these interactions, all of which have been clearly demonstrated by experiments:
# Electric charges &#x27; or &#x27; one another with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them: opposite charges attract, like charges repel.
# Magnetic poles (or states of polarization at individual points) attract or repel one another in a manner similar to positive and negative charges and always exist as pairs: every north pole is yoked to a south pole.
# An electric current inside a wire creates a corresponding circumferential magnetic field outside the wire. Its direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) depends on the direction of the current in the wire.
# A current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved toward or away from a magnetic field, or a magnet is moved towards or away from it; the direction of current depends on that of the movement.
In April 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted observed that an electrical current in a wire caused a nearby compass needle to move. At the time of discovery, Ørsted did not suggest any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon, nor did he try to represent the phenomenon in a mathematical framework. However, three months later he began more intensive investigations. Soon thereafter he published his findings, proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The CGS unit of magnetic induction (oersted) is named in honor of his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.

His findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific community in electrodynamics. They influenced French physicist André-Marie Ampère&#x27;s developments of a single mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. Ørsted&#x27;s discovery also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.

This unification, which was observed by Michael Faraday, extended by James Clerk Maxwell, and partially reformulated by Oliver Heaviside and Heinrich Hertz, is one of the key accomplishments of 19th-century mathematical physics. It has had far-reaching consequences, one of which was the understanding of the nature of light. Unlike what was proposed by the electromagnetic theory of that time, light and other electromagnetic waves are at present seen as taking the form of quantized, self-propagating oscillatory electromagnetic field disturbances called photons. Different frequencies of oscillation give rise to the different forms of electromagnetic radiation, from radio waves at the lowest frequencies, to visible light at intermediate frequencies, to gamma rays at the highest frequencies.

Ørsted was not the only person to examine the relationship between electricity and magnetism. In 1802, Gian Domenico Romagnosi, an Italian legal scholar, deflected a magnetic needle using a Voltaic pile. The factual setup of the experiment is not completely clear, nor if current flowed across the needle or not. An account of the discovery was published in 1802 in an Italian newspaper, but it was largely overlooked by the contemporary scientific community, because Romagnosi seemingly did not belong to this community.

An earlier (1735), and often neglected, connection between electricity and magnetism was reported by a Dr. Cookson. The account stated:A tradesman at Wakefield in Yorkshire, having put up a great number of knives and forks in a large box ... and having placed the box in the corner of a large room, there happened a sudden storm of thunder, lightning, &amp;c. ... The owner emptying the box on a counter where some nails lay, the persons who took up the knives, that lay on the nails, observed that the knives took up the nails. On this the whole number was tried, and found to do the same, and that, to such a degree as to take up large nails, packing needles, and other iron things of considerable weight ... E. T. Whittaker suggested in 1910 that this particular event was responsible for lightning to be &quot;credited with the power of magnetizing steel; and it was doubtless this which led Franklin in 1751 to attempt to magnetize a sewing-needle by means of the discharge of Leyden jars.&quot;

== A fundamental force ==

The electromagnetic force is the second strongest of the four known fundamental forces and has unlimited range.
All other forces, known as non-fundamental forces. (e.g., friction, contact forces) are derived from the four fundamental forces. At high energy, the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single interaction called the electroweak interaction.

Most of the forces involved in interactions between atoms are explained by electromagnetic forces between electrically charged atomic nuclei and electrons. The electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of chemical phenomena.

Electromagnetism explains how materials carry momentum despite being composed of individual particles and empty space. The forces we experience when &quot;pushing&quot; or &quot;pulling&quot; ordinary material objects result from intermolecular forces between individual molecules in our bodies and in the objects.

The effective forces generated by the momentum of electrons&#x27; movement is a necessary part of understanding atomic and intermolecular interactions. As electrons move between interacting atoms, they carry momentum with them. As a collection of electrons becomes more confined, their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The behavior of matter at the molecular scale, including its density, is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves.

==Classical electrodynamics==
In 1600, William Gilbert proposed, in his &quot;De Magnete&quot;, that electricity and magnetism, while both capable of causing attraction and repulsion of objects, were distinct effects. Mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle. The link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s proposed experiments in 1752 were conducted on 10May 1752 by Thomas-François Dalibard of France using a iron rod instead of a kite and he successfully extracted electrical sparks from a cloud.

One of the first to discover and publish a link between human-made electric current and magnetism was Gian Romagnosi, who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a voltaic pile deflected a nearby compass needle. However, the effect did not become widely known until 1820, when Ørsted performed a similar experiment. Ørsted&#x27;s work influenced Ampère to conduct further experiments, which eventually gave rise to a new area of physics: electrodynamics. By determining a force law for the interaction between elements of electric current, Ampère placed the subject on a solid mathematical foundation.

A theory of electromagnetism, known as classical electromagnetism, was developed by several physicists during the period between 1820 and 1873, when James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s treatise was published, which unified previous developments into a single theory, proposing that light was an electromagnetic wave propagating in the &quot;luminiferous ether&quot;. In classical electromagnetism, the behavior of the electromagnetic field is described by a set of equations known as Maxwell&#x27;s equations, and the electromagnetic force is given by the Lorentz force law.

One of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with classical mechanics, but it is compatible with special relativity. According to Maxwell&#x27;s equations, the speed of light in vacuum is a universal constant that is dependent only on the electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability of free space. This violates Galilean invariance, a long-standing cornerstone of classical mechanics. One way to reconcile the two theories (electromagnetism and classical mechanics) is to assume the existence of a luminiferous aether through which the light propagates. However, subsequent experimental efforts failed to detect the presence of the aether. After important contributions of Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincaré, in 1905, Albert Einstein solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity, which replaced classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics compatible with classical electromagnetism. (For more information, see History of special relativity.)

In addition, relativity theory implies that in moving frames of reference, a magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero electric component and conversely, a moving electric field transforms to a nonzero magnetic component, thus firmly showing that the phenomena are two sides of the same coin. Hence the term &quot;electromagnetism&quot;. (For more information, see Classical electromagnetism and special relativity and Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism.)

Today few problems in electromagnetism remain unsolved. These include: the lack of magnetic monopoles, Abraham–Minkowski controversy, the location in space of the electromagnetic field energy, and the mechanism by which some organisms can sense electric and magnetic fields.

==Extension to nonlinear phenomena==
The Maxwell equations are &quot;linear,&quot; in that a change in the sources (the charges and currents) results in a proportional change of the fields. Nonlinear dynamics can occur when electromagnetic fields couple to matter that follows nonlinear dynamical laws. This is studied, for example, in the subject of magnetohydrodynamics, which combines Maxwell theory with the Navier–Stokes equations. Another branch of electromagnetism dealing with nonlinearity is nonlinear optics.

==Quantities and units==

Here is a list of common units related to electromagnetism:

* ampere (electric current, SI unit)
* coulomb (electric charge)
* farad (capacitance)
* henry (inductance)
* ohm (resistance)
* siemens (conductance)
* tesla (magnetic flux density)
* volt (electric potential)
* watt (power)
* weber (magnetic flux)

In the electromagnetic CGS system, electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via Ampère&#x27;s law and takes the permeability as a dimensionless quantity (relative permeability) whose value in vacuum is unity. As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system.

Formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as Maxwell&#x27;s equations) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses. This is because there is no one-to-one correspondence between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit &quot;sub-systems&quot;, including Gaussian, &quot;ESU&quot;, &quot;EMU&quot;, and Heaviside–Lorentz. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and in fact the phrase &quot;CGS units&quot; is often used to refer specifically to CGS-Gaussian units.

== Applications ==
The study of electromagnetism informs electric circuits, magnetic circuits, and semiconductor devices&#x27; construction.

<doc id="9534" wikidata="Q83464" url="?curid=9534" title="Euphemism">
<text>A euphemism ( ) is an innocuous word or expression used in place of one that is deemed offensive or suggests something unpleasant. Some euphemisms are intended to amuse, while others use bland, inoffensive terms for concepts that the user wishes to downplay. Euphemisms may be used to mask profanity or refer to topics some consider taboo such as mental or physical disability, sexual intercourse, bodily excretions, pain, violence, illness, or death in a polite way.

==Etymology==
&quot;Euphemism&quot; comes from the Greek word () which refers to the use of &#x27;words of good omen&#x27;; it is a compound of (), meaning &#x27;good, well&#x27;, and (), meaning &#x27;prophetic speech; rumour, talk&#x27;. &quot;Eupheme&quot; is a reference to the female Greek spirit of words of praise and positivity, etc. The term &quot;euphemism&quot; itself was used as a euphemism by the ancient Greeks; with the meaning &quot;to keep a holy silence&quot; (speaking well by not speaking at all).

==Purpose==
===Avoidance===
Reasons for using euphemisms vary by context and intent. Commonly, euphemisms are used to avoid directly addressing subjects that might be deemed negative or embarrassing, such as death, sex, and excretory bodily functions. They may be created for innocent, well-intentioned purposes or nefariously and cynically, intentionally to deceive, confuse or deny. Euphemisms which emerge as dominant social euphemisms are often created to serve progressive causes. The Oxford University Press&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Euphemisms&quot; identifies &quot;late&quot; as an occasionally ambiguous term, whose nature as a euphemism for dead and an adjective meaning overdue, can cause confusion in listeners.

===Mitigation===
Euphemisms are also used to mitigate, soften or downplay the gravity of large-scale injustices, war crimes, or other events that warrant a pattern of avoidance in official statements or documents. For instance, one reason for the comparative scarcity of written evidence documenting the exterminations at Auschwitz, relative to their sheer number, is &quot;directives for the extermination process obscured in bureaucratic euphemisms&quot;. Another example of this is during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, where Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his speech starting the invasion, called the invasion a &quot;special military operation&quot;.

Euphemisms are sometimes used to lessen the opposition to a political move. For example, according to linguist Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used the neutral Hebrew lexical item (literally &#x27;beatings (of the heart)&#x27;), rather than (&#x27;withdrawal&#x27;), to refer to the stages in the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank , in order to lessen the opposition of right-wing Israelis to such a move. was thus used as a euphemism for &#x27;withdrawal&#x27;.

===Rhetoric===
Euphemism may be used as a rhetorical strategy, in which case its goal is to change the valence of a description.

==Controversial use==
Using a euphemism can in itself be controversial, as in the following examples:
* &quot;Affirmative action&quot;, meaning a preference for minorities or the historically disadvantaged, usually in employment or academic admissions. This term is sometimes said to be a euphemism for reverse discrimination, or, in the UK, positive discrimination, which suggests an intentional bias that might be legally prohibited, or otherwise unpalatable.
* &quot;Enhanced interrogation&quot; is a euphemism for torture. For example, columnist David Brooks called the use of this term for practices at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere an effort to &quot;dull the moral sensibility&quot;.

===Online===
The use of euphemism online is known as &quot;algospeak&quot; when used to evade automated online moderation techniques used on Meta and TikTok&#x27;s platforms. Algospeak has been used in debate about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

==Formation methods==
===Pronunciation (phonetic modification)===

Phonetic euphemism is used to replace profanities and blasphemies, diminishing their intensity. To alter the pronunciation or spelling of a taboo word (such as profanity) to form a euphemism is known as &quot;taboo deformation&quot;, or a &quot;minced oath&quot;. Such modifications include:
* Shortening or &quot;clipping&quot; the term, such as &quot;Jeez&quot; (&#x27;Jesus&#x27;) and &quot;what the—&quot; (&#x27;what the hell&#x27;).
* Mispronunciations, such as &quot;oh my gosh&quot; (&#x27;oh my God&#x27;), &quot;frickin&quot; (&#x27;fucking&#x27;), &quot;darn&quot; (&#x27;damn&#x27;) or &quot;oh shoot&quot; (&#x27;oh shit&#x27;). This is also referred to as a minced oath. &quot;Feck&quot; is a minced oath for &#x27;fuck&#x27;, originating in Hiberno-English and popularised outside of Ireland by the British sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;.
* Using acronyms as replacements, such as &quot;SOB&quot; (&#x27;son of a bitch&#x27;). Sometimes, the word &quot;word&quot; or &quot;bomb&quot; is added after it, such as &quot;F-word&quot; (&#x27;fuck&#x27;), etc. Also, the letter can be phonetically respelled.

===Understatement===
Euphemisms formed from understatements include &quot;asleep&quot; for dead and &quot;drinking&quot; for consuming alcohol. &quot;Tired and emotional&quot; is a notorious British euphemism for &quot;drunk&quot;, one of many recurring jokes popularized by the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;; it has been used by MPs to avoid unparliamentary language.

===Substitution===
Pleasant, positive, worthy, neutral, or nondescript terms are often substituted for explicit or unpleasant ones, with many substituted terms deliberately coined by sociopolitical movements, marketing, public relations, or advertising initiatives, including:
*&quot;meat packing company&quot; for &#x27;slaughterhouse&#x27; (avoids entirely the subject of killing); &quot;natural issue&quot; or &quot;love child&quot; for &#x27;bastard&#x27;; &quot;let go&quot; for &#x27;fired/sacked&#x27;, etc.

Some examples of Cockney rhyming slang may serve the same purpose: to call a person a &quot;berk&quot; sounds less offensive than to call a person a &quot;cunt&quot;, though &quot;berk&quot; is short for Berkeley Hunt, which rhymes with &quot;cunt&quot;.

===Metaphor===
* Metaphors (&quot;beat the meat&quot;, &quot;choke the chicken&quot;, or &quot;jerkin&#x27; the gherkin&quot; for &#x27;masturbation&#x27;; &quot;take a dump&quot; and &quot;take a leak&quot; for &#x27;defecation&#x27; and &#x27;urination&#x27;, respectively)
* Comparisons (&quot;buns&quot; for &#x27;buttocks&#x27;, &quot;weed&quot; for &#x27;cannabis&#x27;)
* Metonymy (&quot;men&#x27;s room&quot; for &#x27;men&#x27;s restroom/toilet&#x27;)

===Slang===

The use of a term with a softer connotation, though it shares the same meaning. For instance, &quot;screwed up&quot; is a euphemism for &#x27;fucked up&#x27;; &quot;hook-up&quot; and &quot;laid&quot; are euphemisms for &#x27;sexual intercourse&#x27;.

===Foreign words===
Expressions or words from a foreign language may be imported for use as euphemism. For example, the French word was sometimes used instead of the English word &quot;pregnant&quot;; for &quot;slaughterhouse&quot;, although in French the word retains its explicit violent meaning &#x27;a place for beating down&#x27;, conveniently lost on non-French speakers. &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; for &quot;businessman&quot;, adds glamour; &quot;douche&quot; (French for &#x27;shower&#x27;) for vaginal irrigation device; &quot;bidet&quot; (&#x27;little pony&#x27;) for vessel for anal washing. Ironically, although in English physical &quot;handicaps&quot; are almost always described with euphemism, in French the English word &quot;handicap&quot; is used as a euphemism for their problematic words or .

===Periphrasis/circumlocution===
Periphrasis, or circumlocution, is one of the most common: to &quot;speak around&quot; a given word, implying it without saying it. Over time, circumlocutions become recognized as established euphemisms for particular words or ideas.

==Doublespeak==

Bureaucracies frequently spawn euphemisms intentionally, as doublespeak expressions. For example, in the past, the US military used the term &quot;sunshine units&quot; for contamination by radioactive isotopes. The United States Central Intelligence Agency refers to systematic torture as &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;. An effective death sentence in the Soviet Union during the Great Purge often used the clause &quot;imprisonment without right to correspondence&quot;: the person sentenced would be shot soon after conviction. As early as 1939, Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich used the term &quot;Sonderbehandlung&quot; (&quot;special treatment&quot;) to mean summary execution of persons viewed as &quot;disciplinary problems&quot; by the Nazis even before commencing the systematic extermination of the Jews. Heinrich Himmler, aware that the word had come to be known to mean murder, replaced that euphemism with one in which Jews would be &quot;guided&quot; (to their deaths) through the slave-labor and extermination camps after having been &quot;evacuated&quot; to their doom. Such was part of the formulation of &quot;Endlösung der Judenfrage&quot; (the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;), which became known to the outside world during the Nuremberg Trials.

== Lifespan ==

Frequently, over time, euphemisms themselves become taboo words, through the linguistic process of semantic change known as pejoration, which University of Oregon linguist Sharon Henderson Taylor dubbed the &quot;euphemism cycle&quot; in 1974, also frequently referred to as the &quot;euphemism treadmill&quot;, as worded by Steven Pinker. For instance, the place of human defecation is a needy candidate for a euphemism in all eras. &quot;Toilet&quot; is an 18th-century euphemism, replacing the older euphemism &quot;house-of-office&quot;, which in turn replaced the even older euphemisms &quot;privy-house&quot; and &quot;bog-house&quot;. In the 20th century, where the old euphemisms &quot;lavatory&quot; (a place where one washes) and &quot;toilet&quot; (a place where one dresses) had grown from widespread usage (e.g., in the United States) to being synonymous with the crude act they sought to deflect, they were sometimes replaced with &quot;bathroom&quot; (a place where one bathes), &quot;washroom&quot; (a place where one washes), or &quot;restroom&quot; (a place where one rests) or even by the extreme form &quot;powder room&quot; (a place where one applies facial cosmetics). The form &quot;water closet&quot;, often shortened to &quot;W.C.&quot;, is a less deflective form. The word &quot;shit&quot; appears to have originally been a euphemism for defecation in Pre-Germanic, as the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;&quot;, from which it was derived, meant &#x27;to cut off&#x27;.

Another example in American English is the replacement of &quot;colored people&quot; with &quot;Negro&quot; (euphemism by foreign language), which itself came to be replaced by either &quot;African American&quot; or &quot;Black&quot;. Also in the United States the term &quot;ethnic minorities&quot; in the 2010s has been replaced by &quot;people of color&quot;.

Venereal disease, which associated shameful bacterial infection with a seemingly worthy ailment emanating from Venus, the goddess of love, soon lost its deflective force in the post-classical education era, as &quot;VD&quot;, which was replaced by the three-letter initialism &quot;STD&quot; (sexually transmitted disease); later, &quot;STD&quot; was replaced by &quot;STI&quot; (sexually transmitted infection).

Intellectually-disabled people were originally defined with words such as &quot;morons&quot; or &quot;imbeciles&quot;, which then became commonly used insults. The medical diagnosis was changed to &quot;mentally retarded&quot;, which morphed into the pejorative, &quot;retard&quot;, against those with intellectual disabilities. To avoid the negative connotations of their diagnoses, students who need accommodations because of such conditions are often labeled as &quot;special needs&quot; instead, although the words &quot;special&quot; or &quot;sped&quot; (short for &quot;special education&quot;) have long been schoolyard insults. As of August 2013, the Social Security Administration replaced the term &quot;mental retardation&quot; with &quot;intellectual disability&quot;. Since 2012, that change in terminology has been adopted by the National Institutes of Health and the medical industry at large. There are numerous disability-related euphemisms that have negative connotations.

<text>Edmund Spenser (; born 1552 or 1553; died 13 January O.S. 1599) was an English poet best known for &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. He is recognized as one of the premier craftsmen of nascent Modern English verse, and he is considered one of the great poets in the English language.

==Life==
Edmund Spenser was born in East Smithfield, London, around the year 1552; however, there is still some ambiguity as to the exact date of his birth. His parenthood is obscure, but he was probably the son of John Spenser, a journeyman clothmaker. As a young boy, he was educated in London at the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and matriculated as a sizar at Pembroke College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge he became a friend of Gabriel Harvey and later consulted him, despite their differing views on poetry. In 1578, he became for a short time secretary to John Young, Bishop of Rochester. In 1579, he published &quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot; and around the same time married his first wife, Machabyas Childe. They had two children, Sylvanus (d. 1638) and Katherine.

In July 1580, Spenser went to Ireland in service of the newly appointed Lord Deputy, Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton. Spenser served under Lord Grey with Walter Raleigh at the Siege of Smerwick massacre. When Lord Grey was recalled to England, Spenser stayed on in Ireland, having acquired other official posts and lands in the Munster Plantation. Raleigh acquired other nearby Munster estates confiscated in the Second Desmond Rebellion. Sometime between 1587 and 1589, Spenser acquired his main estate at Kilcolman, near Doneraile in North Cork. He later bought a second holding to the south, at Rennie, on a rock overlooking the river Blackwater in North Cork. Its ruins are still visible today. A short distance away grew a tree, locally known as &quot;Spenser&#x27;s Oak&quot; until it was destroyed in a lightning strike in the 1960s. Local legend claims that he penned some of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; under this tree.

In 1590, Spenser brought out the first three books of his most famous work, &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, having travelled to London to publish and promote the work, with the likely assistance of Raleigh. He was successful enough to obtain a life pension of £50 a year from the Queen. He probably hoped to secure a place at court through his poetry, but his next significant publication boldly antagonised the queen&#x27;s principal secretary, Lord Burghley (William Cecil), through its inclusion of the satirical &quot;Mother Hubberd&#x27;s Tale&quot;. He returned to Ireland. He was at the centre of a literary circle whose members included his lifelong friend Lodowick Bryskett and Dr. John Longe, Archbishop of Armagh.

In 1591, Spenser published a translation in verse of Joachim Du Bellay&#x27;s sonnets, &quot;Les Antiquités de Rome&quot;, which had been published in 1558. Spenser&#x27;s version, &quot;Ruines of Rome: by Bellay&quot;, may also have been influenced by Latin poems on the same subject, written by Jean or Janis Vitalis and published in 1576.

By 1594, Spenser&#x27;s first wife had died, and in that year he married a much younger Elizabeth Boyle, a relative of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. He addressed to her the sonnet sequence &quot;Amoretti&quot;. The marriage was celebrated in &quot;Epithalamion&quot;. They had a son named Peregrine.

In 1596, Spenser wrote a prose pamphlet titled &quot;A View of the Present State of Irelande&quot;. This piece, in the form of a dialogue, circulated in manuscript, remaining unpublished until the mid-17th century. It is probable that it was kept out of print during the author&#x27;s lifetime because of its inflammatory content. The pamphlet argued that Ireland would never be totally &quot;pacified&quot; by the English until its indigenous language and customs had been destroyed, if necessary by violence.

In 1598, during the Nine Years&#x27; War, Spenser was driven from his home by the native Irish forces of Hugh O&#x27;Neill. His castle at Kilcolman was burned, and Ben Jonson, who may have had private information, asserted that one of his infant children died in the blaze.

In the year after being driven from his home, 1599, Spenser travelled to London, where he died at the age of forty-six – &quot;for want of bread&quot;, according to Ben Jonson; one of Jonson&#x27;s more doubtful statements, since Spenser had a payment to him authorised by the government and was due his pension. His coffin was carried to his grave, deliberately near that of Geoffrey Chaucer, in what became known as Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey by other poets, probably including Shakespeare, who threw many pens and pieces of poetry into his grave. His second wife survived him and remarried twice. His sister Sarah, who had accompanied him to Ireland, married into the Travers family, and her descendants were prominent landowners in Cork for centuries.

==Rhyme and reason==
Thomas Fuller, in &quot;Worthies of England&quot;, included a story where the Queen told her treasurer, William Cecil, to pay Spenser £100 for his poetry. The treasurer, however, objected that the sum was too much. She said, &quot;Then give him what is reason&quot;. Without receiving his payment in due time, Spenser gave the Queen this quatrain on one of her progresses:

&lt;poem&gt;
I was promis&#x27;d on a time,
To have a reason for my rhyme:
From that time unto this season,
I receiv&#x27;d nor rhyme nor reason.
&lt;/poem&gt;

She immediately ordered the treasurer to pay Spenser the original £100.

This story seems to have attached itself to Spenser from Thomas Churchyard, who apparently had difficulty in getting payment of his pension, the only other pension Elizabeth awarded to a poet. Spenser seems to have had no difficulty in receiving payment when it was due as the pension was being collected for him by his publisher, Ponsonby.

==&quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot;==
&quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot; is Edmund Spenser&#x27;s first major work, which appeared in 1579. It emulates Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot; of the first century BCE and the &quot;Eclogues&quot; of Mantuan by Baptista Mantuanus, a late medieval, early renaissance poet. An eclogue is a short pastoral poem that is in the form of a dialogue or soliloquy. Although all the months together form an entire year, each month stands alone as a separate poem. Editions of the late 16th and early 17th centuries include woodcuts for each month/poem, and thereby have a slight similarity to an emblem book which combines a number of self-contained pictures and texts, usually a short vignette, saying, or allegory with an accompanying illustration.

==&quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;==

Spenser&#x27;s masterpiece is the epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. The first three books of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; were published in 1590, and the second set of three books was published in 1596. Spenser originally indicated that he intended the poem to consist of twelve books, so the version of the poem we have today is incomplete. Despite this, it remains one of the longest poems in the English language. It is an allegorical work, and can be read (as Spenser presumably intended) on several levels of allegory, including as praise of Queen Elizabeth I. In a completely allegorical context, the poem follows several knights in an examination of several virtues. In Spenser&#x27;s &quot;A Letter of the Authors&quot;, he states that the entire epic poem is &quot;cloudily enwrapped in allegorical devises&quot;, and that the aim behind &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; was to &quot;fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline&quot;.

==Shorter poems==
Spenser published numerous relatively short poems in the last decade of the 16th century, almost all of which consider love or sorrow. In 1591, he published &quot;Complaints&quot;, a collection of poems that express complaints in mournful or mocking tones. Four years later, in 1595, Spenser published &quot;Amoretti and Epithalamion&quot;. This volume contains eighty-eight sonnets commemorating his courtship of Elizabeth Boyle. In &quot;Amoretti&quot;, Spenser uses subtle humour and parody while praising his beloved, reworking Petrarchism in his treatment of longing for a woman. &quot;Epithalamion&quot;, similar to &quot;Amoretti&quot;, deals in part with the unease in the development of a romantic and sexual relationship. It was written for his wedding to his young bride, Elizabeth Boyle. Some have speculated that the attention to disquiet, in general, reflects Spenser&#x27;s personal anxieties at the time, as he was unable to complete his most significant work, &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. In the following year, Spenser released &quot;Prothalamion&quot;, a wedding song written for the daughters of a duke, allegedly in hopes to gain favour in the court.

==The Spenserian stanza and sonnet==
Spenser used a distinctive verse form, called the Spenserian stanza, in several works, including &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. The stanza&#x27;s main metre is iambic pentameter with a final line in iambic hexameter (having six feet or stresses, known as an Alexandrine), and the rhyme scheme is . He also used his own rhyme scheme for the sonnet. In a Spenserian sonnet, the last line of every quatrain is linked with the first line of the next one, yielding the rhyme scheme . &quot;Men Call you Fayre&quot; is a fine Sonnet from Amoretti. The poet presents the concept of true beauty in the poem. He addresses the sonnet to his beloved, Elizabeth Boyle, and presents his courtship. Like all Renaissance men, Edmund Spenser believed that love is an inexhaustible source of beauty and order. In this Sonnet, the poet expresses his idea of true beauty. The physical beauty will finish after a few days; it is not a permanent beauty. He emphasises beauty of mind and beauty of intellect. He considers his beloved is not simply flesh but is also a spiritual being. The poet opines that he is beloved born of heavenly seed and she is derived from fair spirit. The poet states that because of her clean mind, pure heart and sharp intellect, men call her fair and she deserves it. At the end, the poet praises her spiritual beauty and he worships her because of her Divine Soul.

==Influences==
Though Spenser was well-read in classical literature, scholars have noted that his poetry does not rehash tradition, but rather is distinctly his. This individuality may have resulted, to some extent, from a lack of comprehension of the classics. Spenser strove to emulate such ancient Roman poets as Virgil and Ovid, whom he studied during his schooling, but many of his best-known works are notably divergent from those of his predecessors. The language of his poetry is purposely archaic, reminiscent of earlier works such as &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; of Geoffrey Chaucer and &quot;Il Canzoniere&quot; of Petrarch, whom Spenser greatly admired.

An Anglican and a devotee of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth, Spenser was particularly offended by the anti-Elizabethan propaganda that some Catholics circulated. Like most Protestants near the time of the Reformation, Spenser saw a Catholic church full of corruption, and he determined that it was not only the wrong religion but the anti-religion. This sentiment is an important backdrop for the battles of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;.

Spenser was called &quot;the Poet&#x27;s Poet&quot; by Charles Lamb, and was admired by John Milton, William Blake, William Wordsworth, John Keats, Lord Byron, Alfred Tennyson and others. Among his contemporaries Walter Raleigh wrote a commendatory poem to &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; in 1590 in which he claims to admire and value Spenser&#x27;s work more so than any other in the English language. John Milton in his &quot;Areopagitica&quot; mentions &quot;our sage and serious poet Spenser, whom I dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas&quot;. In the 18th century, Alexander Pope compared Spenser to &quot;a mistress, whose faults we see, but love her with them all&quot;.

==&quot;A View of the Present State of Irelande&quot;==

In his work &quot;A View of the Present State of Irelande&quot; (1596), Spenser discussed future plans to establish control over Ireland, the most recent Irish uprising, led by Hugh O&#x27;Neill having demonstrated the futility of previous efforts. The work is partly a defence of Lord Arthur Grey de Wilton, who was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1580, and who greatly influenced Spenser&#x27;s thinking on Ireland.

The goal of the piece was to show that Ireland was in great need of reform. Spenser believed that &quot;Ireland is a diseased portion of the State, it must first be cured and reformed, before it could be in a position to appreciate the good sound laws and blessings of the nation&quot;. In &quot;A View of the Present State of Ireland&quot;, Spenser categorises the &quot;evils&quot; of the Irish people into three prominent categories: laws, customs and religion. According to Spenser, these three elements worked together in creating the supposedly &quot;disruptive and degraded people&quot; who inhabited the country. One example given in the work is the Irish law system termed &quot;Brehon law&quot;, which at the time trumped the established law as dictated by the Crown. The Brehon system had its own court and methods of punishing infractions committed. Spenser viewed this system as a backward custom which contributed to the &quot;degradation&quot; of the Irish people. A particular legal punishment viewed with distaste by Spenser was the Brehon method of dealing with murder, which was to impose an &quot;éraic&quot; (fine) on the murderer&#x27;s family. From Spenser&#x27;s viewpoint, the appropriate punishment for murder was capital punishment. Spenser also warned of the dangers that allowing the education of children in the Irish language would bring: &quot;Soe that the speach being Irish, the hart must needes be Irishe; for out of the aboundance of the hart, the tonge speaketh&quot;.

He pressed for a scorched earth policy in Ireland, noting its effectiveness in the Second Desmond Rebellion:

&quot;&#x27;Out of everye corner of the woode and glenns they came creepinge forth upon theire handes, for theire legges could not beare them; they looked Anatomies [of] death, they spake like ghostes, crying out of theire graves; they did eate of the carrions, happye wheare they could find them, yea, and one another soone after, in soe much as the verye carcasses they spared not to scrape out of theire graves; and if they found a plott of water-cresses or shamrockes, theyr they flocked as to a feast… in a shorte space there were none almost left, and a most populous and plentyfull countrye suddenly lefte voyde of man or beast: yett sure in all that warr, there perished not manye by the sworde, but all by the extreamytie of famine ... they themselves had wrought.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="9540" wikidata="Q383973" url="?curid=9540" title="Electricity generation">
<text>Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy. For utilities in the electric power industry, it is the stage prior to its delivery (transmission, distribution, etc.) to end users or its storage, using for example, the pumped-storage method.

Consumable electricity is not freely available in nature, so it must be &quot;produced&quot;, transforming other forms of energy to electricity. Production is carried out in power stations, also called &quot;power plants&quot;. Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission, but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power. There are exotic and speculative methods to recover energy, such as proposed fusion reactor designs which aim to directly extract energy from intense magnetic fields generated by fast-moving charged particles generated by the fusion reaction (see magnetohydrodynamics). 

Phasing out coal-fired power stations and eventually gas-fired power stations, or, if practical, capturing their greenhouse gas emissions, is an important part of the energy transformation required to limit climate change. Vastly more solar power and wind power is forecast to be required, with electricity demand increasing strongly with further electrification of transport, homes and industry. However, in 2023, it was reported that the global electricity supply was approaching peak CO2 emissions thanks to the growth of solar and wind power.

== History ==
The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered in the 1820s and early 1830s by British scientist Michael Faraday. His method, still used today, is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or Faraday disc, between the poles of a magnet. Central power stations became economically practical with the development of alternating current (AC) power transmission, using power transformers to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss.

Commercial electricity production started with the coupling of the dynamo to the hydraulic turbine. The mechanical production of electric power began the Second Industrial Revolution and made possible several inventions using electricity, with the major contributors being Thomas Alva Edison and Nikola Tesla. Previously the only way to produce electricity was by chemical reactions or using battery cells, and the only practical use of electricity was for the telegraph.

Electricity generation at central power stations started in 1882, when a steam engine driving a dynamo at Pearl Street Station produced a DC current that powered public lighting on Pearl Street, New York. The new technology was quickly adopted by many cities around the world, which adapted their gas-fueled street lights to electric power. Soon after electric lights would be used in public buildings, in businesses, and to power public transport, such as trams and trains.

The first power plants used water power or coal. Today a variety of energy sources are used, such as coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, and oil, as well as solar energy, tidal power, and geothermal sources.

In the 1880s the popularity of electricity grew massively with the introduction of the Incandescent light bulb. Although there are 22 recognised inventors of the light bulb prior to Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison, Edison and Swan&#x27;s invention became by far the most successful and popular of all. During the early years of the 19th century, massive jumps in electrical sciences were made. And by the later 19th century the advancement of electrical technology and engineering led to electricity being part of everyday life. With the introduction of many electrical inventions and their implementation into everyday life, the demand for electricity within homes grew dramatically. With this increase in demand, the potential for profit was seen by many entrepreneurs who began investing into electrical systems to eventually create the first electricity public utilities. This process in history is often described as electrification.

The earliest distribution of electricity came from companies operating independently of one another. A consumer would purchase electricity from a producer, and the producer would distribute it through their own power grid. As technology improved so did the productivity and efficiency of its generation. Inventions such as the steam turbine had a massive impact on the efficiency of electrical generation but also the economics of generation as well. This conversion of heat energy into mechanical work was similar to that of steam engines, however at a significantly larger scale and far more productively. The improvements of these large-scale generation plants were critical to the process of centralised generation as they would become vital to the entire power system that we now use today. 

Throughout the middle of the 20th century many utilities began merging their distribution networks due to economic and efficiency benefits. Along with the invention of long-distance power transmission, the coordination of power plants began to form. This system was then secured by regional system operators to ensure stability and reliability. The electrification of homes began in Northern Europe and in the Northern America in the 1920s in large cities and urban areas. It was not until the 1930s that rural areas saw the large-scale establishment of electrification.

== Methods of generation ==

Several fundamental methods exist to convert other forms of energy into electrical energy. Utility-scale generation is achieved by rotating electric generators or by photovoltaic systems. A small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries. Other forms of electricity generation used in niche applications include the triboelectric effect, the piezoelectric effect, the thermoelectric effect, and betavoltaics.

=== Generators ===
Electric generators transform kinetic energy into electricity. This is the most used form for generating electricity based on Faraday&#x27;s law. It can be seen experimentally by rotating a magnet within closed loops of conducting material, e.g. copper wire. Almost all commercial electrical generation uses electromagnetic induction, in which mechanical energy forces a generator to rotate.

=== Electrochemistry ===
Electrochemistry is the direct transformation of chemical energy into electricity, as in a battery. Electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications. Currently, most electrochemical power comes from batteries. Primary cells, such as the common zinc–carbon batteries, act as power sources directly, but secondary cells (i.e. rechargeable batteries) are used for storage systems rather than primary generation systems. Open electrochemical systems, known as fuel cells, can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels. Osmotic power is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merge.

=== Photovoltaic effect ===
The photovoltaic effect is the transformation of light into electrical energy, as in solar cells. Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to DC electricity. Power inverters can then convert that to AC electricity if needed. Although sunlight is free and abundant, solar power electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels. Low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30% conversion efficiency are now commercially available. Over 40% efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems. 

Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed capacity is growing by around 20% per year led by increases in Germany, Japan, United States, China, and India.

== Economics ==

The selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region. The economics vary considerably around the world, resulting in widespread residential selling prices. Hydroelectric plants, nuclear power plants, thermal power plants and renewable sources have their own pros and cons, and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand. 

All power grids have varying loads on them. The daily minimum is the base load, often supplied by plants which run continuously. Nuclear, coal, oil, gas and some hydro plants can supply base load. If well construction costs for natural gas are below $10 per MWh, generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal.

Nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit. However, nuclear disasters have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power, and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high.
Hydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power. It may not be an economically viable single source of production where the ability to store the flow of water is limited and the load varies too much during the annual production cycle.

==Generating equipment==
Electric generators were known in simple forms from the discovery of electromagnetic induction in the 1830s. In general, some form of prime mover such as an engine or the turbines described above, drives a rotating magnetic field past stationary coils of wire thereby turning mechanical energy into electricity. The only commercial scale forms of electricity production that do not employ a generator are photovoltaic solar and fuel cells.

=== Turbines ===

Almost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a turbine, driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas. The turbine drives a generator, thus transforming its mechanical energy into electrical energy by electromagnetic induction. There are many different methods of developing mechanical energy, including heat engines, hydro, wind and tidal power. Most electric generation is driven by heat engines. 

The combustion of fossil fuels supplies most of the energy to these engines, with a significant fraction from nuclear fission and some from renewable sources. The modern steam turbine, invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884, currently generates about 80% of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Turbine types include:
* Steam 
** Water is boiled by coal burned in a thermal power plant. About 41% of all electricity is generated this way.
** Nuclear fission heat created in a nuclear reactor creates steam. Less than 15% of electricity is generated this way.
** Renewable energy. The steam is generated by biomass, solar thermal energy, or geothermal power.
* Natural gas: turbines are driven directly by gases produced by combustion. Combined cycle are driven by both steam and natural gas. They generate power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine and use residual heat to generate steam. At least 20% of the world&#x27;s electricity is generated by natural gas.
*Water Energy is captured by a water turbine from the movement of water - from falling water, the rise and fall of tides or ocean thermal currents (see ocean thermal energy conversion). Currently, hydroelectric plants provide approximately 16% of the world&#x27;s electricity.
*The windmill was a very early wind turbine. In 2018 around 5% of the world&#x27;s electricity was produced from wind
Turbines can also use other heat-transfer liquids than steam. Supercritical carbon dioxide based cycles can provide higher conversion efficiency due to faster heat exchange, higher energy density and simpler power cycle infrastructure. Supercritical carbon dioxide blends, that are currently in development, can further increase efficiency by optimizing its critical pressure and temperature points.

Although turbines are most common in commercial power generation, smaller generators can be powered by gasoline or diesel engines. These may used for backup generation or as a prime source of power within isolated villages.

== World production ==

Total world generation in 2021 was 28,003 TWh, including coal (36%), gas (23%), hydro (15%), nuclear (10%), wind (6.6%), solar (3.7%), oil and other fossil fuels (3.1%), biomass (2.4%) and geothermal and other renewables (0.33%).

=== Production by country ===


China produced a third of the world&#x27;s electricity in 2021, largely from coal. The United States produces half as much as China but uses far more natural gas and nuclear.

== Environmental concerns ==
Variations between countries generating electrical power affect concerns about the environment. In France only 10% of electricity is generated from fossil fuels, the US is higher at 70% and China is at 80%. The cleanliness of electricity depends on its source. Methane leaks (from natural gas to fuel gas-fired power plants) and carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-based electricity generation account for a significant portion of world greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, fossil fuel combustion for electric power generation is responsible for 65% of all emissions of sulfur dioxide, the main component of acid rain. Electricity generation is the fourth highest combined source of NOx, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter in the US.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), low-carbon electricity generation needs to account for 85% of global electrical output by 2040 in order to ward off the worst effects of climate change. Like other organizations including the Energy Impact Center (EIC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the IEA has called for the expansion of nuclear and renewable energy to meet that objective. Some, like EIC founder Bret Kugelmass, believe that nuclear power is the primary method for decarbonizing electricity generation because it can also power direct air capture that removes existing carbon emissions from the atmosphere. Nuclear power plants can also create district heating and desalination projects, limiting carbon emissions and the need for expanded electrical output.

A fundamental issue regarding centralised generation and the current electrical generation methods in use today is the significant negative environmental effects that many of the generation processes have. Processes such as coal and gas not only release carbon dioxide as they combust, but their extraction from the ground also impacts the environment. Open pit coal mines use large areas of land to extract coal and limit the potential for productive land use after the excavation. Natural gas extraction releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere when extracted from the ground greatly increase global greenhouse gases. Although nuclear power plants do not release carbon dioxide through electricity generation, there are risks associated with nuclear waste and safety concerns associated with the use of nuclear sources. 

Per unit of electricity generated coal and gas-fired power life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are almost always at least ten times that of other generation methods.

==Centralised and distributed generation==
Centralised generation is electricity generation by large-scale centralised facilities, sent through transmission lines to consumers. These facilities are usually located far away from consumers and distribute the electricity through high voltage transmission lines to a substation, where it is then distributed to consumers; the basic concept being that multi-megawatt or gigawatt scale large stations create electricity for a large number of people. The vast majority of electricity used is created from centralised generation. Most centralised power generation comes from large power plants run by fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas, though nuclear or large hydroelectricity plants are also commonly used. 

Centralised generation is fundamentally the opposite of distributed generation. Distributed generation is the small-scale generation of electricity to smaller groups of consumers. This can also include independently producing electricity by either solar or wind power. In recent years distributed generation as has seen a spark in popularity due to its propensity to use renewable energy generation methods such as rooftop solar.

== Technologies==
Centralised energy sources are large power plants that produce huge amounts of electricity to a large number of consumers. Most power plants used in centralised generation are thermal power plants meaning that they use a fuel to heat steam to produce a pressurised gas which in turn spins a turbine and generates electricity. This is the traditional way of producing energy. This process relies on several forms of technology to produce widespread electricity, these being natural coal, gas and nuclear forms of thermal generation. More recently solar and wind have become large scale.

=== Solar ===
=== Wind ===
=== Coal===
=== Natural gas===
Natural gas is ignited to create pressurised gas which is used to spin turbines to generate electricity. Natural gas plants use a gas turbine where natural gas is added along with oxygen which in turn combusts and expands through the turbine to force a generator to spin. 

Natural gas power plants are more efficient than coal power generation, they however contribute to climate change, but not as highly as coal generation. Not only do they produce carbon dioxide from the ignition of natural gas, the extraction of gas when mined releases a significant amount of methane into the atmosphere.

=== Nuclear===
Nuclear power plants create electricity through steam turbines where the heat input is from the process of nuclear fission. Currently, nuclear power produces 11% of all electricity in the world. Most nuclear reactors use uranium as a source of fuel. In a process called nuclear fission, energy, in the form of heat, is released when nuclear atoms are split. Electricity is created through the use of a nuclear reactor where heat produced by nuclear fission is used to produce steam which in turn spins turbines and powers the generators. Although there are several types of nuclear reactors, all fundamentally use this process.

Normal emissions due to nuclear power plants are primarily waste heat and radioactive spent fuel. In a reactor accident, significant amounts of radioisotopes can be released to the environment, posing a long term hazard to life. This hazard has been a continuing concern of environmentalists. Accidents such as the Three Mile Island accident, Chernobyl disaster and the Fukushima nuclear disaster illustrate this problem. 

== Electricity generation capacity by country ==
The table lists 45 countries with their total electricity capacities. The data is from 2022.
According to the Energy Information Administration, the total global electricity capacity in 2022 was nearly 8.9 terawatt (TW), more than four times the total global electricity capacity in 1981. The global average per-capita electricity capacity was about 1,120 watts in 2022, nearly two and a half times the global average per-capita electricity capacity in 1981. 

Iceland has the highest installed capacity per capita in the world, at about 8,990 watts. All developed countries have an average per-capita electricity capacity above the global average per-capita electricity capacity, with the United Kingdom having the lowest average per-capita electricity capacity of all other developed countries.

<text>The design of experiments (DOE), also known as experiment design or experimental design, is the design of any task that aims to describe and explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation. The term is generally associated with experiments in which the design introduces conditions that directly affect the variation, but may also refer to the design of quasi-experiments, in which natural conditions that influence the variation are selected for observation.

In its simplest form, an experiment aims at predicting the outcome by introducing a change of the preconditions, which is represented by one or more independent variables, also referred to as &quot;input variables&quot; or &quot;predictor variables.&quot; The change in one or more independent variables is generally hypothesized to result in a change in one or more dependent variables, also referred to as &quot;output variables&quot; or &quot;response variables.&quot; The experimental design may also identify control variables that must be held constant to prevent external factors from affecting the results. Experimental design involves not only the selection of suitable independent, dependent, and control variables, but planning the delivery of the experiment under statistically optimal conditions given the constraints of available resources. There are multiple approaches for determining the set of design points (unique combinations of the settings of the independent variables) to be used in the experiment.

Main concerns in experimental design include the establishment of validity, reliability, and replicability. For example, these concerns can be partially addressed by carefully choosing the independent variable, reducing the risk of measurement error, and ensuring that the documentation of the method is sufficiently detailed. Related concerns include achieving appropriate levels of statistical power and sensitivity.

Correctly designed experiments advance knowledge in the natural and social sciences and engineering, with design of experiments methodology recognised as a key tool in the successful implementation of a Quality by Design (QbD) framework. Other applications include marketing and policy making. The study of the design of experiments is an important topic in metascience.

==History==

===Statistical experiments, following Charles S. Peirce===
A theory of statistical inference was developed by Charles S. Peirce in &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; (1877–1878) and &quot;A Theory of Probable Inference&quot; (1883), two publications that emphasized the importance of randomization-based inference in statistics.

====Randomized experiments====
Charles S. Peirce randomly assigned volunteers to a blinded, repeated-measures design to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights.
Peirce&#x27;s experiment inspired other researchers in psychology and education, which developed a research tradition of randomized experiments in laboratories and specialized textbooks in the 1800s.

====Optimal designs for regression models====
Charles S. Peirce also contributed the first English-language publication on an optimal design for regression models in 1876. A pioneering optimal design for polynomial regression was suggested by Gergonne in 1815. In 1918, Kirstine Smith published optimal designs for polynomials of degree six (and less).

===Sequences of experiments===
The use of a sequence of experiments, where the design of each may depend on the results of previous experiments, including the possible decision to stop experimenting, is within the scope of sequential analysis, a field that was pioneered by Abraham Wald in the context of sequential tests of statistical hypotheses. Herman Chernoff wrote an overview of optimal sequential designs, while adaptive designs have been surveyed by S. Zacks. One specific type of sequential design is the &quot;two-armed bandit&quot;, generalized to the multi-armed bandit, on which early work was done by Herbert Robbins in 1952.

==Fisher&#x27;s principles==

A methodology for designing experiments was proposed by Ronald Fisher, in his innovative books: &quot;The Arrangement of Field Experiments&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Design of Experiments&quot; (1935). Much of his pioneering work dealt with agricultural applications of statistical methods. As a mundane example, he described how to test the lady tasting tea hypothesis, that a certain lady could distinguish by flavour alone whether the milk or the tea was first placed in the cup. These methods have been broadly adapted in biological, psychological, and agricultural research.

;Comparison
:In some fields of study it is not possible to have independent measurements to a traceable metrology standard. Comparisons between treatments are much more valuable and are usually preferable, and often compared against a scientific control or traditional treatment that acts as baseline.

;Randomization
:Random assignment is the process of assigning individuals at random to groups or to different groups in an experiment, so that each individual of the population has the same chance of becoming a participant in the study. The random assignment of individuals to groups (or conditions within a group) distinguishes a rigorous, &quot;true&quot; experiment from an observational study or &quot;quasi-experiment&quot;. There is an extensive body of mathematical theory that explores the consequences of making the allocation of units to treatments by means of some random mechanism (such as tables of random numbers, or the use of randomization devices such as playing cards or dice). Assigning units to treatments at random tends to mitigate confounding, which makes effects due to factors other than the treatment to appear to result from the treatment.

:The risks associated with random allocation (such as having a serious imbalance in a key characteristic between a treatment group and a control group) are calculable and hence can be managed down to an acceptable level by using enough experimental units. However, if the population is divided into several subpopulations that somehow differ, and the research requires each subpopulation to be equal in size, stratified sampling can be used. In that way, the units in each subpopulation are randomized, but not the whole sample. The results of an experiment can be generalized reliably from the experimental units to a larger statistical population of units only if the experimental units are a random sample from the larger population; the probable error of such an extrapolation depends on the sample size, among other things.

;Statistical replication
:Measurements are usually subject to variation and measurement uncertainty; thus they are repeated and full experiments are replicated to help identify the sources of variation, to better estimate the true effects of treatments, to further strengthen the experiment&#x27;s reliability and validity, and to add to the existing knowledge of the topic. However, certain conditions must be met before the replication of the experiment is commenced: the original research question has been published in a peer-reviewed journal or widely cited, the researcher is independent of the original experiment, the researcher must first try to replicate the original findings using the original data, and the write-up should state that the study conducted is a replication study that tried to follow the original study as strictly as possible.

;Blocking
:Blocking is the non-random arrangement of experimental units into groups (blocks) consisting of units that are similar to one another. Blocking reduces known but irrelevant sources of variation between units and thus allows greater precision in the estimation of the source of variation under study.
;
;Orthogonality

:Orthogonality concerns the forms of comparison (contrasts) that can be legitimately and efficiently carried out. Contrasts can be represented by vectors and sets of orthogonal contrasts are uncorrelated and independently distributed if the data are normal. Because of this independence, each orthogonal treatment provides different information to the others. If there are &quot;T&quot; treatments and &quot;T&quot; – 1 orthogonal contrasts, all the information that can be captured from the experiment is obtainable from the set of contrasts.

;Multifactorial experiments
:Use of multifactorial experiments instead of the one-factor-at-a-time method. These are efficient at evaluating the effects and possible interactions of several factors (independent variables). Analysis of experiment design is built on the foundation of the analysis of variance, a collection of models that partition the observed variance into components, according to what factors the experiment must estimate or test.

==Example==

This example of design experiments is attributed to Harold Hotelling, building on examples from Frank Yates. The experiments designed in this example involve combinatorial designs.

Weights of eight objects are measured using a pan balance and set of standard weights. Each weighing measures the weight difference between objects in the left pan and any objects in the right pan by adding calibrated weights to the lighter pan until the balance is in equilibrium. Each measurement has a random error. The average error is zero; the standard deviations of the probability distribution of the errors is the same number σ on different weighings; errors on different weighings are independent. Denote the true weights by

:formula_1

We consider two different experiments:

# Weigh each object in one pan, with the other pan empty. Let &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; be the measured weight of the object, for &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., 8.
# Do the eight weighings according to the following schedule—a weighing matrix:

:: formula_2

: Let &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; be the measured difference for &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., 8. Then the estimated value of the weight &quot;θ&quot;1 is

:: formula_3

:Similar estimates can be found for the weights of the other items:

:: formula_4

The question of design of experiments is: which experiment is better?

The variance of the estimate &quot;X&quot;1 of &quot;θ&quot;1 is &quot;σ&quot;2 if we use the first experiment. But if we use the second experiment, the variance of the estimate given above is &quot;σ&quot;2/8. Thus the second experiment gives us 8 times as much precision for the estimate of a single item, and estimates all items simultaneously, with the same precision. What the second experiment achieves with eight would require 64 weighings if the items are weighed separately. However, note that the estimates for the items obtained in the second experiment have errors that correlate with each other.

Many problems of the design of experiments involve combinatorial designs, as in this example and others.

==Avoiding false positives==

False positive conclusions, often resulting from the pressure to publish or the author&#x27;s own confirmation bias, are an inherent hazard in many fields.

Use of double-blind designs can prevent biases potentially leading to false positives in the data collection phase. When a double-blind design is used, participants are randomly assigned to experimental groups but the researcher is unaware of what participants belong to which group. Therefore, the researcher can not affect the participants&#x27; response to the intervention.

Experimental designs with undisclosed degrees of freedom are a problem, in that they can lead to conscious or unconscious &quot;p-hacking&quot;: trying multiple things until you get the desired result. It typically involves the manipulation – perhaps unconsciously – of the process of statistical analysis and the degrees of freedom until they return a figure below the p&lt;.05 level of statistical significance. 

P-hacking can be prevented by preregistering researches, in which researchers have to send their data analysis plan to the journal they wish to publish their paper in before they even start their data collection, so no data manipulation is possible.

Another way to prevent this is taking a double-blind design to the data-analysis phase, making the study triple-blind, where the data are sent to a data-analyst unrelated to the research who scrambles up the data so there is no way to know which participants belong to before they are potentially taken away as outliers.

Clear and complete documentation of the experimental methodology is also important in order to support replication of results.

==Discussion topics when setting up an experimental design==
An experimental design or randomized clinical trial requires careful consideration of several factors before actually doing the experiment. An experimental design is the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment. Some of the following topics have already been discussed in the principles of experimental design section:

# How many factors does the design have, and are the levels of these factors fixed or random?
# Are control conditions needed, and what should they be?
# Manipulation checks: did the manipulation really work?
# What are the background variables?
# What is the sample size? How many units must be collected for the experiment to be generalisable and have enough power?
# What is the relevance of interactions between factors?
# What is the influence of delayed effects of substantive factors on outcomes?
# How do response shifts affect self-report measures?
# How feasible is repeated administration of the same measurement instruments to the same units at different occasions, with a post-test and follow-up tests?
# What about using a proxy pretest?
# Are there confounding variables?
# Should the client/patient, researcher or even the analyst of the data be blind to conditions?
# What is the feasibility of subsequent application of different conditions to the same units?
# How many of each control and noise factors should be taken into account?

The independent variable of a study often has many levels or different groups. In a true experiment, researchers can have an experimental group, which is where their intervention testing the hypothesis is implemented, and a control group, which has all the same element as the experimental group, without the interventional element. Thus, when everything else except for one intervention is held constant, researchers can certify with some certainty that this one element is what caused the observed change. In some instances, having a control group is not ethical. This is sometimes solved using two different experimental groups. In some cases, independent variables cannot be manipulated, for example when testing the difference between two groups who have a different disease, or testing the difference between genders (obviously variables that would be hard or unethical to assign participants to). In these cases, a quasi-experimental design may be used.

==Causal attributions==
In the pure experimental design, the independent (predictor) variable is manipulated by the researcher – that is – every participant of the research is chosen randomly from the population, and each participant chosen is assigned randomly to conditions of the independent variable. Only when this is done is it possible to certify with high probability that the reason for the differences in the outcome variables are caused by the different conditions. Therefore, researchers should choose the experimental design over other design types whenever possible. However, the nature of the independent variable does not always allow for manipulation. In those cases, researchers must be aware of not certifying about causal attribution when their design doesn&#x27;t allow for it. For example, in observational designs, participants are not assigned randomly to conditions, and so if there are differences found in outcome variables between conditions, it is likely that there is something other than the differences between the conditions that causes the differences in outcomes, that is – a third variable. The same goes for studies with correlational design.

==Statistical control==
It is best that a process be in reasonable statistical control prior to conducting designed experiments. When this is not possible, proper blocking, replication, and randomization allow for the careful conduct of designed experiments.
To control for nuisance variables, researchers institute control checks as additional measures. Investigators should ensure that uncontrolled influences (e.g., source credibility perception) do not skew the findings of the study. A manipulation check is one example of a control check. Manipulation checks allow investigators to isolate the chief variables to strengthen support that these variables are operating as planned.

One of the most important requirements of experimental research designs is the necessity of eliminating the effects of spurious, intervening, and antecedent variables. In the most basic model, cause (X) leads to effect (Y). But there could be a third variable (Z) that influences (Y), and X might not be the true cause at all. Z is said to be a spurious variable and must be controlled for. The same is true for intervening variables (a variable in between the supposed cause (X) and the effect (Y)), and anteceding variables (a variable prior to the supposed cause (X) that is the true cause). When a third variable is involved and has not been controlled for, the relation is said to be a zero order relationship. In most practical applications of experimental research designs there are several causes (X1, X2, X3). In most designs, only one of these causes is manipulated at a time.

==Experimental designs after Fisher==
Some efficient designs for estimating several main effects were found independently and in near succession by Raj Chandra Bose and K. Kishen in 1940 at the Indian Statistical Institute, but remained little known until the Plackett–Burman designs were published in &quot;Biometrika&quot; in 1946. About the same time, C. R. Rao introduced the concepts of orthogonal arrays as experimental designs. This concept played a central role in the development of Taguchi methods by Genichi Taguchi, which took place during his visit to Indian Statistical Institute in early 1950s. His methods were successfully applied and adopted by Japanese and Indian industries and subsequently were also embraced by US industry albeit with some reservations.

In 1950, Gertrude Mary Cox and William Gemmell Cochran published the book &quot;Experimental Designs,&quot; which became the major reference work on the design of experiments for statisticians for years afterwards.

Developments of the theory of linear models have encompassed and surpassed the cases that concerned early writers. Today, the theory rests on advanced topics in linear algebra, algebra and combinatorics.

As with other branches of statistics, experimental design is pursued using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches: In evaluating statistical procedures like experimental designs, frequentist statistics studies the sampling distribution while Bayesian statistics updates a probability distribution on the parameter space.

Some important contributors to the field of experimental designs are C. S. Peirce, R. A. Fisher, F. Yates, R. C. Bose, A. C. Atkinson, R. A. Bailey, D. R. Cox, G. E. P. Box, W. G. Cochran, W. T. Federer, V. V. Fedorov, A. S. Hedayat, J. Kiefer, O. Kempthorne, J. A. Nelder, Andrej Pázman, Friedrich Pukelsheim, D. Raghavarao, C. R. Rao, Shrikhande S. S., J. N. Srivastava, William J. Studden, G. Taguchi and H. P. Wynn.

The textbooks of D. Montgomery, R. Myers, and G. Box/W. Hunter/J.S. Hunter have reached generations of students and practitioners. Furthermore, there is ongoing discussion of experimental design in the context of model building for models either static or dynamic models, also known as system identification. 

==Human participant constraints==
Laws and ethical considerations preclude some carefully designed 
experiments with human subjects. Legal constraints are dependent on 
jurisdiction. Constraints may involve 
institutional review boards, informed consent 
and confidentiality affecting both clinical (medical) trials and 
behavioral and social science experiments.
In the field of toxicology, for example, experimentation is performed 
on laboratory &quot;animals&quot; with the goal of defining safe exposure limits 
for &quot;humans&quot;. Balancing
the constraints are views from the medical field. Regarding the randomization of patients, 
&quot;... if no one knows which therapy is better, there is no ethical 
imperative to use one therapy or another.&quot; (p 380) Regarding 
experimental design, &quot;...it is clearly not ethical to place subjects 
at risk to collect data in a poorly designed study when this situation 
can be easily avoided...&quot;. (p 393)

<text>Empirical research is research using empirical evidence. It is also a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience. Empiricism values some research more than other kinds. Empirical evidence (the record of one&#x27;s direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively. Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called data). Research design varies by field and by the question being investigated. Many researchers combine qualitative and quantitative forms of analysis to better answer questions that cannot be studied in laboratory settings, particularly in the social sciences and in education.

In some fields, quantitative research may begin with a research question (e.g., &quot;Does listening to vocal music during the learning of a word list have an effect on later memory for these words?&quot;) which is tested through experimentation. Usually, the researcher has a certain theory regarding the topic under investigation. Based on this theory, statements or hypotheses will be proposed (e.g., &quot;Listening to vocal music has a negative effect on learning a word list.&quot;). From these hypotheses, predictions about specific events are derived (e.g., &quot;People who study a word list while listening to vocal music will remember fewer words on a later memory test than people who study a word list in silence.&quot;). These predictions can then be tested with a suitable experiment. Depending on the outcomes of the experiment, the theory on which the hypotheses and predictions were based will be supported or not, or may need to be modified and then subjected to further testing.

==Terminology==
The term empirical was originally used to refer to certain ancient Greek practitioners of medicine who rejected adherence to the dogmatic doctrines of the day, preferring instead to rely on the observation of phenomena as perceived in experience. Later empiricism referred to a theory of knowledge in philosophy which adheres to the principle that knowledge arises from experience and evidence gathered specifically using the senses. In scientific use, the term empirical refers to the gathering of data using only evidence that is observable by the senses or in some cases using calibrated scientific instruments. What early philosophers described as empiricist and empirical research have in common is the dependence on observable data to formulate and test theories and come to conclusions.

==Usage==
The researcher attempts to describe accurately the interaction between the instrument (or the human senses) and the entity being observed. If instrumentation is involved, the researcher is expected to calibrate his/her instrument by applying it to known standard objects and documenting the results before applying it to unknown objects. In other words, it describes the research that has not taken place before and their results.

In practice, the accumulation of evidence for or against any particular theory involves planned research designs for the collection of empirical data, and academic rigor plays a large part of judging the merits of research design. Several typologies for such designs have been suggested, one of the most popular of which comes from Campbell and Stanley. They are responsible for popularizing the widely cited distinction among pre-experimental, experimental, and quasi-experimental designs and are staunch advocates of the central role of randomized experiments in educational research.

=== Scientific research ===
Accurate analysis of data using standardized statistical methods in scientific studies is critical to determining the validity of empirical research. Statistical formulas such as regression, uncertainty coefficient, t-test, chi square, and various types of ANOVA (analyses of variance) are fundamental to forming logical, valid conclusions. If empirical data reach significance under the appropriate statistical formula, the research hypothesis is supported. If not, the null hypothesis is supported (or, more accurately, not rejected), meaning no effect of the independent variable(s) was observed on the dependent variable(s).

The result of empirical research using statistical hypothesis testing is never &quot;proof&quot;. It can only &quot;support&quot; a hypothesis, &quot;reject&quot; it, or do neither. These methods yield only probabilities. Among scientific researchers, empirical &quot;evidence&quot; (as distinct from empirical &quot;research&quot;) refers to objective evidence that appears the same regardless of the observer. For example, a thermometer will not display different temperatures for each individual who observes it. Temperature, as measured by an accurate, well calibrated thermometer, is empirical evidence. By contrast, non-empirical evidence is subjective, depending on the observer. Following the previous example, observer A might truthfully report that a room is warm, while observer B might truthfully report that the same room is cool, though both observe the same reading on the thermometer. The use of empirical evidence negates this effect of personal (i.e., subjective) experience or time.

The varying perception of empiricism and rationalism shows concern with the limit to which there is dependency on experience of sense as an effort of gaining knowledge. According to rationalism, there are a number of different ways in which sense experience is gained independently for the knowledge and concepts. According to empiricism, sense experience is considered as the main source of every piece of knowledge and the concepts. 
In general, rationalists are known for the development of their own views following two different way. First, the key argument can be placed that there are cases in which the content of knowledge or concepts end up outstripping the information. This outstripped information is provided by the sense experience (Hjørland, 2010, 2). Second, there is construction of accounts as to how reasoning helps in the provision of addition knowledge about a specific or broader scope. Empiricists are known to be presenting complementary senses related to thought. 

First, there is development of accounts of how there is provision of information by experience that is cited by rationalists. This is insofar for having it in the initial place. At times, empiricists tend to be opting skepticism as an option of rationalism. If experience is not helpful in the provision of knowledge or concept cited by rationalists, then they do not exist (Pearce, 2010, 35). Second, empiricists have a tendency of attacking the accounts of rationalists, while considering reasoning to be an important source of knowledge or concepts. 

The overall disagreement between empiricists and rationalists shows major concerns about how knowledge is gained with respect to the sources of knowledge and concepts. In some of the cases, disagreement on the point of gaining knowledge results in the provision of conflicting responses to other aspects as well. There might be a disagreement in the overall feature of warrant, while limiting the knowledge and thought. Empiricists are known for sharing the view that there is no existence of innate knowledge and rather that is derivation of knowledge out of experience. These experiences are either reasoned using the mind or sensed through the five senses human possess (Bernard, 2011, 5). On the other hand, rationalists are known to be sharing the view that there is existence of innate knowledge and this is different for the objects of innate knowledge being chosen. 

In order to follow rationalism, there must be adoption of one of the three claims related to the theory that are deduction or intuition, innate knowledge, and innate concept. The more there is removal of concept from mental operations and experience, there can be performance over experience with increased plausibility in being innate. Further ahead, empiricism in context with a specific subject provides a rejection of the corresponding version related to innate knowledge and deduction or intuition (Weiskopf, 2008, 16). Insofar as there is acknowledgement of concepts and knowledge within the area of subject, the knowledge has major dependence on experience through human senses.

==Empirical cycle==

A.D. de Groot&#x27;s empirical cycle:
# Observation: The observation of a phenomenon and inquiry concerning its causes.
# Induction: The formulation of hypotheses - generalized explanations for the phenomenon.
# Deduction: The formulation of experiments that will test the hypotheses (i.e. confirm them if true, refute them if false). 
# Testing: The procedures by which the hypotheses are tested and data are collected.
# Evaluation: The interpretation of the data and the formulation of a theory - an abductive argument that presents the results of the experiment as the most reasonable explanation for the phenomenon.

<text>Engineering statistics combines engineering and statistics using scientific methods for analyzing data. Engineering statistics involves data concerning manufacturing processes such as: component dimensions, tolerances, type of material, and fabrication process control. There are many methods used in engineering analysis and they are often displayed as histograms to give a visual of the data as opposed to being just numerical. Examples of methods are:
# Design of Experiments (DOE) is a methodology for formulating scientific and engineering problems using statistical models. The protocol specifies a randomization procedure for the experiment and specifies the primary data-analysis, particularly in hypothesis testing. In a secondary analysis, the statistical analyst further examines the data to suggest other questions and to help plan future experiments. In engineering applications, the goal is often to optimize a process or product, rather than to subject a scientific hypothesis to test of its predictive adequacy. The use of optimal (or near optimal) designs reduces the cost of experimentation.
# Quality control and process control use statistics as a tool to manage conformance to specifications of manufacturing processes and their products.
# Time and methods engineering use statistics to study repetitive operations in manufacturing in order to set standards and find optimum (in some sense) manufacturing procedures.
# Reliability engineering which measures the ability of a system to perform for its intended function (and time) and has tools for improving performance.
# Probabilistic design involving the use of probability in product and system design
# System identification uses statistical methods to build mathematical models of dynamical systems from measured data. System identification also includes the optimal design of experiments for efficiently generating informative data for fitting such models.

==History==

Engineering statistics dates back to 1000 B.C. when the Abacus was developed as means to calculate numerical data. In the 1600s, the development of information processing to systematically analyze and process data began. In 1654, the Slide Rule technique was developed by Robert Bissaker for advanced data calculations. In 1833, a British mathematician named Charles Babbage designed the idea of an automatic computer which inspired developers at Harvard University and IBM to design the first mechanical automatic-sequence-controlled calculator called MARK I. The integration of computers and calculators into the industry brought about a more efficient means of analyzing data and the beginning of engineering statistics.

== Examples ==

=== Factorial Experimental Design ===

A factorial experiment is one where, contrary to the standard experimental philosophy of changing only one independent variable and holding everything else constant, multiple independent variables are tested at the same time. With this design, statistical engineers can see both the direct effects of one independent variable (main effect), as well as potential interaction effects that arise when multiple independent variables provide a different result when together than either would on its own.

=== Six Sigma ===

Six Sigma is a set of techniques to improve the reliability of a manufacturing process. Ideally, all products will have the exact same specifications equivalent to what was desired, but countless imperfections of real-world manufacturing makes this impossible. The as-built specifications of a product are assumed to be centered around a mean, with each individual product deviating some amount away from that mean in a normal distribution. The goal of Six Sigma is to ensure that the acceptable specification limits are six standard deviations away from the mean of the distribution; in other words, that each step of the manufacturing process has at most a 0.00034% chance of producing a defect.

<doc id="9549" wikidata="Q16867" url="?curid=9549" title="Edgar Allan Poe">
<text>Edgar Allan Poe (; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic who is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales involving mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as one of the central figures of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the United States and of early American literature. Poe was one of the country&#x27;s first successful practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered to be the inventor of the detective fiction genre. In addition, he is credited with contributing significantly to the emergence of science fiction. He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living exclusively through writing, which resulted in a financially difficult life and career.

Poe was born in Boston. He was the second child of actors David and Elizabeth &quot;Eliza&quot; Poe. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when Eliza died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he lived with them well into young adulthood. Poe attended the University of Virginia but left after only a year due to a lack of money. He frequently quarreled with John Allan over the funds needed to continue his education as well as his gambling debts. In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under the assumed name of Edgar A. Perry, he published his first collection, &quot;Tamerlane and Other Poems&quot;, which was credited only to &quot;a Bostonian&quot;. Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan&#x27;s wife, Frances, in 1829. However, Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared his intention to become a writer, primarily of poems, and parted ways with Allan.

Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move between several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In 1836, when he was 27, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm. She died of tuberculosis in 1847.

In January 1845, he published his poem &quot;The Raven&quot; to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal, &quot;The Penn&quot;, later renamed &quot;The Stylus&quot;. But before it began publishing, Poe died in Baltimore in 1849, aged 40, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of his death remains unknown and has been attributed to many causes, including disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide.

Poe&#x27;s works influenced the development of literature throughout the world and even impacted such specialized fields as cosmology and cryptography. Since his death, he and his writings have appeared throughout popular culture in such fields as art, photography, literary allusions, music, motion pictures, and television. Several of his homes are dedicated museums. In addition, The Mystery Writers of America presents an annual Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.

==Early life and education==

Edgar Poe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 19, 1809, the second child of American actor David Poe Jr. and English-born actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe. He had an elder brother, Henry, and a younger sister, Rosalie. Their grandfather, David Poe, had emigrated from County Cavan, Ireland, around 1750.

His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died a year later from pulmonary tuberculosis. Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful merchant in Richmond, Virginia, who dealt in a variety of goods, including cloth, wheat, tombstones, tobacco, and slaves. The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name &quot;Edgar Allan Poe&quot;, although they never formally adopted him.

The Allan family had Poe baptized into the Episcopal Church in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son. The family sailed to the United Kingdom in 1815, and Poe attended a grammar school for a short period in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland, where Allan was born, before rejoining the family in London in 1816. There he studied at a boarding school in Chelsea until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby&#x27;s Manor House School in Stoke Newington, then a suburb north of London.

Poe moved to Richmond with the Allans in 1820. In 1824, he served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as the city celebrated the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette. In March 1825, Allan&#x27;s uncle and business benefactor William Galt died, who was said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond, leaving Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000 (). By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick house called Moldavia.

Poe may have become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he registered at the University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages. The university was in its infancy, established on the ideals of its founder, Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were mostly ignored. Jefferson enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty.

The unique system was rather chaotic, and there was a high dropout rate. During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. He claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, or procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe&#x27;s debts increased. Poe gave up on the university after a year, but did not feel welcome to return to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart, Royster, had married another man, Alexander Shelton. Instead, he traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper contributor. Poe started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet during this period.

==Military career==

As Poe was unable to support himself, he decided to enlist in the United States Army as a private on May 27, 1827, using the name &quot;Edgar A. Perry&quot;. Although he claimed that he was , he was actually 18. He first served at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor for five dollars a month. That same year, his first book was published, a 40-page collection of poetry titled &quot;Tamerlane and Other Poems&quot;, attributed only to &quot;A Bostonian&quot;. 50 copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention. Poe&#x27;s 1st Regiment of Artillery was posted to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina, before embarking on the brig &quot;Waltham&quot; on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to &quot;artificer&quot;, an enlisted tradesman tasked with preparing shells for artillery. His monthly pay doubled. Poe served for two years, attaining the rank of sergeant major for artillery, the highest rank that a non-commissioned officer could achieve. He then sought to end his five-year enlistment early.

Poe revealed his real name and his actual circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard, who promised to allow Poe to be honorably discharged if he reconciled with Allan. Poe then wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic and spent several months ignoring Poe&#x27;s pleas. Allan may not have written to Poe to inform him of his foster mother&#x27;s illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829. Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife&#x27;s death, Allan agreed to support Poe&#x27;s desire to receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.

Poe was finally discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlistment. Before entering West Point, he moved to Baltimore, where he stayed with his widowed aunt, Maria Clemm, her daughter Virginia Eliza Clemm (Poe&#x27;s first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe. That September, Poe received &quot;the very first words of encouragement I ever remember to have heard&quot; in a review of his poetry by influential critic John Neal, which prompted Poe to dedicate one of the poems to Neal in his second book, &quot;Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems&quot;, published in Baltimore in 1829.

Poe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson. This marriage and the bitter quarrels with Poe over children born to Allan out of extramarital affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe. Poe then decided to leave West Point by intentionally getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, and church. Knowing he would be found guilty, Poe pleaded not guilty to the charges in order to induce dismissal.

Poe left for New York in February 1831 and then released a third volume of poems, simply titled, &quot;Poems&quot;. The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, some of whom donated as much as 75 cents to the cause. The total raised was approximately $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones Poe had written about commanding officers in the past. The book was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as &quot;Second Edition&quot;, and included a page saying, &quot;To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated&quot;. It once again reprinted the somewhat lengthy poems, &quot;Tamerlane&quot;, and &quot;Al Araaf&quot;, while also including six previously unpublished poems, conspicuous among which are, &quot;To Helen&quot;, and &quot;The City in the Sea&quot;. Poe returned to Baltimore and to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831. His elder brother Henry had been seriously ill for some time, in part due to complications resulting from alcoholism, and he died on August 1, 1831.

==Publishing career==

After his brother&#x27;s death, Poe&#x27;s earnest attempts to make a living as a writer were mostly unsuccessful. However, he eventually managed to earn a living by his pen alone, becoming one of the first American authors to do so. His efforts were initially hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. American publishers often chose to sell unauthorized copies of works by British authors rather than pay for new work written by Americans, regardless of merit. The initially anemic reception of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s work may also have been influenced by the Panic of 1837.

There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues. Publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised, and Poe repeatedly resorted to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.After his early attempts at poetry, Poe turned his attention to prose, perhaps based on John Neal&#x27;s critiques in &quot;The Yankee&quot; magazine. He placed a few stories with a Philadelphia publication and began work on his only drama, &quot;Politian&quot;. The &quot;Baltimore Saturday Visiter&quot; awarded him a prize in October 1833 for his often overlooked short story &quot;MS. Found in a Bottle&quot;. The tale brought him to the attention of John P. Kennedy, a Baltimorean of considerable means who helped Poe place some of his other stories and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; in Richmond.

In 1835, Poe became assistant editor of the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;, but White discharged him within a few weeks, allegedly for being drunk on the job. Poe then returned to Baltimore, where he obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were actually married at that time. He was 26 and she was 13.

Poe was reinstated by White after promising to improve his behavior, and he returned to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the &quot;Messenger&quot; until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500. He published several poems, and many book reviews, critiques, essays, and articles, as well as a few stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia were officially married at a Presbyterian wedding ceremony performed by Amasa Converse at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm&#x27;s age as 21.

===Philadelphia===
In 1838, Poe relocated to Philadelphia, where he lived at four different residences between 1838 and 1844, one of which at 532 N. 7th Street has been preserved as a National Historic Landmark.

That same year, Poe&#x27;s only novel, &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; was published and widely reviewed. In the summer of 1839, he became assistant editor of &quot;Burton&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing the reputation he had established at the &quot;Messenger&quot; as one of America&#x27;s foremost literary critics. Also in 1839, the collection &quot;Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque&quot; was published in two volumes, though Poe received little remuneration from it and the volumes received generally mixed reviews.

In June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal called &quot;The Stylus&quot;, although he originally intended to call it &quot;The Penn&quot;, since it would have been based in Philadelphia. He bought advertising space for the prospectus in the June 6, 1840, issue of Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;: &quot;Prospectus of the Penn Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A. Poe.&quot; However, Poe died before the journal could be produced.

Poe left &quot;Burton&#x27;s&quot; after a year and found a position as writer and co-editor at &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which was a successful monthly publication. In the last number of &quot;Graham&#x27;s&quot; for 1841, Poe was among the co-signatories to an editorial note of celebration concerning the tremendous success the magazine had achieved in the past year: &quot;Perhaps the editors of no magazine, either in America or in Europe, ever sat down, at the close of a year, to contemplate the progress of their work with more satisfaction than we do now. Our success has been unexampled, almost incredible. We may assert without fear of contradiction that no periodical ever witnessed the same increase during so short a period.&quot;

Around this time, Poe attempted to secure a position in the administration of John Tyler, claiming that he was a member of the Whig Party. He hoped to be appointed to the United States Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler&#x27;s son Robert, an acquaintance of Poe&#x27;s friend Frederick Thomas. However, Poe failed to appear for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk. Poe was promised an appointment, but all positions were eventually filled by others.

One evening in January 1842, Virginia showed the first signs of consumption, or tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano, which Poe described as the breaking of a blood vessel in her throat. She only partially recovered, and Poe is alleged to have begun to drink heavily due to the stress he suffered as a result of her illness. He then left &quot;Graham&#x27;s&quot; and attempted to find a new position, for a time again angling for a government post. He finally decided to return to New York where he worked briefly at the &quot;Evening Mirror&quot; before becoming editor of the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot;, and later its owner. There Poe alienated himself from other writers by, among other things, publicly accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism, though Longfellow never responded. On January 29, 1845, Poe&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Raven&quot;, appeared in the &quot;Evening Mirror&quot; and quickly became a popular sensation. It made Poe a household name almost instantly, though at the time, he was paid only $9 () for its publication. It was concurrently published in &quot;The American Review: A Whig Journal&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Quarles&quot;.

===The Bronx===
The &quot;Broadway Journal&quot; failed in 1846, and Poe then moved to a cottage in Fordham, New York, in the Bronx. That home, now known as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, was relocated in later years to a park near the southeast corner of the Grand Concourse and Kingsbridge Road. Nearby, Poe befriended the Jesuits at St. John&#x27;s College, now Fordham University. Virginia died at the cottage on January 30, 1847. Biographers and critics often suggest that Poe&#x27;s frequent theme of the &quot;death of a beautiful woman&quot; stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his wife.

Poe was increasingly unstable after his wife&#x27;s death. He attempted to court the poet Sarah Helen Whitman, who lived in Providence, Rhode Island. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe&#x27;s drinking and erratic behavior. There is also strong evidence that Whitman&#x27;s mother intervened and did much to derail the relationship. Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.

==Death==
On October 3, 1849, Poe was found semiconscious in Baltimore, &quot;in great distress, and... in need of immediate assistance&quot;, according to Joseph W. Walker, who found him. He was taken to Washington Medical College, where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849, at 5:00 in the morning.

Poe was not coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition and why he was wearing clothes that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name &quot;Reynolds&quot; on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. His attending physician said that Poe&#x27;s final words were, &quot;Lord help my poor soul&quot;. All of the relevant medical records have been lost, including Poe&#x27;s death certificate.

Newspapers at the time reported Poe&#x27;s death as &quot;congestion of the brain&quot; or &quot;cerebral inflammation&quot;, common euphemisms for death from disreputable causes such as alcoholism. The actual cause of death remains a mystery. Speculation has included &quot;delirium tremens&quot;, heart disease, epilepsy, syphilis, meningeal inflammation, carbon monoxide poisoning, and rabies. One theory dating from 1872 suggests that Poe&#x27;s death resulted from cooping, a form of electoral fraud in which citizens were forced to vote for a particular candidate, sometimes leading to violence and even murder.

===Griswold&#x27;s memoir===
Immediately after Poe&#x27;s death, his literary rival Rufus Wilmot Griswold, wrote a slanted, high-profile obituary under a pseudonym, filled with falsehoods that cast Poe as a lunatic, and which described him as a person who &quot;walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips moving in indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate prayers, (never for himself, for he felt, or professed to feel, that he was already damned)&quot;.

The long obituary appeared in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, signed, &quot;Ludwig&quot; on the day Poe was buried in Baltimore. It was further published throughout the country. The obituary began, &quot;Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it.&quot; &quot;Ludwig&quot; was soon identified as Griswold, an editor, critic, and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe&#x27;s literary executor and attempted to destroy his enemy&#x27;s reputation after his death.

Griswold wrote a biographical article of Poe called &quot;Memoir of the Author&quot;, which he included in an 1850 volume of the collected works. There he depicted Poe as a depraved, drunken, drug-addled madman, including some of Poe&#x27;s &quot;letters&quot; as evidence. Many of his claims were either outright lies or obvious distortions; for example, there is little to no evidence that Edgar Allan Poe was a drug addict. Griswold&#x27;s book was denounced by those who knew Poe well, including John Neal, who published an article defending Poe and attacking Griswold as a &quot;Rhadamanthus, who is not to be bilked of his fee, a thimble-full of newspaper notoriety&quot;. Griswold&#x27;s book nevertheless became a popularly accepted biographical source. This was in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted, and in part because readers thrilled at the thought of reading works by an &quot;evil&quot; man. Letters that Griswold presented as proof were later revealed as forgeries.

==Literary style and themes==
=== Genres ===
Poe&#x27;s best-known fiction works have been labeled as Gothic horror, and adhere to that genre&#x27;s general propensity to appeal to the public&#x27;s taste for the terrifying or psychologically intimidating. His most recurrent themes seem to deal with death. The physical signs indicating death, the nature of decomposition, the popular concerns of Poe&#x27;s day about premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, are all at length explored in his more notable works. Many of his writings are generally considered to be part of the dark romanticism genre, which is said to be a literary reaction to transcendentalism, which Poe strongly criticized. He referred to followers of the transcendental movement, including Emerson, as &quot;Frog-Pondians&quot;, after the pond on Boston Common, and ridiculed their writings as &quot;metaphor—run mad,&quot; lapsing into &quot;obscurity for obscurity&#x27;s sake&quot; or &quot;mysticism for mysticism&#x27;s sake&quot;. However, Poe once wrote in a letter to Thomas Holley Chivers that he did not dislike transcendentalists, &quot;only the pretenders and sophists among them&quot;.

Beyond the horror stories he is most famous for, Poe also wrote a number of satires, humor tales, and hoaxes. He was a master of sarcasm. For comic effect, he often used irony and ludicrous extravagance in a deliberate attempt to liberate the reader from cultural and literary conformity. &quot;Metzengerstein&quot; is the first story that Poe is known to have published, and his first foray into horror, but it was originally intended as a burlesque satirizing the popular genres of Poe&#x27;s time. Poe was also one of the forerunners of American science fiction, responding in his voluminous writing to such emerging literary trends as the explorations into the possibilities of hot air balloons as featured in such works as, &quot;The Balloon-Hoax&quot;.

Much of Poe&#x27;s work coincided with themes that readers of his day found appealing, though he often professed to abhor the tastes of the majority of the people who read for pleasure in his time. In his critical works, Poe investigated and wrote about many of the pseudosciences that were then popular with the majority of his fellow Americans. They included, but were not limited to, the fields of astrology, cosmology, phrenology, and physiognomy.

===Literary theory===
Poe&#x27;s writings often reflect the literary theories he introduced in his prolific critical works and expounded on in such essays as, &quot;The Poetic Principle&quot;. He disliked didacticism and imitation masquerading as influence, believing originality to be the highest mark of genius. In Poe&#x27;s conception of the artist&#x27;s life, the attainment of the concretization of beauty should be the ultimate goal. That which is unique is alone of value. Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art. He believed that any work worthy of being praised should have as its focus a single specific effect. That which does not tend towards the effect is extraneous. In his view, every serious writer must carefully calculate each sentiment and idea in his or her work to ensure that it strengthens the theme of the piece.

Poe describes the method he employed while composing his most famous poem, &quot;The Raven&quot;, in an essay entitled &quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot;. However, many of Poe&#x27;s critics have questioned whether the method enunciated in the essay was formulated before the poem was written, or afterward, or, as T. S. Eliot is quoted as saying, &quot;It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.&quot; Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as &quot;a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Influence===
During his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. The vast majority of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s writings are nonfictional. Contemporary critic James Russell Lowell called him, &quot;the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America,&quot; suggesting—rhetorically—that he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink. Poe&#x27;s often caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a &quot;tomahawk man&quot;. One target of Poe&#x27;s criticism was Boston&#x27;s acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was defended by his friends, literary and otherwise, in what was later called, &quot;The Longfellow War&quot;. Poe accused Longfellow of &quot;the heresy of the didactic&quot;, writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized. Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow&#x27;s reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, &quot;We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future&quot;.

Poe became known as the creator of a type of fiction that was difficult to categorize and nearly impossible to imitate. He was one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe was particularly esteemed in France, in part due to early translations of his work by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire&#x27;s translations became definitive renditions of Poe&#x27;s work in Continental Europe.

Poe&#x27;s early mystery tales featuring the detective, C. Auguste Dupin, though not numerous, laid the groundwork for similar characters that would eventually become famous throughout the world. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, &quot;Each [of Poe&#x27;s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?&quot; The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the mystery genre &quot;The Edgars&quot;. Poe&#x27;s work also influenced writings that would eventually come to be called &quot;science fiction&quot;, notably the works of Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; called &quot;An Antarctic Mystery&quot;, also known as &quot;The Sphinx of the Ice Fields&quot;. And as the author H. G. Wells noted, &quot;&quot;Pym&quot; tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago&quot;. In 2013, &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited &quot;Pym&quot; as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, Henry James, B. Traven, and David Morrell.

Horror author and historian H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by Poe&#x27;s horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;, to his influence on the genre. In his letters, Lovecraft described Poe as his &quot;God of Fiction&quot;. Lovecraft&#x27;s earliest stories are clearly influenced by Poe. &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; directly quotes him. Lovecraft made extensive use of Poe&#x27;s concept of the &quot;unity of effect&quot; in his fiction. Alfred Hitchcock once said, &quot;It&#x27;s because I liked Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s stories so much that I began to make suspense films&quot;. Many references to Poe&#x27;s works are present in Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novels. The Japanese author Tarō Hirai derived his pen name, Edogawa Ranpo, from an altered phonetic rendering of Poe&#x27;s name.

Poe&#x27;s works have spawned many imitators. In 1863, a medium named Lizzie Doten published &quot;Poems of the Inner Life&quot;, which compiled several poems she claimed were written by the channeled spirits of dead authors. She claimed six were by Poe, though Poe scholar Christopher P. Semtner dismisses them as &quot;merely pastiches&quot;.

Poe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation. William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him &quot;vulgar&quot;. Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to &quot;The Raven&quot; by saying, &quot;I see nothing in it&quot;, and derisively referred to Poe as &quot;the jingle man&quot;. Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe&#x27;s writing &quot;falls into vulgarity&quot; by being &quot;too poetical&quot;—the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger.

It is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe&#x27;s first book &quot;Tamerlane and Other Poems&quot;. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie&#x27;s auctioneers in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.

===Physics and cosmology===
&quot;&quot;, an essay written in 1848, included a cosmological theory that presaged the Big Bang theory by 80 years, as well as the first plausible solution to Olbers&#x27; paradox.
Poe eschewed the scientific method in &quot;Eureka&quot; and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. Even so, &quot;Eureka&quot; is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe&#x27;s suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.

===Cryptography===
Poe had a keen interest in cryptography. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Weekly (Express) Messenger&quot;, inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve. In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called &quot;A Few Words on Secret Writing&quot; in &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; incorporating ciphers as an essential part of the story. Poe&#x27;s success with cryptography relied not so much on his deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution cryptogram) as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage. The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.

Two ciphers he published in 1841 under the name &quot;W. B. Tyler&quot; were not solved until 1992 and 2000 respectively. One was a quote from Joseph Addison&#x27;s play &quot;Cato&quot;; the other is probably based on a poem by Hester Thrale.

Poe had an influence on cryptography beyond increasing public interest during his lifetime. William Friedman, America&#x27;s foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by Poe. Friedman&#x27;s initial interest in cryptography came from reading &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; as a child, an interest that he later put to use in deciphering Japan&#x27;s PURPLE code during World War II.

==Commemorations and namesake==
Poe&#x27;s image and namesake has often been used in a number of different capacities including literature, historic places, artistic works, books, film and commemorations.

===Character===
The historical Edgar Allan Poe has appeared as a fictionalized character, often in order to represent the &quot;mad genius&quot; or &quot;tormented artist&quot; and in order to exploit his personal struggles. Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting that Poe and his characters share identities. Often, fictional depictions of Poe use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as &quot;The Poe Shadow&quot; by Matthew Pearl.

===Preserved homes, landmarks, and museums===
No childhood home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family&#x27;s Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used during his time with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm room that Poe is believed to have used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society.

The earliest surviving home in which Poe lived is at 203 North Amity St. in Baltimore, which is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum. Poe is believed to have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia and possibly his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe.

Between 1834 and 1844, Poe lived in at least four different Philadelphia residences, including the Indian Queen Hotel at 15 S. 4th Street, at a residence at 16th and Locust Streets, at 2502 Fairmount Street, and then in the Spring Garden section of the city at 532 N. 7th Street, a residence that has been preserved by the National Park Service as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site. Poe&#x27;s final home in Bronx, New York City, is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage.

In Boston, a commemorative plaque on Boylston Street is several blocks away from the actual location of Poe&#x27;s birth. The house which was his birthplace at 62 Carver Street no longer exists; also, the street has since been renamed &quot;Charles Street South&quot;. A &quot;square&quot; at the intersection of Broadway, Fayette, and Carver Streets had once been named in his honor, but it disappeared when the streets were rearranged. In 2009, the intersection of Charles and Boylston streets (two blocks north of his birthplace) was designated &quot;Edgar Allan Poe Square&quot;.

In March 2014, fundraising was completed for construction of a permanent memorial sculpture, known as &quot;Poe Returning to Boston&quot;, at this location. The winning design by Stefanie Rocknak depicts a life-sized Poe striding against the wind, accompanied by a flying raven; his suitcase lid has fallen open, leaving a &quot;paper trail&quot; of literary works embedded in the sidewalk behind him. The public unveiling on October 5, 2014, was attended by former U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky.

Other Poe landmarks include a building on the Upper West Side, where Poe temporarily lived when he first moved to New York City. A plaque suggests that Poe wrote &quot;The Raven&quot; here. On Sullivan&#x27;s Island in Charleston County, South Carolina, the setting of Poe&#x27;s tale &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; and where Poe served in the Army in 1827 at Fort Moultrie, there is a restaurant called Poe&#x27;s Tavern. In the Fell&#x27;s Point section of Baltimore, a bar still stands where legend says that Poe was last seen drinking before his death. Known as &quot;The Horse You Came in On&quot;, local lore insists that a ghost whom they call &quot;Edgar&quot; haunts the rooms above.

===Poe Toaster===

Between 1949 and 2009, a bottle of cognac and three roses were left at Poe&#x27;s original grave marker every January 19 by an unknown visitor affectionately referred to as the &quot;Poe Toaster&quot;. Sam Porpora was a historian at the Westminster Church in Baltimore, where Poe is buried; he claimed on August 15, 2007, that he had started the tradition in 1949. Porpora said that the tradition began in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church. His story has not been confirmed, and some details which he gave to the press are factually inaccurate. The Poe Toaster&#x27;s last appearance was on January 19, 2009, the day of Poe&#x27;s bicentennial.

<text>Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter possessing an electric charge. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.

The presence of either a positive or negative electric charge produces an electric field. The motion of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. In most applications, Coulomb&#x27;s law determines the force acting on an electric charge. Electric potential is the work done to move an electric charge from one point to another within an electric field, typically measured in volts.

Electricity plays a central role in many modern technologies, serving in electric power where electric current is used to energise equipment, and in electronics dealing with electrical circuits involving active components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.

The study of electrical phenomena dates back to antiquity, with theoretical understanding progressing slowly until the 17th and 18th centuries. The development of the theory of electromagnetism in the 19th century marked significant progress, leading to electricity&#x27;s industrial and residential application by electrical engineers by the century&#x27;s end. This rapid expansion in electrical technology at the time was the driving force behind the Second Industrial Revolution, with electricity&#x27;s versatility driving transformations in both industry and society. Electricity is integral to applications spanning transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation, making it the foundation of modern industrial society.

== History ==


Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE described them as the &quot;protectors&quot; of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.

Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat&#x27;s fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artefact was electrical in nature.
Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote &quot;De Magnete&quot;, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the Neo-Latin word &quot;electricus&quot; (&quot;of amber&quot; or &quot;like amber&quot;, from ἤλεκτρον, &quot;elektron&quot;, the Greek word for &quot;amber&quot;) to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words &quot;electric&quot; and &quot;electricity&quot;, which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne&#x27;s &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot; of 1646. Isaac Newton made early investigations into electricity, with an idea of his written down in his book &quot;Opticks&quot; arguably the beginning of the field theory of the electric force.

Further work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.

In 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish&#x27;s electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta&#x27;s battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot; in 1861 and 1862.

While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.

In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for &quot;his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect&quot;. The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.

The first solid-state device was the &quot;cat&#x27;s-whisker detector&quot; first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.

Solid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.

==Concepts==
===Electric charge===

By modern convention, the charge carried by electrons is defined as negative, and that by protons is positive. Before these particles were discovered, Benjamin Franklin had defined a positive charge as being the charge acquired by a glass rod when it is rubbed with a silk cloth. A proton by definition carries a charge of exactly . This value is also defined as the elementary charge. No object can have a charge smaller than the elementary charge, and any amount of charge an object may carry is a multiple of the elementary charge. An electron has an equal negative charge, i.e. . Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.

The presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended by a fine thread can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: &quot;like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract&quot;.

The force acts on the charged particles themselves, hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb&#x27;s law, which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them. The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances. In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force, the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together.

Charge originates from certain types of subatomic particles, the most familiar carriers of which are the electron and proton. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an electrically isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or &#x27;imbalance&#x27;) of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.

Charge can be measured by a number of means, an early instrument being the gold-leaf electroscope, which although still in use for classroom demonstrations, has been superseded by the electronic electrometer.

===Electric current===
The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.

By historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the &quot;opposite&quot; direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.

The process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.

Current causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by Nicholson and Carlisle in 1800, a process now known as electrolysis. Their work was greatly expanded upon by Michael Faraday in 1833. Current through a resistance causes localised heating, an effect James Prescott Joule studied mathematically in 1840. One of the most important discoveries relating to current was made accidentally by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820, when, while preparing a lecture, he witnessed the current in a wire disturbing the needle of a magnetic compass. He had discovered electromagnetism, a fundamental interaction between electricity and magnetics. The level of electromagnetic emissions generated by electric arcing is high enough to produce electromagnetic interference, which can be detrimental to the workings of adjacent equipment.

In engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.

===Electric field===

The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.

An electric field generally varies in space, and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a &#x27;test charge&#x27;, must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, having both magnitude and direction, it follows that an electric field is a vector field.

The study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term &#x27;lines of force&#x27; still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, they may never cross nor close in on themselves.

A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface. The field is therefore 0 at all places inside the body. This is the operating principle of the Faraday cage, a conducting metal shell that isolates its interior from outside electrical effects.

The principles of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30 kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1 kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100 MV and have discharge energies as great as 250 kWh.

The field strength is greatly affected by nearby conducting objects, and it is particularly intense when it is forced to curve around sharply pointed objects. This principle is exploited in the lightning conductor, the sharp spike of which acts to encourage the lightning strike to develop there, rather than to the building it serves to protect.

===Electric potential===


The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. The electric field is &quot;conservative&quot;, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.

For practical purposes, defining a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared is useful. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.

Electric potential is a scalar quantity. That is, it has only magnitude and not direction. It may be viewed as analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will &#x27;fall&#x27; across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor&#x27;s surface, since otherwise there would be a force along the surface of the conductor that would move the charge carriers to even the potential across the surface.

The electric field was formally defined as the force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the electric field is the local gradient of the electric potential. Usually expressed in volts per metre, the vector direction of the field is the line of greatest slope of potential, and where the equipotentials lie closest together.

===Electromagnets===

Ørsted&#x27;s discovery in 1821 that a magnetic field existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it. Ørsted&#x27;s words were that &quot;the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner.&quot; The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too.

Ørsted did not fully understand his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.
This relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday&#x27;s invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday&#x27;s homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting in a pool of mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained.

Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday&#x27;s disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.

===Electric circuits===

An electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components such that electric charge is made to flow along a closed path (a circuit), usually to perform some useful task.

The components in an electric circuit can take many forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components are those that are termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.

The resistor is perhaps the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance is a consequence of the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm&#x27;s law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as &#x27;ohmic&#x27;. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1 Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.

The capacitor is a development of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol &quot;F&quot;: one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.

The inductor is a conductor, usually a coil of wire, that stores energy in a magnetic field in response to the current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor&#x27;s behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current but opposes a rapidly changing one.

===Electric power===

Electric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.

Electric power, like mechanical power, is the rate of doing work, measured in watts, and represented by the letter &quot;P&quot;. The term &quot;wattage&quot; is used colloquially to mean &quot;electric power in watts.&quot; The electric power in watts produced by an electric current &quot;I&quot; consisting of a charge of &quot;Q&quot; coulombs every &quot;t&quot; seconds passing through an electric potential (voltage) difference of &quot;V&quot; is
:formula_1
where
:&quot;Q&quot; is electric charge in coulombs
:&quot;t&quot; is time in seconds
:&quot;I&quot; is electric current in amperes
:&quot;V&quot; is electric potential or voltage in volts

Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry. Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure power using electricity meters, which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency.

===Electronics===

Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes digital switching possible, and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.

Today, most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. The underlying principles that explain how semiconductors work are studied in solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems are part of electronics engineering.

===Electromagnetic wave===

Faraday&#x27;s and Ampère&#x27;s work showed that a time-varying magnetic field created an electric field, and a time-varying electric field created a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, a field of the other is always induced. These variations are an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that in a vacuum such a wave would travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.

The work of many researchers enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents and, via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances.

==Production, storage and uses==
===Generation and transmission===


In the 6th century BC the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods: these were the first studies into the production of electricity. While this method, now known as the triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electricity.

Electrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators. These can be driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion or the heat released from nuclear reactions, but also more directly from the kinetic energy of wind or flowing water. The steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 is still used to convert the thermal energy of steam into a rotary motion that can be used by electro-mechanical generators. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday&#x27;s homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. Electricity generated by solar panels rely on a different mechanism: solar radiation is converted directly into electricity using the photovoltaic effect.
Demand for electricity grows with great rapidity as a nation modernises and its economy develops. The United States showed a 12% increase in demand during each year of the first three decades of the twentieth century, a rate of growth that is now being experienced by emerging economies such as those of India or China.

Environmental concerns with electricity generation, in specific the contribution of fossil fuel burning to climate change, have led to an increased focus on generation from renewable sources. In the power sector, wind and solar have become cost effective, speeding up an energy transition away from fossil fuels.

=== Transmission and storage ===
The invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.

Normally, demand for electricity must match the supply, as storage of electricity is difficult. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses. With increasing levels of variable renewable energy (wind and solar energy) in the grid, it has become more challenging to match supply and demand. Storage plays an increasing role in bridging that gap. There are four types of energy storage technologies, each in varying states of technology readiness: batteries (electrochemical storage), chemical storage such as hydrogen, thermal or mechanical (such as pumped hydropower).

===Applications===
Electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy, and it has been adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.

The resistive Joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, it can be seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate. Electrification is expected to play a major role in the decarbonisation of sectors that rely on direct fossil fuel burning, such as transport (using electric vehicles) and heating (using heat pumps).

The effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph. Electrically powered vehicles are used in public transportation, such as electric buses and trains, and an increasing number of battery-powered electric cars in private ownership.

Electricity is used within telecommunications, and indeed the electrical telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first transcontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process.

Electronic devices make use of the transistor, perhaps one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain many billions of miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.

==Electricity and the natural world==
===Physiological effects===
A voltage applied to a human body causes an electric current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with the path of the current, but is about 0.1 mA to 1 mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock—electrocution—is still used for judicial execution in some US states, though its use had become very rare by the end of the 20th century.

===Electrical phenomena in nature===

Electricity is not a human invention, and may be observed in several forms in nature, notably lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is due to the natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet&#x27;s core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when pressed. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek &quot;piezein&quot; (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal: when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field it changes size slightly.

Some organisms, such as sharks, are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon; these are electric fish in different orders. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best-known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.

==Cultural perception==
It is said that in the 1850s, British politician William Ewart Gladstone asked the scientist Michael Faraday why electricity was valuable. Faraday answered, &quot;One day sir, you may tax it.&quot; However, according to Snopes.com &quot;the anecdote should be considered apocryphal because it isn&#x27;t mentioned in any accounts by Faraday or his contemporaries (letters, newspapers, or biographies) and only popped up well after Faraday&#x27;s death.&quot;

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world. The popular culture of the time accordingly often depicted it as a mysterious, quasi-magical force that can slay the living, revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature. This attitude began with the 1771 experiments of Luigi Galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity. &quot;Revitalization&quot; or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after Galvani&#x27;s work. These results were known to Mary Shelley when she authored &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films.

As public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the Second Industrial Revolution grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light, such as the workers who &quot;finger death at their gloves&#x27; end as they piece and repiece the living wires&quot; in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1907 poem &quot;Sons of Martha&quot;. Electrically powered vehicles of every sort featured large in adventure stories such as those of Jules Verne and the &quot;Tom Swift&quot; books. The masters of electricity, whether fictional or real—including scientists such as Thomas Edison, Charles Steinmetz or Nikola Tesla—were popularly conceived of as having wizard-like powers.

With electricity ceasing to be a novelty and becoming a necessity of everyday life in the later half of the 20th century, it acquired particular attention by popular culture only when it &quot;stops&quot; flowing, an event that usually signals disaster. The people who &quot;keep&quot; it flowing, such as the nameless hero of Jimmy Webb&#x27;s song &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot; (1968), are still often cast as heroic, wizard-like figures.

<doc id="9553" wikidata="Q83375" url="?curid=9553" title="Empedocles">
<text>Empedocles (; ; , 444–443 BC) was a Greek pre-Socratic philosopher and a native citizen of Akragas, a Greek city in Sicily. Empedocles&#x27; philosophy is known best for originating the cosmogonic theory of the four classical elements. He also proposed forces he called Love and Strife which would mix and separate the elements, respectively.

Empedocles challenged the practice of animal sacrifice and killing animals for food. He developed a distinctive doctrine of reincarnation. He is generally considered the last Greek philosopher to have recorded his ideas in verse. Some of his work survives, more than is the case for any other pre-Socratic philosopher. Empedocles&#x27; death was mythologized by ancient writers, and has been the subject of a number of literary treatments.

==Life==
The exact dates of Empedocles&#x27; birth and death are unknown, and ancient accounts of his life conflict on the exact details. However, they agree that he was born in the early 5th century BC in the Greek city of Akragas in Magna Graecia, present-day Sicily. Modern scholars believe the accuracy of the accounts that he came from a rich and noble family and that his grandfather, also named Empedocles, had won a victory in the horse race at Olympia in the 71st Olympiad (496–495 BC). Little else can be determined with accuracy.

Primary sources of information on the life of Empedocles come from the Hellenistic period, several centuries after his own death and long after any reliable evidence about his life would have perished. Modern scholarship generally believes that these biographical details, including Aristotle&#x27;s assertion that he was the &quot;father of rhetoric&quot;, his chronologically impossible tutelage under Pythagoras, and his employment as a doctor and miracle worker, were fabricated from interpretations of Empedocles&#x27; poetry, as was common practice for the biographies written during this time.

===Death and legacy===
According to Aristotle, Empedocles died at the age of 60 (), even though other writers have him living up to the age of 109. Likewise, there are myths concerning his death: a tradition, which is traced to Heraclides Ponticus, represented him as having been removed from the Earth; whereas others had him perishing in the flames of Mount Etna. Diogenes Laërtius records the legend that Empedocles died by throwing himself into Mount Etna in Sicily, so that the people would believe his body had vanished and he had turned into an immortal god; the volcano, however, threw back one of his bronze sandals, revealing the deceit. Another legend maintains that he threw himself into the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal; he believed he would come back as a god after being consumed by the fire. Lucretius speaks of him with enthusiasm, and evidently viewed him as his model. Horace also refers to the death of Empedocles in his work &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; and admits poets have the right to destroy themselves. In &quot;&quot;, a comedic dialogue written by the second-century satirist Lucian of Samosata, Empedocles&#x27; final fate is re-evaluated. Rather than being incinerated in the fires of Mount Etna, he was carried up into the heavens by a volcanic eruption. Although singed by the ordeal, Empedocles survives and continues his life on the Moon, surviving by feeding on dew.

Burnet states that Empedocles likely did not die in Sicily, that both the positive story of Empedocles being taken up to heaven and the negative one about him throwing himself into a volcano could be easily accepted by ancient writers, as there was no local tradition to contradict them.

Empedocles&#x27; death is the subject of Friedrich Hölderlin&#x27;s play &quot;Tod des Empedokles&quot; (&quot;The Death of Empedocles&quot;) as well as Matthew Arnold&#x27;s poem &quot;Empedocles on Etna&quot;.

==Philosophy==

Based on the surviving fragments of his work, modern scholars generally believe that Empedocles was directly responding to Parmenides&#x27; doctrine of monism and was likely acquainted with the work of Anaxagoras, although it is unlikely he was aware of either the later Eleatics or the doctrines of the Atomists. Many later accounts of his life claim that Empedocles studied with the Pythagoreans on the basis of his doctrine of reincarnation, although he may have instead learned this from a local tradition rather than directly from the Pythagoreans.

===Cosmogony===
Empedocles established four ultimate elements which make all the structures in the world—fire, air, water, earth. Empedocles called these four elements &quot;roots&quot;, which he also identified with the mythical names of Zeus, Hera, Nestis, and Aidoneus (e.g., &quot;Now hear the fourfold roots of everything: enlivening Hera, Hades, shining Zeus. And Nestis, moistening mortal springs with tears&quot;). Empedocles never used the term &quot;element&quot; (, &quot;stoicheion&quot;), which seems to have been first used by Plato. According to the different proportions in which these four indestructible and unchangeable elements are combined with each other the difference of the structure is produced. It is in the aggregation and segregation of elements thus arising, that Empedocles, like the atomists, found the real process which corresponds to what is popularly termed growth, increase or decrease. One interpreter describes his philosophy as asserting that &quot;Nothing new comes or can come into being; the only change that can occur is a change in the juxtaposition of element with element.&quot; This theory of the four elements became the standard dogma for the next two thousand years.

The four elements, however, are simple, eternal, and unalterable, and as change is the consequence of their mixture and separation, it was also necessary to suppose the existence of moving powers that bring about mixture and separation. The four elements are both eternally brought into union and parted from one another by two divine powers, Love and (&quot;Philotes&quot; and &quot;Neikos&quot;). Love () is responsible for the attraction of different forms of what we now call matter, and Strife () is the cause of their separation. If the four elements make up the universe, then Love and Strife explain their variation and harmony. Love and Strife are attractive and repulsive forces, respectively, which are plainly observable in human behavior, but also pervade the universe. The two forces wax and wane in their dominance, but neither force ever wholly escapes the imposition of the other.

As the best and original state, there was a time when the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and inertness in the form of a sphere. The elements existed together in their purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the extreme edges of the sphere. Since that time, strife gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by both Love and Strife. Empedocles assumed a cyclical universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere for the next period of the universe.

Empedocles attempted to explain the separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results—heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of double sex. But most of these products of natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts were found to be adapted to each other did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited each other as if this had been intended. Soon various influences reduced creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life.

===Psychology===
Like Pythagoras, Empedocles believed in the transmigration of the soul or metempsychosis, that souls can be reincarnated between humans, animals and even plants. According to him, all humans, or maybe only a selected few among them, were originally long-lived daimons who dwelt in a state of bliss until committing an unspecified crime, possibly bloodshed or perjury. As a consequence, they fell to Earth, where they would be forced to spend 30,000 cycles of metempsychosis through different bodies before being able to return to the sphere of divinity. One&#x27;s behavior during his lifetime would also determine his next incarnation. Wise people, who have learned the secret of life, are closer to the divine, while their souls similarly are closer to the freedom from the cycle of reincarnations, after which they are able to rest in happiness for eternity. This cycle of mortal incarnation seems to have been inspired by the god Apollo&#x27;s punishment as a servant to Admetus.

Empedocles was a vegetarian and advocated vegetarianism, since the bodies of animals are also dwelling places of punished souls. For Empedocles, all living things were on the same spiritual plane; plants and animals are links in a chain where humans are a link too.

Empedocles is credited with the first comprehensive theory of light and vision. Historian Will Durant noted that &quot;Empedocles suggested that light takes time to pass from one point to another.&quot; He put forward the idea that we see objects because light streams out of our eyes and touches them. While flawed, this became the fundamental basis on which later Greek philosophers and mathematicians like Euclid would construct some of the most important theories of light, vision, and optics.

Knowledge is explained by the principle that elements in the things outside us are perceived by the corresponding elements in ourselves. Like is known by like. The whole body is full of pores and hence respiration takes place over the whole frame. In the organs of sense these pores are specially adapted to receive the effluences which are continually rising from bodies around us; thus perception occurs. In vision, certain particles go forth from the eye to meet similar particles given forth from the object, and the resultant contact constitutes vision. Perception is not merely a passive reflection of external objects.

Empedocles also attempted to explain the phenomenon of respiration by means of an elaborate analogy with the clepsydra, an ancient device for conveying liquids from one vessel to another. This fragment has sometimes been connected to a passage in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; where Aristotle refers to people who twisted wineskins and captured air in clepsydras to demonstrate that void does not exist. The fragment certainly implies that Empedocles knew about the corporeality of air, but he says nothing whatever about the void, and there is no evidence that Empedocles performed any experiment with clepsydras.

==Writings==

According to Diogenes Laertius, Empedocles wrote two poems, &quot;On Nature&quot; and &quot;On Purifications&quot;, which together comprised 5000 lines. However, only some 550 lines of his poetry survive, quoted in fragments by later ancient sources.

In old editions of Empedocles, about 450 lines were ascribed to &quot;On Nature&quot; which outlined his philosophical system, and explains not only the nature and history of the universe, including his theory of the four classical elements, but also theories on causation, perception, and thought, as well as explanations of terrestrial phenomena and biological processes. The other 100 lines were typically ascribed to his &quot;Purifications&quot;, which was taken to be a poem about ritual purification, or the poem that contained all his religious and ethical thought, which early editors supposed that it was a poem that offered a mythical account of the world which may, nevertheless, have been part of Empedocles&#x27; philosophical system.

A late 20th century discovery has changed this situation. The Strasbourg papyrus contains a large section of &quot;On Nature&quot;, including many lines formerly attributed to &quot;On Purifications&quot;. This has raised considerable debate about whether the surviving fragments of his teaching should be attributed to two separate poems, with different subject matter; whether they may all derive from one poem with two titles; or whether one title refers to part of the whole poem.

<text>The Ericaceae () are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the heath or heather family, found most commonly in acidic and infertile growing conditions. The family is large, with about 4,250 known species spread across 124 genera, making it the 14th most species-rich family of flowering plants. The many well known and economically important members of the Ericaceae include the cranberry, blueberry, huckleberry, rhododendron (including azaleas), and various common heaths and heathers (&quot;Erica&quot;, &quot;Cassiope&quot;, &quot;Daboecia&quot;, and &quot;Calluna&quot; for example).

==Description==
The Ericaceae contain a morphologically diverse range of taxa, including herbs, dwarf shrubs, shrubs, and trees. Their leaves are usually evergreen, alternate or whorled, simple and without stipules. Their flowers are hermaphrodite and show considerable variability. The petals are often fused (sympetalous) with shapes ranging from narrowly tubular to funnelform or widely urn-shaped. The corollas are usually radially symmetrical (actinomorphic) and urn-shaped, but many flowers of the genus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; are somewhat bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic). Anthers open by pores.

== Taxonomy ==
Michel Adanson used the term Vaccinia to describe a similar family, but first used the term Ericaceae. The name comes from the type genus &quot;Erica&quot;, which appears to be derived from the Greek word (). The exact meaning is difficult to interpret, but some sources show it as meaning &#x27;heather&#x27;. The name may have been used informally to refer to the plants before Linnaean times, and simply been formalised when Linnaeus described &quot;Erica&quot; in 1753, and then again when Jussieu described the Ericaceae in 1789.

Historically, the Ericaceae included both subfamilies and tribes. In 1971, Stevens, who outlined the history from 1876 and in some instances 1839, recognised six subfamilies (Rhododendroideae, Ericoideae, Vaccinioideae, Pyroloideae, Monotropoideae, and Wittsteinioideae), and further subdivided four of the subfamilies into tribes, the Rhododendroideae having seven tribes (Bejarieae, Rhodoreae, Cladothamneae, Epigaeae, Phyllodoceae, and Diplarcheae). Within tribe Rhodoreae, five genera were described, &quot;Rhododendron&quot; L. (including &quot;Azalea&quot; L. pro parte), &quot;Therorhodion&quot; Small, &quot;Ledum&quot; L., &quot;Tsusiophyllum&quot; Max., &quot;Menziesia&quot; J. E. Smith, that were eventually transferred into &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, along with Diplarche from the monogeneric tribe Diplarcheae.

In 2002, systematic research resulted in the inclusion of the formerly recognised families Empetraceae, Epacridaceae, Monotropaceae, Prionotaceae, and Pyrolaceae into the Ericaceae based on a combination of molecular, morphological, anatomical, and embryological data, analysed within a phylogenetic framework. The move significantly increased the morphological and geographical range found within the group. One possible classification of the resulting family includes 9 subfamilies, 126 genera, and about 4,000 species:

*Enkianthoideae (one genus, 16 species)
*Pyroloideae (4 genera, 40 species)
*Monotropoideae (10 genera, 15 species)
*Arbutoideae (up to six genera, about 80 species)
*Cassiopoideae (one genus, 12 species)
*Ericoideae (19 genera, 1790 species)
*Harrimanelloideae (one species)
*Epacridoideae (=Styphelioideae ) (35 genera, 545 species)
*Vaccinioideae (50 genera, 1580 species)

=== Genera ===

== Distribution and ecology ==
The Ericaceae have a nearly worldwide distribution. They are absent from continental Antarctica, parts of the high Arctic, central Greenland, northern and central Australia, and much of the lowland tropics and neotropics.

The family is largely composed of plants that can tolerate acidic, infertile, shady conditions. Due to their tolerance of acidic conditions, this plant family is also typical of peat bogs and blanket bogs; examples include &quot;Rhododendron groenlandicum&quot; and species in the genus &quot;Kalmia&quot;. In eastern North America, members of this family often grow in association with an oak canopy, in a habitat known as an oak-heath forest. Plants in Ericaceae, especially species in &quot;Vaccinium&quot;, rely on buzz pollination for successful pollination to occur.

The majority of ornamental species from &quot;Rhododendron&quot; are native to East Asia, but most varieties cultivated today are hybrids. Most rhododendrons grown in the United States are cultivated in the Pacific Northwest. The United States is the top producer of both blueberries and cranberries, with the state of Maine growing the majority of lowbush blueberry. The wide distribution of genera within Ericaceae has led to situations in which distinct American and European plants share the same common name, e.g. blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium corymbosum&quot; in North America and &quot;V.&quot; &quot;myrtillus&quot; in Europe) and cranberry (&quot;V.&quot; &quot;macrocarpon&quot; in America and &quot;V.&quot; &quot;oxycoccos&quot; in Europe).

=== Mycorrhizal relationships ===
Like other stress-tolerant plants, many Ericaceae have mycorrhizal fungi to assist with extracting nutrients from infertile soils, as well as evergreen foliage to conserve absorbed nutrients. This trait is not found in the Clethraceae and Cyrillaceae, the two families most closely related to the Ericaceae. Most Ericaceae (excluding the Monotropoideae, and some Epacridoideae) form a distinctive accumulation of mycorrhizae, in which fungi grow in and around the roots and provide the plant with nutrients. The Pyroloideae are mixotrophic and gain sugars from the mycorrhizae, as well as nutrients.

The cultivation of blueberries, cranberries, and wintergreen for their fruit and oils relies especially on these unique relationships with fungi, as a healthy mycorrhizal network in the soil helps the plants to resist environmental stresses that might otherwise damage crop yield. Ericoid mycorrhizae are responsible for a high rate of uptake of nitrogen, which causes naturally low levels of free nitrogen in ericoid soils. These mycorrhizal fungi may also increase the tolerance of Ericaceae to heavy metals in soil, and may cause plants to grow faster by producing phytohormones.

=== Heathlands ===

In many parts of the world, a &quot;heath&quot; or &quot;heathland&quot; is an environment characterised by an open dwarf-shrub community found on low-quality acidic soils, generally dominated by plants in Ericaceae. Heathlands are a broadly anthropogenic habitat, requiring regular grazing or burning to prevent succession. Heaths are particularly abundantand constitute important cultural elementsin Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and other countries in Central and Western Europe. The most common examples of plants in Ericaceae which dominate heathlands are &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Erica cineria&quot;, &quot;Erica tetralix&quot;, and &quot;Vaccinium myrtillus.&quot;

In heathland, plants in Ericaceae serve as host plants to the butterfly &quot;Plebejus argus&quot;. Other insects, such as &quot;Saturnia pavonia&quot;, &quot;Myrmeleotettix maculatus&quot;, &quot;Metrioptera brachyptera&quot;, and &quot;Picromerus bidens&quot; are closely associated with heathland environments. Reptiles thrive in heaths due to an abundance of sunlight and prey, and birds hunt the insects and reptiles which are present.

Some evidence suggests eutrophic rainwater can convert ericoid heaths with species such as &quot;Erica tetralix&quot; to grasslands. Nitrogen is particularly suspect in this regard, and may be causing measurable changes to the distribution and abundance of some ericaceous species.

<text>An electrical network is an interconnection of electrical components (e.g., batteries, resistors, inductors, capacitors, switches, transistors) or a model of such an interconnection, consisting of electrical elements (e.g., voltage sources, current sources, resistances, inductances, capacitances). An electrical circuit is a network consisting of a closed loop, giving a return path for the current. Thus all circuits are networks, but not all networks are circuits (although networks without a closed loop are often imprecisely referred to as &quot;circuits&quot;).

A resistive network is a network containing only resistors and ideal current and voltage sources. Analysis of resistive networks is less complicated than analysis of networks containing capacitors and inductors. If the sources are constant (DC) sources, the result is a DC network. The effective resistance and current distribution properties of arbitrary resistor networks can be modeled in terms of their graph measures and geometrical properties.

A network that contains active electronic components is known as an &quot;electronic circuit&quot;. Such networks are generally nonlinear and require more complex design and analysis tools.

==Classification==

===By passivity===
An active network contains at least one voltage source or current source that can supply energy to the network indefinitely. A passive network does not contain an active source.

An active network contains one or more sources of electromotive force. Practical examples of such sources include a battery or a generator. Active elements can inject power to the circuit, provide power gain, and control the current flow within the circuit.

Passive networks do not contain any sources of electromotive force. They consist of passive elements like resistors and capacitors.

===By linearity===
Linear electrical networks, a special type consisting only of sources (voltage or current), linear lumped elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors), and linear distributed elements (transmission lines), have the property that signals are linearly superimposable. They are thus more easily analyzed, using powerful frequency domain methods such as Laplace transforms, to determine DC response, AC response, and transient response.

Passive networks are generally taken to be linear, but there are exceptions. For instance, an inductor with an iron core can be driven into saturation if driven with a large enough current. In this region, the behaviour of the inductor is very non-linear.

===By lumpiness===
Discrete passive components (resistors, capacitors and inductors) are called &quot;lumped elements&quot; because all of their, respectively, resistance, capacitance and inductance is assumed to be located (&quot;lumped&quot;) at one place. This design philosophy is called the lumped-element model and networks so designed are called &quot;lumped-element circuits&quot;. This is the conventional approach to circuit design. At high enough frequencies, or for long enough circuits (such as power transmission lines), the lumped assumption no longer holds because there is a significant fraction of a wavelength across the component dimensions. A new design model is needed for such cases called the distributed-element model. Networks designed to this model are called &quot;distributed-element circuits&quot;.

A distributed-element circuit that includes some lumped components is called a &quot;semi-lumped&quot; design. An example of a semi-lumped circuit is the combline filter.

==Classification of sources==
Sources can be classified as independent sources and dependent sources.

===Independent===
An ideal independent source maintains the same voltage or current regardless of the other elements present in the circuit. Its value is either constant (DC) or sinusoidal (AC). The strength of voltage or current is not changed by any variation in the connected network.

===Dependent===
Dependent sources depend upon a particular element of the circuit for delivering the power or voltage or current depending upon the type of source it is.

==Applying electrical laws==

A number of electrical laws apply to all linear resistive networks. These include:

* Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law: The sum of all currents entering a node is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node.

* Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law: The directed sum of the electrical potential differences around a loop must be zero.

* Ohm&#x27;s law: The voltage across a resistor is equal to the product of the resistance and the current flowing through it.

* Norton&#x27;s theorem: Any network of voltage or current sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source in parallel with a single resistor.

* Thévenin&#x27;s theorem: Any network of voltage or current sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to a single voltage source in series with a single resistor.

* Superposition theorem: In a linear network with several independent sources, the response in a particular branch when all the sources are acting simultaneously is equal to the linear sum of individual responses calculated by taking one independent source at a time.

Applying these laws results in a set of simultaneous equations that can be solved either algebraically or numerically. The laws can generally be extended to networks containing reactances. They cannot be used in networks that contain nonlinear or time-varying components.

==Design methods==

To design any electrical circuit, either analog or digital, electrical engineers need to be able to predict the voltages and currents at all places within the circuit. Simple linear circuits can be analyzed by hand using complex number theory. In more complex cases the circuit may be analyzed with specialized computer programs or estimation techniques such as the piecewise-linear model.

Circuit simulation software, such as HSPICE (an analog circuit simulator), and languages such as VHDL-AMS and verilog-AMS allow engineers to design circuits without the time, cost and risk of error involved in building circuit prototypes.

==Network simulation software==
More complex circuits can be analyzed numerically with software such as SPICE or GNUCAP, or symbolically using software such as SapWin.

===Linearization around operating point===
When faced with a new circuit, the software first tries to find a steady state solution, that is, one where all nodes conform to Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law &quot;and&quot; the voltages across and through each element of the circuit conform to the voltage/current equations governing that element.

Once the steady state solution is found, the &quot;operating points&quot; of each element in the circuit are known. For a small signal analysis, every non-linear element can be linearized around its operation point to obtain the small-signal estimate of the voltages and currents. This is an application of Ohm&#x27;s Law. The resulting linear circuit matrix can be solved with Gaussian elimination.

===Piecewise-linear approximation===
Software such as the PLECS interface to Simulink uses piecewise-linear approximation of the equations governing the elements of a circuit. The circuit is treated as a completely linear network of ideal diodes. Every time a diode switches from on to off or vice versa, the configuration of the linear network changes. Adding more detail to the approximation of equations increases the accuracy of the simulation, but also increases its running time.

<doc id="9566" wikidata="Q226183" url="?curid=9566" title="Empty set">
<text>In mathematics, the empty set or void set is the unique set having no elements; its size or cardinality (count of elements in a set) is zero. Some axiomatic set theories ensure that the empty set exists by including an axiom of empty set, while in other theories, its existence can be deduced. Many possible properties of sets are vacuously true for the empty set.

Any set other than the empty set is called &quot;non-empty&quot;.

In some textbooks and popularizations, the empty set is referred to as the &quot;null set&quot;. However, null set is a distinct notion within the context of measure theory, in which it describes a set of measure zero (which is not necessarily empty).

==Notation==
Common notations for the empty set include &quot;{ }&quot;, &quot;formula_1&quot;, and &quot;∅&quot;. The latter two symbols were introduced by the Bourbaki group (specifically André Weil) in 1939, inspired by the letter Ø () in the Danish and Norwegian alphabets. In the past, &quot;0&quot; (the numeral zero) was occasionally used as a symbol for the empty set, but this is now considered to be an improper use of notation.

The symbol ∅ is available at Unicode point . It can be coded in HTML as and as or as . It can be coded in LaTeX as . The symbol formula_1 is coded in LaTeX as .

When writing in languages such as Danish and Norwegian, where the empty set character may be confused with the alphabetic letter Ø (as when using the symbol in linguistics), the Unicode character U+29B0 REVERSED EMPTY SET ⦰ may be used instead.

== Properties ==
In standard axiomatic set theory, by the principle of extensionality, two sets are equal if they have the same elements (that is, neither of them has an element not in the other). As a result, there can be only one set with no elements, hence the usage of &quot;the empty set&quot; rather than &quot;an empty set&quot;.

The only subset of the empty set is the empty set itself; equivalently, the power set of the empty set is the set containing only the empty set. The number of elements of the empty set (i.e., its cardinality) is zero. The empty set is the only set with either of these properties.

For any set &quot;A&quot;:
* The empty set is a subset of &quot;A&quot;
* The union of &quot;A&quot; with the empty set is &quot;A&quot;
* The intersection of &quot;A&quot; with the empty set is the empty set
* The Cartesian product of &quot;A&quot; and the empty set is the empty set

For any property &quot;P&quot;:
* For every element of formula_3, the property &quot;P&quot; holds (vacuous truth).
* There is no element of formula_3 for which the property &quot;P&quot; holds.

Conversely, if for some property &quot;P&quot; and some set &quot;V&quot;, the following two statements hold:
* For every element of &quot;V&quot; the property &quot;P&quot; holds
* There is no element of &quot;V&quot; for which the property &quot;P&quot; holds
then formula_5

By the definition of subset, the empty set is a subset of any set &quot;A&quot;. That is, element &quot;x&quot; of formula_3 belongs to &quot;A&quot;. Indeed, if it were not true that every element of formula_3 is in &quot;A&quot;, then there would be at least one element of formula_3 that is not present in &quot;A&quot;. Since there are elements of formula_3 at all, there is no element of formula_3 that is not in &quot;A&quot;. Any statement that begins &quot;for every element of formula_3&quot; is not making any substantive claim; it is a vacuous truth. This is often paraphrased as &quot;everything is true of the elements of the empty set.&quot;

In the usual set-theoretic definition of natural numbers, zero is modelled by the empty set.

=== Operations on the empty set ===

When speaking of the sum of the elements of a finite set, one is inevitably led to the convention that the sum of the elements of the empty set (the empty sum) is zero. The reason for this is that zero is the identity element for addition. Similarly, the product of the elements of the empty set (the empty product) should be considered to be one, since one is the identity element for multiplication.

A derangement is a permutation of a set without fixed points. The empty set can be considered a derangement of itself, because it has only one permutation (formula_12), and it is vacuously true that no element (of the empty set) can be found that retains its original position.

==In other areas of mathematics==
=== Extended real numbers ===

Since the empty set has no member when it is considered as a subset of any ordered set, every member of that set will be an upper bound and lower bound for the empty set. For example, when considered as a subset of the real numbers, with its usual ordering, represented by the real number line, every real number is both an upper and lower bound for the empty set. When considered as a subset of the extended reals formed by adding two &quot;numbers&quot; or &quot;points&quot; to the real numbers (namely negative infinity, denoted formula_13 which is defined to be less than every other extended real number, and positive infinity, denoted formula_14 which is defined to be greater than every other extended real number), we have that: 
formula_15
and
formula_16

That is, the least upper bound (sup or supremum) of the empty set is negative infinity, while the greatest lower bound (inf or infimum) is positive infinity. By analogy with the above, in the domain of the extended reals, negative infinity is the identity element for the maximum and supremum operators, while positive infinity is the identity element for the minimum and infimum operators.

=== Topology ===
In any topological space &quot;X&quot;, the empty set is open by definition, as is &quot;X&quot;. Since the complement of an open set is closed and the empty set and &quot;X&quot; are complements of each other, the empty set is also closed, making it a clopen set. Moreover, the empty set is compact by the fact that every finite set is compact.

The closure of the empty set is empty. This is known as &quot;preservation of nullary unions.&quot;

=== Category theory ===
If formula_17 is a set, then there exists precisely one function formula_18 from formula_3 to formula_20 the empty function. As a result, the empty set is the unique initial object of the category of sets and functions.

The empty set can be turned into a topological space, called the empty space, in just one way: by defining the empty set to be open. This empty topological space is the unique initial object in the category of topological spaces with continuous maps. In fact, it is a strict initial object: only the empty set has a function to the empty set.

=== Set theory ===
In the von Neumann construction of the ordinals, 0 is defined as the empty set, and the successor of an ordinal is defined as formula_21. Thus, we have formula_22, formula_23, formula_24, and so on. The von Neumann construction, along with the axiom of infinity, which guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, can be used to construct the set of natural numbers, formula_25, such that the Peano axioms of arithmetic are satisfied.

==Questioned existence==
=== Historical issues ===
In the context of sets of real numbers, Cantor used formula_26 to denote &quot;formula_27 contains no single point&quot;. This formula_28 notation was utilized in definitions; for example, Cantor defined two sets as being disjoint if their intersection has an absence of points; however, it is debatable whether Cantor viewed formula_29 as an existent set on its own, or if Cantor merely used formula_28 as an emptiness predicate. Zermelo accepted formula_29 itself as a set, but considered it an &quot;improper set&quot;.

=== Axiomatic set theory ===
In Zermelo set theory, the existence of the empty set is assured by the axiom of empty set, and its uniqueness follows from the axiom of extensionality. However, the axiom of empty set can be shown redundant in at least two ways:
*Standard first-order logic implies, merely from the logical axioms, that exists, and in the language of set theory, that thing must be a set. Now the existence of the empty set follows easily from the axiom of separation.
*Even using free logic (which does not logically imply that something exists), there is already an axiom implying the existence of at least one set, namely the axiom of infinity.

=== Philosophical issues ===
While the empty set is a standard and widely accepted mathematical concept, it remains an ontological curiosity, whose meaning and usefulness are debated by philosophers and logicians.

The empty set is not the same thing as ; rather, it is a set with nothing it and a set is always . This issue can be overcome by viewing a set as a bag—an empty bag undoubtedly still exists. Darling (2004) explains that the empty set is not nothing, but rather &quot;the set of all triangles with four sides, the set of all numbers that are bigger than nine but smaller than eight, and the set of all opening moves in chess that involve a king.&quot;

The popular syllogism
:Nothing is better than eternal happiness; a ham sandwich is better than nothing; therefore, a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness
is often used to demonstrate the philosophical relation between the concept of nothing and the empty set. Darling writes that the contrast can be seen by rewriting the statements &quot;Nothing is better than eternal happiness&quot; and &quot;[A] ham sandwich is better than nothing&quot; in a mathematical tone. According to Darling, the former is equivalent to &quot;The set of all things that are better than eternal happiness is formula_3&quot; and the latter to &quot;The set {ham sandwich} is better than the set formula_3&quot;. The first compares elements of sets, while the second compares the sets themselves.

Jonathan Lowe argues that while the empty set
:was undoubtedly an important landmark in the history of mathematics, … we should not assume that its utility in calculation is dependent upon its actually denoting some object.

it is also the case that:
:&quot;All that we are ever informed about the empty set is that it (1) is a set, (2) has no members, and (3) is unique amongst sets in having no members. However, there are very many things that &#x27;have no members&#x27;, in the set-theoretical sense—namely, all non-sets. It is perfectly clear why these things have no members, for they are not sets. What is unclear is how there can be, uniquely amongst sets, a which has no members. We cannot conjure such an entity into existence by mere stipulation.&quot;

George Boolos argued that much of what has been heretofore obtained by set theory can just as easily be obtained by plural quantification over individuals, without sets as singular entities having other entities as members.

<doc id="9567" wikidata="Q238350" url="?curid=9567" title="Egoism">
<text>Egoism is a philosophy concerned with the role of the self, or , as the motivation and goal of one&#x27;s own action. Different theories of egoism encompass a range of disparate ideas and can generally be categorized into descriptive or normative forms. That is, they may be interested in either describing that people &quot;do&quot; act in self-interest or prescribing that they &quot;should&quot;. Other definitions of egoism may instead emphasise action according to one&#x27;s will rather than one&#x27;s self-interest, and furthermore posit that this is a truer sense of egoism.

The &quot;New Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states of egoism that it &quot;incorporates in itself certain basic truths: it is natural for man to love himself; he should moreover do so, since each one is ultimately responsible for himself; pleasure, the development of one&#x27;s potentialities, and the acquisition of power are normally desirable.&quot; The moral censure of self-interest is a common subject of critique in egoist philosophy, with such judgments being examined as means of control and the result of power relations. Egoism may also reject the idea that insight into one&#x27;s internal motivation can arrive extrinsically, such as from psychology or sociology, though, for example, this is not present in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.

== Overview ==

The term egoism is derived from the French , from the Latin (first person singular personal pronoun; &quot;I&quot;) with the French (&quot;-ism&quot;).

=== Descriptive theories ===
The descriptive variants of egoism are concerned with self-regard as a factual description of human motivation and, in its furthest application, that all human motivation stems from the desires and interest of the ego. In these theories, action which is self-regarding may be simply termed &quot;egoistic&quot;.

The position that people &quot;tend&quot; to act in their own self-interest is called default egoism, whereas psychological egoism is the position that &quot;all&quot; motivations are rooted in an ultimately self-serving psyche. That is, in its strong form, that even seemingly altruistic actions are only disguised as such and are always self-serving. Its weaker form instead holds that, even if altruistic motivation is possible, the willed action necessarily becomes egoistic in serving one&#x27;s own will. In contrast to this and philosophical egoism, biological egoism (also called evolutionary egoism) describes motivations rooted solely in reproductive self-interest (i.e. reproductive fitness). Furthermore, selfish gene theory holds that it is the self-interest of genetic information that conditions human behaviour.

=== Normative theories ===
Theories which hold egoism to be normative stipulate that the ego ought to promote its own interests above other values. Where this ought is held to be a pragmatic judgment it is termed rational egoism and where it is held to be a moral judgment it is termed ethical egoism. The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; states that &quot;ethical egoism might also apply to things other than acts, such as rules or character traits&quot; but that such variants are uncommon. Furthermore, conditional egoism is a consequentialist form of ethical egoism which holds that egoism is morally right if it leads to morally acceptable ends. John F. Welsh, in his work &quot;Max Stirner&#x27;s Dialectical Egoism: A New Interpretation&quot;, coins the term dialectical egoism to describe an interpretation of the egoist philosophy of Max Stirner as being fundamentally dialectical.

Normative egoism, as in the case of Stirner, need not reject that some modes of behavior are to be valued above others—such as Stirner&#x27;s affirmation that non-restriction and autonomy are to be most highly valued. Contrary theories, however, may just as easily favour egoistic domination of others.

== Theoreticians ==
=== Stirner ===
=== Nietzsche ===
The philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche has been linked to forms of both descriptive and normative egoism. Nietzsche, in attacking the widely held moral abhorrence for egoistic action, seeks to free higher human beings from their belief that this morality is good for them. He rejects Christian and Kantian ethics as merely the disguised egoism of slave morality.

In his &quot;On the Genealogy of Morals&quot;, Friedrich Nietzsche traces the origins of master–slave morality to fundamentally egoistic value judgments. In the aristocratic valuation, excellence and virtue come as a form of superiority over the common masses, which the priestly valuation, in &quot;ressentiment&quot; of power, seeks to invert—where the powerless and pitiable become the moral ideal. This upholding of unegoistic actions is therefore seen as stemming from a desire to reject the superiority or excellency of others. He holds that all normative systems which operate in the role often associated with morality favor the interests of some people, often, though not necessarily, at the expense of others.

Nevertheless, Nietzsche also states &quot;in the same book&quot; that there is no &#x27;doer&#x27; of any acts, be they selfish or not:
Jonas Monte of Brigham Young University argues that Nietzsche doubted if any &#x27;I&#x27; existed in the first place, which the former defined as &quot;a conscious Ego who commands mental states&quot;.
=== Other theoreticians ===
* Nikolai Gavrilovich Chernyshevskii, a Russian literary critic and philosopher of nihilism and rational egoism
* Aleister Crowley, who popularized the expression &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot;
* Arthur Desmond as Ragnar Redbeard (possibly, unproved)
* Thomas Hobbes, who is attributed as an early proponent of psychological egoism
* John Henry Mackay, a British-German egoist anarchist
* Bernard de Mandeville, whose materialism has been retroactively described as form of egoism
* Friedrich Nietzsche, whose concept of will to power has both descriptive and prescriptive interpretations
* Dmitry Ivanovich Pisarev, a Russian literary critic and philosopher of nihilism and rational egoism
* Ayn Rand, who supported an egoistic model of capitalist self-incentive and selfishness
* Max Stirner, whose views were described by John F. Welsh as &quot;dialectical egoism&quot;
* Benjamin Tucker, an American egoist anarchist
* James L. Walker, who independently formulated an egoist philosophy before himself discovering the work of Stirner

== Relation to altruism ==
In 1851, French philosopher Auguste Comte coined the term altruism (; , ) as an antonym for egoism. In this sense, altruism defined Comte&#x27;s position that all self-regard must be replaced with only the regard for others.

While Friedrich Nietzsche does not view altruism as a suitable antonym for egoism, Comte instead states that only two human motivations exist, egoistic and altruistic, and that the two cannot be mediated; that is, one must always predominate the other. For Comte, the total subordination of the self to altruism is a necessary condition to both social and personal benefit. Nietzsche, rather than rejecting the practice of altruism, warns that despite there being neither much altruism nor equality in the world, there is almost universal endorsement of their value and, notoriously, even by those who are its worst enemies in practice. Egoist philosophy commonly views the subordination of the self to altruism as either a form of domination that limits freedom, an unethical or irrational principle, or an extension of some egoistic root cause.

In evolutionary theory, biological altruism is the observed occurrence of an organism acting to the benefit of others at the cost of its own reproductive fitness. While biological egoism does grant that an organism may act to the benefit of others, it describes only such when in accordance with reproductive self-interest. Kin altruism and selfish gene theory are examples of this division. On biological altruism, the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; states: &quot;Contrary to what is often thought, an evolutionary approach to human behaviour does not imply that humans are likely to be motivated by self-interest alone. One strategy by which ‘selfish genes’ may increase their future representation is by causing humans to be &quot;non&quot;-selfish, in the psychological sense.&quot; This is a central topic within contemporary discourse of psychological egoism.

Philosophies of personal identity such as open individualism have implications for egoism and altruism. Daniel Kolak argues that closed individualism, the idea that one&#x27;s identity consists of a line stretching across time and that a future self exists, is incoherent. Kolak instead argues that personal identity is an illusion, and the &quot;self&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually exist, similar to the idea of anattā in Buddhist philosophy. Thus, it could be argued that egoism is incoherent, since there is no &quot;self&quot; in the first place. Similar arguments have been made by Derek Parfit in the book &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; with ideas such as the teletransportation paradox.

== Relation to nihilism ==
The history of egoist thought has often overlapped with that of nihilism. For example, Max Stirner&#x27;s rejection of absolutes and abstract concepts often places him among the first philosophical nihilists. The popular description of Stirner as a moral nihilist, however, may fail to encapsulate certain subtleties of his ethical thought. The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; states, &quot;Stirner is clearly committed to the non-nihilistic view that certain kinds of character and modes of behaviour (namely autonomous individuals and actions) are to be valued above all others. His conception of morality is, in this respect, a narrow one, and his rejection of the legitimacy of moral claims is not to be confused with a denial of the propriety of all normative or ethical judgement.&quot; Stirner&#x27;s nihilism may instead be understood as cosmic nihilism. Likewise, both normative and descriptive theories of egoism further developed under Russian nihilism, shortly giving birth to rational egoism. Nihilist philosophers Dmitry Pisarev and Nikolay Chernyshevsky were influential in this regard, compounding such forms of egoism with hard determinism.

Max Stirner&#x27;s philosophy strongly rejects modernity and is highly critical of the increasing dogmatism and oppressive social institutions that embody it. In order that it might be surpassed, egoist principles are upheld as a necessary advancement beyond the modern world. The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia&quot; states that Stirner&#x27;s historical analyses serve to &quot;undermine historical narratives which portray the modern development of humankind as the progressive realisation of freedom, but also to support an account of individuals in the modern world as increasingly oppressed&quot;. This critique of humanist discourses especially has linked Stirner to more contemporary poststructuralist thought.

== Political egoism ==
Since normative egoism rejects the moral obligation to subordinate the ego to society-at-large or to a ruling class, it may be predisposed to certain political implications. The &quot;Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; states:
In contrast with this however, such an ethic may not morally obligate against the egoistic exercise of power over others. On these grounds, Friedrich Nietzsche criticizes egalitarian morality and political projects as unconducive to the development of human excellence. Max Stirner&#x27;s own conception, the union of egoists as detailed in his work &quot;The Ego and Its Own&quot;, saw a proposed form of societal relations whereby limitations on egoistic action are rejected. When posthumously adopted by the anarchist movement, this became the foundation for egoist anarchism.

Stirner&#x27;s variant of property theory is similarly dialectical, where the concept of ownership is only that personal distinction made between what is one&#x27;s property and what is not. Consequentially, it is the exercise of control over property which constitutes the nonabstract possession of it. In contrast to this, Ayn Rand incorporates capitalist property rights into her egoist theory.

=== Revolutionary politics ===
Egoist philosopher Nikolai Gavrilovich Chernyshevskii was the dominant intellectual figure behind the 1860–1917 revolutionary movement in Russia, which resulted in the assassination of Tsar Alexander II eight years before his death in 1889. Dmitry Pisarev was a similarly radical influence within the movement, though he did not personally advocate political revolution.

Philosophical egoism has also found wide appeal among anarchist revolutionaries and thinkers, such as John Henry Mackay, Benjamin Tucker, Émile Armand, Han Ryner Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers, Renzo Novatore, Miguel Giménez Igualada, and Lev Chernyi. Though he did not involve in any revolutionary movements himself, the entire school of individualist anarchism owes much of its intellectual heritage to Max Stirner.

Egoist philosophy may be misrepresented as a principally revolutionary field of thought. However, neither Hobbesian nor Nietzschean theories of egoism approve of political revolution. Anarchism and revolutionary socialism were also strongly rejected by Ayn Rand and her followers.

=== Fascism ===
The philosophies of both Nietzsche and Stirner were heavily appropriated (or possibly expropriated) by fascist and proto-fascist ideologies. Nietzsche in particular has infamously been represented as a predecessor to Nazism and a substantial academic effort was necessary to disassociate his ideas from their aforementioned appropriation.

<doc id="9569" wikidata="Q1340800" url="?curid=9569" title="Endomorphism">
<text>In mathematics, an endomorphism is a morphism from a mathematical object to itself. An endomorphism that is also an isomorphism is an automorphism. For example, an endomorphism of a vector space is a linear map , and an endomorphism of a group is a group homomorphism . In general, we can talk about endomorphisms in any category. In the category of sets, endomorphisms are functions from a set &quot;S&quot; to itself.

In any category, the composition of any two endomorphisms of is again an endomorphism of . It follows that the set of all endomorphisms of forms a monoid, the full transformation monoid, and denoted (or to emphasize the category ).

==Automorphisms==

An invertible endomorphism of is called an automorphism. The set of all automorphisms is a subset of with a group structure, called the automorphism group of and denoted . In the following diagram, the arrows denote implication:
==Endomorphism rings==

Any two endomorphisms of an abelian group, , can be added together by the rule . Under this addition, and with multiplication being defined as function composition, the endomorphisms of an abelian group form a ring (the endomorphism ring). For example, the set of endomorphisms of formula_1 is the ring of all matrices with integer entries. The endomorphisms of a vector space or module also form a ring, as do the endomorphisms of any object in a preadditive category. The endomorphisms of a nonabelian group generate an algebraic structure known as a near-ring. Every ring with one is the endomorphism ring of its regular module, and so is a subring of an endomorphism ring of an abelian group; however there are rings that are not the endomorphism ring of any abelian group.

==Operator theory==
In any concrete category, especially for vector spaces, endomorphisms are maps from a set into itself, and may be interpreted as unary operators on that set, acting on the elements, and allowing the notion of element orbits to be defined, etc.

Depending on the additional structure defined for the category at hand (topology, metric, ...), such operators can have properties like continuity, boundedness, and so on. More details should be found in the article about operator theory.

==Endofunctions==
An endofunction is a function whose domain is equal to its codomain. A homomorphic endofunction is an endomorphism.

Let be an arbitrary set. Among endofunctions on one finds permutations of and constant functions associating to every in the same element in . Every permutation of has the codomain equal to its domain and is bijective and invertible. If has more than one element, a constant function on has an image that is a proper subset of its codomain, and thus is not bijective (and hence not invertible). The function associating to each natural number the floor of has its image equal to its codomain and is not invertible.

Finite endofunctions are equivalent to directed pseudoforests. For sets of size there are endofunctions on the set.

Particular examples of bijective endofunctions are the involutions; i.e., the functions coinciding with their inverses.

<text>Eric Hoffer (July 25, 1902 – May 21, 1983) was an American philosopher and social critic. A conservative moderate with an atypical working-class background, Hoffer authored ten books over his career and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in February 1983. His first book, &quot;The True Believer&quot; (1951), was widely recognized as a classic, receiving critical acclaim from both scholars and laymen, although Hoffer believed that &quot;The Ordeal of Change&quot; (1963) was his finest work. The Eric Hoffer Book Award is an international literary prize established in his honor. The University of California, Berkeley awards an annual literary prize named jointly for Hoffer.

==Early life==
Many elements of Hoffer&#x27;s early life are unverified, but in autobiographical statements, Hoffer claimed to have been born in 1902 in The Bronx, New York City, New York, to Knut and Elsa (Goebel) Hoffer. His parents were immigrants from Alsace, then part of Imperial Germany. By age five, Hoffer could already read in both English and his parents&#x27; native German. When he was five, his mother fell down the stairs with him in her arms. He later recalled, &quot;I lost my sight at the age of seven. Two years before, my mother and I fell down a flight of stairs. She did not recover and died in that second year after the fall. I lost my sight and, for a time, my memory.&quot; Hoffer spoke with a pronounced German accent all his life, and spoke the language fluently. He was raised by a live-in relative or servant, a German immigrant named Martha. His eyesight inexplicably returned when he was 15. Fearing he might lose it again, he seized on the opportunity to read as much as he could. His recovery proved permanent, but Hoffer never abandoned his reading habit.

Hoffer was a young man when he also lost his father. The cabinetmaker&#x27;s union paid for Knut Hoffer&#x27;s funeral and gave Hoffer about $300 insurance money. He took a bus to Los Angeles and spent the next 10 years wandering, as he remembered, “up and down the land, dodging hunger and grieving over the world.” Hoffer eventually landed on Skid Row, reading, occasionally writing, and working at odd jobs.

In 1931, he considered suicide by drinking a solution of oxalic acid, but he could not bring himself to do it. He left Skid Row and became a migrant worker, following the harvests in California. He acquired a library card where he worked, dividing his time &quot;between the books and the brothels.&quot; He also prospected for gold in the mountains. Snowed in for the winter, he read the &quot;Essays&quot; by Michel de Montaigne. Montaigne impressed Hoffer deeply, and Hoffer often made reference to him. He also developed a respect for America&#x27;s underclass, which he said was &quot;lumpy with talent.&quot;

==Career==
He wrote a novel, &quot;Four Years in Young Hank&#x27;s Life,&quot; and a novella, &quot;Chance and Mr. Kunze,&quot; both partly autobiographical. He also penned a long article based on his experiences in a federal work camp, &quot;Tramps and Pioneers.&quot; It was never published, but a truncated version appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; after he became well known.

Hoffer tried to enlist in the U.S. Army at age 40 during World War II, but he was rejected due to a hernia. Instead, he began work as a longshoreman on the docks of San Francisco in 1943. At the same time, he began to write seriously.

Hoffer left the docks in 1964, and shortly after became an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He later retired from public life in 1970. “I&#x27;m going to crawl back into my hole where I started,” he said. “I don&#x27;t want to be a public person or anybody&#x27;s spokesman... Any man can ride a train. Only a wise man knows when to get off.” In 1970, he endowed the Lili Fabilli and Eric Hoffer Laconic Essay Prize for students, faculty, and staff at the University of California, Berkeley.

Hoffer called himself an atheist but had sympathetic views of religion and described it as a positive force.

He died at his home in San Francisco in 1983 at the age of 80.

==Working-class roots==
Hoffer was influenced by his modest roots and working-class surroundings, seeing in it vast human potential. In a letter to Margaret Anderson in 1941, he wrote: &quot;My writing is done in railroad yards while waiting for a freight, in the fields while waiting for a truck, and at noon after lunch. Towns are too distracting.&quot; He once remarked, &quot;my writing grows out of my life just as a branch from a tree.&quot; When he was called an intellectual, he insisted that he simply was a longshoreman. Hoffer has been dubbed by some authors a &quot;longshoreman philosopher.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hoffer, who was an only child, never married. He fathered a child with Lili Fabilli Osborne, named Eric Osborne, who was born in 1955 and raised by Lili Osborne and her husband, Selden Osborne. Lili Fabilli Osborne had become acquainted with Hoffer through her husband, a fellow longshoreman and acquaintance of Hoffer&#x27;s. Despite this, Selden Osborne and Hoffer remained on good terms.

Hoffer referred to Eric Osborne as his son or godson. Lili Fabilli Osborne died in 2010 at the age of 93. Prior to her death, Osborne was the executor of Hoffer&#x27;s estate, and vigorously controlled the rights to his intellectual property.

In his 2012 book &quot;Eric Hoffer: The Longshoreman Philosopher,&quot; journalist Tom Bethell revealed doubts about Hoffer&#x27;s account of his early life. Although Hoffer claimed his parents were from Alsace-Lorraine, Hoffer himself spoke with a pronounced Bavarian accent. He claimed to have been born and raised in the Bronx but had no Bronx accent. His lover and executor Lili Fabilli stated that she always thought Hoffer was an immigrant. Her son, Eric Fabilli, said that Hoffer&#x27;s life might have been comparable to that of B. Traven and considered hiring a genealogist to investigate Hoffer&#x27;s early life, to which Hoffer reportedly replied, &quot;Are you &quot;sure&quot; you want to know?&quot; Pescadero land-owner Joe Gladstone, a family friend of the Fabillis who also knew Hoffer, said of Hoffer&#x27;s account of his early life: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe a word of it.&quot; To this day, no one ever has claimed to have known Hoffer in his youth, and no records apparently exist of his parents, nor indeed of Hoffer himself until he was about forty, when his name appeared in a census.

==Books and opinions==

===&quot;The True Believer&quot;===

Hoffer came to public attention with the 1951 publication of his first book, &quot;The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements&quot;, which consists of a preface and 125 sections, which are divided into 18 chapters. Hoffer analyzes the phenomenon of &quot;mass movements,&quot; a general term that he applies to revolutionary parties, nationalistic movements, and religious movements. He summarizes his thesis in §113: &quot;A movement is pioneered by men of words, materialized by fanatics and consolidated by men of actions.&quot;

Hoffer argues that fanatical and extremist cultural movements, whether religious, social, or national, arise when large numbers of frustrated people, believing their own individual lives to be worthless or spoiled, join a movement demanding radical change. But the real attraction for this population is an escape from the self, not a realization of individual hopes: &quot;A mass movement attracts and holds a following not because it can satisfy the desire for self-advancement, but because it can satisfy the passion for self-renunciation.&quot;

Hoffer consequently argues that the appeal of mass movements is interchangeable: in the Germany of the 1920s and the 1930s, for example, the Communists and National Socialists were ostensibly enemies, but sometimes enlisted each other&#x27;s members, since they competed for the same kind of marginalized, angry, frustrated people. For the &quot;true believer,&quot; Hoffer argues that particular beliefs are less important than escaping from the burden of the autonomous self.

Harvard historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. said of &quot;The True Believer&quot;: &quot;This brilliant and original inquiry into the nature of mass movements is a genuine contribution to our social thought.&quot;

===Later works===
Subsequent to the publication of &quot;The True Believer&quot; (1951), Eric Hoffer touched upon Asia and American interventionism in several of his essays. In &quot;The Awakening of Asia&quot; (1954), published in &quot;The Reporter&quot; and later his book &quot;The Ordeal of Change&quot; (1963), Hoffer discusses the reasons for unrest on the continent. In particular, he argues that the root cause of social discontent in Asia was not government corruption, &quot;communist agitation,&quot; or the legacy of European colonial &quot;oppression and exploitation,&quot; but rather that a &quot;craving for pride&quot; was the central problem in Asia, suggesting a problem that could not be relieved through typical American intervention.

During the Vietnam War, despite his objections to the antiwar movement and acceptance of the notion that the war was somehow necessary to prevent a third world war, Hoffer remained skeptical concerning American interventionism, specifically the intelligence with which the war was being conducted in Southeast Asia. After the United States became more involved in the war, Hoffer wished to avoid defeat in Vietnam because of his fear that such a defeat would transform American society for ill, opening the door to those who would preach a stab-in-the-back myth and allow for the rise of an American version of Hitler.

In &quot;The Temper of Our Time&quot; (1967), Hoffer implies that the United States as a rule should avoid interventions in the first place: &quot;the better part of statesmanship might be to know clearly and precisely what not to do, and leave action to the improvisation of chance.&quot; In fact, Hoffer indicates that &quot;it might be wise to wait for enemies to defeat themselves,&quot; as they might fall upon each other with the United States out of the picture. The view was somewhat borne out with the Cambodian-Vietnamese War and Chinese-Vietnamese War of the late 1970s.

==Papers==
Hoffer&#x27;s papers, including 131 of the notebooks he carried in his pockets, were acquired in 2000 by the Hoover Institution Archives. The papers fill of shelf space. Because Hoffer cultivated an aphoristic style, the unpublished notebooks (dated from 1949 to 1977) contain very significant work. Although available for scholarly study since at least 2003, little of their contents has been published. A selection of fifty aphorisms, focusing on the development of unrealized human talents through the creative process, appeared in the July 2005 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

<doc id="9577" wikidata="Q161549" url="?curid=9577" title="European Coal and Steel Community">
<text>The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was a European organization created after World War II to integrate Europe&#x27;s coal and steel industries into a single common market based on the principle of supranationalism which would be governed by the creation of a High Authority which would be made up of appointed representatives from the member states who would not represent their national interest, but would take and make decisions in the general interests of the Community as a whole. It was formally established in 1951 by the Treaty of Paris, signed by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany and was generally seen as the first step in the process of European integration following the end of the Second World War in Europe. The organization&#x27;s subsequent enlargement of both members and duties ultimately led to the creation of the European Union. However, it was forced into action in 1952.

The ECSC was first proposed via the Schuman Declaration by French foreign minister Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950 (commemorated in the EU as Europe Day), the day after the fifth anniversary of the end of World War II, to prevent another war between France and Germany. He declared &quot;the solidarity in production&quot; from pooling &quot;coal and steel production&quot; would make war between the two &quot;not only unthinkable but materially impossible&quot;. The Treaty created a common market among member states that stipulated free movement of goods (without customs duties or taxes) and prohibited states from introducing unfair competitive or discriminatory practices.

Its terms were enforced by four institutions: a High Authority composed of independent appointees, a Common Assembly composed of national parliamentarians, a Special Council composed of national ministers, and a Court of Justice. These would ultimately form the blueprint for today&#x27;s European Commission, European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the Court of Justice of the European Union, respectively.

The ECSC set an example for the pan-European organizations created by the Treaty of Rome in 1957: the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community, with whom it shared its membership and some institutions. The 1967 Merger (Brussels) Treaty merged the ECSC&#x27;s institutions into the European Economic Community, but the former retained its own independent legal personality until the Treaty of Paris expired in 2002, leaving its activities fully absorbed by the European Community under the frameworks of the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice.

==History==

As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was instrumental in turning French policy away from the Gaullist objective of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar. Despite stiff ultra-nationalist, Gaullist and communist opposition, the French Assembly voted a number of resolutions in favour of his new policy of integrating Germany 9 a community. The International Authority for the Ruhr changed in consequence.
===Schuman declaration===

The Schuman Declaration had the stated aim of preventing further antagonism between France and Germany
and among other European states by tackling the root cause of war through the establishment of common foundations for economic development. Schuman proposed the formation of the ECSC primarily with France and Germany in mind: &quot;The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries.&quot; Portraying the coal and steel industries as integral to the production of munitions,
Schuman proposed that uniting these two industries across France and Germany under an innovative supranational system (that also included a European anti-cartel agency) would &quot;make war between France and Germany [...] not only unthinkable but materially impossible&quot;.

===Negotiations===
Following the Schuman Declaration in May 1950, negotiations on what became the Treaty of Paris (1951) began on 20 June 1950. The objective of the treaty was to create a single market in the coal and steel industries of the member states. Customs duties, subsidies, discriminatory and restrictive practices were all to be abolished. The single market was to be supervised by a High Authority, with powers to handle extreme shortages of supply or demand, to tax, and to prepare production forecasts as guidelines for investment.

A key issue in the negotiations for the treaty was the break-up of the excessive concentrations in the coal and steel industries of the Ruhr, where the &quot;Konzerne&quot;, or trusts, had underlain the military power of the former Reich. The Germans regarded the concentration of coal and steel as one of the bases of their economic efficiency, and a right. The steel barons were a formidable lobby because they embodied a national tradition.

The US was not officially part of the treaty negotiations, but it was a major force behind the scenes. The US High Commissioner for Occupied Germany, John McCloy, was an advocate of decartelization and his chief advisor in Germany was a Harvard anti-trust lawyer, Robert Bowie. Bowie was asked to draft anti-trust articles, and texts of the two articles he prepared (on cartels and the abuse of monopoly power) became the basis of the treaty&#x27;s competition policy regime. Also, Raymond Vernon (of later fame for his studies on industrial policy at Harvard university) was passing every clause of successive drafts of the treaty under his microscope down in the bowels of the State Department. He stressed the importance of the freedom of the projected common market from restrictive practices.

The Americans insisted that the German coal sales monopoly, the &quot;Deutscher Kohlenverkauf&quot; (&quot;DKV&quot;), should lose its monopoly, and that the steel industries should no longer own the coalmines. It was agreed that the &quot;DKV&quot; would be broken up into four independent sales agencies. The steel firm &quot;Vereinigte Stahlwerke&quot; was to be divided into thirteen firms, and Krupp into two. Ten years after the Schuman negotiations, a US State Department official noted that while the articles as finally agreed were more qualified than American officials in touch with the negotiations would have wished, they were &quot;almost revolutionary&quot; in terms of the traditional European approach to these basic industries.

===Political pressures and treaty ratification===
In West Germany, Karl Arnold, the Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia, the state that included the coal and steel producing Ruhr, was initially spokesman for German foreign affairs. He gave a number of speeches and broadcasts on a supranational coal and steel community at the same time as Robert Schuman began to propose this Community in 1948 and 1949. The Social Democratic Party of Germany (, SPD), in spite of support from unions and other socialists in Europe, decided it would oppose the Schuman plan. Kurt Schumacher&#x27;s personal distrust of France, capitalism, and Konrad Adenauer aside, he claimed that a focus on integrating with a &quot;Little Europe of the Six&quot; would override the SPD&#x27;s prime objective of German reunification and thus empower ultra-nationalist and Communist movements in democratic countries. He also thought the ECSC would end any hopes of nationalising the steel industry and lock in a Europe of &quot;cartels, clerics and conservatives&quot;. Younger members of the party like Carlo Schmid, were, however, in favor of the Community and pointed to the long socialist support for the supranational idea.

In France, Schuman had gained strong political and intellectual support from all sections of the nation and many non-communist parties. Notable amongst these were ministerial colleague Andre Philip, president of the Foreign Relations Committee Edouard Bonnefous, and former prime minister, Paul Reynaud. Projects for a coal and steel authority and other supranational communities were formulated in specialist subcommittees of the Council of Europe in the period before it became French government policy. Charles de Gaulle, who was then out of power, had been an early supporter of &quot;linkages&quot; between economies, on French terms, and had spoken in 1945 of a &quot;European confederation&quot; that would exploit the resources of the Ruhr. However, he opposed the ECSC as a &quot;faux&quot; (false) pooling (&quot;le pool, ce faux semblant&quot;) because he considered it an unsatisfactory &quot;piecemeal approach&quot; to European unity and because he considered the French government &quot;too weak&quot; to dominate the ECSC as he thought proper. De Gaulle also felt that the ECSC had an insufficient supranational mandate because its Assembly was not ratified by a European referendum and he did not accept Raymond Aron&#x27;s contention that the ECSC was intended as a movement away from United States domination. Consequently, de Gaulle and his followers in the RPF voted against ratification in the lower house of the French Parliament.

Despite these attacks and those from the extreme left, the ECSC found substantial public support. It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European public opinion. In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman&#x27;s first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.

The UK Prime Minister Clement Attlee opposed Britain joining the proposed European Coal and Steel Community, saying that he &#x27;would not accept the [UK] economy being handed over to an authority that is utterly undemocratic and is responsible to nobody.&#x27;

===Treaty===
The 100-article Treaty of Paris, which established the ECSC, was signed on 18 April 1951 by &quot;the inner six&quot;: France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The ECSC was based on supranational principles and was, through the establishment of a common market for coal and steel, intended to expand the economy, increase employment, and raise the standard of living within the Community. The market was also intended to progressively rationalise the distribution of production whilst ensuring stability and employment. The common market for coal was opened on 10 February 1953, and for steel on 1 May 1953. Upon taking effect, the ECSC replaced the International Authority for the Ruhr.

On 11 August 1952, the United States was the first non-ECSC member to recognise the Community and stated it would now deal with the ECSC on coal and steel matters, establishing its delegation in Brussels. Monnet responded by choosing Washington, D.C., as the site of the ECSC&#x27;s first external presence. The headline of the delegation&#x27;s first bulletin read &quot;Towards a Federal Government of Europe&quot;.

Six years after the Treaty of Paris, the Treaties of Rome were signed by the six ECSC members, creating the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom). These Communities were based, with some adjustments, on the ECSC. The Treaties of Rome were to be in force indefinitely, unlike the Treaty of Paris, which was to last for a renewable period of fifty years. These two new Communities worked on the creation of a customs union and nuclear power community respectively.

===Merger Treaty and expiry===

Despite being separate legal entities, the ECSC, EEC and Euratom initially shared the Common Assembly and the European Court of Justice, although the Councils and the High Authority/Commissions remained separate. To avoid duplication, the Merger Treaty merged these separate bodies of the ECSC and Euratom with those of the EEC. The EEC later became one of the three pillars of the present day European Union.

The Treaty of Paris was frequently amended as the EC and EU evolved and expanded. With the treaty due to expire in 2002, debate began at the beginning of the 1990s on what to do with it. It was eventually decided that it should be left to expire. The areas covered by the ECSC&#x27;s treaty were transferred to the Treaty of Rome and the financial loose ends and the ECSC research fund were dealt with via a protocol of the Treaty of Nice. The treaty finally expired on 23 July 2002. That day, the ECSC flag was lowered for the final time outside the European Commission in Brussels and replaced with the EU flag.

==Institutions==

The institutions of the ECSC were the High Authority, the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice. A Consultative Committee was established alongside the High Authority, as a fifth institution representing producers, workers, consumers and dealers (article 18). These institutions were merged in 1967 with those of the European Community, except for the Consultative Committee, which continued to be independent until the expiration of the Treaty of Paris in 2002.

The Treaty stated that the location of the institutions would be decided by common accord of the members, yet the issue was hotly contested. As a temporary compromise, the institutions were provisionally located in the City of Luxembourg, while the Assembly was based in Strasbourg.

===High Authority===
The High Authority (the predecessor to the European Commission) was a nine-member executive body which governed the ECSC. The Authority consisted of nine members in office for a term of six years, appointed by the governments of the six signatories. Two were from each of France, Germany and Italy; and one from each of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. These members appointed a person among themselves to be President of the High Authority.

Despite being appointed by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to pledge not to represent their national interest, but rather took an oath to defend the general interests of the Community as a whole. Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office. To further ensure impartiality, one third of the membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).

The Authority had a broad area of competence to ensure the objectives of the treaty were met and that the common market functioned smoothly. The High Authority could issue three types of legal instruments: Decisions, which were entirely binding laws; Recommendations, which had binding aims but the methods were left to member states; and Opinions, which had no legal force.

Up to the merger in 1967, the authority had five Presidents followed by an interim President serving for the final days.

===Other institutions===
The Common Assembly (the forerunner to the European Parliament) was composed of 78 representatives: 18 from each of France, Germany, and Italy; 10 from Belgium and the Netherlands; and 4 from Luxembourg (article 21). It exercised supervisory powers over the executive High Authority (article 20). The Common Assembly representatives were to be national MPs delegated each year by their Parliaments to the Assembly or directly elected &quot;by universal suffrage&quot; (article 21), though in practice it was the former, as there was no requirement for elections until the Treaties of Rome and no actual election until 1979, as Rome required agreement in the council on the electoral system first. However, to emphasise that the chamber was not a traditional international organisation composed of representatives of national governments, the Treaty of Paris used the term &quot;representatives of the peoples&quot;. Some hoped the Community would use the institutions (Assembly, Court) of the Council of Europe, and The Treaty&#x27;s &quot;Protocol on Relations with the Council of Europe&quot; encouraged links between the two institutions&#x27; assemblies. The ECSC Assembly was intended as a democratic counter-weight and check to the High Authority, to advise but also to have power to sack the Authority (article 24). The first President (akin to a Speaker) was Paul-Henri Spaak.

The Special Council of Ministers (the forerunner to the Council of the European Union) was composed of representatives of national governments. The Presidency was held by each state for a period of three months, rotating between them in alphabetical order. One of its key aspects was the harmonisation of the work of the High Authority and that of national governments. The council was also required to issue opinions on certain areas of work of the High Authority. Issues relating only to coal and steel were in the exclusive domain of the High Authority, and in these areas the council (unlike the modern council) could only act as a scrutiny on the Authority. However, areas outside coal and steel required the consent of the council.

The Court of Justice was to ensure the observation of ECSC law along with the interpretation and application of the Treaty. The Court was composed of seven judges, appointed by common accord of the national governments for six years. There were no requirements that the judges had to be of a certain nationality, simply that they be qualified and that their independence be beyond doubt. The Court was assisted by two Advocates General.

The Consultative Committee (forerunner to the Economic and Social Committee) had between 30 and 51 members equally divided between producers, workers, consumers and dealers in the coal and steel sector (article 18). There were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Members were appointed for two years and were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Nomination of these members remained in the hands of the council. The High Authority was obliged to consult the committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC).

== Members ==
After the original six members, the ESCS expanded to all members of the European Economic Community (later renamed the European Community) and the European Union (15 countries in 2002 at the time of the expiry of the Treaty of Paris).

==Achievements and shortcomings==
===Major Goal: ending war between Member States===
Schuman described the goal as to &quot;make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible&quot; for signatory States. This is described in the treaty&#x27;s preamble. It commences quoting the French Government Proposal of Schuman:

&quot;World peace cannot be safeguarded without creative measures commensurate with the dangers which threaten it.&quot; Europe had been at the centre of world wars. For this the Community created the world&#x27;s first international anti-cartel agency. Treaty Chapters VI &quot;Ententes et Concentrations&quot; and VII on the Free Market describe joint action against cartels and trusts which were instrumental in world war arms races, and activities leading to the disruption of the free market.

The Six Founder Member States are now living in the longest period of peace in more than 2000 years of their histories.

===Economic===

The economic mission of the ECSC (article 2) was to &quot;contribute to economic expansion, the development of employment and the improvement of the standard of living in participating countries&quot;. Writing in &quot;Le Monde&quot; in 1970, Gilbert Mathieu argued the Community had little effect on coal and steel &quot;production&quot;, which was influenced more by global trends. From 1952, oil, gas, and electricity became competitors to coal, so the 28% reduction in the amount of coal mined in the Six had little connection with the Treaty of Paris. However, the Treaty caused costs to be reduced by the abolition of discriminatory railway tariffs, and this promoted trade between members: steel trade increased tenfold. The High Authority also issued 280 modernization loans which helped the industry to improve output and reduce costs.

Mathieu claims the ECSC failed to achieve several fundamental aims of the Treaty of Paris. He argues that the &quot;pool&quot; did not prevent the resurgence of large coal and steel groups, such as the &quot;Konzerne&quot;, which helped Adolf Hitler build his war machine. The cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing. Furthermore, the Community failed to define a common energy policy. Mathieu also argues the ECSC fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the industry. These failures could be put down to overambition in a short period of time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored.

The ECSC&#x27;s greatest achievements relate to welfare issues, according to Mathieu. Some miners had extremely poor housing and over 15 years the ECSC financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers to buy a home they could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who had lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150 million (835 million francs) creating around 100,000 jobs, a third of which were offered to unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were copied and extended by several of the Six to workers outside the coal and steel sectors.

Far more important than creating Europe&#x27;s first social and regional policy, Robert Schuman argued that the ECSC introduced European peace. It involved the continent&#x27;s first European tax. This was a flat tax, a levy on production with a maximum rate of one percent. Given that the European Community countries are now experiencing the longest period of peace in more than seventy years, this has been described as the cheapest tax for peace in history. Another world war, or &quot;world suicide&quot; as Schuman called this threat in 1949, was avoided.
