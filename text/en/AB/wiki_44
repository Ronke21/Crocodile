<text>Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (book and lyrics). The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s 1909 play &quot;Liliom&quot;, transplanting its Budapest setting to the Maine coastline. The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs. He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes tragically wrong, he is given a chance to make things right. A secondary plot line deals with millworker Carrie Pipperidge and her romance with ambitious fisherman Enoch Snow. The show includes the songs &quot;If I Loved You&quot;, &quot;June Is Bustin&#x27; Out All Over&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;. Richard Rodgers later wrote that &quot;Carousel&quot; was his favorite of all his musicals.

Following the spectacular success of the first Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1943), the pair sought to collaborate on another piece, knowing that any resulting work would be compared with &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, most likely unfavorably. They were initially reluctant to seek the rights to &quot;Liliom&quot;; Molnár had refused permission for the work to be adapted in the past, and the original ending was considered too depressing for the musical theatre. After acquiring the rights, the team created a work with lengthy sequences of music and made the ending more hopeful.

The musical required considerable modification during out-of-town tryouts, but once it opened on Broadway on April 19, 1945, it was an immediate hit with both critics and audiences. &quot;Carousel&quot; initially ran for 890 performances and duplicated its success in the West End in 1950. Though it has never achieved as much commercial success as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, the piece has been repeatedly revived, recorded several times and was filmed in 1956. A production by Nicholas Hytner enjoyed success in 1992 in London, in 1994 in New York and on tour. Another Broadway revival opened in 2018. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;Carousel&quot; the best musical of the 20th century.

== Background ==

=== &quot;Liliom&quot; ===

Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s Hungarian-language drama, &quot;Liliom&quot;, premiered in Budapest in 1909. The audience was puzzled by the work, and it lasted only thirty-odd performances before being withdrawn, the first shadow on Molnár&#x27;s successful career as a playwright. &quot;Liliom&quot; was not presented again until after World War I. When it reappeared on the Budapest stage, it was a tremendous hit.
Except for the ending, the plots of &quot;Liliom&quot; and &quot;Carousel&quot; are very similar. Andreas Zavocky (nicknamed Liliom, the Hungarian word for &quot;lily&quot;, a slang term for &quot;tough guy&quot;), a carnival barker, falls in love with Julie Zeller, a servant girl, and they begin living together. With both discharged from their jobs, Liliom is discontented and contemplates leaving Julie, but decides not to do so on learning that she is pregnant. A subplot involves Julie&#x27;s friend Marie, who has fallen in love with Wolf Biefeld, a hotel porter—after the two marry, he becomes the owner of the hotel. Desperate to make money so that he, Julie and their child can escape to America and a better life, Liliom conspires with lowlife Ficsur to commit a robbery, but it goes badly, and Liliom stabs himself. He dies, and his spirit is taken to heaven&#x27;s police court. As Ficsur suggested while the two waited to commit the crime, would-be robbers like them do not come before God Himself. Liliom is told by the magistrate that he may go back to Earth for one day to attempt to redeem the wrongs he has done to his family, but must first spend sixteen years in a fiery purgatory.

On his return to Earth, Liliom encounters his daughter Louise, who, like her mother, is now a factory worker. Saying that he knew her father, he tries to give her a star he stole from the heavens. When Louise refuses to take it, he strikes her. Not realizing who he is, Julie confronts him, but finds herself unable to be angry with him. Liliom is ushered off to his fate, presumably Hell, and Louise asks her mother if it is possible to feel a hard slap as if it was a kiss. Julie reminiscently tells her daughter that it is very possible for that to happen.

An English translation of &quot;Liliom&quot; was credited to Benjamin &quot;Barney&quot; Glazer, though there is a story that the actual translator, uncredited, was Rodgers&#x27; first major partner Lorenz Hart. The Theatre Guild presented it in New York City in 1921, with Joseph Schildkraut as Liliom, and the play was a success, running 300 performances. A 1940 revival with Burgess Meredith and Ingrid Bergman was seen by both Hammerstein and Rodgers. Glazer, in introducing the English translation of &quot;Liliom&quot;, wrote of the play&#x27;s appeal:

And where in modern dramatic literature can such pearls be matched—Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love she had always been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he is to be a father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves&#x27; song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven. ... The temptation to count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist.

=== Inception ===
In the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both became well known for creating Broadway hits with other partners. Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; (1937), &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; (1938) and &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1940). Some of Rodgers&#x27; work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre: &quot;On Your Toes&quot; was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot (in the &quot;Slaughter on Tenth Avenue&quot; scene), while &quot;Pal Joey&quot; flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero. Hammerstein had written or co-written the words for such hits as &quot;Rose-Marie&quot; (1924), &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1926), &quot;The New Moon&quot; (1927) and &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1927). Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an Oscar for his song with Jerome Kern, &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot;, which was included in the 1941 film &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;.

By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, becoming unreliable and prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him. Hammerstein was eager to do so, and their first collaboration was &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1943). Thomas Hischak states, in his &quot;The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia&quot;, that &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; is &quot;the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. In fact, the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and what came after it.&quot; An innovation for its time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; would serve, according to Hischak, as &quot;the model for Broadway shows for decades&quot;, and proved a huge popular and financial success. Once it was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair. Film producer Samuel Goldwyn saw &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and advised Rodgers to shoot himself, which, according to Rodgers, &quot;was Sam&#x27;s blunt but funny way of telling me that I&#x27;d never create another show as good as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;&quot; As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote, &quot;We&#x27;re such fools. No matter what we do, everyone is bound to say, &#x27;This is not another &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;&#x27; &quot;

&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; had been a struggle to finance and produce. Hammerstein and Rodgers met weekly in 1943 with Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theatre Guild, producers of the blockbuster musical, who together formed what they termed &quot;the Gloat Club&quot;. At one such luncheon, Helburn and Langner proposed to Rodgers and Hammerstein that they turn Molnár&#x27;s &quot;Liliom&quot; into a musical. Both men refused—they had no feeling for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending was unsuitable for musical theatre. In addition, given the unstable wartime political situation, they might need to change the setting from Hungary while in rehearsal. At the next luncheon, Helburn and Langner again proposed &quot;Liliom&quot;, suggesting that they move the setting to Louisiana and make Liliom a Creole. Rodgers and Hammerstein played with the idea over the next few weeks, but decided that Creole dialect, filled with &quot;zis&quot; and &quot;zose&quot;, would sound corny and would make it difficult to write effective lyrics.

A breakthrough came when Rodgers, who owned a house in Connecticut, proposed a New England setting. Hammerstein wrote of this suggestion in 1945,

I began to see an attractive ensemble—sailors, whalers, girls who worked in the mills up the river, clambakes on near-by islands, an amusement park on the seaboard, things people could do in crowds, people who were strong and alive and lusty, people who had always been depicted on the stage as thin-lipped puritans—a libel I was anxious to refute ... as for the two leading characters, Julie with her courage and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to Maine than to Budapest. Liliom is, of course, an international character, indigenous to nowhere.
Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about what they termed &quot;the tunnel&quot; of Molnár&#x27;s second act—a series of gloomy scenes leading up to Liliom&#x27;s suicide—followed by a dark ending. They also felt it would be difficult to set Liliom&#x27;s motivation for the robbery to music. Molnár&#x27;s opposition to having his works adapted was also an issue; he had famously turned down Giacomo Puccini when the great composer wished to transform &quot;Liliom&quot; into an opera, stating that he wanted the piece to be remembered as his, not Puccini&#x27;s. In 1937, Molnár, who had recently emigrated to the United States, had declined another offer from Kurt Weill to adapt the play into a musical.

The pair continued to work on the preliminary ideas for a &quot;Liliom&quot; adaptation while pursuing other projects in late 1943 and early 1944—writing the film musical &quot;State Fair&quot; and producing &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; on Broadway. Meanwhile, the Theatre Guild took Molnár to see &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; Molnár stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt &quot;Liliom&quot; as beautifully as they had modified &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot; into &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, he would be pleased to have them do it. The Guild obtained the rights from Molnár in October 1943. The playwright received one percent of the gross and $2,500 for &quot;personal services&quot;. The duo insisted, as part of the contract, that Molnár permit them to make changes in the plot. At first, the playwright refused, but eventually yielded. Hammerstein later stated that if this point had not been won, &quot;we could never have made &quot;Carousel&quot;.&quot;

In seeking to establish through song Liliom&#x27;s motivation for the robbery, Rodgers remembered that he and Hart had a similar problem in &quot;Pal Joey&quot;. Rodgers and Hart had overcome the problem with a song that Joey sings to himself, &quot;I&#x27;m Talking to My Pal&quot;. This inspired &quot;Soliloquy&quot;. Both partners later told a story that &quot;Soliloquy&quot; was only intended to be a song about Liliom&#x27;s dreams of a son, but that Rodgers, who had two daughters, insisted that Liliom consider that Julie might have a girl. However, the notes taken at their meeting of December 7, 1943 state: &quot;Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number for the end of the scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father, in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy, and then suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely.&quot;
Hammerstein and Rodgers returned to the &quot;Liliom&quot; project in mid-1944. Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked, fearing that no matter what they did, Molnár would disapprove of the results. &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot; had been a little-known work; &quot;Liliom&quot; was a theatrical standard. Molnár&#x27;s text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society. A dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy. Hammerstein decided to use the words and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers. He also built up the secondary couple, who are incidental to the plot in &quot;Liliom&quot;; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge. &quot;This Was a Real Nice Clambake&quot; was repurposed from a song, &quot;A Real Nice Hayride&quot;, written for &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; but not used.

Molnár&#x27;s ending was unsuitable, and after a couple of false starts, Hammerstein conceived the graduation scene that ends the musical. According to Frederick Nolan in his book on the team&#x27;s works: &quot;From that scene the song &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; sprang almost naturally.&quot; In spite of Hammerstein&#x27;s simple lyrics for &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, Rodgers had great difficulty in setting it to music. Rodgers explained his rationale for the changed ending,

&quot;Liliom&quot; was a tragedy about a man who cannot learn to live with other people. The way Molnár wrote it, the man ends up hitting his daughter and then having to go back to purgatory, leaving his daughter helpless and hopeless. We couldn&#x27;t accept that. The way we ended &quot;Carousel&quot; it may still be a tragedy but it&#x27;s a hopeful one because in the final scene it is clear that the child has at last learned how to express herself and communicate with others.
When the pair decided to make &quot;This Was a Real Nice Clambake&quot; into an ensemble number, Hammerstein realized he had no idea what a clambake was like, and researched the matter. Based on his initial findings, he wrote the line, &quot;First came codfish chowder&quot;. However, further research convinced him the proper term was &quot;codhead chowder&quot;, a term unfamiliar to many playgoers. He decided to keep it as &quot;codfish&quot;. When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast, Hammerstein wrote the line &quot;We slit &#x27;em down the back/And peppered &#x27;em good&quot;. He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always slit down the front. The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back. Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back. One error not caught involved the song &quot;June Is Bustin&#x27; Out All Over&quot;, in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring—they actually do so in the winter. Whenever this was brought to Hammerstein&#x27;s attention, he told his informant that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring.

Rodgers early decided to dispense with an overture, feeling that the music was hard to hear over the banging of seats as latecomers settled themselves. In his autobiography, Rodgers complained that only the brass section can be heard during an overture because there are never enough strings in a musical&#x27;s small orchestra. He determined to force the audience to concentrate from the beginning by opening with a pantomime scene accompanied by what became known as &quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot;. The pantomime paralleled one in the Molnár play, which was also used to introduce the characters and situation to the audience. Author Ethan Mordden described the effectiveness of this opening:

Other characters catch our notice—Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill owner, Mrs. Mullin, the widow who runs the carousel and, apparently, Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat. But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy—the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying to the rhythm of Billy&#x27;s spiel. And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R &amp; H have not only skipped the overture &quot;and&quot; the opening number but the exposition as well. They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had.
=== Casting and out-of-town tryouts ===
The casting for &quot;Carousel&quot; began when &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;&#x27;s production team, including Rodgers and Hammerstein, was seeking a replacement for the part of Curly (the male lead in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;). Lawrence Langner had heard, through a relative, of a California singer named John Raitt, who might be suitable for the part. Langner went to hear Raitt, then urged the others to bring Raitt to New York for an audition. Raitt asked to sing &quot;Largo al factotum&quot;, Figaro&#x27;s aria from &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, to warm up. The warmup was sufficient to convince the producers that not only had they found a Curly, they had found a Liliom (or Billy Bigelow, as the part was renamed). Theresa Helburn made another California discovery, Jan Clayton, a singer/actress who had made a few minor films for MGM. She was brought east and successfully auditioned for the part of Julie.

The producers sought to cast unknowns. Though many had played in previous Hammerstein or Rodgers works, only one, Jean Casto (cast as carousel owner Mrs. Mullin, and a veteran of &quot;Pal Joey&quot;), had ever played on Broadway before. It proved harder to cast the ensemble than the leads, due to the war—Rodgers told his casting director, John Fearnley, that the sole qualification for a dancing boy was that he be alive. Rodgers and Hammerstein reassembled much of the creative team that had made &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; a success, including director Rouben Mamoulian and choreographer Agnes de Mille. Miles White was the costume designer while Jo Mielziner (who had not worked on &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;) was the scenic and lighting designer. Even though &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; orchestrator Russell Bennett had informed Rodgers that he was unavailable to work on &quot;Carousel&quot; due to a radio contract, Rodgers insisted he do the work in his spare time. He orchestrated &quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot; and &quot;(When I Marry) Mister Snow&quot; before finally being replaced by Don Walker. A new member of the creative team was Trude Rittmann, who arranged the dance music. Rittmann initially felt that Rodgers mistrusted her because she was a woman, and found him difficult to work with, but the two worked together on Rodgers&#x27; shows until the 1970s.

Rehearsals began in January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was presented with the lyrics for &quot;Soliloquy&quot; on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he felt that they were never fully addressed. At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. There are a number of variations on the story. As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár in the rear of the theatre and whispered the news to his partner. Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right. At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, &quot;What you have done is so beautiful. And you know what I like best? The ending!&quot; Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.

Like most of the pair&#x27;s works, &quot;Carousel&quot; contains a lengthy ballet, &quot;Billy Makes a Journey&quot;, in the second act, as Billy looks down to the Earth from &quot;Up There&quot; and observes his daughter. In the original production the ballet was choreographed by de Mille. It began with Billy looking down from heaven at his wife in labor, with the village women gathered for a &quot;birthing&quot;. The ballet involved every character in the play, some of whom spoke lines of dialogue, and contained a number of subplots. The focus was on Louise, played by Bambi Linn, who at first almost soars in her dance, expressing the innocence of childhood. She is teased and mocked by her schoolmates, and Louise becomes attracted to the rough carnival people, who symbolize Billy&#x27;s world. A youth from the carnival attempts to seduce Louise, as she discovers her own sexuality, but he decides she is more girl than woman, and he leaves her. After Julie comforts her, Louise goes to a children&#x27;s party, where she is shunned. The carnival people reappear and form a ring around the children&#x27;s party, with Louise lost between the two groups. At the end, the performers form a huge carousel with their bodies.

The play opened for tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut on March 22, 1945. The first act was well-received; the second act was not. Casto recalled that the second act finished about 1:30 a.m. The staff immediately sat down for a two-hour conference. Five scenes, half the ballet, and two songs were cut from the show as the result. John Fearnley commented, &quot;Now I see why these people have hits. I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life.&quot; De Mille said of this conference, &quot;not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished. Nor was there any idle joking. ... We cut and cut and cut and then we went to bed.&quot; By the time the company left New Haven, de Mille&#x27;s ballet was down to forty minutes.

A major concern with the second act was the effectiveness of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers &quot;Mr. and Mrs. God&quot;), before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor. The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening. Rodgers said to Hammerstein, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to get God out of that parlor&quot;. When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t care where you put Him. Put Him on a ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor!&quot; Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder, and Mrs. God was removed from the show. Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by &quot;The New Republic&quot; as &quot;a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth&quot;.

Hammerstein wrote that Molnár&#x27;s advice, to combine two scenes into one, was key to pulling together the second act and represented &quot;a more radical departure from the original than any change we had made&quot;. A reprise of &quot;If I Loved You&quot; was added in the second act, which Rodgers felt needed more music. Three weeks of tryouts in Boston followed the brief New Haven run, and the audience there gave the musical a warm reception. An even shorter version of the ballet was presented the final two weeks in Boston, but on the final night there, de Mille expanded it back to forty minutes, and it brought the house down, causing both Rodgers and Hammerstein to embrace her.

== Synopsis ==

=== Act 1 ===
Two young female millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town&#x27;s carousel after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts the attention of the barker, Billy Bigelow (&quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot;). When Julie lets Billy put his arm around her during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin. Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive (&quot;You&#x27;re a Queer One, Julie Jordan&quot;). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow (&quot;(When I Marry) Mister Snow&quot;), to whom she is newly engaged. Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie&#x27;s job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other (&quot;If I Loved You&quot;).
Over a month passes, and preparations for the summer clambake are under way (&quot;June Is Bustin&#x27; Out All Over&quot;). Julie and Billy, now married, live at Julie&#x27;s cousin Nettie&#x27;s spa. Julie confides in Carrie that Billy, frustrated over being unemployed, hit her. Carrie has happier news—she is engaged to Enoch, who enters as she discusses him (&quot;(When I Marry) Mister Snow (reprise))&quot;. Billy arrives with his ne&#x27;er-do-well whaler friend, Jigger. Billy is openly rude to Enoch and Julie, then leaves with Jigger, followed by a distraught Julie. Enoch tells Carrie that he expects to become rich selling herring and to have a large family, larger perhaps than Carrie is comfortable having (&quot;When the Children Are Asleep&quot;).

Jigger and his shipmates, joined by Billy, then sing about life on the sea (&quot;Blow High, Blow Low&quot;). The whaler tries to recruit Billy to help with a robbery, but Billy declines, as the victim—Julie&#x27;s former boss, Mr. Bascombe—might have to be killed. Mrs. Mullin enters and tries to tempt Billy back to the carousel (and to her). He would have to abandon Julie; a married barker cannot evoke the same sexual tension as one who is single. Billy reluctantly mulls it over as Julie arrives and the others leave. She tells him that she is pregnant, and Billy is overwhelmed with happiness, ending all thoughts of returning to the carousel. Once alone, Billy imagines the fun he will have with Bill Jr.—until he realizes that his child might be a girl, and reflects soberly that &quot;you&#x27;ve got to be a &quot;father&quot; to a girl&quot; (&quot;Soliloquy&quot;). Determined to provide financially for his future child, whatever the means, Billy decides to be Jigger&#x27;s accomplice.

The whole town leaves for the clambake. Billy, who had earlier refused to go, agrees to join in, to Julie&#x27;s delight, as he realizes that being seen at the clambake is integral to his and Jigger&#x27;s alibi (&quot;Act I Finale&quot;).

=== Act 2 ===

Everyone reminisces about the huge meal and much fun (&quot;This Was a Real Nice Clambake&quot;). Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks in at the wrong moment, and declares that he is finished with her (&quot;Geraniums In the Winder&quot;), as Jigger jeers (&quot;There&#x27;s Nothin&#x27; So Bad for a Woman&quot;). The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that &quot;he&#x27;s your feller and you love him&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s the Use of Wond&#x27;rin&#x27;?&quot;). Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt. She begs him to give it to her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.

As they wait, Jigger and Billy gamble with cards. They stake their shares of the anticipated robbery spoils. Billy loses: his participation is now pointless. Unknown to Billy and Jigger, Mr. Bascombe, the intended victim, has already deposited the mill&#x27;s money. The robbery fails: Bascombe pulls a gun on Billy while Jigger escapes. Billy stabs himself with his knife; Julie arrives just in time for him to say his last words to her and die. Julie strokes his hair, finally able to tell him that she loved him. Carrie and Enoch, reunited by the crisis, attempt to console Julie; Nettie arrives and gives Julie the resolve to keep going despite her despair (&quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;).

Billy&#x27;s defiant spirit (&quot;The Highest Judge of All&quot;) is taken Up There to see the Starkeeper, a heavenly official. The Starkeeper tells Billy that the good he did in life was not enough to get into heaven, but so long as there is a person alive who remembers him, he can return for a day to try to do good to redeem himself. He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since his suicide, and suggests that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter, Louise. He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her (instrumental ballet: &quot;Billy Makes a Journey&quot;). Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter. The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater. In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young. The dance concludes, and Billy is anxious to return to Earth and help his daughter. He steals a star to take with him, as the Starkeeper pretends not to notice.

Outside Julie&#x27;s cottage, Carrie describes her visit to New York with the now-wealthy Enoch. Carrie&#x27;s husband and their many children enter to fetch her—the family must get ready for the high school graduation later that day. Enoch Jr., the oldest son, remains behind to talk with Louise, as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter, invisible to the other characters. Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe. He says that he will stop her by marrying her, but that his father will think her an unsuitable match. Louise is outraged: each insults the other&#x27;s father, and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away. Billy, able to make himself visible at will, reveals himself to the sobbing Louise, pretending to be a friend of her father. He offers her a gift—the star he stole from heaven. She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her hand. He makes himself invisible, and Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that the slap miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow—and Julie understands her perfectly. Louise retreats to the house, as Julie notices the star that Billy dropped; she picks it up and seems to feel Billy&#x27;s presence (&quot;If I Loved You (Reprise)&quot;).

Billy invisibly attends Louise&#x27;s graduation, hoping for one last chance to help his daughter and redeem himself. The beloved town physician, Dr. Seldon (who resembles the Starkeeper) advises the graduating class not to rely on their parents&#x27; success or be held back by their failure (words directed at Louise). Seldon prompts everyone to sing an old song, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;. Billy, still invisible, whispers to Louise, telling her to believe Seldon&#x27;s words, and when she tentatively reaches out to another girl, she learns she does not have to be an outcast. Billy goes to Julie, telling her at last that he loved her. As his widow and daughter join in the singing, Billy is taken to his heavenly reward.

== Productions ==

=== Early productions ===
The original Broadway production opened at the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945. The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well received. One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain. Sedated with morphine, he could see only part of the stage. As he could not hear the audience&#x27;s applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause. Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow. Rodgers&#x27; daughter Mary caught sight of her friend, Stephen Sondheim, both teenagers then, across several rows; both had eyes wet with tears.

The original production ran for 890 performances, closing on May 24, 1947. The original cast included John Raitt (Billy), Jan Clayton (Julie), Jean Darling (Carrie), Eric Mattson (Enoch Snow), Christine Johnson (Nettie Fowler), Murvyn Vye (Jigger), Bambi Linn (Louise) and Russell Collins (Starkeeper). In December 1945, Clayton left to star in the Broadway revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot; and was replaced by Iva Withers; Raitt was replaced by Henry Michel in January 1947; Darling was replaced by Margot Moser.

After closing on Broadway, the show went on a national tour for two years. It played for five months in Chicago alone, visited twenty states and two Canadian cities, covered and played to nearly two million people. The touring company had a four-week run at New York City Center in January 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT/Calta 1949-01-25&quot;&gt;Calta, Louis. &quot;&#x27;Carousel&#x27; opens tonight at City Center&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, January 25, 1949, p. 27. Retrieved on December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the City Center run, the show was moved back to the Majestic Theatre starring Stephen Douglass (Billy) and Iva Withers (Julie), in the hopes of filling the theatre until &quot;South Pacific&quot; opened in early April. Ticket sales were mediocre, however, and the show closed almost a month early.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT/Calta 1949-02-28&quot;&gt;Calta, Louis. &quot;&#x27;Carousel&#x27; to end run on Saturday&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, February 28, 1949, p. 15. Retrieved on December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical premiered in the West End, London, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on June 7, 1950. The production was restaged by Jerome Whyte, with a cast that included Douglass and Withers reprising their roles as Billy and Julie, and Margot Moser as Carrie. &quot;Carousel&quot; ran in London for 566 performances, remaining there for over a year and a half.

=== Subsequent productions ===
&quot;Carousel&quot; was revived in 1954 and 1957 at City Center, presented by the New York City Center Light Opera Company. Both times, the production featured Barbara Cook, though she played Carrie in 1954 and Julie in 1957 (playing alongside Howard Keel as Billy). The production was then taken to Belgium to be performed at the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair, with David Atkinson as Billy, Ruth Kobart as Nettie, and Clayton reprising the role of Julie, which she had originated.

In August 1965, Rodgers and the Music Theater of Lincoln Center produced &quot;Carousel&quot; for 47 performances. John Raitt reprised the role of Billy, with Jerry Orbach as Jigger and Reid Shelton as Enoch Snow. The roles of the Starkeeper and Dr. Seldon were played by Edward Everett Horton in his final stage appearance. The following year, New York City Center Light Opera Company brought &quot;Carousel&quot; back to City Center for 22 performances, with Bruce Yarnell as Billy and Constance Towers as Julie.

Nicholas Hytner directed a new production of &quot;Carousel&quot; in 1992, at London&#x27;s Royal National Theatre, with choreography by Sir Kenneth MacMillan and designs by Bob Crowley. In this staging, the story begins at the mill, where Julie and Carrie work, with the music slowed down to emphasize the drudgery. After work ends, they move to the shipyards and then to the carnival. As they proceed on a revolving stage, carnival characters appear, and at last the carousel is assembled onstage for the girls to ride. Louise is seduced by the ruffian boy during her Act 2 ballet, set around the ruins of a carousel. Michael Hayden played Billy not as a large, gruff man, but as a frustrated smaller one, a time bomb waiting to explode. Joanna Riding (Julie) and Janie Dee (Carrie) won Olivier Awards for their performances, the production won Best Musical Revival, and Hytner won as director. Patricia Routledge played Nettie. Clive Rowe, as Enoch, was nominated for an Olivier Award. Enoch and Carrie were cast as an interracial couple whose eight children, according to the review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, looked like &quot;a walking United Colors of Benetton ad&quot;. The production&#x27;s limited run from December 1992 through March 1993 was a sellout. It re-opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London in September 1993, presented by Cameron Mackintosh, where it continued until May 1994.

The Hytner production moved to New York&#x27;s Vivian Beaumont Theater, where it opened on March 24, 1994, and ran for 322 performances. This won five Tony Awards, including best musical revival, as well as awards for Hytner, MacMillan, Crowley and Audra McDonald (as Carrie). The cast also included Sally Murphy as Julie, Shirley Verrett as Nettie, Fisher Stevens as Jigger and Eddie Korbich as Enoch. Replacements for Billy included Marcus Lovett and James Barbour. One change made from the London to the New York production was to have Billy strike Louise across the face, rather than on the hand. According to Hayden, &quot;He does the one unpardonable thing, the thing we can&#x27;t forgive. It&#x27;s a challenge for the audience to like him after that.&quot; The Hytner &quot;Carousel&quot; was presented in Japan in May 1995. A U.S. national tour with a scaled-down production began in February 1996 in Houston and closed in May 1997 in Providence, Rhode Island. Producers sought to feature young talent on the tour, with Patrick Wilson as Billy and Sarah Uriarte Berry, and later Jennifer Laura Thompson, as Julie.

A revival opened at London&#x27;s Savoy Theatre on December 2, 2008, after a week of previews, starring Jeremiah James (Billy), Alexandra Silber (Julie) and Lesley Garrett (Nettie). The production received warm to mixed reviews. It closed in June 2009, a month early. Michael Coveney, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, admired Rodgers&#x27; music but stated, &quot;Lindsay Posner&#x27;s efficient revival doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the National Theatre 1992 version&quot;. A production at Theater Basel, Switzerland, in 2016 to 2017, with German dialogue, was directed by Alexander Charim and choreographed by Teresa Rotemberg. Bryony Dwyer, Christian Miedl and Cheryl Studer starred, respectively, as Julie Jordan, Billy Bigelow and Nettie Fowler. A semi-staged revival by the English National Opera opened at the London Coliseum in 2017. The production was directed by Lonny Price, conducted by David Charles Abell, and starred Alfie Boe as Billy, Katherine Jenkins as Julie and Nicholas Lyndhurst as the Starkeeper. The production received mixed to positive reviews.

The third Broadway revival began previews on February 28, 2018, at the Imperial Theatre and officially opened on April 12. It closed on September 16, 2018. The production starred Jessie Mueller, Joshua Henry, Renée Fleming, Lindsay Mendez and Alexander Gemignani. The production was directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien and choreographed by Justin Peck. The songs &quot;Geraniums in the Winder&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Nothin&#x27; So Bad for a Woman&quot; were cut from this revival. Ben Brantley wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The tragic inevitability of &quot;Carousel&quot; has seldom come across as warmly or as chillingly as it does in this vividly reimagined revival. ... [W]ith thoughtful and powerful performances by Mr. Henry and Ms. Mueller, the love story at the show&#x27;s center has never seemed quite as ill-starred or, at the same time, as sexy. ... [T]he Starkeeper ... assumes new visibility throughout, taking on the role of Billy&#x27;s angelic supervisor.&quot; Brantley strongly praised the choreography, all the performances and the designers. He was unconvinced, however, by the &quot;mother-daughter dialogue that falls so abrasively on contemporary ears&quot;, where Julie tries to justify loving an abusive man, and other scenes in Act 2, particularly those set in heaven, and the optimism of the final scene. Most of the reviewers agreed that while the choreography and performances (especially the singing) were excellent, characterizing the production as sexy and sumptuous, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s direction did little to help the show deal with modern sensibilities about men&#x27;s treatment of women, instead indulging in nostalgia.

From July to September 2021 the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre in London is presenting a staging by its artistic director Timothy Sheader, with choreography by Drew McOnie. The cast included Carly Bawden as Julie, Declan Bennett as Billy and Joanna Riding as Nettie.

=== Film, television and concert versions ===
A film version of the musical was made in 1956, starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones. It follows the musical&#x27;s story fairly closely, although a prologue, set in the Starkeeper&#x27;s heaven, was added. The film was released only a few months after the release of the film version of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; It garnered some good reviews, and the soundtrack recording was a best seller. As the same stars appeared in both pictures, however, the two films were often compared, generally to the disadvantage of &quot;Carousel&quot;. Thomas Hischak, in &quot;The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia&quot;, later wondered &quot;if the smaller number of &quot;Carousel&quot; stage revivals is the product of this often-lumbering [film] musical&quot;.

There was also an abridged (100 minute) 1967 network television version that starred Robert Goulet, with choreography by Edward Villella. BBC Radio Theatre broadcast a concert of &quot;Carousel&quot; in July 1995 starring Mandy Patinkin as Billy. In 2002, Carnegie Hall presented a concert of the musical starring Hugh Jackman and Audra McDonald as Billy and Julie, directed by Walter Bobbie. Other cast members included Jason Danieley, Judy Kaye, Lauren Ward, Norbert Leo Butz, Philip Bosco and Blythe Danner.

The New York Philharmonic presented a staged concert version of the musical from February 28 to March 2, 2013, at Avery Fisher Hall. Kelli O&#x27;Hara played Julie, with Nathan Gunn as Billy, Stephanie Blythe as Nettie, Jessie Mueller as Carrie, Danieley as Enoch, Shuler Hensley as Jigger, John Cullum as the Starkeeper, and Kate Burton as Mrs. Mullin. Tiler Peck danced the role of Louise to choreography by Warren Carlyle. The production was directed by John Rando and conducted by Rob Fisher. Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;this is as gorgeously sung a production of this sublime 1945 Broadway musical as you are ever likely to hear.&quot; It was broadcast as part of the PBS &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot; series, premiering on April 26, 2013.

== Music and recordings ==

=== Musical treatment ===
Rodgers designed &quot;Carousel&quot; to be an almost continuous stream of music, especially in Act 1. In later years, Rodgers was asked if he had considered writing an opera. He stated that he had been sorely tempted to, but saw &quot;Carousel&quot; in operatic terms. He remembered, &quot;We came very close to opera in the Majestic Theatre. ... There&#x27;s much that is operatic in the music.&quot;
Rodgers uses music in &quot;Carousel&quot; in subtle ways to differentiate characters and tell the audience of their emotional state. In &quot;You&#x27;re a Queer One, Julie Jordan&quot;, the music for the placid Carrie is characterized by even eighth-note rhythms, whereas the emotionally restless Julie&#x27;s music is marked by dotted eighths and sixteenths; this rhythm will characterize her throughout the show. When Billy whistles a snatch of the song, he selects Julie&#x27;s dotted notes rather than Carrie&#x27;s. Reflecting the close association in the music between Julie and the as-yet unborn Louise, when Billy sings in &quot;Soliloquy&quot; of his daughter, who &quot;gets hungry every night&quot;, he uses Julie&#x27;s dotted rhythms. Such rhythms also characterize Julie&#x27;s Act 2 song, &quot;What&#x27;s the Use of Wond&#x27;rin&#x27;&quot;. The stable love between Enoch and Carrie is strengthened by her willingness to let Enoch not only plan his entire life, but hers as well. This is reflected in &quot;When the Children Are Asleep&quot;, where the two sing in close harmony, but Enoch musically interrupts his intended&#x27;s turn at the chorus with the words &quot;Dreams that won&#x27;t be interrupted&quot;. Rodgers biographer Geoffrey Block, in his book on the Broadway musical, points out that though Billy may strike his wife, he allows her musical themes to become a part of him and never interrupts her music. Block suggests that, as reprehensible as Billy may be for his actions, Enoch requiring Carrie to act as &quot;the little woman&quot;, and his having nine children with her (more than she had found acceptable in &quot;When the Children are Asleep&quot;) can be considered to be even more abusive.

The twelve-minute &quot;bench scene&quot;, in which Billy and Julie get to know each other and which culminates with &quot;If I Loved You&quot;, according to Hischak, &quot;is considered the most completely integrated piece of music-drama in the American musical theatre&quot;. The scene is almost entirely drawn from Molnár and is one extended musical piece; Stephen Sondheim described it as &quot;probably the single most important moment in the revolution of contemporary musicals&quot;. &quot;If I Loved You&quot; has been recorded many times, by such diverse artists as Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Sammy Davis Jr., Mario Lanza and Chad and Jeremy. The D-flat major theme that dominates the music for the second act ballet seems like a new melody to many audience members. It is, however, a greatly expanded development of a theme heard during &quot;Soliloquy&quot; at the line &quot;I guess he&#x27;ll call me &#x27;The old man&#x27; &quot;.

When the pair discussed the song that would become &quot;Soliloquy&quot;, Rodgers improvised at the piano to give Hammerstein an idea of how he envisioned the song. When Hammerstein presented his collaborator with the lyrics after two weeks of work (Hammerstein always wrote the words first, then Rodgers would write the melodies), Rodgers wrote the music for the eight-minute song in two hours. &quot;What&#x27;s the Use of Wond&#x27;rin&#x27; &quot;, one of Julie&#x27;s songs, worked well in the show but was never as popular on the radio or for recording, and Hammerstein believed that the lack of popularity was because he had concluded the final line, &quot;And all the rest is talk&quot; with a hard consonant, which does not allow the singer a vocal climax.
Irving Berlin later stated that &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; had the same sort of effect on him as the 23rd Psalm. When singer Mel Tormé told Rodgers that &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; had made him cry, Rodgers nodded impatiently. &quot;You&#x27;re supposed to.&quot; The frequently recorded song has become a widely accepted hymn. The cast recording of &quot;Carousel&quot; proved popular in Liverpool, like many Broadway albums, and in 1963, the Brian Epstein-managed band, Gerry and the Pacemakers had a number-one hit with the song. At the time, the top ten hits were played before Liverpool F.C. home matches; even after &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; dropped out of the top ten, fans continued to sing it, and it has become closely associated with the soccer team and the city of Liverpool. A BBC program, &quot;Soul Music&quot;, ranked it alongside &quot;Silent Night&quot; and &quot;Abide With Me&quot; in terms of its emotional impact and iconic status.

=== Recordings ===
The cast album of the 1945 Broadway production was issued on 78s, and the score was significantly cut—as was the 1950 London cast recording. Theatre historian John Kenrick notes of the 1945 recording that a number of songs had to be abridged to fit the 78 format, but that there is a small part of &quot;Soliloquy&quot; found on no other recording, as Rodgers cut it from the score immediately after the studio recording was made.

A number of songs were cut for the 1956 film, but two of the deleted numbers had been recorded and were ultimately retained on the soundtrack album. The expanded CD version of the soundtrack, issued in 2001, contains all of the singing recorded for the film, including the cut portions, and nearly all of the dance music. The recording of the 1965 Lincoln Center revival featured Raitt reprising the role of Billy. Studio recordings of &quot;Carousel&quot;&#x27;s songs were released in 1956 (with Robert Merrill as Billy, Patrice Munsel as Julie, and Florence Henderson as Carrie), 1962 and 1987. The 1987 version featured a mix of opera and musical stars, including Samuel Ramey, Barbara Cook and Sarah Brightman. Kenrick recommends the 1962 studio recording for its outstanding cast, including Alfred Drake, Roberta Peters, Claramae Turner, Lee Venora, and Norman Treigle.

Both the London (1993) and New York (1994) cast albums of the Hytner production contain portions of dialogue that, according to Hischak, speak to the power of Michael Hayden&#x27;s portrayal of Billy. Kenrick judges the 1994 recording the best all-around performance of &quot;Carousel&quot; on disc, despite uneven singing by Hayden, due to Sally Murphy&#x27;s Julie and the strong supporting cast (calling Audra McDonald the best Carrie he has heard). The Stratford Festival issued a recording in 2015.

== Critical reception and legacy ==

The musical received almost unanimous rave reviews after its opening in 1945. According to Hischak, reviews were not as exuberant as for &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; as the critics were not taken by surprise this time. John Chapman of the &quot;Daily News&quot; termed it &quot;one of the finest musical plays I have ever seen and I shall remember it always&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27;s reviewer, Lewis Nichols, stated that &quot;Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, who can do no wrong, have continued doing no wrong in adapting &quot;Liliom&quot; into a musical play. Their &quot;Carousel&quot; is on the whole delightful.&quot; Wilella Waldorf of the &quot;New York Post&quot;, however, complained, &quot;&quot;Carousel&quot; seemed to us a rather long evening. The &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; formula is becoming a bit monotonous and so are Miss de Mille&#x27;s ballets. All right, go ahead and shoot!&quot; &quot;Dance Magazine&quot; gave Linn plaudits for her role as Louise, stating, &quot;Bambi doesn&#x27;t come on until twenty minutes before eleven, and for the next forty minutes, she practically holds the audience in her hand&quot;. Howard Barnes in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; also applauded the dancing: &quot;It has waited for Miss de Mille to come through with peculiarly American dance patterns for a musical show to become as much a dance as a song show.&quot;

When the musical returned to New York in 1949, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Brooks Atkinson described &quot;Carousel&quot; as &quot;a conspicuously superior musical play ... &quot;Carousel&quot;, which was warmly appreciated when it opened, seems like nothing less than a masterpiece now.&quot; In 1954, when &quot;Carousel&quot; was revived at City Center, Atkinson discussed the musical in his review:

&quot;Carousel&quot; has no comment to make on anything of topical importance. The theme is timeless and universal: the devotion of two people who love each other through thick and thin, complicated in this case by the wayward personality of the man, who cannot fulfill the responsibilities he has assumed.  ... Billy is a bum, but &quot;Carousel&quot; recognizes the decency of his motives and admires his independence. There are no slick solutions in &quot;Carousel&quot;.

Stephen Sondheim noted the duo&#x27;s ability to take the innovations of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and apply them to a serious setting: &quot;&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; is about a picnic, &quot;Carousel&quot; is about life and death.&quot; Critic Eric Bentley, on the other hand, wrote that &quot;the last scene of &quot;Carousel&quot; is an impertinence: I refuse to be lectured to by a musical comedy scriptwriter on the education of children, the nature of the good life, and the contribution of the American small town to the salvation of souls.&quot;

&quot;New York Times&quot; critic Frank Rich said of the 1992 London production: &quot;What is remarkable about Mr. Hytner&#x27;s direction, aside from its unorthodox faith in the virtues of simplicity and stillness, is its ability to make a 1992 audience believe in Hammerstein&#x27;s vision of redemption, which has it that a dead sinner can return to Earth to do godly good.&quot; The Hytner production in New York was hailed by many critics as a grittier &quot;Carousel&quot;, which they deemed more appropriate for the 1990s. Clive Barnes of the &quot;New York Post&quot; called it a &quot;defining &quot;Carousel&quot;—hard-nosed, imaginative, and exciting.&quot;

Critic Michael Billington has commented that &quot;lyrically [&quot;Carousel&quot;] comes perilously close to acceptance of the inevitability of domestic violence.&quot; BroadwayWorld.com stated in 2013 that &quot;Carousel&quot; is now &quot;considered somewhat controversial in terms of its attitudes on domestic violence&quot; because Julie chooses to stay with Billy despite the abuse; actress Kelli O&#x27;Hara noted that the domestic violence that Julie &quot;chooses to deal with – is a real, existing and very complicated thing. And exploring it is an important part of healing it.&quot;

Rodgers considered &quot;Carousel&quot; his favorite of all his musicals and wrote, &quot;it affects me deeply every time I see it performed&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in its &quot;Best of the Century&quot; list, named &quot;Carousel&quot; the Best Musical of the 20th century, writing that Rodgers and Hammerstein &quot;set the standards for the 20th century musical, and this show features their most beautiful score and the most skillful and affecting example of their musical storytelling&quot;. Hammerstein&#x27;s grandson, Oscar Andrew Hammerstein, in his book about his family, suggested that the wartime situation made &quot;Carousel&quot;&#x27;s ending especially poignant to its original viewers, &quot;Every American grieved the loss of a brother, son, father, or friend ... the audience empathized with [Billy&#x27;s] all-too-human efforts to offer advice, to seek forgiveness, to complete an unfinished life, and to bid a proper good-bye from beyond the grave.&quot; Author and composer Ethan Mordden agreed with that perspective:

If &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; developed the moral argument for sending American boys overseas, &quot;Carousel&quot; offered consolation to those wives and mothers whose boys would only return in spirit. The meaning lay not in the tragedy of the present, but in the hope for a future where no one walks alone.

<text>Christian alternative rock is a form of alternative rock music that is lyrically grounded in a Christian worldview. Some critics have suggested that unlike CCM and older Christian rock, Christian alternative rock generally emphasizes musical style over lyrical content as a defining genre characteristic, though the degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist.

==History==
Christian alternative music has its roots in the early 1980s, as the earliest efforts at Christian punk and new wave were recorded by artists like Andy McCarroll and Moral Support, Undercover, the 77s, Steve Scott, Adam Again, Quickflight, Daniel Amos, Youth Choir (later renamed the Choir), Lifesavers Underground, Michael Knott, the Prayer Chain, Altar Boys, Breakfast with Amy, Steve Taylor, 4-4-1, David Edwards and Vector. Early labels, most now-defunct, included Blonde Vinyl, Frontline, Exit, and Refuge.

By the 1990s, many of these bands and artists had disbanded, were no longer performing, or were being carried by independent labels because their music tended to be more lyrically complex (and often more controversial) than mainstream Christian pop. The modern market is currently supported by labels such as Tooth &amp; Nail, Gotee and Floodgate. These companies are often children of, or partially owned, by general market labels such as Warner, EMI, and Capitol Records, giving successful artists an opportunity to &quot;cross over&quot; into mainstream markets.

<doc id="7573" wikidata="Q298761" url="?curid=7573" title="Clive Barker">
<text>Clive Barker (born 5 October 1952) is an English writer, filmmaker and visual artist. He came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of short stories, the &quot;Books of Blood&quot;, which established him as a leading horror writer. He has since written many novels and other works. His fiction has been adapted into films, notably the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; series, the first installment of which he also wrote and directed, and the &quot;Candyman&quot; series.

Barker&#x27;s paintings and illustrations have been shown in galleries in the United States, and have appeared in his books. He has also created characters and series for comic books, and some of his more popular horror stories have been featured in ongoing comics series.

==Early life==
Barker was born on 5 October 1952 in Liverpool, the son of Joan Ruby (née Revill), a painter and school welfare officer, and Leonard Barker, a personnel director for an industrial relations firm. He was educated at Dovedale Primary School, Quarry Bank High School and the University of Liverpool, where he studied English and philosophy.

When he was three, Barker witnessed the French skydiver Léo Valentin plummet to his death in 1956 during a performance at an air show in Liverpool. He later alluded to Valentin in many of his stories.

== Theatrical work ==
Barker&#x27;s involvement in live theatre began while still in school with productions of &quot;Voodoo&quot; and &quot;Inferno&quot; in 1967. He collaborated on six plays with &quot;Theatre of the Imagination&quot; in 1974 and two more that he was the sole writer of, &quot;A Clowns&#x27; Sodom&quot; and &quot;Day of the Dog,&quot; for &quot;The Mute Pantomime Theatre&quot; in 1976 and 1977.

He co-founded the avant-garde theatrical troupe &quot;The Dog Company&quot; in 1978 with former school friends and up and coming actors, many of whom would go on to become key collaborators in Barker&#x27;s film work. Doug Bradley took on the iconic role of Pinhead in the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; series while Peter Atkins wrote the scripts for the first three Hellraiser sequels. Over the next five years Barker wrote nine plays, often serving as director, including some of his best-known stage productions, &quot;The History of The Devil&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein in Love&quot;, and &quot;The Secret Life of Cartoons&quot;.

From 1982 to 1983, he wrote &quot;Crazyface&quot;, &quot;Subtle Bodies&quot; and &quot;Colossus&quot; for the Cockpit Youth Theatre.

His theatrical work came to a close as he shifted focus to writing the &quot;Books of Blood&quot;.

==Writing career==
Barker is an author of horror and fantasy. He began writing horror early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in &quot;Books of Blood&quot; 1–6) and the Faustian novel &quot;The Damnation Game&quot; (1985). Later he moved toward modern-day fantasy and urban fantasy with horror elements in &quot;Weaveworld&quot; (1987), &quot;The Great and Secret Show&quot; (1989), the world-spanning &quot;Imajica&quot; (1991), and &quot;Sacrament&quot; (1996).

When &quot;Books of Blood&quot; was first published in the United States in paperback, Stephen King was quoted on the book covers: &quot;I have seen the future of horror and his name is Clive Barker.&quot; As influences on his writing, Barker lists Herman Melville, Edgar Allan Poe, Ray Bradbury, William S. Burroughs, William Blake, and Jean Cocteau, among others.

He is the writer of the best-selling &quot;Abarat&quot; series.

In early 2024, he announced he would stop attending conventions and public events so he could focus more on his writing, as he was working on the manuscripts for 31 different projects, some closer to completion than others.

==Personal life==
During his early years as a writer, Barker occasionally worked as an escort when his writing did not provide sufficient income. 

In 2003, he received the Davidson/Valentini Award at the 15th GLAAD Media Awards.

He has been open about his experiences with sadomasochism, and says that &quot;on S&amp;M&#x27;s sliding scale, I&#x27;m probably a 6&quot;.

Barker is critical of organized religion, but has said that the Bible influences his work and spirituality. Years later, he said on Facebook that he did not identify himself as a Christian.

Barker said in a December 2008 online interview (published in March 2009) that he had throat polyps which were so severe, a doctor told him he was taking in only 10% of the air he was supposed to. He has had two surgical procedures to remove them and believes his voice has improved as a result. He said he did not have cancer, and has given up cigars.

In 2012, Barker entered a coma for several days after contracting toxic shock syndrome, triggered by a visit to a dentist where a spillage of poisonous bacteria entered his bloodstream, almost killing him. Realising he might have just a short time to live, he decided to put his personal concerns about the world and society into the upcoming novel &quot;Deep Hill&quot;, which he thought could be his final book.

As of 2015, he is a member of the board of advisers for the Hollywood Horror Museum.

===Relationships===
While appearing on the radio call-in show &quot;Loveline&quot; on 20 August 1996, Barker said that in his teens he had several relationships with older women, but came to identify himself as homosexual by 18 or 19.

His relationship with John Gregson lasted from 1975 until 1986. He later spent 13 years with photographer David Armstrong, described as his husband in the introduction to &quot;Coldheart Canyon&quot;; they separated in 2009.

==Film work==

Barker wrote the screenplays for &quot;Underworld&quot; (1985) and &quot;Rawhead Rex&quot; (1986), both directed by George Pavlou. Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with &quot;Hellraiser&quot; (1987), based on his novella &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot;. After his film &quot;Nightbreed&quot; (1990) flopped, Barker returned to write and direct &quot;Lord of Illusions&quot; (1995). The short story &quot;The Forbidden&quot;, from Barker&#x27;s &quot;Books of Blood&quot;, provided the basis for the 1992 film &quot;Candyman&quot; and its three sequels. He had been working on a series of film adaptations of his &quot;The Abarat Quintet&quot; books under The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s management, but due to creative differences, the project was cancelled.

He served as an executive producer for the 1998 film &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot;, a semi-fictional tale of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; director James Whale&#x27;s later years, which won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Barker said of his interest in the project: &quot;Whale was gay, I&#x27;m gay; Whale was English, I&#x27;m English…Whale made some horror movies, and I&#x27;ve made some horror movies. It seemed as if I should be helping to tell this story.&quot; Barker also provided the foreword on the published shooting script.

In 2005, Barker and horror film producer Jorge Saralegui created the film production company Midnight Picture Show with the intent of producing two horror films per year.

In October 2006, Barker announced through his website that he will be writing the script to a forthcoming remake of the original &quot;Hellraiser&quot; film. He was developing a film based on his &quot;Tortured Souls&quot; line of toys from McFarlane Toys. In 2020, Barker regained control of the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; franchise, and served as executive producer on a 2022 reboot film for the streaming service Hulu.

==Television work==
In May 2015, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Clive Barker was developing a television series adaptation of various creepypastas in partnership with Warner Brothers, to be called &quot;Clive Barker&#x27;s Creepypastas&quot;, a feature arc based on &quot;Slender Man&quot; and &quot;Ben Drowned&quot;. Barker was involved in a streaming service film adaptation of &quot;The Books of Blood&quot; in 2020, and is developing a &quot;Nightbreed&quot; television series directed by Michael Dougherty and written by Josh Stolberg for SyFy. In April 2020, HBO was announced to be developing a &quot;Hellraiser&quot; television series that would serve as &quot;an elevated continuation and expansion&quot; of its mythology with Mark Verheiden and Michael Dougherty writing the series and David Gordon Green directing several episodes. Verheiden, Dougherty and Green will also be executive producing the series with Danny McBride, Jody Hill, Brandon James and Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment.

==Visual art==
Barker is a prolific visual artist, often illustrating his own books. His paintings have been seen first on the covers of his official fan club magazine, &quot;Dread&quot;, published by Fantaco in the early &#x27;90s; on the covers of the collections of his plays, &quot;Incarnations&quot; (1995) and &quot;Forms of Heaven&quot; (1996); and on the second printing of the original British publications of his &quot;Books of Blood&quot; series. Barker also provided the artwork for his young adult novel &quot;The Thief of Always&quot; and for the &quot;Abarat&quot; series. His artwork has been exhibited at Bert Green Fine Art in Los Angeles and Chicago, at the Bess Cutler Gallery in New York and La Luz De Jesus in Los Angeles. Many of his sketches and paintings can be found in the collection &quot;Clive Barker, Illustrator&quot;, published in 1990 by Arcane/Eclipse Books, and in &quot;Visions of Heaven and Hell&quot;, published in 2005 by Rizzoli Books.

He worked on the horror video game &quot;Clive Barker&#x27;s Undying&quot;, providing the voice for the character Ambrose. &quot;Undying&quot; was developed by DreamWorks Interactive and released in 2001. He worked on &quot;Clive Barker&#x27;s Jericho&quot; for Codemasters, which was released in late 2007.

Barker created Halloween costume designs for Disguise Costumes.

Around 150 art works by Barker were used in the set of the Academy of the Unseen Arts for the Netflix TV series &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;.

==Comic books==
Barker published his Razorline imprint via Marvel Comics in 1993.

Barker horror adaptations and spin-offs in comics include the Marvel/Epic Comics series &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, &quot;Nightbreed&quot;, &quot;Pinhead&quot;, &quot;The Harrowers&quot;, &quot;Book of the Damned&quot;, and &quot;Jihad&quot;; Eclipse Books&#x27; series and graphic novels &quot;Tapping The Vein&quot;, &quot;Dread&quot;, &quot;Son of Celluloid&quot;, &quot;Revelations&quot;, &quot;The Life of Death&quot;, &quot;Rawhead Rex&quot; and &quot;The Yattering and Jack&quot;, and Dark Horse Comics&#x27; &quot;Primal&quot;, among others. Barker served as a consultant and wrote issues of the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; anthology comic book.

In 2005, IDW published a three-issue adaptation of Barker&#x27;s children&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Thief of Always&quot;, written and painted by Kris Oprisko and Gabriel Hernandez. IDW is publishing a 12 issue adaptation of Barker&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great and Secret Show&quot;.

In December 2007, Chris Ryall and Clive Barker announced an upcoming collaboration of an original comic book series, &quot;Torakator&quot;, to be published by IDW.

In 2008, Barker authored a foreword for the first volume of the &quot;DEMONICSEX&quot; comic series by Chuck Conner and Sean Platter.

In October 2009, IDW published &quot;Seduth&quot;, co-written by Barker. The work was released with three variant covers.

In 2011, Boom! Studios began publishing an original &quot;Hellraiser&quot; comic book series.

In 2013, Boom! Studios announced &quot;Next Testament&quot;, the first original story by Barker to be published in comic book format.

<doc id="7574" wikidata="Q1637212" url="?curid=7574" title="Fantasy comedy">
<text>Fantasy comedy or comic fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy that is primarily humorous in intent and tone. Typically set in imaginary worlds, fantasy comedy often involves puns on, and parodies of, other works of fantasy.

==Literature==
The subgenre rose in the nineteenth century. Elements of fantasy comedy can be found in such nineteenth century works
as some of Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tales, Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Christmas Books&quot;, and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Alice books. The first writer to specialize in the subgenre was &quot;F. Anstey&quot; in novels such as &quot;Vice Versa&quot; (1882), where magic disrupts Victorian society with humorous results. Anstey&#x27;s work was popular enough to inspire several imitations, including E. Nesbit&#x27;s light-hearted children&#x27;s fantasies, &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; (1904) and &quot;The Story of the Amulet&quot; (1906). The United States had several writers of fantasy comedy, including James Branch Cabell, whose satirical fantasy &quot;Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice&quot; (1919) was the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution for obscenity. Another American writer in a similar vein was Thorne Smith, whose works (such as &quot;Topper&quot; and &quot;The Night Life of the Gods&quot;) were popular and influential, and often adapted for film and television. Humorous fantasies narrated in a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s club&quot; setting are common; they include John Kendrick Bangs&#x27; &quot;A Houseboat on the Styx&quot; (1895), Lord Dunsany&#x27;s &quot;Jorkens&quot; stories, and Maurice Richardson&#x27;s 
&quot;The Exploits of Englebrecht&quot; (1950).

According to Lin Carter, T. H. White&#x27;s works exemplify fantasy comedy, L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt&#x27;s Harold Shea stories are early exemplars. The overwhelming bulk of de Camp&#x27;s fantasy was comic. Pratt and de Camp were among several contributors to &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot;, a pulp magazine which emphasized fantasy with a comedic element. The work of Fritz Leiber also appeared in &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot;, including his Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, a jocose take on the sword and sorcery subgenre.

In more modern times, Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; books, Piers Anthony&#x27;s &quot;Xanth&quot; books, Robert Asprin&#x27;s &quot;MythAdventures&quot; of Skeeve and Aahz books, and Tom Holt&#x27;s books provide good examples, as do many of the works by Christopher Moore. There are also comic-strips/graphic novels in the humorous fantasy genre, including Chuck Whelon&#x27;s Pewfell series and the webcomics &quot;8-Bit Theater&quot; and &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot;. Other authors of the genre in modern times include C.K. McDonnell, Jasper Fforde, Neil Gaiman, Robert Rankin, John Brosnan, Craig Shaw Gardner, David Lee Stone and Esther Freisner, as well as countless independent authors.

==Other media==
The subgenre has also been represented in television, such as in the television series &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, &quot;Kröd Mändoon&quot;. Examples on radio are the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Hordes of the Things&quot; and &quot;ElvenQuest&quot;. Fantasy comedy films can either be parodies (&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;), comedies with fantastical elements (&quot;Being John Malkovich, Barbie&quot;) or animated (&quot;Shrek&quot;). It has also been used with fantasy as the primary genre and comedy as the secondary, as in the case of &quot;&quot; and its .

<doc id="7575" wikidata="Q775159" url="?curid=7575" title="CLU (programming language)">
<text>CLU is a programming language created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by Barbara Liskov and her students starting in 1973. While it did not find extensive use, it introduced many features that are used widely now, and is seen as a step in the development of object-oriented programming (OOP).

Key contributions include abstract data types, call-by-sharing, iterators, multiple return values (a form of parallel assignment), type-safe parameterized types, and type-safe variant types. It is also notable for its use of classes with constructors and methods, but without inheritance.

== Clusters ==
The syntax of CLU was based on ALGOL, then the starting point for most new language designs. The key addition was the concept of a &quot;cluster&quot;, CLU&#x27;s type extension system and the root of the language&#x27;s name (CLUster). Clusters correspond generally to the concept of a &quot;class&quot; in an OO language. For instance, here is the CLU syntax for a cluster that implements complex numbers:
 complex_number = cluster is add, subtract, multiply, ...
 rep = record [ real_part: real, imag_part: real ]
 add = proc ... end add;
 subtract = proc ... end subtract;
 multiply = proc ... end multiply;
 end complex_number;
A cluster is a module that encapsulates all of its components except for those explicitly named in the &quot;is&quot; clause. These correspond to the public components of a class in recent OO languages. A cluster also defines a type that can be named outside the cluster (in this case, &quot;complex_number&quot;), but its representation type (rep) is hidden from external clients.

Cluster names are global, and no namespace mechanism was provided to group clusters or allow them to be created &quot;locally&quot; inside other clusters.

In a cluster, the explicit type conversions &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; change between the abstract type and the representation; implicit conversions between these types are signified using the special type &quot;cvt&quot;. CLU does not otherwise perform implicit type conversions. There is a universal type &quot;any&quot;, and a procedure force[] to check that an object is a certain type. Objects may be mutable or immutable, the latter being &quot;base types&quot; such as integers, booleans, characters and strings.

== Other features ==
Another key feature of the CLU type system are &quot;iterators&quot;, which return objects from a collection serially, one after another. Iterators offer an identical application programming interface (API) no matter what data they are being used with. Thus the iterator for a collection of codice_1s can be used interchangeably with that for an array of codice_2s. A distinctive feature of CLU iterators is that they are implemented as coroutines, with each value being provided to the caller via a &quot;yield&quot; statement. Iterators like those in CLU are now a common feature of many modern languages, such as C#, Ruby, and Python, though recently they are often referred to as generators.

CLU also includes exception handling, based on various attempts in other languages; exceptions are raised using codice_3 and handled with codice_4. Unlike most other languages with exception handling, exceptions are not implicitly resignaled up the calling chain. Also unlike most other languages that provide exception handling, exceptions in CLU are considered part of ordinary execution flow and are considered a &quot;normal&quot; and efficient type-safe way to break out of loops or to return from functions; this allows for direct assignment of return values &quot;except when&quot; other conditions apply. Exceptions that are neither caught nor resignaled explicitly are immediately converted into a special failure exception that typically terminates the program.

CLU is often credited as being the first language with type-safe variant types, called &quot;oneofs&quot;, before the language ML had them.

A final distinctive feature in CLU is parallel assignment (multiple assignment), where more than one variable can appear on the left hand side of an assignment operator. For instance, writing codice_5 would exchange values of codice_6 and codice_7. In the same way, functions could return several values, like . Parallel assignment (though not multiple return values) predates CLU, appearing in CPL (1963), named &quot;simultaneous assignment&quot;, but CLU popularized it and is often credited as the direct influence leading to parallel assignment in later languages.

All objects in a CLU program live in the heap, and memory management is automatic.

CLU supports type-parameterized user-defined data abstractions. It was the first language to offer type-safe bounded parameterized types, using &quot;where clauses&quot; to express constraints on actual type arguments. Unlike in languages with template-based generics, a use of such a data abstraction can be type-checked without access to the implementation of the abstraction.

== Influence ==
CLU and Ada were major inspirations for C++ templates.

CLU&#x27;s exception handling mechanisms influenced later languages like C++, Java and many others.

Sather, Python, and C# include iterators, which first appeared in CLU.

Perl and Lua took multiple assignment and multiple returns from function calls from CLU.

Python and Ruby borrowed call by sharing, the &quot;yield&quot; statement, and multiple assignment.

<text>The history of the Soviet Union from 1982 through 1991 spans the period from the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s death until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Due to the years of Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development, and complex systemic problems in the command economy, Soviet output stagnated. Failed attempts at reform, a standstill economy, and the success of the proxies of the United States against the Soviet Union&#x27;s forces in the war in Afghanistan led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the Soviet-occupied Central and Eastern Europe (including the Baltic states).

Greater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, created an atmosphere of open criticism of the communist regime, and also &quot;perestroika&quot;. The dramatic drop of the price of oil in 1985 and 1986 profoundly influenced actions of the Soviet leadership.

Nikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, was succeeded by Nikolai Ryzhkov, and Vasili Kuznetsov, the acting Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, was succeeded by Andrei Gromyko, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Several republics began resisting central control, and increasing democratization led to a weakening of the central government. The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when Boris Yeltsin seized power in the aftermath of a failed coup that had attempted to topple the reform-minded Gorbachev.

==Leadership transition==
By 1982, the stagnation of the Soviet economy was obvious, as evidenced by the fact that the Soviet Union had been importing grain from the U.S. throughout the 1970s, but the system was so firmly entrenched that any real change seemed impossible. A huge rate of defense spending consumed large parts of the economy. The transition period that separated the Brezhnev and Gorbachev eras resembled the former much more than the latter, although hints of reform emerged as early as 1983.

===Andropov interregnum===
Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982. After a two-day power struggle Yuri Andropov became the new General Secretary. He maneuvered his way into power both through his KGB connections and by gaining the support of the military by promising not to cut defense spending. For comparison, some of his rivals such as Konstantin Chernenko were skeptical of a continued high military budget. Aged 68, Andropov was the oldest person ever appointed as General Secretary. Andropov began a thorough house-cleaning throughout the party and state bureaucracy, a decision made easy by the fact that the Central Committee had an average age of 69. He replaced more than one-fifth of the Soviet ministers and regional party first secretaries and more than one-third of the department heads within the Central Committee apparatus. As a result, he replaced the aging leadership with younger, more vigorous administrators. But Andropov&#x27;s ability to reshape the top leadership was constrained by his own age and poor health and the influence of Chernenko, his rival and longtime ally of Brezhnev who had previously supervised personnel matters in the Central Committee.

The transition of power from Brezhnev to Andropov was notably the first one in Soviet history to occur completely peacefully with no one being imprisoned, killed, or forced from office.

====Domestic policies====
Andropov&#x27;s domestic policy leaned heavily towards restoring discipline and order to Soviet society. He eschewed radical political and economic reforms, promoting instead a small degree of candor in politics and mild economic experiments similar to those that had been associated with the late Premier Alexei Kosygin&#x27;s initiatives in the mid-1960s. In tandem with such economic experiments, Andropov launched an anti-corruption drive that reached high into the government and party ranks. Unlike Brezhnev, who possessed several mansions and a fleet of luxury cars, he lived quite simply. While visiting Budapest in early 1983, he expressed interest in Hungary&#x27;s Goulash Communism and that the sheer size of the Soviet economy made strict top-down planning impractical. Changes were needed in a hurry for 1982 had witnessed the country&#x27;s worst economic performance, with real GDP growth at almost zero percent.

====Foreign policies====
Andropov faced a series of foreign policy crises: the hopeless situation of the Soviet army in Afghanistan, threatened revolt in Poland, growing animosity with China, the polarization threat of war in the Middle East, and troubles in Ethiopia and South Africa. The most critical threat was the &quot;Second Cold War&quot; launched by American President Ronald Reagan and a specific attack on rolling back what he denounced as the &quot;Evil Empire&quot;. Reagan was using American economic power, and Soviet economic weakness, to escalate massive spending on the Cold War, emphasizing high technology that Moscow lacked. The main response was raising the military budget to 70 percent of the national budget, and supplying billions of dollars worth of military aid to Syria, Iraq, Libya, South Yemen, the PLO, Cuba, and North Korea. That included tanks and armored troop carriers, hundreds of fighter planes, as well as anti-aircraft systems, artillery systems, and all sorts of high tech equipment for which the USSR was the main supplier for its allies. Andropov&#x27;s main goal was to avoid an open war.

In foreign policy, the conflict in Afghanistan continued even though Andropov—who now felt the invasion was a mistake—half-heartedly explored options for a negotiated withdrawal. Andropov&#x27;s rule was also marked by deterioration of relations with the United States. During a much-publicized &quot;walk in the woods&quot; with Soviet dignitary Yuli Kvitsinsky, American diplomat Paul Nitze suggested a compromise for reducing nuclear missiles in Europe on both sides that was ultimately ignored by the Politburo. Kvitsinsky would later write that, despite his own efforts, the Soviet leadership was not interested in compromise, instead calculating that peace movements in the West would force the Americans to capitulate. On 8 March 1983, during Andropov&#x27;s reign as General Secretary, U.S. President Ronald Reagan famously labeled the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire&quot;. The same month, on 23 March, Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative. Reagan claimed this research program into ballistic missile defense would be &quot;consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty&quot;. However, Andropov was dismissive of this claim, and said that &quot;It is time they [Washington] stopped ... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war. ... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane&quot;.

In August 1983, Andropov announced that the country was stopping all work on space-based weapons. Meanwhile, Soviet–U.S. arms control talks on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe were suspended by the Soviet Union in November 1983 and by the end of the year, the Soviets had broken off all arms control negotiations.
Massive bad publicity worldwide came when Soviet fighters shot down a civilian jet liner, Korean Air Flight KAL-007, which carried 269 passengers and crew. It had strayed over the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 on its scheduled route from Anchorage, Alaska, to Seoul, South Korea. The Soviet system was unprepared to deal with a civilian airliner, and the shooting down was a matter of following orders without question. Instead of admitting an accident, Soviet media proclaimed a brave decision to meet a Western provocation. Together with its low credibility explanation in 1986 of the meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, the episode demonstrated an inability to deal with public relations crises; the propaganda system was only aimed at people who already were committed friends of the Soviet Union. Both crises were escalated by technological and organizational failures, compounded by human error.

US−Soviet relations deteriorated rapidly especially after March 1983, when Reagan dubbed the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire&quot;. The official press agency TASS accused Reagan of &quot;thinking only in terms of confrontation and bellicose, lunatic anti-communism&quot;. Further Soviet outrage was directed at Reagan&#x27;s stationing of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe. In Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua and elsewhere, under the Reagan Doctrine, the US began undermining Soviet-supported governments by supplying arms to anti-communist resistance movements in these countries.

President Reagan&#x27;s decision to deploy medium-range Pershing II missiles in Western Europe met with mass protests in countries such as France and West Germany, sometimes numbering 1 million people at a time. Many Europeans became convinced that the US and not the Soviet Union was the more aggressive country, and there was fear over the prospect of a war, especially since there was a widespread conviction in Europe that the US, being separated from the Red Army by two oceans as opposed to a short land border, was insensitive to the people of Germany and other countries. Moreover, the memory of World War II was still strong and many Germans could not forget the destruction and mass rapes committed by Soviet troops in the closing days of that conflict. This attitude was helped along by the Reagan Administration&#x27;s comments that a war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact would not necessarily result in the use of nuclear weapons.

Andropov&#x27;s health declined rapidly during the tense summer and fall of 1983, and he became the first Soviet leader to miss the anniversary celebrations of the 1917 revolution that November. He died in February 1984 of kidney failure after disappearing from public view for several months. His most significant legacy to the Soviet Union was his discovery and promotion of Mikhail Gorbachev. Beginning in 1978, Gorbachev advanced in two years through the Kremlin hierarchy to full membership in the Politburo. His responsibilities for the appointment of personnel allowed him to make the contacts and distribute the favors necessary for a future bid to become general secretary. At this point, Western experts believed that Andropov was grooming Gorbachev as his successor. However, although Gorbachev acted as a deputy to the general secretary throughout Andropov&#x27;s illness, Gorbachev&#x27;s time had not yet arrived when his patron died early in 1984.

===Chernenko interregnum===
At 73, Konstantin Chernenko was in poor health, suffering from emphysema, and unable to play an active role in policy making when he was chosen, after lengthy discussion, to succeed Andropov. But Chernenko&#x27;s short time in office did bring some significant policy changes. The personnel changes and investigations into corruption undertaken under Andropov&#x27;s tutelage came to an end. Chernenko advocated more investment in consumer goods and services and in agriculture. He also called for a reduction in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union&#x27;s (CPSU) micromanagement of the economy and greater attention to public opinion. However, KGB repression of Soviet dissidents also increased. In February 1983, Soviet representatives withdrew from the World Psychiatric Organization in protest of that group&#x27;s continued complaints about the use of psychiatry to suppress dissent. This policy was underlined in June when Vladimir Danchev, a broadcaster for Radio Moscow, referred to the Soviet troops in Afghanistan as &quot;invaders&quot; while conducting English-language broadcasts. After refusing to retract this statement, he was sent to a mental institution for several months. Valery Senderov, a leader of an unofficial union of professional workers, was sentenced to seven years in a labor camp early in the year for speaking out on discrimination practiced against Jews in education and the professions.

Although Chernenko had called for renewed &quot;détente&quot; with the West, little progress was made towards closing the rift in East−West relations during his rule. The Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, retaliating for the United States-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. In September 1984, the Soviet Union also prevented a visit to West Germany by East German leader Erich Honecker. Fighting in the Afghan Democratic Republic also intensified, but in the late autumn of 1984 the United States and the Soviet Union did agree to resume arms control talks in early 1985.

==Rise of Gorbachev==
In addition to the failing economy, the prolonged war in Afghanistan, often referred to as the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;Vietnam War&quot;, led to increased public dissatisfaction with the Communist regime. Also, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added motive force to Gorbachev&#x27;s glasnost and perestroika reforms, which eventually spiraled out of control and caused the Soviet system to collapse.

== Ousting the old guard ==

After years of stagnation, the &quot;new thinking&quot; of younger Communist apparatchik began to emerge. Following the death of terminally ill Konstantin Chernenko, the Politburo elected Mikhail Gorbachev to the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1985. At 54, Gorbachev was the youngest person since Joseph Stalin to become General Secretary and the country&#x27;s first head of state born a Soviet citizen instead of a subject of the tsar. During his official confirmation on 11 March, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko spoke of how the new Soviet leader had filled in for Chernenko as CC Secretariat, and praised his intelligence and flexible, pragmatic ideas instead of rigid adherence to party ideology. Gorbachev was aided by a lack of serious competition in the Politburo. He immediately began appointing younger men of his generation to important party posts, including Nikolai Ryzhkov, Secretary of Economics, Viktor Cherbrikov, KGB Chief, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze (replacing the 75-year-old Gromyko), Secretary of Defense Industries , and Secretary of Construction Boris Yeltsin. Removed from the Politburo and Secretariat was Grigory Romanov, who had been Gorbachev&#x27;s most significant rival for the position of General Secretary. Gromyko&#x27;s removal as Foreign Minister was the most unexpected change given his decades of unflinching, faithful service compared to the unknown, inexperienced Shevardnadze.

More predictably, the 80-year-old Nikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, was succeeded by Nikolai Ryzhkov, and Vasili Kuznetsov, the acting Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, was succeeded by Andrei Gromyko, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Further down the chain, up to 40% of the first secretaries of the &quot;oblasts&quot; (provinces) were replaced with younger, better educated, and more competent men. The defense establishment was also given a thorough shakeup with the commanders of all 16 military districts replaced along with all theaters of military operation, as well as the three Soviet fleets. Not since World War II had the Soviet military had such a rapid turnover of officers. Sixty-eight-year-old Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov was fully rehabilitated after having fallen from favor in 1983–84 due to his handling of the KAL 007 shootdown and his ideas about improving Soviet strategic and tactical doctrines were made into an official part of defense policy, although some of his other ambitions such as developing the military into a smaller, tighter force based on advanced technology were not considered feasible for the time being. Many, but not all, of the younger army officers appointed during 1985 were proteges of Ogarkov.

Gorbachev got off to an excellent start during his first months in power. He projected an aura of youth and dynamism compared to his aged predecessors and made frequent walks in the streets of the major cities answering questions from ordinary citizens. He became the first leader that spoke with the Soviet people in person. When he made public speeches, he made clear that he was interested in constructive exchanges of ideas instead of merely reciting lengthy platitudes about the excellence of the Soviet system. He also spoke candidly about the slackness and run-down condition of Soviet society in recent years, blaming alcohol abuse, poor workplace discipline, and other factors for these situations. Alcohol was a particular nag of Gorbachev&#x27;s, especially as he himself did not drink, and he made one of his major policy aims curbing the consumption of it.

===Foreign policy===
In terms of foreign policy, the most important one, relations with the United States, remained twitchy through 1985. In October, Gorbachev made his first visit to a non-communist country when he traveled to France and was warmly received. The fashion-conscious French were also captivated by his wife Raisa and political pundits widely believed that the comparatively young Soviet leader would have a PR advantage over President Reagan, who was 20 years his senior.

Reagan and Gorbachev met for the first time in Geneva in November. The three weeks preceding the summit meeting were marked by an unprecedented Soviet media campaign against the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), taking advantage of opposition at home in the US to the program. When it finally took place, the two superpower leaders established a solid rapport that boded well for the future despite Reagan&#x27;s refusal to compromise on abandonment of SDI. A joint communique by both parties stated that they were in agreement that nuclear war could not be won by either side and must never be allowed to happen. It was also agreed that Reagan and Gorbachev would carry out two more summit meetings in 1986–87.

Jimmy Carter had decisively ended the policy of détente, by financially aiding the Mujahideen movement in neighboring Socialist Afghanistan, which served as a pretext for the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan six months later, with the aims of supporting the Afghan government, controlled by the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan. Tensions between the superpowers increased during this time, when Carter placed trade embargoes on the Soviet Union and stated that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was &quot;the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War.&quot;

===Economy===
East-West tensions increased during the first term of US President Ronald Reagan (1981–85), reaching levels not seen since the Cuban Missile Crisis as Reagan increased US military spending to 7% of the GDP. To match the military buildup, the Soviet Union increased its own military spending to 27% of its GDP and froze production of civilian goods at 1980 levels, causing a sharp economic decline in the already failing Soviet economy.

The US financed the training for the Mujahideen warlords such as Jalaluddin Haqqani, Gulbudin Hekmatyar and Burhanuddin Rabbani eventually culminated to the fall of the Soviet satellite the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. While the CIA and MI6 and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China financed the operation along with the Pakistan government against the Soviet Union, eventually the Soviet Union began looking for a withdrawal route and in 1988 the Geneva Accords were signed between Communist-Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan; under the terms Soviet troops were to withdraw. Once the withdrawal was complete the Pakistan ISI continued to support the Mujahideen against the Communist Government and by 1992, the government collapsed. US President Reagan also actively hindered the Soviet Union&#x27;s ability to sell natural gas to Europe whilst simultaneously actively working to keep gas prices low, which kept the price of Soviet oil low and further starved the Soviet Union of foreign capital. This &quot;long-term strategic offensive,&quot; which &quot;contrasts with the essentially reactive and defensive strategy of &quot;containment&quot;, accelerated the fall of the Soviet Union by encouraging it to overextend its economic base. The proposition that special operations by the CIA in Saudi Arabia affected the prices of Soviet oil was refuted by Marshall Goldman—one of the leading experts on the economy of the Soviet Union—in his latest book. He pointed out that the Saudis decreased their production of oil in 1985 (it reached a 16-year low), whereas the peak of oil production was reached in 1980. They increased the production of oil in 1986, reduced it in 1987 with a subsequent increase in 1988, but not to the levels of 1980 when production reached its highest level. The real increase happened in 1990, by which time the Cold War was almost over. In his book he asked why, if Saudi Arabia had such an effect on Soviet oil prices, did prices not fall in 1980 when the production of oil by Saudi Arabia reached its highest level—three times as much oil as in the mid-eighties—and why did the Saudis wait till 1990 to increase their production, five years after the CIA&#x27;s supposed intervention? Why didn&#x27;t the Soviet Union collapse in 1980 then?

By the time Gorbachev ushered in the process that would lead to the dismantling of the Soviet administrative command economy through his programs of &quot;uskoreniye&quot; (speed-up of economic development) and &quot;perestroika&quot; (political and economic restructuring) announced in 1986, the Soviet economy suffered from both hidden inflation and pervasive supply shortages aggravated by an increasingly open black market that undermined the official economy. Additionally, the costs of superpower status—the military, space program, subsidies to client states—were out of proportion to the Soviet economy. The new wave of industrialization based upon information technology had left the Soviet Union desperate for Western technology and credits in order to counter its increasing backwardness.

===Reforms===

The Law on Cooperatives enacted in May 1988 was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the Gorbachev era. For the first time since Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy, the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors. Under this provision, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene.

&quot;Glasnost&quot; resulted in greater freedom of speech and the press becoming far less controlled. Thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were also released. Soviet social science became free to explore and publish on many subjects that had previously been off limits, including conducting public opinion polls. The All−Union Center for Public Opinion Research (VCIOM)—the most prominent of several polling organizations that were started then— was opened. State archives became more accessible, and some social statistics that had been kept secret became open for research and publication on sensitive subjects such as income disparities, crime, suicide, abortion, and infant mortality. The first center for gender studies was opened within a newly formed Institute for the Socio−Economic Study of Human Population.

In January 1987, Gorbachev called for democratization: the infusion of democratic elements such as multi-candidate elections into the Soviet political process. A 1987 conference convened by Soviet economist and Gorbachev adviser Leonid Abalkin, concluded: &quot;Deep transformations in the management of the economy cannot be realized without corresponding changes in the political system.&quot;

In June 1988, at the CPSU&#x27;s Nineteenth Party Conference, Gorbachev launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus. On 1 December 1988, the Supreme Soviet amended the Soviet constitution to allow for the establishment of a Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies as the Soviet Union&#x27;s new supreme legislative body.

Elections to the new Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies were held throughout the USSR in March and April 1989. Gorbachev, as General Secretary of the Communist Party, could be forced to resign at any moment if the communist elite became dissatisfied with him. To proceed with reforms opposed by the majority of the communist party, Gorbachev aimed to consolidate power in a new position, President of the Soviet Union, which was independent from the CPSU and the soviets (councils) and whose holder could be impeached only in case of direct violation of the law. On 15 March 1990, Gorbachev was elected as the first executive president. At the same time, Article 6 of the constitution was changed to deprive the CPSU of a monopoly on political power.

===Unintended consequences===
Gorbachev&#x27;s efforts to streamline the Communist system offered promise, but ultimately proved uncontrollable and resulted in a cascade of events that eventually concluded with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initially intended as tools to bolster the Soviet economy, the policies of &quot;perestroika&quot; and &quot;glasnost&quot; soon led to unintended consequences.

Relaxation under &quot;glasnost&quot; resulted in the Communist Party losing its absolute grip on the media. Before long, and much to the embarrassment of the authorities, the media began to expose severe social and economic problems the Soviet government had long denied and actively concealed. Problems receiving increased attention included poor housing, alcoholism, drug abuse, pollution, outdated Stalin-era factories, and petty to large-scale corruption, all of which the official media had ignored. Media reports also exposed crimes committed by Joseph Stalin and the Soviet regime, such as the gulags, his treaty with Adolf Hitler, and the Great Purges, which had been ignored by the official media. Moreover, the ongoing war in Afghanistan, and the mishandling of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, further damaged the credibility of the Soviet government at a time when dissatisfaction was increasing.

In all, the positive view of Soviet lifelong presented to the public by the official media was rapidly fading, and the negative aspects of life in the Soviet Union were brought into the spotlight. This undermined the faith of the public in the Soviet system and eroded the Communist Party&#x27;s social power base, threatening the identity and integrity of the Soviet Union itself.

Fraying amongst the members of the Warsaw Pact countries and instability of its western allies, first indicated by Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s 1980 rise to leadership of the trade union Solidarity, accelerated, leaving the Soviet Union unable to depend upon its Eastern European satellite states for protection as a buffer zone. By 1989, following his doctrine of &quot;new political thinking&quot;, Gorbachev had repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of its Warsaw Pact allies (&quot;Sinatra Doctrine&quot;). Gradually, each of the Warsaw Pact countries saw their communist governments fall to popular elections and, in the case of Romania, a violent uprising. By 1990, the governments of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, all of which had been imposed after World War II, were brought down as revolutions swept Eastern Europe.

The Soviet Union also began experiencing upheaval as the political consequences of &quot;glasnost&quot; reverberated throughout the country. Despite efforts at containment, the upheaval in Eastern Europe inevitably spread to nationalities within the USSR. In elections to the regional assemblies of the Soviet Union&#x27;s constituent republics, nationalists as well as radical reformers swept the board. As Gorbachev had weakened the system of internal political repression, the ability of the USSR&#x27;s central Moscow government to impose its will on the USSR&#x27;s constituent republics had been largely undermined. Massive peaceful protests in the Baltic republics such as the Baltic Way and the Singing Revolution drew international attention and bolstered independence movements in various other regions.

The rise of nationalism under &quot;freedom of speech&quot; soon re-awakened simmering ethnic tensions in various Soviet republics, further discrediting the ideal of a unified Soviet people. One instance occurred in February 1988, when the government in Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly ethnic Armenian region in the Azerbaijan SSR, passed a resolution calling for unification with the Armenian SSR. Violence against local Azerbaijanis was reported on Soviet television, provoking massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.

Emboldened by the liberalized atmosphere of &quot;glasnost&quot;, public dissatisfaction with economic conditions was much more overt than ever before in the Soviet period. Although &quot;perestroika&quot; was considered bold in the context of Soviet history, Gorbachev&#x27;s attempts at economic reform were not radical enough to restart the country&#x27;s chronically sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms made some inroads in decentralization, but Gorbachev and his team left intact most of the fundamental elements of the Stalinist system, including price controls, inconvertibility of the ruble, exclusion of private property ownership, and the government monopoly over most means of production.

The value of all consumer goods manufactured in 1990 in retail prices was about 459 billion rubles ($2.1 trillion). Nevertheless, the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue. Tax revenues declined as republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The anti−alcohol campaign reduced tax revenues as well, which in 1982 accounted for about 12% of all state revenue. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supplier−producer relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev&#x27;s decentralization caused new production bottlenecks.

==Dissolution of the Soviet Union==

The dissolution of the Soviet Union&#x27; was a process of systematic disintegration, which occurred in the economy, social structure and political structure. It resulted in the abolition of the Soviet Federal Government (&quot;the Union center&quot;) and independence of the USSR&#x27;s republics on 26 December 1991. The process was caused by a weakening of the Soviet government, which led to disintegration and took place from about 19 January 1990 to 26 December 1991. The process was characterized by many of the republics of the Soviet Union declaring their independence and being recognized as sovereign nation-states.

Andrei Grachev, the Deputy Head of the Intelligence Department of the Central Committee, summed up the denouement of the downfall quite cogently:

==Post-Soviet restructuring==

To restructure the Soviet administrative command system and implement a transition to a market economy, Yeltsin&#x27;s shock program was employed within days of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The subsidies to money-losing farms and industries were cut, price controls abolished, and the ruble moved towards convertibility. New opportunities for Yeltsin&#x27;s circle and other entrepreneurs to seize former state property were created, thus restructuring the old state-owned economy within a few months.

After obtaining power, the vast majority of &quot;idealistic&quot; reformers gained huge possessions of state property using their positions in the government and became business oligarchs in a manner that appeared antithetical to an emerging democracy. Existing institutions were conspicuously abandoned prior to the establishment of new legal structures of the market economy such as those governing private property, overseeing financial markets, and enforcing taxation.

Market economists believed that the dismantling of the administrative command system in Russia would raise GDP and living standards by allocating resources more efficiently. They also thought the collapse would create new production possibilities by eliminating central planning, substituting a decentralized market system, eliminating huge macroeconomic and structural distortions through liberalization, and providing incentives through privatization.

Since the USSR&#x27;s collapse, Russia faced many problems that free market proponents in 1992 did not expect. Among other things, 25% of the population lived below the poverty line, life expectancy had fallen, birthrates were low, and the GDP was halved. There was a sharp increase in economic inequality between 1988/1989 and 1993/1995, with the Gini ratio increasing by an average of 9 points for all former socialist countries. These problems led to a series of crises in the 1990s, which nearly led to the election of Yeltsin&#x27;s Communist challenger, Gennady Zyuganov, in the 1996 presidential election. After the turn of the century, the economy of Russia has begun to improve greatly, due to major investments and business development and also due to high prices of natural resources.

==Historiography==

According to Boris N. Mironov, by 2020 Russian scholars had produced over 300 books, 3000 articles, and 20 dissertations trying to explain the collapse. Two approaches were taken. The first is to look at the short term, 1985–1991, emphasizing personalities. external causes and policy mistakes. The second looks at long-term economic, political, cultural, and social structures.

<doc id="7578" wikidata="Q33111" url="?curid=7578" title="Corsican language">
<text>Corsican (, , or , ) is a Romance language consisting of the continuum of the Tuscan Italo-Dalmatian dialects spoken on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, a territory of France, and in the northern regions of the island of Sardinia, an autonomous region of Italy.

Corsica is situated approximately 123.9 km (77.0 miles; 66 nautical miles) off the western coast of Tuscany; and with historical connections, the Corsican language is considered a part of Tuscan varieties, from that part of the Italian peninsula, and thus is closely related to Florentine-based standard Italian.

Under the long-standing influence of Tuscany&#x27;s Pisa, and the historic Republic of Genoa, over Corsica, the Corsican language once filled the role of a vernacular, with Italian functioning as the island&#x27;s official language until France acquired the island from the Republic of Genoa (1768); by 1859, French had replaced Italian as Corsica&#x27;s first language so much so that, by the time of the Liberation of France (1945), nearly every islander had at least a working-knowledge of French. The 20th century saw a vast language shift, with the islanders adapting and changing their communications to the extent that there were no monolingual Corsican-speakers left by the 1960s. By 1995, an estimated 65% of islanders had some degree of proficiency in Corsican, and a minority of around 10% used Corsican as a first language.

== Classification ==

Corsican is classed as a regional language under French law. It is almost universally agreed that Corsican is typologically and traditionally Italo-Romance, but its specific position therein is more controversial. Some scholars argue that Corsican belongs to the Centro-Southern Italian dialects, while others are of the opinion that it is closely related to, or as part of, Italy&#x27;s Tuscan dialect varieties. Italian and the dialects of Corsican (especially Northern Corsican) are in fact very mutually intelligible. Southern Corsican, in spite of the geographical proximity, has as its closest linguistic neighbour not Sardinian (a separate group with which it is not mutually intelligible), but rather the Extreme Southern Italian dialects like Siculo-Calabrian. It has been theorised, on the other hand, that a Sardinian variety, or a variety very similar to Sardo-Romance, might have been originally spoken in Corsica prior to the island&#x27;s Tuscanisation under Pisan and Genoese rule.

The matter is controversial in light of the historical, cultural and particularly strong linguistic bonds that Corsica had traditionally formed with the Italian Mainland from the Middle Ages until the 19th century: in contrast to the neighbouring Sardinia, Corsica&#x27;s installment into a diglossic system with Italian as the island&#x27;s prestige language ran so deep that both Corsican and Italian might be even, and in fact were, perceived as two sociolinguistic levels of a single language. Corsican and Italian traditionally existed on a spectrum, and the dividing lines between them were blurred enough that the locals needed little else but a change of register to communicate in an official setting. &quot;Tuscanising&quot; their tongue, or as the Corsican elites would have once said, &quot;parlà in crusca&quot; (&quot;speaking in &quot;crusca&quot;&quot;, from the name of the Academy dedicated to the standardisation of the Italian language), allowed for a practice not of code-switching, but rather of code-mixing which is quite typical of the Mainland Italian dialects. Italian was perceived as different from Corsican, but not as much as the differences between the two main isoglosses of Northern and Southern Corsican, as spoken by their respective native speakers. When Pasquale Paoli found himself exiled in London, he replied to Samuel Johnson&#x27;s query on the peculiar existence of a &quot;rustic language&quot; very different from Italian that such a language existed only in Sardinia; in fact, the existence of Corsican as the island&#x27;s native vernacular did not take anything away from Paoli&#x27;s claims that Corsica&#x27;s official language was Italian.

Today&#x27;s Corsican is the result of these historical vicissitudes, which have morphed the language to an idiom that bears a strong resemblance to the medieval Tuscan once spoken at the time of Dante and Boccaccio, and still existing in peripheral Tuscany (Lucca, Garfagnana, Elba, Capraia). The correspondence of modern Corsican to ancient Tuscan can be seen from almost any aspect of the language, ranging from the phonetics, morphology, lexicon to the syntax. One of the characteristics of standard Italian is the retention of the -&quot;re&quot; infinitive ending, as in Latin &quot;mittere&quot; &quot;send&quot;; such infinitival ending is lost in Tuscan as well as Corsican, resulting in the outcome &quot;mette&quot; / &quot;metta&quot;, &quot;to put&quot;. Whereas the relative pronoun in Italian for &quot;who&quot; is &quot;chi&quot; and &quot;what&quot; is &quot;che&quot;/&quot;(che) cosa&quot;, it is an uninflected &quot;chì&quot; in Corsican. The only unifying, as well as distinctive, feature which separates the Corsican dialects from the mainland Tuscan ones, with the exception of Amiatino, Pitiglianese, and Capraiese, is the retention of word-final &quot;o&quot;-&quot;u&quot;. For example, the Italian demonstrative pronouns &quot;questo&quot; &quot;this&quot; and &quot;quello&quot; &quot;that&quot; become in Corsican &quot;questu&quot; or &quot;quistu&quot; and &quot;quellu&quot; or &quot;quiddu&quot;: this feature was also typical of the early Italian texts during the Middle Ages.

Even after the acquisition of Corsica by Louis XV, Italian continued to be the island&#x27;s language of education, literature, religion and local affairs. The affluent youth still went to Italy to pursue higher studies. (It has been estimated that Corsican presence in Pisa amounted to a fourth of the University&#x27;s total student body in 1830.) Local civil registers continued to be written in Italian until 1855; it was on 9 May 1859, that Italian was replaced by French as the island&#x27;s official language, although the latter would start to take root among the islanders from 1882 onwards, through the Jules Ferry laws aimed at spreading literacy across the French provinces. Even so, a specifically homegrown Corsican (rather than Italian) literature in Corsica only developed belatedly and, in its earliest phase, there were no autonomous cultural instances; Corsican writers, such as Salvatore Viale, even prided themselves on their affiliation to the broader Italian sphere, considering Corsican &quot;one of the lowest, impure dialects of Italy&quot;.

It was the Italian Fascist aggressive claims to the island in the 20th century, followed by their invasion, that provoked a popular backlash, estranging the native islanders from standard Italian and, if anything, only accelerated their shifting to the French even further. By the Liberation of France, any previously existing link between the two linguistic varieties and with Italy altogether had been severed; any promotion of Corsican, which had been politicized by the local collaborators with the regime, would be met with popular criticism and even suspicion of potentially harboring irredentist sentiments. From then on, Corsican would grow independently of Italian to become, later in the 1970s, a centerpiece of the &quot;Riacquistu&quot; (&quot;reacquisition&quot;) movement for the rediscovery of Corsican culture. Nationalist calls for Corsican to be put on the same footing as French led the French National Assembly, in 1974, to extend the 1951 Deixonne Law, which initially recognized only a few languages (Breton, Basque, Catalan and Occitan), to including Corsican as well, among others, not as a dialect of Italian, but as one of France&#x27;s full-fledged regional languages. (See governmental support.)

== Origins ==

The common relationship between Corsica and central Italy can be traced from as far back as the Etruscans, who asserted their presence on the island in as early as 500 BC. In 40 AD, the natives of Corsica reportedly did not speak Latin. The Roman exile, Seneca the Younger, reported that both coast and interior were occupied by natives whose language he was not able to understand. More specifically, Seneca claimed that the island&#x27;s population was the result of the stratification of different ethnic groups, such as the Greeks, the Ligures (see the Ligurian hypothesis) and the Iberians, whose language had long since stopped being recognizable among the population due to the intermixing of the other two groups. The occupation of the island by the Vandals around the year 469 marked the end of authoritative influence by Latin speakers. (See Medieval Corsica.) If the natives of that time spoke Latin, they must have acquired it during the late empire.

Modern Corsican has been influenced by the languages of the major powers taking an interest in Corsican affairs; earlier by those of the medieval Italian powers, such as the Papal States (828–1077), the Republic of Pisa (1077–1282) and the Republic of Genoa (1282–1768), and finally by France which, since 1859, has promulgated the official Parisian French. The term &quot;gallicised Corsican&quot; refers to the evolution of Corsican starting from about the year 1950, whereas &quot;distanciated Corsican&quot; refers to an idealized variety of Corsican following linguistic purism, by means of removing any French-derived elements.

== Dialects ==
=== Corsica ===
The two most widely spoken forms of the Corsican language are the groups spoken in the Bastia and Corte area (generally throughout the northern half of the island, known as Haute-Corse, &quot;Cismonte&quot; or &quot;Corsica suprana&quot;), and the groups spoken around Sartène and Porto-Vecchio (generally throughout the southern half of the island, known as Corse-du-Sud, &quot;Pumonti&quot; or ). The dialect of Ajaccio has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at Calvi and Bonifacio (Bonifacino) are dialects of the Ligurian language.

This division along the Girolata-Porto Vecchio line was due to the massive immigration from Tuscany which took place in Corsica during the lower Middle Ages: as a result, the northern Corsican dialects became very close to a central Italian dialect like Tuscan, while the southern Corsican varieties could keep the original characteristics of the language which make it much more similar to Sicilian and, only to some extent, Sardinian.

==== Northern Corsican ====
The Northern Corsican macro variety (&quot;Supranacciu&quot;, &quot;Supranu&quot;, &quot;Cismuntincu&quot; or &quot;Cismontano&quot;) is the most widespread on the island and standardised as well, and is spoken in North-West Corsica around the districts of Bastia and Corte. The dialects of Bastia and Cap Corse belong to the Western Tuscan dialects; they being, with the exception of Florentine, the closest to standard Italian. All the dialects presenting, in addition to what has already been stated, the conditional formed in (e.g. &quot;she would love&quot;) are generally considered &quot;Cismontani&quot; dialects, situated north of a line uniting the villages of Piana, Vico, Vizzavona, Ghisoni and Ghisonaccia, and also covering the subgroups from the Cap Corse (which, unlike the rest of the island and similarly to Italian, uses &quot;lu&quot;, &quot;li&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;le&quot; as definite articles), Bastia (besides i &gt; e and a &gt; e, u &gt; o: , , , ; a &gt; o: , , ), Balagna, Niolo and Corte (which retain the general Corsican traits: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ).

==== Transitional area ====
Across the Northern and Southern borders of the line separating the Northern dialects from the Southern ones, there is a transitional area picking up linguistic phenomena associated with either of the two groups, with some local peculiarities. Along the Northern line are the dialects around Piana and Calcatoggio, from Cinarca with Vizzavona (which form the conditional as in the South), and Fiumorbo through Ghisonaccia and Ghisoni, which have the retroflex sound (written &quot;-dd-&quot;) for historical ; along the Southern line, the dialects of Ajaccio (retroflex &quot;-dd-&quot;, realized as -&quot;ghj&quot;-, feminine plurals ending in &quot;i&quot;, some Northern words like &quot;cane&quot; and &quot;accattà&quot; instead of &quot;ghjacaru&quot; and &quot;cumprà&quot;, as well as &quot;ellu&quot;/&quot;ella&quot; and not &quot;eddu&quot;/&quot;edda&quot;; minor variations: &quot;sabbatu&quot; &gt; &quot;sabbitu&quot;, &quot;u li dà&quot; &gt; &quot;ghi lu dà&quot;; final syllables often stressed and truncated: &quot;marinari&quot; &gt; &quot;marinà&quot;, &gt; &quot;panattè&quot;, &quot;castellu&quot; &gt; &quot;castè&quot;, &quot;cuchjari&quot; &gt; &quot;cuchjà&quot;), the Gravona area, Bastelica (which would be classified as Southern, but is also noted for its typical rhotacism: &quot;Basterga&quot;) and Solenzara, which did not preserve the Latin short vowels: &quot;seccu&quot;, &quot;peru&quot;, &quot;rossu&quot;, &quot;croci&quot;, &quot;pozzu&quot;.

==== Southern Corsican ====
The Southern Corsican macro variety (&quot;Suttanacciu&quot;, &quot;Suttanu&quot;, &quot;Pumuntincu&quot; or &quot;Oltramontano&quot;) is the most archaic and conservative group, spoken in the districts of Sartène and Porto-Vecchio. Unlike the Northern varieties and similarly to Sardinian, the group retains the distinction of the Latin short vowels &quot;ĭ&quot; and &quot;ŭ&quot; (e.g. &quot;pilu&quot;, &quot;bucca&quot;). It is also strongly marked by the presence of the voiced retroflex stop, like Sicilian (e.g. &quot;aceddu&quot;, &quot;beddu&quot;, &quot;quiddu&quot;, &quot;ziteddu&quot;, &quot;famidda&quot;), and the conditional mood formed in &quot;-ìa&quot; (e.g. &quot;(idda) amarìa&quot; &quot;she would love&quot;). All the &quot;Oltramontani&quot; dialects are from an area located to the South of Porticcio, Bastelica, Col di Verde and Solenzara. Notable dialects are those from around Taravo (retroflex -&quot;dd&quot;- only for historical : &quot;frateddu&quot;, &quot;suredda&quot;, &quot;beddu&quot;; preservation of the palatal lateral approximant: &quot;piglià&quot;, &quot;famiglia&quot;, &quot;figliolu&quot;, ; does not preserve the Latin short vowels: &quot;seccu&quot;, &quot;peru&quot;, &quot;rossu&quot;, &quot;croci&quot;, &quot;pozzu&quot;), Sartène (preserving the Latin short vowels: &quot;siccu&quot;, &quot;piru&quot;, &quot;russu&quot;, &quot;cruci&quot;, &quot;puzzu&quot;; changing historical &quot;-rn-&quot; to &quot;-rr-&quot;: &quot;forru&quot;, &quot;carri&quot;, &quot;corru&quot;; substituting the stop for the palatal lateral approximant: &quot;piddà&quot;, &quot;famidda&quot;, &quot;fiddolu&quot;, &quot;voddu&quot;; imperfect tense like &quot;cantàvami&quot;, &quot;cantàvani&quot;; masculine plurals ending in &quot;a&quot;: &quot;l&#x27;ochja&quot;, &quot;i poma&quot;; having &quot;eddu/edda/eddi&quot; as personal pronouns), the Alta Rocca (the most conservative area in Corsica, being very close to the varieties spoken in Northern Sardinia), and the Southern region located between the hinterlands of Porto-Vecchio and Bonifacio (masculine singulars always ending in &quot;u&quot;: &quot;fiumu&quot;, &quot;paesu&quot;, &quot;patronu&quot;; masculine plurals always ending in &quot;a&quot;: &quot;i letta&quot;, &quot;i solda&quot;, &quot;i ponta&quot;, &quot;i foca&quot;, &quot;i mura&quot;, &quot;i loca&quot;, &quot;i balcona&quot;; imperfect tense like &quot;cantàiami&quot;, &quot;cantàiani&quot;).

=== Sardinia ===


Some Italo-Romance languages that might have originated from Southern Corsican, but are also heavily influenced by the Sardinian language, are spoken in the neighbouring island of Sardinia.

Gallurese is spoken in the extreme north of the island, including the region of Gallura, while Sassarese is spoken in Sassari and in its neighbourhood, in the northwest of Sardinia. Their geographical position in Sardinia has been theorised to be the result of different migration waves from the already tuscanized Corsicans and the Tuscans, who then proceeded to settle in Sardinia and slowly displace the indigenous Logudorese Sardinian varieties spoken therein (at present, Luras is the only town in the middle of Gallura that has retained the original language).

On the Maddalena archipelago, which was culturally Corsican but had been annexed to the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia a short while before Corsica was ceded by Genoa to France in 1767, the local dialect (called &quot;isulanu&quot; or &quot;maddaleninu&quot;) was brought by fishermen and shepherds from Bonifacio over a long period of immigration in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though influenced by Gallurese, it has maintained the original characteristics of Southern Corsican. In the dialect of &quot;maddalenino&quot;, as it is known in Italian, there are also numerous words of Genoese and Ponzese origin.

Although Gallurese and Sassarese both belong to Italo-Dalmatian, which is a group typologically different from Sardinian, it has long been a subject of debate whether the two should be included as dialects either of Corsican or of Sardinian or, in light of their historical development, even considered languages of their own. It has been argued that all these varieties should be placed in a single category, Southern Romance, but such classification has not garnered universal support among linguists.

On 14 October 1997, Article 2 Item 4 of Law Number 26 of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia granted &quot;the Sassarese and Gallurese dialects&quot; («&quot;al dialetto sassarese e a quello gallurese&quot;») equal legal status with the other languages indigenous to Sardinia. Thus, even though they would technically not be covered by the national law pertaining to the historical linguistic minorities, among which is Sardinian, Sassarese and Gallurese are nonetheless recognized by the Sardinian government on a regional level.
=== Examples of the main Corsican varieties compared with standard Italian and Elba&#x27;s Tuscan dialect ===
== Number of speakers ==
The situation of Corsican with regard to French as the country&#x27;s national language is analogous to that of many other French regions and provinces, which have or used to have a traditional language of their own, even though the islanders&#x27; switch from their local idiom to regional French has happened relatively later and the presence of Corsican, albeit declining, is still strongly felt among the population. In 1980, about 70 percent of the island&#x27;s population &quot;had some command of the Corsican language.&quot; In 1990, out of a total population of about 254,000, the percentage had declined to 50 percent, with 10 percent of the island&#x27;s residents using it as a first language. The language appeared to be in serious decline when the French government reversed its unsupportive stand and initiated some strong measures to save it.

The January 2007 estimated population of Corsica was 281,000, whereas the figure for the March 1999 census, when most of the studies—though not the linguistic survey work referenced in this article—were performed, was about 261,000. Only a fraction of the population at either time spoke Corsican with any fluency.

According to an official survey run on behalf of the Territorial Collectivity of Corsica which took place in April 2013, in Corsica, the Corsican language had a number of speakers between 86,800 and 130,200, out of a total population amounting to 309,693 inhabitants. 28% of the overall population was able to speak Corsican well, while an additional 14% had a capacity to speak it &quot;quite well.&quot; The percentage of those who had a solid oral understanding of the language varies between a minimum of 25 percent in the 25–34 age group and the maximum of 65 percent in the over-65 age group: almost a quarter of the former age group reported that they were not able to understand Corsican, while only a small minority of the older people did not understand it. While 32 percent of the population of Northern Corsica was reported to speak Corsican quite well, this percentage dropped to 22 percent for Southern Corsica. Moreover, 10 percent of the population of Corsica spoke only French, while 62 percent code-switched between French and at least some Corsican. 8 percent of the Corsicans knew how to write correctly in Corsican, while about 60 percent of the population did not know how to write in Corsican. While 90 percent of the population was in favor of a Corsican-French bilingualism, 3 percent would have liked to have only Corsican as the official language in the island, and 7 percent would have preferred French to have this role.

UNESCO classifies Corsican as a &quot;definitely endangered language.&quot; The Corsican language is a key vehicle for Corsican culture, which is notably rich in proverbs and in polyphonic song.

== Governmental support ==

When the French Assembly passed the Deixonne Law in 1951, which made it possible for regional languages to be taught at school, Alsatian, Flemish and Corsican were not included on the ground of being classified as &quot;dialectes allogènes&quot; of German, Dutch and Italian respectively, i.e. dialects of foreign languages and not languages in themselves. Only in 1974 were they too politically recognized as regional languages for their teaching on a voluntary basis.

The 1991 Joxe Statute, in setting up the Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the Corsican Assembly, and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of Corsican. The University of Corsica Pasquale Paoli at Corte, Haute-Corse took a central role in the planning.

At the primary school level Corsican is taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level, but is required at the University of Corsica. It is available through adult education. It can be spoken in court or in the conduct of other government business if the officials concerned speak it. The Cultural Council of the Corsican Assembly advocates for its use, for example, on public signs.

In 2023, in a judgement initiated by local prefect and going in opposite direction of recent trends, usage of the Corsican language in French public offices and the regional parliament was legally banned, the existence of the &quot;Corsican people&quot; was also deemed unconstitutional.

== Literature ==
According to the anthropologist Dumenica Verdoni, writing new literature in modern Corsican, known as the &quot;Riacquistu&quot;, is an integral part of affirming Corsican identity. Some individuals have returned from careers in continental France to write in Corsican, including Dumenicu Togniotti, director of the &quot;Teatru Paisanu&quot;, which produced polyphonic musicals, 1973–1982, followed in 1980 by Michel Raffaelli&#x27;s &quot;Teatru di a Testa Mora&quot;, and Saveriu Valentini&#x27;s &quot;Teatru Cupabbia&quot; in 1984. Modern prose writers include Alanu di Meglio, Ghjacumu Fusina, Lucia Santucci, and Marcu Biancarelli.

There were writers working in Corsican in the 1700s and 1800s.

Ferdinand Gregorovius, a 19th-century traveller and enthusiast of Corsican culture, reported that the preferred form of the literary tradition of his time was the &quot;vocero&quot;, a type of polyphonic ballad originating from funeral obsequies. These laments were similar in form to the chorales of Greek drama except that the leader could improvise. Some performers were noted at this, such as the 1700s Mariola della Piazzole and Clorinda Franseschi. However, the trail of written popular literature of known date in Corsican currently goes no further back than the 17th century. An undated corpus of proverbs from communes may well precede it (see under &quot;External links&quot; below). Corsican has also left a trail of legal documents ending in the late 12th century. At that time the monasteries held considerable land on Corsica and many of the churchmen were notaries.

Between 1200 and 1425 the monastery of Gorgona, which belonged to the Order of Saint Benedict for much of that time and was in the territory of Pisa, acquired about 40 legal papers of various sorts related to Corsica. As the church was replacing Pisan prelates with Corsican ones there, the legal language shows a transition from entirely Latin through partially Latin and partially Corsican to entirely Corsican. The first known surviving document containing some Corsican is a bill of sale from Patrimonio dated to 1220. These documents were moved to Pisa before the monastery closed its doors and were published there. Research into earlier evidence of Corsican is ongoing.

== Alphabet and spelling ==
Corsican is written in the standard Latin script, using 21 of the letters for native words. The letters j, k, w, x, and y are found only in foreign names and French vocabulary. The digraphs and trigraphs &quot;chj&quot;, &quot;ghj&quot;, &quot;sc&quot; and &quot;sg&quot; are also defined as &quot;letters&quot; of the alphabet in its modern scholarly form (compare the presence of &quot;ch&quot; or &quot;ll&quot; in the old Spanish alphabet) and appear respectively after &quot;c&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;s&quot;.

The primary diacritic used is the grave accent, indicating word stress when it is not penultimate. In scholarly contexts, disyllables may be distinguished from diphthongs by use of the diaeresis on the former vowel (as in Italian and distinct from French and English). In older writing, the acute accent is sometimes found on stressed , the circumflex on stressed , indicating respectively () and () phonemes.

Corsican has been regarded as a dialect of Italian historically, similar to the Romance lects developed on the Italian peninsula, and in writing, it also resembles Italian (with the generalised substitution of -&quot;u&quot; for final -&quot;o&quot; and the articles &quot;u&quot; and &quot;a&quot; for &quot;il/lo&quot; and &quot;la&quot; respectively; however, both the dialect of Cap Corse and Gallurese retain the original articles &quot;lu&quot; and &quot;la&quot;). On the other hand, the phonemes of the modern Corsican dialects have undergone complex and sometimes irregular phenomena depending on phonological context, so the pronunciation of the language for foreigners familiar with other Romance languages is not straightforward.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
As in Italian, the grapheme appears in some digraphs and trigraphs in which it does not represent the phonemic vowel. All vowels are pronounced except in a few well-defined instances. is not pronounced between and : &quot;sciarpa&quot; ; or initially in some words: &quot;istu&quot; 

Vowels may be nasalized before (which is assimilated to before or ) and the palatal nasal consonant represented by . The nasal vowels are represented by the vowel plus , or . The combination is a digraph or trigraph indicating the nasalized vowel. The consonant is pronounced in weakened form. The same combination of letters might not be the digraph or trigraph but might be just the non-nasal vowel followed by the consonant at full weight. The speaker must know the difference. Example of nasal: is pronounced and not .

The Northern and central dialects in the vicinity of the Taravo river adopt the Italian seven-vowel system, whereas all the Southern ones around the so-called &quot;archaic zone&quot; with its centre being the town of Sartène (including the Gallurese dialect spoken in Northern Sardinia) resort to a five-vowel system without length differentiation, like Sardinian.

The vowel inventory, or collection of phonemic vowels (and the major allophones), transcribed in IPA symbols, is:

<text>Commodore International Corporation was a home computer and electronics manufacturer with its head office in The Bahamas and its executive office in the United States founded in 1976 by Jack Tramiel and Irving Gould. It was the successor company to Commodore Business Machines (Canada) Ltd., established in 1958 by Tramiel and Manfred Kapp. Commodore International (CI), along with its U.S. subsidiary Commodore Business Machines, Inc. (CBM), was a significant participant in the development of the home computer industry, and at one point in the 1980s was the world&#x27;s largest in the industry.

The company released its first home computer, the Commodore PET, in 1977; it was followed by the VIC-20, the first ever computer to reach one million units of sales. In 1982, the company developed and marketed the world&#x27;s best selling computer, the Commodore 64; its success made Commodore one of the world&#x27;s largest personal computer manufacturers, with sales peaking in the last quarter of 1983 at $ (equivalent to $ in ). However an internal struggle led to co-founder Tramiel quitting, then rivalling Commodore under Atari Corporation joined by a number of other employees. Commodore in 1985 launched the Amiga 1000 personal computer — running on AmigaOS featuring a full color graphical interface and preemptive multitasking — which would initially become a popular platform for computer games and creative software. The company did particularly well in European markets; in West Germany, Commodore machines were ubiquitous as of 1989.

The company&#x27;s position started declining in the late 1980s amid internal conflicts and mismanagement, and while the Amiga line was popular, newer models failed to keep pace against competing IBM PC-compatibles and Apple Macintosh. By 1992, MS-DOS and 16-bit video game consoles offered by Nintendo and Sega had eroded Amiga&#x27;s status as a solid gaming platform. Under co-founding chairman Irving Gould and president Mehdi Ali, Commodore filed for bankruptcy on April 29, 1994 and was soon liquidated, with its assets purchased by German company Escom. The Amiga line was revitalized and continued to be developed by Escom until it too went bankrupt, in July 1996. Commodore&#x27;s computer systems, mainly the C64 and Amiga series, retain a cult following decades after its demise.

Commodore&#x27;s assets have been passed through various companies since then. After Escom&#x27;s demise and liquidation, its core assets were sold to Gateway 2000 while the Commodore brand name was eventually passed to Tulip Computers of the Netherlands, and remains under ownership of a Dutch company today. Gateway 2000 attempted but failed to market a modern Amiga, and eventually sold the copyrights, Amiga trademark and other intellectual properties to Amiga, Inc., while retaining the Commodore patents, which are now under Acer since its acquisition of Gateway. Amiga Corp., a sister company of Cloanto, owns the Amiga properties since 2019. Hyperion Entertainment of Belgium has continued development of AmigaOS (version 4) to this day under license, and have released AmigaOne computers based on PowerPC.

==History==
===Commodore Business Machines (Canada) Ltd. (1954–1976)===
Jack Tramiel and Manfred Kapp met in the early 1950s while both employed by the Ace Typewriter Repair Company in New York City. In 1954, they partnered to sell used and reconditioned typewriters and used their profits to purchase the Singer Typewriter Company. After acquiring a local dealership selling Everest adding machines, Tramiel convinced Everest to give him and Kapp exclusive Canadian rights to its products and established Everest Office Machines in Toronto in 1955.

By 1958, the adding machine business was slowing. Tramiel made a connection with an Everest agent in England who alerted him to a business opportunity to import portable typewriters manufactured by a Czechoslovakian company into Canada. On October 10, 1958, Tramiel and Kapp incorporated Commodore Portable Typewriter, Ltd. in Toronto to sell the imported typewriters. Commodore funded its operations through factoring over its first two years but faced a continual cash crunch. To bolster the company&#x27;s financial condition, Tramiel and Kapp sold a portion of the company to Atlantic Acceptance Corporation, one of Canada&#x27;s largest financing companies, and Atlantic President C. Powell Morgan became the chairman of Commodore. In 1962, the company went public on the Montreal Stock Exchange, under the name of Commodore Business Machines (Canada), Ltd.

With the financial backing of Atlantic Acceptance, Commodore expanded rapidly in the early 1960s. It purchased a factory in West Germany to manufacture its typewriters, began distributing office furniture for a Canadian manufacturer, and sold Pearlsound radio and stereo equipment. In 1965, it purchased the furniture company for which it served as the distributor and moved its headquarters to its facilities on Warden Avenue in the Scarborough district of Toronto. That same year, the company made a deal with a Japanese manufacturer to produce adding machines for Commodore, and purchased the office supply retailer Wilson Stationers to serve as an outlet for its typewriters.

In 1965, Atlantic Acceptance collapsed when it failed to make a routine payment. A subsequent investigation by a royal commission revealed a massive fraud scheme in which the company falsified financial records to acquire loans funneled into a web of subsidiaries where C. Powell Morgan held a personal stake. Morgan then pocketed the money or invested it in several unsuccessful ventures. Commodore was one of the Atlantic subsidiaries directly implicated in this scheme. Despite heavy suspicion, the commission could not find evidence of wrongdoing by Tramiel or Kapp. The scandal left Commodore in a worse financial position as it had borrowed heavily from Atlantic to purchase Wilson, and the loan was called in. Due to the financial scandal, Tramiel could only secure a bridge loan by paying interest well above the prime rate and putting the German factory up as collateral. Tramiel worked with a financier named Irving Gould to extricate himself, who brokered a deal to sell Wilson Stationers to an American company. Commodore now owed Gould money and still did not have sufficient capital to meet its payments, so Tramiel sold 17.9% of the company to Gould in 1966 for $ (equivalent to $ in ). As part of the deal, Gould became the company&#x27;s new chairman.

Tramiel saw some of the first electronic calculators through his Japanese contacts in the late 1960s. He pivoted from adding machines to marketing calculators produced by companies like Casio under the Commodore brand name. In 1969, Commodore began manufacturing its electronic calculators. Commodore soon had a profitable calculator line and was one of the more popular brands in the early 1970s, producing both consumer and scientific/programmable calculators. However, in 1975, Texas Instruments, the leading supplier of calculator parts, entered the market directly and put out a line of machines priced at less than Commodore&#x27;s cost for the parts. Commodore obtained an infusion of cash from Gould, which Tramiel used beginning in 1976 to purchase several second-source chip suppliers, including MOS Technology, Inc., to assure his supply. He agreed to buy MOS, which was having troubles of its own, on the condition that its chip designer Chuck Peddle join Commodore directly as head of engineering.

In 1976, Commodore Business Machines (Canada) Ltd. was dissolved and replaced by the newly formed Bahamanian corporation Commodore International, which became the new parent of the Commodore group of companies.

===Entry into the computer market and success (1977–1984)===
Chuck Peddle convinced Jack Tramiel that calculators were a dead end business and that they should turn their attention to home computers. Peddle packaged his single-board computer design in a metal case, initially with a keyboard using calculator keys, later with a full-travel QWERTY keyboard, monochrome monitor, and tape recorder for program and data storage, to produce the Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor). From PET&#x27;s 1977 debut, Commodore was primarily a computer company.

Commodore had been reorganized the year before into Commodore International, Ltd., moving its financial headquarters to the Bahamas and its operational base to West Chester, Pennsylvania, near the MOS Technology site. The operational headquarters, where research and development of new products occurred, retained the name Commodore Business Machines, Inc. In 1980, Commodore launched production for the European market in Braunschweig, Germany. This site once employed up to 2000 employees, and in February 2017 an exhibition room for about 200 Commodore products was opened here to commemorate its past. 

By 1980, Commodore was one of the three largest microcomputer companies and the largest in the Common Market. The company had lost its early domestic-market sales leadership, however by mid-1981 its US market share was less than 5% and US computer magazines rarely discussed Commodore products. &quot;BYTE&quot; stated &quot;the lack of a marketing strategy by Commodore, as well as its past nonchalant attitude toward the encouragement and development of good software, has hurt its credibility, especially in comparison to the other systems on the market&quot;. Writing for &quot;Programming the PET/CBM&quot;, Raeto Collin West wrote &quot;CBM&#x27;s product manuals are widely recognized to be unhelpful; this is one of the reasons for the existence of this book.&quot;

Commodore re-emphasized the US market with the VIC-20. The PET computer line was used primarily in schools, where its tough all-metal construction and ability to share printers and disk drives on a simple local area network were advantages, but PETs did not compete well in the home setting where graphics and sound were important. This was addressed with the VIC-20 in 1981, which was introduced at a cost of (equivalent to $ in ) and sold in retail stores. Commodore bought aggressive advertisements featuring William Shatner asking consumers, &quot;Why buy just a video game?&quot; The strategy worked, and the VIC-20 became the first computer to ship more than one million units, with 2.5 million units sold over the machine&#x27;s lifetime, which helped Commodore&#x27;s sales in Canadian schools. In promotions aimed at schools and to reduce unsold inventory, PET models labeled &#x27;Teacher&#x27;s PET&#x27; were given away as part of a &quot;buy 2 get 1 free&quot; promotion. As of calendar year 1980, Commodore sales were $40 million, behind Apple Computer and Tandy Corporation in the market.
In 1982, Commodore introduced the Commodore 64 (C64) as the successor to the VIC-20. Due to its chips designed by MOS Technology, the C64 possessed advanced sound and graphics for its time, and is often credited with starting the computer demo scene. Its (equivalent to $ in ) price was high compared to that of the VIC-20 but was much less expensive than any other 64K computer. Early C64 advertisements boasted that &quot;You can&#x27;t buy a better computer at twice the price&quot;, with Australian adverts in the mid-1980s using the slogan &quot;Are you keeping up with the Commodore? Because the Commodore is keeping up with you.&quot;

In 1983, Tramiel decided to focus on market share and cut the price of the VIC-20 and C64 dramatically, starting the home computer war. TI responded by cutting prices on its 1981 TI-99/4A, leading to a price war involving most vendors other than Apple Computer, including Commodore, TI and Atari. Commodore began selling the VIC-20 and C64 through mass-market retailers such as K-Mart, in addition to traditional computer stores. By the end of this conflict, Commodore had shipped around 22 million C64s, making the C64 the best-selling computer, until the Raspberry Pi overtook it in 2019.

At the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show, Commodore lowered the retail price of the C64 to , and stores sold it for as little as . At one point, the company was selling as many computers as the rest of the industry combined. Prices for the VIC-20 and C64 were $50 lower than Atari&#x27;s prices for the 600XL and 800XL. Commodore&#x27;s strategy was to, according to a spokesman, devote 50% of its efforts to the under- market, 30% on the market, and 20% on the over- market. Its vertical integration and Tramiel&#x27;s focus on cost control helped Commodore do well during the price war, with in 1983 sales. Although the company and Tramiel&#x27;s focus on cost cutting over product testing caused hardware defects in the initial C64, some resolved in later iterations. By early 1984, Synapse Software, the largest provider of third-party Atari 8-bit software, received 65% of sales from the Commodore market, and Commodore sold almost three times as many computers as Atari that year.

Despite its focus on the lower end of the market, Commodore&#x27;s computers were also sold in upmarket department stores such as Harrods. The company also attracted several high-profile customers. In 1984, the company&#x27;s British branch became the first manufacturer to receive a royal warrant for computer business systems. NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center was another noted customer, with over 60 Commodore systems processing documentation, tracking equipment and employees, costing jobs, and ensuring the safety of hazardous waste.

===Departure of Tramiel, acquisition of Amiga and competition with Atari (1984–1987)===
By early 1984, Commodore was the most successful home computer company, with more than (equivalent to $ in ) in annual revenue and (equivalent to $ in ) in net income, whilst competitors had large losses. The company&#x27;s revenue of $425 million in the fourth calendar quarter of 1983 more than doubled its revenue of a year earlier. Although &quot;Creative Computing&quot; compared the company to &quot;a well-armed battleship [which] rules the micro waves&quot; and threatened to destroy rivals like Atari and Coleco, Commodore&#x27;s board of directors, affected by the price spiral, decided to exit the company. In January 1984, an internal power struggle resulted after Tramiel resigned due to disagreements with the board chairman, Irving Gould. Gould replaced Tramiel with Marshall F. Smith, a steel executive without a computer or consumer marketing experience. Tramiel&#x27;s departure at the moment of Commodore&#x27;s greatest financial success surprised the industry.
In May 1984, Tramiel founded a new company, Tramel Technology, and hired several Commodore engineers to begin work on a next-generation computer design. That same year, Tramiel discovered Warner Communications wanted to sell Atari, which was rumored to be losing about a day. Interested in Atari&#x27;s overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network for a new computer, he approached Atari and entered negotiations. After several talks with Atari in May and June 1984, Tramiel had secured funding and bought Atari&#x27;s Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July. In July 1984 Tramiel bought the consumer side of Atari Inc. from Warner Communications and released the Atari ST earlier in 1985 for about . As more executives and researchers left Commodore after the announcement to join Tramiel&#x27;s new company Atari Corp., Commodore followed by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets in late July. This was intended, in effect, to bar Tramiel from releasing his new computer. One of Tramiel&#x27;s first acts after forming Atari Corp. was to fire most of Atari&#x27;s remaining staff and to cancel almost all ongoing projects to review their continued viability. In late July to early August, Tramiel representatives discovered the original Amiga contract from the previous fall. Seeing a chance to gain some leverage, Tramiel immediately used the agreement to counter-sue Commodore on August 13.

The remaining Commodore management sought to salvage the company&#x27;s fortunes and plan for the future, and did so by buying a small startup company called Amiga Corporation in August 1984 for ( in cash and $550,000 in common shares). Amiga became a subsidiary of Commodore, called Commodore-Amiga, Inc. During development in 1981, Amiga had exhausted venture capital and needed more financing. Jay Miner and his company had approached their former employer, the Warner-owned Atari, who paid Amiga to continue development work. In return, Atari received the exclusive use of the design as a video game console for one year, after which Atari would have the right to add a keyboard and market it as a complete Amiga computer. The Atari-Amiga contract and engineering logs identify the Atari-Amiga product was designated as the 1850XLD. As Atari was heavily involved with Disney at the time, it was later code-named &quot;Mickey&quot;, and the 256K memory expansion board was codenamed &quot;Minnie&quot;.

Still suffering serious financial problems, Amiga sought more monetary support from investors that entire spring. At around the same time that Tramiel was negotiating with Atari, Amiga entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions ultimately led to Commodore&#x27;s intentions to purchase Amiga outright, which Commodore viewed would cancel any outstanding contracts including Atari Inc.&#x27;s. Tramiel counter-sued on the basis of this interpretation, and sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga and effectively Commodore from producing any resembling technology, to render Commodore&#x27;s new acquisition and the source for its next generation of computers useless. The resulting court case lasted several years.
Commodore introduced a new 32-bit computer design to market in the fall of 1985 named the Amiga 1000 for , first demonstrated at the CES in 1984. An Atari-Commodore rivalry continued throughout the life of the ST and Amiga platforms. While the rivalry was a holdover from the competition between the C64 and Atari 800, the events leading to the launch of the ST and Amiga served to further alienate fans of each computer, who disagreed as to which platform was superior. This was reflected in sales numbers for the two platforms until the release of the Amiga 500 in 1987, which led the Amiga sales to exceed the ST by about 1.5 to 1, despite reaching the market later. However, neither platform captured a significant share of the world computer market, with only the Apple Macintosh surviving the industry-wide shift to Intel-based x86 computers using Microsoft Windows.

Commodore and Atari both sought to compete in the workstation market, with Commodore announcing in 1988 a Transputer-driven system based on the Amiga 2000 in response to the Atari Transputer Workstation. Similarly, a Unix workstation based on the Amiga 2000, featuring the 68020 CPU, was detailed as Atari announced developer shipments of its own 68030-based Unix workstation within a claimed &quot;to or three months&quot;. Atari&#x27;s workstation, the TT030, eventually arrived in 1990 without a version of Unix available, this only eventually becoming available to developers in late 1991. Commodore&#x27;s workstation arrived in 1990 in the form of the Amiga 3000UX.

===Decline and later years (1987–1994)===

Commodore suffered a poor reputation with its dealers and customers, and upon the 1987 introduction of the Amiga 2000, Commodore retreated from its earlier strategy of selling its computers to discount outlets and toy stores and favored authorized dealers. Adam Osborne stated in April 1981 that &quot;the microcomputer industry abounds with horror stories describing the way Commodore treats its dealers and its customers.&quot; Commodore under Tramiel had a reputation for cannibalizing its own products with newer ones; Doug Carlston and others in the industry believed rumors in late 1983 that Commodore would discontinue the C64 despite its success because they disliked the company&#x27;s business practices, including its poor treatment of dealers and introducing new computers incompatible with existing ones. A Boston reseller said, &quot;It&#x27;s too unsettling to be one of their dealers and not know where you stand with them.&quot; After Tramiel&#x27;s departure, another journalist wrote that he &quot;had never been able to establish excellent relations with computer dealers ... computer retailers have accused Commodore of treating them as harshly as if they were suppliers or competitors, and as a result, many have become disenchanted with Commodore and dropped the product line&quot;. Software developers also disliked the company, with one stating that &quot;Dealing with Commodore was like dealing with Attila the Hun.&quot; At the 1987 Comdex, an informal &quot;InfoWorld&quot; survey found that none of the developers present planned to write for Commodore platforms. Commodore&#x27;s software had a poor reputation; &quot;InfoWorld&quot; in 1984, for example, stated that &quot;so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity&quot;.

Tramiel&#x27;s successor, Marshall F. Smith, left the company in 1986, as did his successor Thomas Rattigan in 1987 after a failed boardroom coup. The head of Blue Chip Electronics, a former Commodore employee, described the company as &quot;a well-known revolving door&quot;. Commodore faced the problem when marketing the Amiga of still being seen as the company that made cheap computers like the C64 and VIC. The C64 remained the company&#x27;s cash cow but its technology was aging. By the late 1980s, the personal computer market had become dominated by the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh platforms. Commodore&#x27;s marketing efforts for the Amiga were less successful in breaking the new computer into an established market compared to the success of its 8-bit line. The company put effort into developing and promoting consumer products that would not be in demand for years, such as an Amiga 500-based HTPC called CDTV.
As early as 1986, the mainstream press was predicting Commodore&#x27;s demise, and in 1990 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote of its &quot;abysmal record of customer and technical support in the past&quot;. Nevertheless, as profits and the stock price began to slide, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&#x27;s&quot; Top 100 Businesses Annual continued to list several Commodore executives among the highest-paid in the region and the paper documented the company&#x27;s questionable hiring practices and large bonuses paid to executives amid shareholder discontent.

Commodore failed to update the Amiga to keep pace as the PC platform advanced. CBM continued selling the Amiga 2000 with 7.14 MHz 68000 CPUs, even though the Amiga 3000 with its 25 MHz 68030 was on the market. Apple, by this time, was using the 68040 and had relegated the 68000 to its lowest-end model, the black and white Macintosh Classic. The 68000 was used in the Sega Genesis, one of the leading game consoles of the era, Computers fitted with high-color VGA graphics cards and SoundBlaster (or compatible) sound cards had also caught up with the Amiga&#x27;s performance, and Commodore began to fade from the consumer market.

Although the Amiga was originally conceived as a gaming machine, Commodore had always emphasized the Amiga&#x27;s potential for professional applications, but the Amiga&#x27;s high-performance sound and graphics were irrelevant to MS-DOS-based routine business word-processing and data-processing requirements, and the machine could not successfully compete with computers in a business market that was rapidly undergoing commoditization. Commodore introduced a range of PC compatible systems designed by its German division, and while the Commodore name was better known in the US than some of its competition, the systems&#x27; price and specifications were only average.

Sales of the PC range were strong in Germany, however, seeing Commodore acquire a 28% share of this market segment in 1990, second only to IBM. Things were less rosy in the United States, where Commodore had a 6% share in the market segment as of 1989, down from 26% in 1984. &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27;s Evan McGlinn wrote regarding the firm&#x27;s decline, citing management as the source cause: &quot;the absentee-landlord management style of globe-trotting chairman and chief executive Irving Gould.&quot; With the Amiga only representing less than 20% of the company&#x27;s sales in the 1987 fiscal year, product lines such as PC-compatibles and Commodore&#x27;s 8-bit computers remained important to the company&#x27;s finances even as the Amiga&#x27;s share of total sales increased. In 1989, with the Amiga accounting for 45% of total sales, the PC business showed modest growth to 24% of total sales, and the Commodore 64 and 128 products still generated 31% of the company&#x27;s revenues.

Commodore attempted to develop new chipsets during the early 1990s, first the Advanced Amiga Architecture and later the Hombre. Funding problems meant that they did not materialize as ultimately the company would go bust. In 1992, the Amiga 600 replaced the Amiga 500, which removed the numeric keypad, Zorro expansion slot, and other functionality, but added IDE, PCMCIA, and intended as a cost-reduced design. Designed as the Amiga 300, a non-expandable model to sell for less than the Amiga 500, the 600 became a replacement for the 500 due to the unexpectedly higher cost of manufacture. Productivity developers increasingly moved to PC and Macintosh, while the console wars took over the gaming market. David Pleasance, managing director of Commodore UK, described the Amiga 600 as a &quot;complete and utter screw-up&quot;. In the same year, Commodore released the Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000 computers, which featured an improved graphics chipset, the AGA. The advent of PC games using 3D graphics such as &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; spelled the end of Amiga as a gaming platform.
In 1993, Commodore launched a 32-bit CD-ROM-based game console called the Amiga CD32, described as a &#x27;make or break&#x27; system, according to Pleasance. The Amiga CD32 was not sufficiently profitable to return Commodore to solvency, however this was not a universal opinion at Commodore, with Commodore Germany hardware expert Rainer Benda stating &quot;The CD32 was a year late for Commodore. In other words, here, too, it might have been better to focus on the core business than jump on a console and hope to sell 300,000 or more units quickly to avoid bankruptcy.&quot;

In 1992, all UK servicing and warranty repairs were outsourced to Wang Laboratories, which was replaced by ICL after failing to meet repair demand during the Christmas rush in 1992. Commodore International&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary authorized 3D Microcomputers of Ontario to manufacture IBM PC clones with the Commodore brand in late 1993. Commodore exited the IBM PC clone market entirely during the 1993 fiscal year, citing the low profitability of this market. PC sales had remained relatively stable and, accounting for 37% of revenue from sales in 1993, had grown modestly as declines in both unit sales and revenues were recorded for the Amiga and Commodore 64 product lines.

By 1994, only Commodore&#x27;s operations in Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom were still profitable. Commodore announced voluntary bankruptcy and liquidation on April 29, 1994, causing the board of directors to &quot;authorize the transfer of its assets to trustees for the benefit of its creditors&quot;, according to an official statement. With Commodore International having reported a quarterly loss in the US, hopes were expressed that European divisions might be able to continue trading and even survive the demise of the parent company, with a management buyout considered a possibility. Other possibilities included the sale of profitable parts of the company to other parties, with Philips and Samsung considered &quot;likely choices&quot;. However, no sale was ever completed.

== After Commodore (1994–present) ==

=== Sale to Escom and bankruptcy ===
Commodore&#x27;s former assets went separate ways following liquidation, with none of the descendant companies repeating Commodore&#x27;s early success. Subsidiaries Commodore UK and Commodore B.V. (Netherlands) survived bankruptcy. The UK division filed a buyout proposal to the Supreme Court in the Bahamas and was considered the front runner in the bid due to press exposure at the time; the other initial bidders were Samsung, Philips and Amstrad in mid-1994. Commodore UK and Commodore BV stayed in business by selling old inventory and making computer speakers and other types of computer peripherals, however Commodore BV dissolved in early 1995. Commodore UK withdrew its bid at the start of the auction process after several larger companies, including Gateway Computers and Dell Inc., became interested, primarily for Commodore&#x27;s patents relating to the Amiga. The only companies who entered bids at the end were Dell and Escom; the successful bidder was German PC maker Escom AG on April 22, 1995, beating Dell&#x27;s bid by $6.6 million. Escom paid US$14 million for the assets of Commodore International. Commodore UK went into liquidation on August 30, 1995. 

Escom separated the Commodore and Amiga operations into separate divisions, the latter becoming Amiga Technologies GmbH, and quickly started using the Commodore brand name on a line of PCs sold in Europe while concepting and developing new Amiga computers. They also debuted a brand new logo for Amiga. However, it soon started losing money due to over-expansion, declared bankruptcy on July 15, 1996, and was liquidated. Escom&#x27;s Dutch arm, Escom B.V., survived bankruptcy and went on to purchase the Commodore brand from its bankrupt parent. The company then renamed itself to Commodore B.V. Meanwhile, a deal for Chicago-based VisCorp to purchase Amiga Technologies GmbH fell through, and instead it was acquired by Gateway 2000 in March 1997, taking both the Amiga properties and the Commodore patents.

==== Brand name ====
In September 1997, Dutch computer maker Tulip Computers acquired the Commodore brand name from Commodore B.V. and made a number of Wintel computers under subsidiary Commodore International B.V., although it did not find much success. In July 2004, Tulip announced a new series of products using the Commodore name: fPET, a flash memory-based USB flash drive; mPET, a flash-based MP3 Player and digital recorder; eVIC, a 20 GB music player. Tulip also licensed the Commodore trademark and logo to the producers of the C64 DTV, a single-chip implementation of the Commodore 64 computer with 30 built-in games.

In late 2004, Tulip sold Commodore International B.V. to Yeahronimo Media Ventures (YMV), a digital music software startup providing legal music downloads in the Netherlands, for €22 million, to be paid in instalments over several years until 2010. The sale was completed in March 2005 after months of negotiations; YMV would not become the sole owner until 2010 after buying the remaining shares from Tulip (by then renamed to Nedfield Holding B.V.) which had gone bankrupt. YMV soon renamed itself to Commodore International Corporation (CIC) — its operational office was in the Netherlands but had headquarters in California — and started an operation intended to relaunch the Commodore brand in the video gaming field. The company then launched its Gravel line of products: Gravel in Pocket personal multimedia players equipped with Wi-Fi and the Gravel in Home, hoping the Commodore brand would help them take off, introduced at CeBIT 2007 with a media &quot;entertainment platform&quot; called CommodoreWorld, and also launched gaming PCs running Windows Vista 64-bit. However the company did not find success with these products. On June 24, 2009, CIC in the United States renamed itself to Reunite Investments, Inc., with the Commodore brand retaining under ownership by its subsidiary CIC Europe Holding B.V. (which would later be renamed into C= Holdings B.V.), trading as Commodore Consumer Electronics (CCE).

CIC&#x27;s founder, Ben van Wijhe, bought a Hong Kong-based company called Asiarim. Reunite Investments then sold the brand to Commodore Licensing B.V., a subsidiary of Asiarim, later in 2010. It was sold again on November 7, 2011. This transaction became the basis of a legal dispute between Asiarim — which, even after that date, made commercial use of the Commodore trademark, among others by advertising for sale Commodore-branded computers, and dealing licensing agreements for the trademarks — and the new owners, that was resolved by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on December 16, 2013, in favor of the new owners. Since then the company holding the brand name turned into Polabe Holding N.V., then Net B.V., and is currently named Commodore Corporation B.V.

==== Copyrights and patents ====
Ownership of the remaining assets of Commodore International, including the copyrights and patents, and the Amiga trademarks, passed from bankrupt Escom to Gateway 2000 in 1997. Jim Collas became director of Amiga Technologies and he assembled a new team to work on a new generation of Amiga computers and other products on a new platform, prototyping one called the Amiga MCC and planning a potential tablet computer. However when Jeffrey Weitzen was chosen to become CEO of Gateway, who was not convinced of Collas&#x27;s plans, he informed that Amiga Technologies division will be sold. On the final day of 1999, Gateway sold the copyrights and trademarks of Amiga to Amino, a Washington-based company founded, among others, by former Gateway subcontractors Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss; Amino immediately renamed itself to Amiga, Inc. Gateway retained the patents but gave a license to Amiga, Inc. to use the patents. Gateway itself was acquired by Taiwanese Acer in 2007.

On March 15, 2004, Amiga, Inc. announced that on April 23, 2003, it had transferred its rights over past and future versions of the AmigaOS (but not yet over other intellectual property) to Itec, LLC, later acquired by KMOS, Inc., a Delaware-based company. Shortly afterwards, based on loans and security agreements between Amiga, Inc. and Itec, LLC, the remaining intellectual property assets were transferred from Amiga, Inc. to KMOS, Inc. On March 16, 2005, KMOS, Inc. announced that it had completed all registrations with the State of Delaware to change its corporate name to Amiga, Inc. The Commodore/Amiga copyrights, including all their works up to 1993, were later sold to Cloanto in 2015. A number of legal challenges and lawsuits have involved these companies and Hyperion Entertainment, the Belgian software company that continues development of AmigaOS.

==== Semiconductor subsidiary ====
The Commodore Semiconductor Group (formerly MOS Technology, Inc.), the silicon wafer foundry and integrated circuit manufacturing unit of Commodore International, was bought by its former management in January 1995 and resumed operations under the name GMT Microelectronics, utilizing a troubled facility in Norristown, Pennsylvania that Commodore had closed in 1992. In 2001, the United States Environmental Protection Agency shut the plant down, and GMT ceased operations and was liquidated.

=== Current and recent developments ===
AmigaOS (as well as spin-offs MorphOS and AROS) is still maintained and updated by Hyperion Entertainment. Enthusiasts continue to make software and games for both AmigaOS and the Commodore 64 computer.

The brand was acquired under license in 2010 by two young entrepreneurs to become Commodore USA in Florida, until 2013. On December 26, 2014, two Italian entrepreneurs licensed the brand and founded Commodore Business Machines Ltd. in London, to manufacture smartphones.

<text>Commodore is a senior naval rank used in many navies which is equivalent to brigadier or brigadier general and air commodore. It is superior to a navy captain, but below a rear admiral. It is either regarded as the most junior of the flag officers rank or may not hold the jurisdiction of a flag officer at all depending on the officer&#x27;s appointment. Non-English-speaking nations commonly use the rank of flotilla admiral, counter admiral, or senior captain as an equivalent, although counter admiral may also correspond to &quot;rear admiral lower half&quot; abbreviated as RDML.

Traditionally, &quot;commodore&quot; is the title for any officer assigned to command more than one ship, even temporarily, much as &quot;captain&quot; is the traditional title for the commanding officer of a single ship even if the officer&#x27;s official title in the service is a lower rank. As an official rank, a commodore typically commands a flotilla or squadron of ships as part of a larger task force or naval fleet commanded by an admiral. A commodore&#x27;s ship is typically designated by the flying of a broad pennant, as compared to an admiral&#x27;s flag.

&quot;Commodore&quot; is typically regarded as a one-star rank with a NATO code of OF-6, known in the U.S. as &quot;rear admiral (lower half)&quot;, but whether it is regarded as a flag rank varies among countries.

It is sometimes abbreviated as &quot;Cdre&quot; in British Royal Navy, &quot;CDRE&quot; in the US Navy, &quot;Cmdre&quot; in the Royal Canadian Navy, &quot;COMO&quot; in the Spanish Navy and in some navies speaking the Spanish language, or &quot;CMDE&quot; as used in the Indian Navy and in navies of several other countries.

==Etymology==
The rank of commodore derives from the French &quot;commandeur&quot;, which was the second highest rank in the orders of knighthood, and in military orders the title of the knight in charge of a commandery.

==History==
The Dutch Navy also used the rank of &quot;commandeur&quot; from the end of the 16th century for a variety of temporary positions, until it became a conventional permanent rank in 1955. The Royal Netherlands Air Force has adopted the English spelling of &quot;commodore&quot; for an equivalent rank.

In the Royal Navy, the position was introduced in the 17th century to combat the cost of appointing more admirals—a costly business with a fleet as large as the Royal Navy&#x27;s at that time.

The rank of commodore was at first a position created as a temporary title to be bestowed upon captains who commanded squadrons of more than one vessel. In many navies, the rank of commodore was merely viewed as a senior captain position, whereas other naval services bestowed upon the rank of commodore the prestige of flag officer status.

=== United States ===

In 1899, the substantive rank of commodore was discontinued in the United States Navy, but revived during World War II in both the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard. It was discontinued as a rank in these services during the postwar period, but as an appointment, the title &quot;commodore&quot; was then used to identify senior U.S. Navy captains who commanded squadrons of more than one vessel or functional air wings or air groups that were not part of a carrier air wing or carrier air group. Concurrently, until the early 1980s, U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard captains selected for promotion to the rank of rear admiral (lower half), would wear the same insignia as rear admiral (upper half), i.e., two silver stars for collar insignia or sleeve braid of one wide and one narrow gold stripe, even though they were actually only equivalent to one-star officers and paid at the one-star rate.

To correct this inequity, the rank of commodore as a single-star flag officer was reinstated by both services in the early 1980s. This immediately caused confusion with those senior U.S. Navy captains commanding destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons, functional air wings and air groups, and so on, who held the temporary &quot;title&quot; of commodore while in their major command billet. As a result of this confusion, the services soon renamed the new one-star rank commodore admiral (CADM) within the first six months following the rank&#x27;s reintroduction. However, this was considered an awkward title and the one-star flag rank was renamed a few months later, giving it its current title of rear admiral (lower half), later abbreviated by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard as RDML. The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and NOAA Commissioned Corps, whose rank structures follow the naval pattern, also use this title and abbreviation.

The &quot;title&quot; of commodore continues to be used in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard for those senior captains in command of organizations consisting of groups of ships or submarines organized into squadrons; air wings or air groups of multiple aviation squadrons other than carrier air wings (the latter whose commanders still use the title &quot;CAG&quot;); explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), mine warfare and special warfare (SEAL) groups; Mobile Inshore Underwater Warfare (MIUW) groups; and construction (SeaBee) regiments. Although not flag officers, modern day commodores in the U.S. Navy rate a blue and white command pennant, also known as a broad pennant, that is normally flown at their headquarters facilities ashore or from ships that they are embarked aboard when they are the Senior Officer Present Afloat (SOPA).

===Argentina===
In the Argentine Navy, the position of commodore was created in the late 1990s, and is usually, but not always, issued to senior captains holding rear-admirals&#x27; positions. It is not a rank but a distinction and, as such, can be issued by the chief of staff without congressional approval. Its equivalents are colonel-major in the Army and commodore-major in the Air Force. It is usually—but incorrectly—referred to as &quot;navy commodore&quot;, to avoid confusion with the &quot;air force commodore&quot;, which is equivalent to the navy&#x27;s captain and army&#x27;s colonel. The sleeve lace is identical to that of the Royal Navy, and wears one star on the epaulette.

==Air force ranks==
Commodore, in Spanish &quot;comodoro&quot;, is a rank in the Argentine Air Force. This rank is the equivalent of a colonel in the Argentine Army, and a colonel or group captain in other air forces of the world. The Argentine rank below commodore is the rank of vice-commodore (Spanish &quot;vicecomodoro&quot;) equivalent to a lieutenant-colonel in the Argentine Army, and a lieutenant-colonel or wing commander in other air forces.

Commodore is a rank in the Royal Netherlands Air Force. It is a one-star rank and has essentially the same rank insignia as the British air commodore.

Many air forces use the rank of air commodore. This rank was first used by the Royal Air Force and is now used in many countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Greece, India, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand and Zimbabwe. It is the equivalent rank to the navy rank of &quot;commodore&quot;, and the army ranks of brigadier and brigadier general.

The German air force used the concept of a unit commodore for the commander of a wing, usually in the rank of colonel (OF-5).

==Merchant Service (Merchant Marine) rank and Yacht Club chief directors==

Commodore is also a title held by many captains as recognition of exceptional navigation ability and seagoing seniority in the Merchant Service, and by the directors of a few yacht clubs and boating associations. Commodores &#x27;in command&#x27; as Master aboard Merchant Marine ships wear distinctive rank and cap insignia denoting their honorific high rank position. In a few country the honorific high position of commodore it is indicated with the high rank denomination of senior captain. Traditionally, commodore is the title of the president of a yacht club.

==Convoy commodore==

During wartime, a shipping convoy will have a ranking officer—sometimes an active-duty naval officer, at other times a civilian master or retired naval officer—designated as the &quot;convoy commodore&quot;. This title is not related to the individual″s military rank (if any), but instead is the title of the senior individual responsible for the overall operation of the merchant ships and naval auxiliary ships that make up the convoy. The convoy commodore does not command the convoy″ escort forces (if any), which are commanded by a naval officer who serves as escort commander.

==Civilian use==

===Commodore in Yachting Leadership===
Civilian yacht clubs, yachting associations and fellowships with formal hierarchical structures, began to use the title &quot;commodore&quot; in countries around the world for their presidents in the early twentieth century along with &quot;vice commodore&quot; in the same manner as &quot;vice president,&quot;and &quot;rear-commodore&quot; and &quot;port captain&#x27; or &quot;international bridge member&quot; in the same manner as board members.

Commodores, vice-commodores and rear-commodores are also known as civilian flag officers because they have an epaulettes, regalia and maritime flags with designated symbols and number of stars for their ranks. Many of the clubs that are more than a century old, such as the Los Angeles Yacht Club have formal ceremonies, where commodores from more than 100 surrounding yacht clubs, flag officers of the US Navy and Coast Guard attend a ceremony at the beginning of the year. The ceremony includes a bagpipe entrance, a presentation of the country flag by commissioned officers of the country&#x27;s navy and a cannon shot upon the raising of each individual officer&#x27;s flags on a flag staff, (also known as flagpoles) for each flag officer (commodore, vice commodore, rear commodore) as their term of office officially begins. Sometimes a trumpet fanfare is also include for special occasions like ribbon cutting in 2019 for the 50th Transpacific Yacht Race. Salutes are given to commodores for special ceremonies, including opening days of the racing season.

==Other uses==

The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary also employs variants of the &quot;title&quot; of commodore. Members of the Auxiliary serve in the Coast Guard&#x27;s uniformed auxiliary service and they do not have military rank, but who do wear modified U.S. Coast Guard uniforms and U.S. military-style officer rank insignia to indicate office. Auxiliary members who have been elected or appointed to positions in the highest levels of the organization, similar in nature to active and reserve rear admirals and vice admirals use the term commodore (e.g., district commodore, assistant national commodore, deputy national commodore, national commodore, etc.). These Coast Guard auxiliarists may permanently append the title commodore, sometimes abbreviated COMO, to their names (e.g., Commodore James A. Smith, National Commodore; or COMO Jim Smith, (NACO)).

In the Philippine Coast Guard Auxiliary—PCGA—each of the directors in command of the ten Coast Guard Auxiliary districts are commodores, as well as most of the Deputy National Directors (some may be rear admirals). Commodore is abbreviated to COMMO in the PCGA.

Vanderbilt University&#x27;s intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the &quot;Commodores&quot;, a reference to Cornelius Vanderbilt&#x27;s self-appointed title (he was the master of a large shipping fleet).

In the U.S. Sea Scouting program (which is part of the Boy Scouts of America), all National, Regional, Area, and Council committee chairs are titled as commodore, while senior committee members are addressed as vice commodore. Ship committee chairs do not hold this recognition.

<text>In the field of complex analysis in mathematics, the Cauchy–Riemann equations, named after Augustin Cauchy and Bernhard Riemann, consist of a system of two partial differential equations which form a necessary and sufficient condition for a complex function of a complex variable to be complex differentiable. 

These equations are 

and

where and are real differentiable bivariate functions.

Typically, and are respectively the real and imaginary parts of a complex-valued function of a single complex variable where and are real variables; and are real differentiable functions of the real variables. Then is complex differentiable at a complex point if and only if the partial derivatives of and satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations at that point.

A holomorphic function is a complex function that is differentiable at every point of some open subset of the complex plane formula_1. It has been proved that holomorphic functions are analytic and analytic complex functions are complex-differentiable. In particular, holomorphic functions are infinitely complex-differentiable.

This equivalence between differentiability and analyticity is the starting point of all complex analysis.

== History ==
The Cauchy–Riemann equations first appeared in the work of Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. Later, Leonhard Euler connected this system to the analytic functions. Cauchy then used these equations to construct his theory of functions. Riemann&#x27;s dissertation on the theory of functions appeared in 1851.

== Simple example ==
Suppose that formula_2. The complex-valued function formula_3 is differentiable at any point in the complex plane. 
formula_4
The real part formula_5 and the imaginary part formula_6 are
formula_7
and their partial derivatives are
formula_8

We see that indeed the Cauchy–Riemann equations are satisfied, formula_9 and formula_10.

== Interpretation and reformulation ==
The Cauchy-Riemann equations are one way of looking at the condition for a function to be differentiable in the sense of complex analysis: in other words, they encapsulate the notion of function of a complex variable by means of conventional differential calculus. In the theory there are several other major ways of looking at this notion, and the translation of the condition into other language is often needed.

=== Conformal mappings ===
First, the Cauchy–Riemann equations may be written in complex form
In this form, the equations correspond structurally to the condition that the Jacobian matrix is of the form
formula_11
where formula_12 and formula_13. A matrix of this form is the matrix representation of a complex number. Geometrically, such a matrix is always the composition of a rotation with a scaling, and in particular preserves angles. The Jacobian of a function takes infinitesimal line segments at the intersection of two curves in and rotates them to the corresponding segments in . Consequently, a function satisfying the Cauchy–Riemann equations, with a nonzero derivative, preserves the angle between curves in the plane. That is, the Cauchy–Riemann equations are the conditions for a function to be conformal.

Moreover, because the composition of a conformal transformation with another conformal transformation is also conformal, the composition of a solution of the Cauchy–Riemann equations with a conformal map must itself solve the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Thus the Cauchy–Riemann equations are conformally invariant.

=== Complex differentiability ===
Let
formula_14
where formula_15 and formula_16 are real-valued functions, be a complex-valued function of a complex variable formula_17 where formula_18 and formula_19 are real variables. formula_20 so the function can also be regarded as a function of real variables formula_21 and formula_19. Then, the &quot;complex-derivative&quot; of formula_23 at a point formula_24 is defined by
formula_25
provided this limit exists (that is, the limit exists along every path approaching formula_26, and does not depend on the chosen path).

A fundamental result of complex analysis is that formula_27 is complex differentiable at formula_28 (that is, it has a complex-derivative), if and only if the bivariate real functions formula_29 and formula_30 are differentiable at formula_31 and satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations at this point.

In fact, if the complex derivative exists at formula_32, then it may be computed by taking the limit at formula_32 along the real axis and the imaginary axis, and the two limits must be equal. Along the real axis, the limit is 
formula_34
and along the imaginary axis, the limit is
formula_35

So, the equality of the derivatives implies 
formula_36
which is the complex form of Cauchy–Riemann equations at formula_32.

(Note that if formula_27 is complex differentiable at formula_28, it is also real differentiable and the Jacobian of formula_27 at formula_28 is the complex scalar formula_42, regarded as a real-linear map of formula_43, since the limit formula_44 as formula_45.)

Conversely, if is differentiable at formula_26 (in the real sense) and satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations there, then it is complex-differentiable at this point. Assume that as a function of two real variables and is differentiable at (real differentiable). This is equivalent to the existence of the following linear approximation formula_47where formula_48, formula_49, , and formula_50 as . 

Since formula_51 and formula_52, the above can be re-written as

formula_53formula_54 

Now, if formula_55 is real, formula_56, while if it is imaginary, then formula_57. Therefore, the second term is independent of the path of the limit formula_58 when (and only when) it vanishes identically: formula_59, which is precisely the Cauchy–Riemann equations in the complex form. This proof also shows that, in that case,
formula_60

Note that the hypothesis of real differentiability at the point formula_28 is essential and cannot be dispensed with. For example, the function formula_62, regarded as a complex function with imaginary part identically zero, has both partial derivatives at formula_63, and it moreover satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations at that point, but it is not differentiable in the sense of real functions (of several variables), and so the first condition, that of real differentiability, is not met. Therefore, this function is not complex differentiable.

Some sources state a sufficient condition for the complex differentiability at a point formula_28 as, in addition to the Cauchy–Riemann equations, the partial derivatives of formula_65 and formula_16 be continuous at the point because this continuity condition ensures the existence of the aforementioned linear approximation. Note that it is not a necessary condition for the complex differentiability. For example, the function formula_67 is complex differentiable at 0, but its real and imaginary parts have discontinuous partial derivatives there. Since complex differentiability is usually considered in an open set, where it in fact implies continuity of all partial derivatives (see below), this distinction is often elided in the literature.

=== Independence of the complex conjugate ===
The above proof suggests another interpretation of the Cauchy–Riemann equations. The complex conjugate of formula_68, denoted formula_69, is defined by
formula_70
for real variables &quot;formula_71&quot; and formula_72. Defining the two Wirtinger derivatives asformula_73
the Cauchy–Riemann equations can then be written as a single equation
formula_74
and the complex derivative of &quot;formula_75&quot; in that case is formula_76 In this form, the Cauchy–Riemann equations can be interpreted as the statement that a complex function &quot;formula_75&quot; of a complex variable &quot;formula_78&quot; is independent of the variable formula_69. As such, we can view analytic functions as true functions of &quot;one&quot; complex variable (&quot;formula_78&quot;) instead of complex functions of &quot;two&quot; real variables (&quot;formula_21&quot; and &quot;formula_82&quot;).

=== Physical interpretation ===

A standard physical interpretation of the Cauchy–Riemann equations going back to Riemann&#x27;s work on function theory is that &quot;u&quot; represents a velocity potential of an incompressible steady fluid flow in the plane, and &quot;v&quot; is its stream function. Suppose that the pair of (twice continuously differentiable) functions &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations. We will take &quot;u&quot; to be a velocity potential, meaning that we imagine a flow of fluid in the plane such that the velocity vector of the fluid at each point of the plane is equal to the gradient of &quot;u&quot;, defined by
formula_83

By differentiating the Cauchy–Riemann equations for the functions &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, with the symmetry of second derivatives, one shows that &quot;u&quot; solves Laplace&#x27;s equation:
formula_84
That is, &quot;u&quot; is a harmonic function. This means that the divergence of the gradient is zero, and so the fluid is incompressible.

The function &quot;v&quot; also satisfies the Laplace equation, by a similar analysis. Also, the Cauchy–Riemann equations imply that the dot product formula_85 (formula_86), i.e., the direction of the maximum slope of &quot;u&quot; and that of &quot;v&quot; are orthogonal to each other. This implies that the gradient of &quot;u&quot; must point along the formula_87 curves; so these are the streamlines of the flow. The formula_88 curves are the equipotential curves of the flow.

A holomorphic function can therefore be visualized by plotting the two families of level curves formula_89 and formula_90. Near points where the gradient of &quot;u&quot; (or, equivalently, &quot;v&quot;) is not zero, these families form an orthogonal family of curves. At the points where formula_91, the stationary points of the flow, the equipotential curves of formula_89 intersect. The streamlines also intersect at the same point, bisecting the angles formed by the equipotential curves.

=== Harmonic vector field ===
Another interpretation of the Cauchy–Riemann equations can be found in Pólya &amp; Szegő. Suppose that &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations in an open subset of R2, and consider the vector field
formula_93
regarded as a (real) two-component vector. Then the second Cauchy–Riemann equation () asserts that formula_94 is irrotational (its curl is 0):
formula_95

The first Cauchy–Riemann equation () asserts that the vector field is solenoidal (or divergence-free):
formula_96

Owing respectively to Green&#x27;s theorem and the divergence theorem, such a field is necessarily a conservative one, and it is free from sources or sinks, having net flux equal to zero through any open domain without holes. (These two observations combine as real and imaginary parts in Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem.) In fluid dynamics, such a vector field is a potential flow. In magnetostatics, such vector fields model static magnetic fields on a region of the plane containing no current. In electrostatics, they model static electric fields in a region of the plane containing no electric charge.

This interpretation can equivalently be restated in the language of differential forms. The pair &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations if and only if the one-form formula_97 is both closed and coclosed (a harmonic differential form).

=== Preservation of complex structure ===
Another formulation of the Cauchy–Riemann equations involves the complex structure in the plane, given by
formula_98
This is a complex structure in the sense that the square of &quot;J&quot; is the negative of the 2×2 identity matrix: formula_99. As above, if &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) and &quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) are two functions in the plane, put

formula_100

The Jacobian matrix of &quot;f&quot; is the matrix of partial derivatives
formula_101

Then the pair of functions &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot; satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations if and only if the 2×2 matrix &quot;Df&quot; commutes with &quot;J&quot;.

This interpretation is useful in symplectic geometry, where it is the starting point for the study of pseudoholomorphic curves.

=== Other representations ===
Other representations of the Cauchy–Riemann equations occasionally arise in other coordinate systems. If () and () hold for a differentiable pair of functions &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, then so do
formula_102

for any coordinate system such that the pair formula_103 is orthonormal and positively oriented. As a consequence, in particular, in the system of coordinates given by the polar representation formula_104, the equations then take the form
formula_105

Combining these into one equation for gives
formula_106

The inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equations consist of the two equations for a pair of unknown functions and of two real variables
formula_107

for some given functions and defined in an open subset of R2. These equations are usually combined into a single equation
formula_108
where &quot;f&quot; = &quot;u&quot; + i&quot;v&quot; and &quot;𝜑&quot; = (&quot;α&quot; + i&quot;β&quot;)/2.

If &quot;𝜑&quot; is &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;, then the inhomogeneous equation is explicitly solvable in any bounded domain &quot;D&quot;, provided &quot;𝜑&quot; is continuous on the closure of &quot;D&quot;. Indeed, by the Cauchy integral formula,
formula_109
for all &quot;ζ&quot; ∈ &quot;D&quot;.

==Generalizations==
=== Goursat&#x27;s theorem and its generalizations ===
Suppose that is a complex-valued function which is differentiable as a function formula_110. Then Goursat&#x27;s theorem asserts that &quot;f&quot; is analytic in an open complex domain Ω if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation in the domain. In particular, continuous differentiability of &quot;f&quot; need not be assumed.

The hypotheses of Goursat&#x27;s theorem can be weakened significantly. If is continuous in an open set Ω and the partial derivatives of &quot;f&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; exist in Ω, and satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations throughout Ω, then &quot;f&quot; is holomorphic (and thus analytic). This result is the Looman–Menchoff theorem.

The hypothesis that &quot;f&quot; obey the Cauchy–Riemann equations throughout the domain Ω is essential. It is possible to construct a continuous function satisfying the Cauchy–Riemann equations at a point, but which is not analytic at the point (e.g., . Similarly, some additional assumption is needed besides the Cauchy–Riemann equations (such as continuity), as the following example illustrates

formula_111

which satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations everywhere, but fails to be continuous at &quot;z&quot; = 0.

Nevertheless, if a function satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations in an open set in a weak sense, then the function is analytic. More precisely:
: If is locally integrable in an open domain formula_112 and satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations weakly, then agrees almost everywhere with an analytic function in .

This is in fact a special case of a more general result on the regularity of solutions of hypoelliptic partial differential equations.

===Several variables===
There are Cauchy–Riemann equations, appropriately generalized, in the theory of several complex variables. They form a significant overdetermined system of PDEs. This is done using a straightforward generalization of the Wirtinger derivative, where the function in question is required to have the (partial) Wirtinger derivative with respect to each complex variable vanish.

===Complex differential forms===
As often formulated, the &quot;d-bar operator&quot;
formula_113
annihilates holomorphic functions. This generalizes most directly the formulation
formula_114
where
formula_115

=== Bäcklund transform ===
Viewed as conjugate harmonic functions, the Cauchy–Riemann equations are a simple example of a Bäcklund transform. More complicated, generally non-linear Bäcklund transforms, such as in the sine-Gordon equation, are of great interest in the theory of solitons and integrable systems.

=== Definition in Clifford algebra ===
In the Clifford algebra formula_116, the complex number formula_117 is represented as formula_118 where formula_119, (formula_120, so formula_121). The Dirac operator in this Clifford algebra is defined as formula_122. The function formula_123 is considered analytic if and only if formula_124, which can be calculated in the following way:

formula_125

Grouping by formula_126 and formula_127:

formula_128

Hence, in traditional notation:

formula_129

=== Conformal mappings in higher dimensions ===
Let Ω be an open set in the Euclidean space formula_130. The equation for an orientation-preserving mapping formula_131 to be a conformal mapping (that is, angle-preserving) is that
formula_132

where &quot;Df&quot; is the Jacobian matrix, with transpose formula_133, and &quot;I&quot; denotes the identity matrix. For , this system is equivalent to the standard Cauchy–Riemann equations of complex variables, and the solutions are holomorphic functions. In dimension , this is still sometimes called the Cauchy–Riemann system, and Liouville&#x27;s theorem implies, under suitable smoothness assumptions, that any such mapping is a Möbius transformation.

=== Lie pseudogroups ===
One might seek to generalize the Cauchy-Riemann equations instead by asking more generally when are the solutions of a system of PDEs closed under composition. The theory of Lie Pseudogroups addresses these kinds of questions.

<text>Chaim Topol (; 9 September 1935 – 8 March 2023), mononymously known as Topol, was an Israeli actor and singer. He is best known for his portrayal of Tevye, the lead role in the stage musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and the 1971 film adaptation, performing this role more than 3,500 times from 1967 through 2009.

Topol began acting during his Israeli army service as a member of the Nahal entertainment troupe. He later toured Israel with kibbutz theatre and satirical theatre companies. He was a co-founder of the Haifa Theatre. His breakthrough film role came in 1964 as the title character in &quot;Sallah Shabati&quot;, by Israeli writer Ephraim Kishon, for which he won a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer—Male. Topol went on to appear in more than 30 films in Israel and the United States, including &quot;Galileo&quot; (1975), &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980), and &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981). He was described as Israel&#x27;s only internationally recognized entertainer from the 1960s through the 1980s. He won a Golden Globe for Best Actor and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his 1971 film portrayal of Tevye, and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor for a 1991 Broadway revival of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

Topol was a founder of Variety Israel, an organization serving children with special needs, and Jordan River Village, a year-round camp for Arab and Jewish children with life-threatening illnesses, for which he served as chairman of the board. In 2015 he was awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement.

==Biography==
Chaim Topol was born on September 9, 1935, in Tel Aviv, in what was then Mandatory Palestine. His father Jacob Topol was born in Russia and in the early 1930s immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, where he worked as a plasterer; he also served in the Haganah paramilitary organization. His mother Imrela &quot;Rel&quot; (née Goldman) Topol was a seamstress.

Topol&#x27;s parents had been members of the Betar Zionist youth movement in Warsaw. His father had Hasidic roots, with a mother coming from a family of Gerrer Hasidim and a father from Aleksander Hasidim.

Topol and his two younger sisters grew up in the South Tel Aviv working-class neighborhood of Florentin. As a young child, although he wanted to become a commercial artist, his elementary school teacher, the writer Yemima Avidar-Tchernovitz, saw a theatrical side to him, and encouraged him to act in school plays and read stories to the class.

At age 14 he began working as a printer at &quot;Davar&quot; newspaper while pursuing his high school studies at night. He graduated at age 17 and moved to Kibbutz Geva. A year later, he enlisted in the Israeli army and became a member of the Nahal entertainment troupe, singing and acting in traveling shows. He rose in rank to troupe commander.

Twenty-three days after being discharged from military service on October 2, 1956, and two days after marrying Galia Finkelstein, a fellow Nahal troupe member, Topol was called up for reserve duty in the Sinai Campaign. He performed for soldiers stationed in the desert.

After the war, he and his wife settled in Kibbutz Mishmar David, where Topol worked as a garage mechanic. Topol assembled a kibbutz theatre company made up of friends from his Nahal troupe; the group toured four days a week, worked on their respective kibbutzim for two days a week, and had one day off. The theatre company was in existence from early 1957 to the mid-1960s. Topol both sang and acted with the group, doing both &quot;loudly&quot;.

Topol and his wife Galia Finkelstein had three children: a son and two daughters. The couple resided in Galia&#x27;s childhood home in Tel Aviv. Topol&#x27;s hobbies included sketching and sculpting.

In June 2022, Topol&#x27;s son, Omer, revealed that his father was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

On March 8, 2023, Topol&#x27;s family notified the press that he was near death and &quot;living his final hours&quot;, and asked the public to respect the family&#x27;s privacy. He died overnight at the age of 87. The day before his burial at Kvutzat Shiller on March 10, a memorial was held at the Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv.

==Singing and acting career==
Between 1960 and 1964, Topol performed with the Batzal Yarok (&quot;Green Onion&quot;) satirical theatre company, which also toured Israel. Other members of the group included Uri Zohar, Nechama Hendel, Zaharira Harifai, Arik Einstein, and Oded Kotler. In 1960, Topol co-founded the Haifa Municipal Theatre with Yosef Milo, serving as assistant to the director and acting in plays by Shakespeare, Ionesco, and Brecht. In 1965 he performed in the Cameri Theatre in Tel Aviv.
Topol&#x27;s first film appearance was in the 1961 film &quot;I Like Mike&quot;, followed by the 1963 Israeli film &quot;El Dorado&quot;. His breakthrough role came as the lead character in the 1964 film &quot;Sallah Shabati&quot;. Adapted for the screen by Ephraim Kishon from his original play, the social satire depicts the hardships of a Sephardic immigrant family in the rough conditions of ma&#x27;abarot, immigrant absorption camps in Israel in the 1950s, satirizing &quot;just about every pillar of Israeli society: the Ashkenazi establishment, the pedantic bureaucracy, corrupt political parties, rigid kibbutz ideologues and ... the Jewish National Fund&#x27;s tree-planting program&quot;. Topol, who was 29 during the filming, was familiar playing the role of the family patriarch, having performed skits from the play with his Nahal entertainment troupe during his army years. He contributed his ideas to the part, playing the character as a more universal Mizrahi Jew instead of specifically a Yemenite, Iraqi, or Moroccan Jew, and asking Kishon to change the character&#x27;s first name from Saadia (a recognizably Yemenite name) to Sallah (a more general Mizrahi name).

The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Topol won the 1964 Golden Gate Award for Best Actor at the San Francisco International Film Festival and the 1965 Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer—Male, alongside Harve Presnell and George Segal. &quot;Sallah Shabati&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, losing to the Italian-language &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot;.

In 1966, Topol made his English-language film debut as Abou Ibn Kaqden in the Mickey Marcus biopic &quot;Cast a Giant Shadow&quot;.

===Tevye the Dairyman===
Topol came to greatest prominence in his portrayal of Tevye the Dairyman on stage and screen. He first played the lead role in the Israeli production of the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; in 1966, replacing Shmuel Rodensky for 10 weeks when Rodensky fell ill. Harold Prince, producer of the original &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; that opened on Broadway in 1964, had seen Topol in &quot;Sallah Shabati&quot; and called him to audition for the role of the fifty-something Tevye in a new production scheduled to open at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London on February 16, 1967. Not yet fluent in English, Topol memorized the score from listening to the original Broadway cast album and practiced the lyrics with a British native.

When Topol arrived at the audition, Prince was surprised that this 30-year-old man had played Shabati, a character in his sixties. Topol explained, &quot;A good actor can play an old man, a sad face, a happy man. Makeup is not an obstacle&quot;. Topol also surprised the producers with his familiarity with the staging, since he had already acted in the Israeli production, and was hired. He spent six months in London learning his part phonetically with vocal coach Cicely Berry. Jerome Robbins, director and choreographer of the 1964 Broadway show who came over to direct the London production, &quot;re-directed&quot; the character of Tevye for Topol and helped the actor deliver a less caricatured performance. Topol&#x27;s performance received positive reviews.

A few months after the opening, Topol was called up for reserve duty in the Six-Day War and returned to Israel. He was assigned to an army entertainment troupe on the Golan Heights. Afterward he returned to the London production, appearing in a total of 430 performances.

It was during the London run that he began being known by his last name only, as the English producers were unable to pronounce the voiceless uvular fricative consonant Ḥet at the beginning of his first name, Chaim, instead calling him &quot;Shame&quot;.
In casting the 1971 film version of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, director Norman Jewison and his production team sought an actor other than Zero Mostel for the lead role. This decision was a controversial one, as Mostel had made the role famous in the long-running Broadway musical and wanted to star in the film. But Jewison and his team felt Mostel would eclipse the character with his larger-than-life personality. Jewison flew to London in February 1968 to see Topol perform as Tevye during his last week with the London production, and chose him over Danny Kaye, Herschel Bernardi, Rod Steiger, Danny Thomas, Walter Matthau, Richard Burton, and Frank Sinatra, who had also expressed interest in the part.

Then 36 years old, Topol was made to look 20 years older and heavier with makeup and costuming. As in his role as Shabati, Topol used the technique of &quot;locking his muscles&quot; to convincingly play an older character. He later explained:

As a young man, I had to make sure that I didn&#x27;t break the illusion for the audience. You have to tame yourself. I&#x27;m now someone who is supposed to be 50, 60 years old. I cannot jump. I cannot suddenly be young. You produce a certain sound [in your voice] that is not young.

For his performance, Topol won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, the Sant Jordi Award for Best Performance in a Foreign Film, and the 1972 David di Donatello for Best Foreign Actor, sharing the latter with Elizabeth Taylor. He was also nominated for the 1971 Academy Award for Best Actor, losing to Gene Hackman in &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

In 1983 Topol reprised the role of Tevye in a revival of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; on the West End in London. In 1989, he played the role in a 30-city U.S. touring production. As he was by then the approximate age of the character, he commented, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have to spend the energy playing the age&quot;. In 1990–1991, he again starred as Tevye in a Broadway revival of &quot;Fiddler&quot; at the Gershwin Theatre. In that production Rosalind Harris, who had played eldest daughter Tzeitel in the film, played Tevye&#x27;s wife Golde opposite Topol. In 1991, he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical, losing to Jonathan Pryce in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;. Topol again played Tevye in a 1994 London revival, which became a touring production. In that production, the role of one of his daughters was played by his daughter, Adi Topol Margalith.

Topol reprised the role of Tevye for a 1997–1998 touring production in Israel, as well as a 1998 show at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne. In September 2005 he returned to Australia for a &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; revival at the Capitol Theatre in Sydney, followed by an April 2006 production at the Lyric Theatre in Brisbane, and a June 2006 production at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Melbourne. In May 2007, he starred in a production at the Auckland Civic Theatre.

In 2009, Topol began a farewell tour of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; as Tevye, opening in Wilmington, Delaware. He was forced to withdraw from the tour in Boston owing to a shoulder injury, and was replaced by Theodore Bikel and Harvey Fierstein, both of whom had portrayed Tevye on Broadway. Topol estimated that he performed the role more than 3,500 times.

In 2014, he appeared in &quot;Raising the Roof&quot;, a 50th-anniversary tribute to &quot;Fiddler&quot; at New York City&#x27;s Town Hall produced by National Yiddish Theatre. The evening featured Chita Rivera, Joshua Bell, Sheldon Harnick, Andrea Martin, Jerry Zaks, and more, and was co-directed by Gary John La Rosa and Erik Liberman.

===Other stage and film roles===
In 1976, Topol played the lead role of the baker, Amiable, in the new musical &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Wife&quot;, but was fired after eight months by producer David Merrick. In her autobiography, Patti LuPone, his co-star in the production, claimed that Topol had behaved unprofessionally on stage and had a strained relationship with her off-stage. The show&#x27;s composer, Stephen Schwartz, claimed that Topol&#x27;s behavior greatly disturbed the cast and directors and resulted in the production not reaching Broadway as planned. In 1988, Topol starred in the title role in &quot;Ziegfeld&quot; at the London Palladium. He returned to the London stage in 2008 in the role of Honoré, played by Maurice Chevalier in the 1958 film &quot;Gigi&quot;.

Topol appeared in more than 30 films in Israel and abroad. Among his notable English-language appearances are the title role in &quot;Galileo&quot; (1975), Dr. Hans Zarkov in &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980), and Milos Columbo in the James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981). He was said to be Israel&#x27;s &quot;only internationally-recognized entertainer&quot; from the 1960s through to the 1980s.

In Israel, Topol acted in and produced dozens of films and television series. As a voice artist, he dubbed the voice of Bagheera in the Hebrew-language versions of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and the 2003 sequel as well as Rubeus Hagrid in the first two films of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. He was also a playwright and screenwriter.
Topol was featured on two BBC One programmes , the six-part series &quot;Topol&#x27;s Israel&quot; (1985) and earlier &quot;It&#x27;s Topol&quot; (1968). A Hebrew-language documentary of his life, &quot;Chaim Topol – Life as a Film&quot;, aired on Israel&#x27;s Channel 1 in 2011, featuring interviews with his longtime actor friends in Israel and abroad.

===Musical recordings===
A baritone, Topol recorded several singles and albums, including film soundtracks, children&#x27;s songs, and Israeli war songs. His albums include &quot;Topol With Roger Webb And His Orchestra - Topol &#x27;68&quot; (1967), &quot;Topol Sings Israeli Freedom Songs&quot; (1967), &quot;War Songs By Topol&quot; (1968), and &quot;Topol&#x27;s Israel&quot; (1984). He appeared on the soundtrack album for the film production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1971) and the London cast album (1967).

==Mossad missions==
After Topol&#x27;s death, the family revealed that he had been involved in Mossad missions in the 1960s and 1970s. They said he went on unexplained trips abroad while equipped with a miniature state-of-the-art camera and tape recorder, and that he was in regular contact with Mossad officer Peter Malkin, who came on visits to the family home through the backyard in disguise. On several occasions, Topol carried out wiretapping and other operations with Malkin, using his international acclaim to divert attention from Malkin.

==Literary and art career==
His autobiography, &quot;Topol by Topol&quot;, was published in London by Weindenfel and Nicholson (1981). He also authored &quot;To Life!&quot; (1994) and &quot;Topol&#x27;s Treasury of Jewish Humor, Wit and Wisdom&quot; (1995).

Topol illustrated approximately 25 books in both Hebrew and English. He also produced drawings of Israeli national figures. His sketches of Israeli presidents were reproduced in a 2013 stamp series issued by the Israel Philatelic Federation, as was his self-portrait as Tevye for 2014 commemorative stamp marking the 50th anniversary of the Broadway debut of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
In 1967, Topol founded Variety Israel, an organization serving children with special needs. He was also a co-founder and chairman of the board of Jordan River Village, a vacation village for Arab and Jewish children with life-threatening illnesses, which opened in 2012. It was inspired by Paul Newman&#x27;s Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. The village is operated almost entirely by volunteers. Topol described it as the project he was &quot;most connected to.&quot;

==Awards and recognition==
Topol was a recipient of Israel&#x27;s Kinor David award in arts and entertainment in 1964. He received a Best Actor award from the San Sebastián International Film Festival for his performance in the 1972 film &quot;Follow Me!&quot; In 2008, he was named an Outstanding Member of the Israel Festival for his contribution to Israeli culture.

In 2014, the University of Haifa conferred upon Topol an honorary degree in recognition of his 50 years of activity in Israel&#x27;s cultural and public life. In 2015, he received the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement.

In 2015, Chaim Topol was honoured by the Chief Rabbi of Ukraine, Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman and the Ukrainian Jewish Community. Topol&#x27;s portrayal of Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof led to the inspiration for the Anatevka Refugee Village which was named in commemoration of the fictional village.

==Legacy==
Shortly after Topol&#x27;s death, President Isaac Herzog issued a statement honouring &quot;one of the most prominent Israeli stage artists, a gifted actor who conquered many stages in Israel and overseas, filled the cinema screens with his presence and, above all, deeply entered our hearts&quot;. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated &quot;his wide smile, warm voice, and unique sense of humour made him a folk hero who won the hearts of the people&quot; and former prime minister Yair Lapid remarked &quot;He and his smile will continue to accompany Israeli culture, his rich legacy will forever remain a part of Israel&quot;.

<text>The Christadelphians () are a restorationist and nontrinitarian (Biblical Unitarian) Christian denomination. The name means &#x27;brothers and sisters in Christ&#x27;, from the Greek words for Christ (&quot;Christos&quot;) and brothers (&quot;adelphoi&quot;).

Christadelphians believe in the inspiration of the Bible, the Virgin Birth, the status of Jesus Christ as the son of God, believer&#x27;s baptism, the resurrection of the dead, the second coming of Christ, and the future kingdom of God on earth. However, they reject a number of mainstream Christian doctrines, for example the Trinity and the immortality of the soul, believing these to be corruptions of original Christian teaching.

The movement developed in the United Kingdom and North America in the 19th century around the teachings of John Thomas and they were initially found predominantly in the developed English-speaking world, expanding in developing countries after the Second World War. There are approximately 50,000 Christadelphians in around 120 countries. Congregations are traditionally referred to as &quot;ecclesias&quot;.

== History ==

=== Background ===

=== 19th century ===
The Christadelphian movement traces its origins to John Thomas (1805–1871). He initially associated with emerging Restoration Movement in the United States but later separated from them. The Christadelphian community in the United Kingdom effectively dates from Thomas&#x27;s first lecturing tour of Britain (May 1848 – October 1850). During this period, he wrote &quot;Elpis Israel&quot; in which he laid out his understanding of the main doctrines of the Bible. Since his medium for bringing change was print and debate, it was natural for the origins of the Christadelphian body to be associated with books and journals, such as Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Herald of the Kingdom&quot;. His message was particularly welcomed in Scotland, and Campbellite, Unitarian and Adventist friends separated to form groups of &quot;Baptised Believers&quot;.

In his desire to seek to establish Biblical truth and test orthodox Christian beliefs through independent scriptural study he was not alone. Among other churches, he had links with the Adventist movement and with Benjamin Wilson (who later set up the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith in the 1860s). Although the Christadelphian movement originated through the activities of John Thomas, he never saw himself as making his own disciples. He believed rather that he had rediscovered 1st century beliefs from the Bible alone, and sought to prove that through a process of challenge and debate and writing journals. Through that process a number of people became convinced and set up various fellowships that had sympathy with that position. Groups associated with John Thomas met under various names, including Believers, Baptised Believers, the Royal Association of Believers, Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God, Nazarines (or Nazarenes), and The Antipas until the time of the American Civil War (1861–1865). At that time, church affiliation was required in the United States and in the Confederate States of America in order to register for conscientious objector status, and in 1864 Thomas chose for registration purposes the name &quot;Christadelphian&quot;.

Through the teaching of John Thomas and the need in the American Civil War for a name, the Christadelphians emerged as a denomination, but they were formed into a lasting structure through a passionate follower of Thomas&#x27;s interpretation of the Bible, Robert Roberts. In 1864, he began to publish &quot;The Ambassador of the Coming Age&quot; magazine. John Thomas, out of concern that someone else might start a publication and call it &quot;The Christadelphian&quot;, urged Robert Roberts to change the name of his magazine to &quot;The Christadelphian&quot;, which he did in 1869. His editorship of the magazine continued with some assistance until his death in 1898. In church matters, Roberts was prominent in the period following the death of John Thomas in 1871, and helped craft the structures of the Christadelphian body.

Initially, the denomination grew in the English-speaking world, particularly in the English Midlands and in parts of North America. Two thirds of ecclesias, and members, in Britain before 1864 were in Scotland. In the early days after the death of John Thomas, the group could have moved in a number of directions. Doctrinal issues arose, debates took place, and statements of faith were created and amended as other issues arose. These attempts were felt necessary by many to both settle and define a doctrinal stance for the newly emerging denomination and to keep out error. As a result of these debates, several groups separated from the main body of Christadelphians, most notably the Suffolk Street fellowship in 1885 (with members believing that the whole of the Bible was not inspired), and the Unamended fellowship.

=== 20th century ===
The Christadelphian position on conscientious objection came to the fore with the introduction of conscription during the First World War. Varying degrees of exemption from military service were granted to Christadelphians in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. In the Second World War, this frequently required the person seeking exemption to undertake civilian work under the direction of the authorities.

During the Second World War, the Christadelphians in Britain assisted in the Kindertransport, helping to relocate several hundred Jewish children away from Nazi persecution by founding a hostel, Elpis Lodge, for that purpose. In Germany, the small Christadelphian community founded by Albert Maier went underground from 1940 to 1945, and a leading brother, Albert Merz, was imprisoned as a conscientious objector and later executed.

After the Second World War, moves were taken to try to reunite various of the earlier divisions. By the end of the 1950s, most Christadelphians had united into one community, but there are still a number of small groups of Christadelphians who remain separate.

=== Today ===
The post-war and post-reunions periods saw an increase in co-operation and interaction between ecclesias, resulting in the establishment of a number of week-long Bible schools and the formation of national and international organisations such as the Christadelphian Bible Mission (for preaching and pastoral support overseas), the Christadelphian Support Network (for counselling), and the Christadelphian Meal-A-Day Fund (for charity and humanitarian work).

The period following the reunions was accompanied by expansion in the developing world, which now accounts for around 40% of Christadelphians.

== Beliefs ==
The Christadelphian body has no central authority or co-ordinating organisation to establish and maintain a standardised set of beliefs, but there are core doctrines accepted by most Christadelphians. In the formal statements of faith a more complete list is found; for instance, the Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith has 30 doctrines to be accepted and 35 to be rejected.

=== The Bible ===
Christadelphians state that their beliefs are based wholly on the Bible, and they do not see other works as inspired by God. They regard the Bible as inspired by God and, therefore, believe that in its original form, it is error-free apart from errors in later copies due to errors of transcription or translation.

=== God ===
Christadelphians believe that God, Jehovah, is the creator of all things and the father of true believers, that he is a separate being from his son, Jesus (who is subordinate to him). They reject the doctrine of the Trinity.

=== Jesus ===
Christadelphians believe that Jesus is the promised Jewish Messiah, in whom the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament find their fulfilment. They believe he is the Son of Man, in that he inherited human nature (with its inclination to sin) from his mother, and the Son of God by virtue of his miraculous conception by the power of God. Christadelphians reject the doctrine of Christ&#x27;s pre-existence. They teach that he was part of God&#x27;s plans from the beginning and was foreshadowed in the Old Testament, but was no independent creature prior to his earthly birth. Although he was tempted, Jesus committed no sin, and was therefore a perfect representative sacrifice to bring salvation to sinful humankind. They believe that God raised Jesus from death and gave him immortality, and he has ascended to Heaven, God&#x27;s dwelling place, until he returns to set up the Kingdom of God on earth.

=== The Holy Spirit ===

Christadelphians believe that the Holy Spirit is the power of God used in creation and for salvation. They also believe that the phrase &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; sometimes refers to God&#x27;s character/mind, depending on the context in which the phrase appears, but reject the view that people need strength, guidance and power from the Holy Spirit to live the Christian life, believing instead that the spirit a believer needs within themselves is the mind/character of God, which is developed in a believer by their reading of the Bible (which, they believe, contains words God gave by his Spirit) and trying to live by what it says during the events of their lives which God uses to help shape their character. Christadelphians deny the personhood of the Holy Spirit, and the present-day possession of the Holy Spirit (both &quot;gift of&quot; and &quot;gifts of&quot;) (see cessationism).

=== The Kingdom of God ===
Christadelphians believe that Jesus Christ will return to the Earth in person to set up the Kingdom of God in fulfilment of the promises made to Abraham and David. This includes the belief that the coming Kingdom will be the restoration of God&#x27;s first Kingdom of Israel, which was under David and Solomon. For Christadelphians, this is the focal point of the gospel taught by Jesus and the apostles. They believe that the Kingdom will be centred upon Israel, but Jesus Christ will also reign over all the other nations on the Earth. Old Paths Christadelphians continue to believe that the Kingdom of God is to be restored to the land of Israel promised to Abraham and ruled over in the past by David, with a worldwide empire.

=== The Devil ===
Christadelphians believe that the word &quot;devil&quot; is a reference in the scriptures to sin and human nature in opposition to God, while the word &quot;satan&quot; is merely a reference to an adversary or opponent (be it good or bad) and is frequently applied to human beings. According to Christadelphians, these terms are used in reference to specific political systems or individuals in opposition or conflict and not to an independent spiritual being or fallen angel. Accordingly, they do not define Hell as a place of eternal torment for sinners, but as a state of eternal death and non-existence due to annihilation of body and mind.

=== Salvation ===
Christadelphians believe that people are separated from God because of their sins but that humankind can be reconciled to him by becoming disciples of Jesus Christ. This is by belief in the gospel, through repentance, and through baptism by total immersion in water. They reject assurance of salvation, believing instead that salvation comes as a result of remaining &quot;in Christ&quot;. After death, believers are in a state of non-existence, knowing nothing until the Resurrection at the return of Christ. Following the judgement at that time, the accepted receive the gift of immortality, and live with Christ on a restored Earth, assisting him to establish the Kingdom of God and to rule over the mortal population for a thousand years (the Millennium). Christadelphians deny the immortality of the soul.

=== Life in Christ ===
The &quot;Commandments of Christ&quot; demonstrates the community&#x27;s recognition of the importance of biblical teaching on morality. Marriage and family life are important. Most Christadelphians believe that sexual relationships should be limited to heterosexual marriage, ideally between baptised believers.

== Organisation ==

=== General organisation ===
In the absence of centralised organisation, some differences exist amongst Christadelphians on matters of belief and practice. This is because each congregation (commonly styled &#x27;ecclesias&#x27;) is organised , typically following common practices which have altered little since the 19th century. Many avoid the word &quot;church&quot; due to its association with mainstream Christianity, and its focus on the building as opposed to the congregation. Most ecclesias have a constitution, which includes a &#x27;Statement of Faith&#x27;, a list of &#x27;Doctrines to be Rejected&#x27; and a formalised list of &#x27;The Commandments of Christ&#x27;. With no central authority, individual congregations are responsible for maintaining orthodoxy in belief and practice, and the statement of faith is seen by many as useful to this end. The statement of faith acts as the official standard of most ecclesias to determine fellowship within and between ecclesias, and as the basis for co-operation between ecclesias. Congregational discipline and conflict resolution are applied using various forms of consultation, mediation, and discussion, with disfellowship (similar to excommunication) being the final response to those with unorthodox practices or beliefs.

The relative uniformity of organisation and practice is undoubtedly due to the influence of a booklet, written early in Christadelphian history by Robert Roberts, called &quot;A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias&quot;. It recommends a basically democratic arrangement by which congregational members elect &#x27;brothers&#x27; to do arranging and serving duties, and includes guidelines for the organisation of committees, as well as conflict resolution between congregational members and between congregations. Christadelphians do not have paid ministers. Male members (and increasingly female in some places) are assessed by the congregation for their eligibility to teach and perform other duties, which are usually assigned on a rotation basis, as opposed to having a permanently appointed preacher. Congregational polity typically follows a democratic model, with an elected arranging committee for each individual ecclesia. This unpaid committee is responsible for the day-to-day running of the ecclesia and is answerable to the rest of the ecclesia&#x27;s members.

Inter-ecclesial organisations co-ordinate the running of, among other things, Christadelphian schools and elderly care homes, the Christadelphian Isolation League (which cares for those prevented by distance or infirmity from attending an ecclesia regularly) and the publication of Christadelphian magazines.

=== Adherents ===
No official membership figures are published, but the &quot;Columbia Encyclopaedia&quot; gives an estimated figure of 50,000 Christadelphians, spread across approximately 120 countries. Estimates for the main centers of Christadelphian population are as follows: Mozambique (17,800), Australia (9,734), the United Kingdom (8,200), Malawi (7,000), United States (6,500), Canada (3,000), Kenya (2,700), India (2,300) and New Zealand (1,785). Figures from Christadelphian mission organisations are as follows: Africa (32,500), Asia (4,000), the Caribbean (400), Europe (including Russia) (700), Latin America (275), and the Pacific (200).

=== Fellowships ===
The Christadelphian body consists of a number of &quot;fellowships&quot; – groups of ecclesias which associate with one another, often to the exclusion of ecclesias outside their group. They are to some degree localised. The Unamended Fellowship, for example, exists only in North America. Christadelphian fellowships have often been named after ecclesias or magazines who took a lead in developing a particular stance.

The majority of Christadelphians today belong to what is commonly known as the &quot;Central Fellowship&quot;. The term &quot;Central&quot; came into use around 1933 to identify ecclesias worldwide who were in fellowship with the Birmingham (Central) Ecclesia. These were previously known as the &quot;Temperance Hall Fellowship&quot;. The &quot;Suffolk Street Fellowship&quot; arose in 1885 over disagreements surrounding the inspiration of the Bible. Meanwhile, in Australia, division concerning the nature of Jesus Christ resulted in the formation of the &quot;Shield Fellowship&quot;. Discussions in 1957–1958 resulted in a worldwide reunion between the Central, Suffolk Street and Shield Fellowships.

The &quot;Unamended Fellowship&quot;, consisting of around 1,850 members, is found in the East Coast and Midwest USA and Ontario, Canada. This group separated in 1898 as a result of differing views on who would be raised to judgement at the return of Christ. The majority of Christadelphians believe that the judgement will include anyone who had sufficient knowledge of the gospel message, and is not limited to baptised believers. The majority in England, Australia and North America amended their statement of faith accordingly. Those who opposed the amendment became known as the &quot;Unamended Fellowship&quot; and allowed the teaching that God either could not or would not raise those who had no covenant relationship with him. Opinions vary as to what the established position was on this subject prior to the controversy. Prominent in the formation of the Unamended Fellowship was Thomas Williams, editor of the Christadelphian Advocate magazine. The majority of the Unamended Fellowship outside North America joined the Suffolk Street Fellowship before its eventual incorporation into Central Fellowship. There is also some co-operation between the Central (Amended) and Unamended Fellowships in North America – most recently in the Great Lakes region, where numerous Amended and Unamended ecclesias are working together to unify their ecclesias. The Central Fellowship in North America is still often referred to today as the &quot;Amended Fellowship&quot;.

The &quot;Berean Fellowship&quot; was formed in 1923 as a result of varying views on military service in England, and on the atonement in North America. The majority of the North American Bereans re-joined the main body of Christadelphians in 1952. A number continue as a separate community, numbering around 200 in Texas, 100 in Kenya and 30 in Wales. Most of the divisions still in existence within the Christadelphian community today stem from further divisions of the &quot;Berean&quot; &quot;Fellowship&quot;.
The &quot;Dawn Fellowship&quot; are the result of an issue which arose in 1942 among the Berean Fellowship regarding divorce and remarriage. The stricter party formed the Dawn Fellowship who, following re-union on the basis of unity of belief with the Lightstand Fellowship in Australia in 2007 increased in number. There are now thought to be around 800 members in England, Australia, Canada, India, Jamaica, Poland, the Philippines, Russia and Kenya.

The &quot;Old Paths Fellowship&quot; was formed in 1957 in response to the reunion of the Central and Suffolk Street Fellowships. A minority from the Central Fellowship held that the reasons for separation remained and that full unity of belief on all fundamental principles of Bible teaching was necessary; thus reunion was only possible with the full agreement and understanding of all members rather than a decision by majority vote. Ecclesias forming the Old Paths Fellowship arose in England, Australia, New Zealand and Canada numbering around 500 members in total. They now number around 250 members in total, with members in Australia, England, Mexico and New Zealand. They maintain that they hold to the original Central Fellowship position held prior to the 1957 Reunion.

Other fellowships (ranging in numbers from as few as 10 to over 200 members) include the &quot;Watchman Fellowship&quot;, the &quot;Companion Fellowship&quot; and the &quot;Pioneer Fellowship&quot;.

According to Bryan Wilson, functionally the definition of a &quot;fellowship&quot; within Christadelphian history has been mutual or unilateral exclusion of groupings of ecclesias from the breaking of bread. This functional definition still holds true in North America, where the Unamended Fellowship and the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith are not received by most North American Amended ecclesias. But outside North America this functional definition no longer holds. Many articles and books on the doctrine and practice of fellowship now reject the notion itself of separate &quot;fellowships&quot; among those who recognise the same baptism, viewing such separations as schismatic. Many ecclesias in the Central fellowship would not refuse a baptised Christadelphian from a minority fellowship from breaking bread; the exclusion is more usually the other way.

They tend to operate organisationally fairly similarly, although there are different emphases. Despite their differences, the Central, Old Paths, Dawn and Berean fellowships generally subscribe to the &quot;Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith&quot; (BASF), though the latter two have additional clauses or supporting documents to explain their position. Most Unamended ecclesias use the &quot;Birmingham Unamended Statement of Faith&quot; (BUSF) with one clause being different. Within the Central fellowship individual ecclesias also may have their own statement of faith, whilst still accepting the statement of faith of the larger community. Some ecclesias have statements around their positions, especially on divorce and re-marriage, making clear that offence would be caused by anyone in that position seeking to join them at the &#x27;Breaking of Bread&#x27; service. Others tolerate a degree of divergence from commonly held Christadelphian views. While some communities of Christadelphian origin have viewed previous statements of faith as set in stone, others have felt it necessary to revise them in order to meet contemporary issues, update language or add supporting Biblical quotations.

For each fellowship, anyone who publicly assents to the doctrines described in the statement and is in good standing in their &quot;home ecclesia&quot; is generally welcome to participate in the activities of any other ecclesia.

===Related groups===
There are a number of groups who, while sharing a common heritage and many Christadelphian teachings, have adopted alternative names in order to dissociate themselves from what they believe to be false teachings and/or practice within the main Christadelphian body. Ranging in size from two or three members in size to around 50, each group restricts fellowship to its own members. These include the Nazarene Fellowship, the Ecclesia of Christ, the Remnant of Christ&#x27;s Ecclesia, the Apostolic Fellowship of Christ and the Apostolic Ecclesia.

The Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith (CGAF) also has common origins with Christadelphians and shares Christadelphian beliefs. Numbering around 400 (primarily Ohio and Florida, USA), they are welcomed into fellowship by some &quot;Central&quot; Christadelphians and are currently involved in unity talks.

==Historical antecedents==

One criticism of the Christadelphian movement has been over the claim of John Thomas and Robert Roberts to have &quot;re-discovered&quot; scriptural truth. However one might argue that &quot;all&quot; Protestant groups make the same claims to some extent. Although both men believed that they had &quot;recovered&quot; the true doctrines for themselves and contemporaries, they also believed there had always existed a group of true believers throughout the ages, albeit marred by the apostasy.

The most notable Christadelphian attempts to find a continuity of those with doctrinal similarities since that point have been geographer Alan Eyre&#x27;s two books &quot;The Protesters&quot; (1975) and &quot;Brethren in Christ&quot; (1982) in which he shows that many individual Christadelphian doctrines had been previously believed. Eyre focused in particular on the Radical Reformation, and also among the Socinians and other early Unitarians and the English Dissenters. In this way, Eyre was able to demonstrate substantial historical precedents for individual Christadelphian teachings and practices, and believed that the Christadelphian community was the &#x27;inheritor of a noble tradition, by which elements of the Truth were from century to century hammered out on the anvil of controversy, affliction and even anguish&#x27;. Although noting in the introduction to &#x27;The Protestors&#x27; that &#x27;Some recorded herein perhaps did not have &quot;all the truth&quot; — so the writer has been reminded&#x27;, Eyre nevertheless claimed that the purpose of the work was to &#x27;tell how a number of little-known individuals, groups and religious communities strove to preserve or revive the original Christianity of apostolic times&#x27;, and that &#x27;In faith and outlook they were far closer to the early springing shoots of first-century Christianity and the penetrating spiritual challenge of Jesus himself than much that has passed for the religion of the Nazarene in the last nineteen centuries&#x27;.

Eyre&#x27;s research has been criticized by some of his Christadelphian peers, and as a result Christadelphian commentary on the subject has subsequently been more cautious and circumspect, with caveats being issued concerning Eyre&#x27;s claims, and the two books less used and publicised than in previous years.

Nevertheless, even with most source writings of those later considered heretics destroyed, evidence can be provided that since the first century BC there have been various groups and individuals who have held certain individual Christadelphian beliefs or similar ones. For example, all the distinctive Christadelphian doctrines (with the exception of the non-literal devil), down to interpretations of specific verses, can be found particularly among sixteenth century Socinian writers (e.g. the rejection of the doctrines of the trinity, pre-existence of Christ, immortal souls, a literal hell of fire, original sin). Early English Unitarian writings also correspond closely to those of Christadelphians. Also, recent discoveries and research have shown a large similarity between Christadelphian beliefs and those held by Isaac Newton who, among other things, rejected the doctrines of the trinity, immortal souls, a personal devil and literal demons. Further examples are as follows:
* The typical Old Testament belief in unconsciousness until resurrection, instead of the immortality of the soul, has been held marginally throughout the history of both Judaism and Christianity; such sources include certain Jewish pseudepigraphal works, rabbinical works, Clement of Rome, Arnobius in the third to fourth century, a succession of Arabic and Syrian Christians from the third to the eighth century including Aphrahat, Ephrem, Narsai, Isaac of Nineveh (d.700), and Jacob of Sarug, Jewish commentators such as Abraham Ibn Ezra (1092–1167), Maimonides (1135–1204), and Joseph Albo (1380–1444), and later Christians such as John Wycliffe, Michael Sattler, and many Anabaptists, long before Martin Luther challenged Roman Catholic views on heaven and hell with his teaching of &quot;soul sleep&quot;.
* The Christadelphian denial of the pre-existence of Christ, and interpretation of verses such as &quot;I came down from heaven&quot; (John 6:38) as relating to the virgin birth and Christ&#x27;s mission only, are found in the teachings of: the early Jewish Christians, the Ebionites, the Nazoreans (or Nazarenes), the Theodotians of Theodotus the Cobbler (who believed Jesus was supernaturally begotten but a man nonetheless), Artemon, Paul of Samosata, the Pseudo-Clementines, and Photinus (d.376); naturally however, given that non-Trinitarian beliefs were punishable with death from the fourth century to the seventeenth, it would be foolish to expect to discover any consistent line of people or groups holding such beliefs. Such attempts become possible only after the Protestant Reformation. Christadelphian Christology is found from the publication of Lelio Sozzini&#x27;s commentary on John (1561) through to the increasing resistance to the miraculous among English Unitarians after 1800.
* Affinities with the Christadelphian concept of the devil and/or demons are found in a range of early Jewish and later Christian sources such as: Jonathan ben Uzziel (100s AD); Joshua Ben Karha (135–160); Levi ben Gershon (d. 1344); David Kimhi (1160); Saadia ben Joseph (892–942); Shimon ben Lakish (230–270), David Joris (1501-1556), Lelio Sozzini (1525-1562), Fausto Sozzini (1539-1604), Gerrard Winstanley (1609-1676), Joseph Mede (1640), Jacob Bauthumley (1650), Thomas Hobbes (1651), Lodowick Muggleton (1669), Dr. Anthonie van Dale (1685), Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772), Balthasar Bekker (1695), Isaac Newton; Christian Thomasius (1704), Arthur Ashley Sykes (1737), Nathaniel Lardner (1742), The New-Light Quakers of Lynn and New Bedford (1800s), Elias Hicks (1748-1830), Dr. Richard Mead (1755), Hugh Farmer (at least in the account of Christ&#x27;s temptation; 1761), William Ashdowne (1791), John Simpson (1804), John Epps (1842) and Primitive Baptist Universalists also known No-Hellers (1907 to present)

Organised worship in England for those whose beliefs anticipated those of Christadelphians only truly became possible in 1779 when the Act of Toleration 1689 was amended to permit denial of the Trinity, and only fully when property penalties were removed in the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813. This is only 35 years before John Thomas&#x27; 1849 lecture tour in Britain which attracted significant support from an existing non-Trinitarian Adventist base, particularly, initially, in Scotland where Arian, Socinian, and unitarian (with a small &#x27;u&#x27; as distinct from the Unitarian Church of Theophilus Lindsey) views were prevalent.

== Practices and worship ==

Christadelphians are organised into local congregations, that commonly call themselves &quot;ecclesias&quot;, which is taken from usage in the New Testament and is Greek for &quot;gathering of those summoned&quot;. Congregational worship, which usually takes place on Sunday, centres on the remembrance of the death and celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ by the taking part in the &quot;memorial service&quot;. Additional meetings are often organised for worship, prayer, preaching and Bible study.

Ecclesias are typically involved in preaching the gospel (evangelism) in the form of public lectures on Bible teaching, college-style seminars on reading the Bible, and Bible Reading Groups. Correspondence courses are also used widely, particularly in areas where there is no established Christadelphian presence. Some ecclesias, organisations or individuals also preach through other media like video, 
 and internet forums. There are also a number of Bible Education/Learning Centres around the world.

Only baptised (by complete immersion in water) believers are considered members of the ecclesia. Ordinarily, baptism follows someone making a &quot;good confession&quot; (cf. 1 Tim. 6:12) of their faith before two or three nominated elders of the ecclesia they are seeking to join. The good confession has to demonstrate a basic understanding of the main elements – &quot;first principles&quot; – of the faith of the community. The children of members are encouraged to attend Christadelphian Sunday schools and youth groups. Interaction between youth from different ecclesias is encouraged through regional and national youth gatherings, conferences and camping holidays.

Christadelphians understand the Bible to teach that male and female believers are equal in God&#x27;s sight, and also that there is a distinction between the roles of male and female members. Women are typically not eligible to teach in formal gatherings of the ecclesia when male believers are present, are expected to cover their heads (using hat or scarf, etc.) during formal services, and do not sit on the main ecclesial arranging (organising) committees. They do, however: participate in other ecclesial and inter-ecclesial committees; participate in discussions; teach children in Sunday schools as well as at home, teach other women and non-members; perform music; discuss and vote on business matters; and engage in the majority of other activities. Generally, at formal ecclesial and inter-ecclesial meetings the women wear head coverings when there are acts of worship and prayer.

There are ecclesially accountable committees for co-ordinated preaching, youth and Sunday school work, conscientious objection issues, care of the elderly, and humanitarian work. These do not have any legislative authority, and are wholly dependent upon ecclesial support. Ecclesias in an area may regularly hold joint activities combining youth groups, fellowship, preaching, and Bible study.

Christadelphians refuse to participate in any military or police force because they are conscientious objectors (not to be confused with pacifists).

There is a strong emphasis on personal Bible reading and study and many Christadelphians use the Bible Companion to help them systematically read the Bible each year.

=== Hymnody and music ===

Christadelphian hymnody makes considerable use of the hymns of the Anglican and English Protestant traditions (even in US ecclesias the hymnody is typically more English than American). In many Christadelphian hymn books a sizeable proportion of hymns are drawn from the Scottish Psalter and non-Christadelphian hymn-writers including Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper and John Newton. Despite incorporating non-Christadelphian hymns however, Christadelphian hymnody preserves the essential teachings of the community.

The earliest hymn book published was the &quot;Sacred Melodist&quot; which was published by Benjamin Wilson in Geneva, Illinois in 1860. The next was the hymn book published for the use of &quot;Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God&quot; (an early name for Christadelphians) by George Dowie in Edinburgh in 1864. In 1865 Robert Roberts published a collection of Scottish psalms and hymns called &quot;The Golden Harp&quot; (which was subtitled &quot;Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, compiled for the use of Immersed Believers in &#x27;The Things concerning the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus Christ). This was replaced only five years later by the first &quot;Christadelphian Hymn Book&quot; (1869), compiled by J. J. and A. Andrew, and this was revised and expanded in 1874, 1932 and 1964. A thorough revision by the Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association resulted in the latest (2002) edition which is almost universally used by English-speaking Christadelphian ecclesias. In addition some Christadelphian fellowships have published their own hymn books.

Some ecclesias use the &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; songbook. It was produced with the aim of making contemporary songs which are consistent with Christadelphian theology more widely available. Another publication, the &quot;Worship&quot; book is a compilation of songs and hymns that have been composed only by members of the Christadelphian community. This book was produced with the aim of providing extra music for non-congregational music items within services (e.g. voluntaries, meditations, et cetera) but has been adopted by congregations worldwide and is now used to supplement congregational repertoire.

In the English-speaking world, worship is typically accompanied by organ or piano, though in recent years a few ecclesias have promoted the use of other instruments (e.g. strings, wind and brass as mentioned in the Psalms). This trend has also seen the emergence of some Christadelphian bands and the establishment of the Christadelphian Art Trust to support performing, visual and dramatic arts within the Christadelphian community.

In other countries, hymn books have been produced in local languages, sometimes resulting in styles of worship which reflect the local culture. It has been noted that Christadelphian hymnody has historically been a consistent witness to Christadelphian beliefs, and that hymnody occupies a significant role in the community.

<text>Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to consumers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables, or in more recent systems, light pulses through fibre-optic cables. This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over-the-air by radio waves and received by a television antenna, or satellite television, in which the television signal is transmitted over-the-air by radio waves from a communications satellite and received by a satellite dish on the roof. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. Analog television was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital cable operation.

A cable channel (sometimes known as a cable network) is a television network available via cable television. Many of the same channels are distributed through satellite television. Alternative terms include &quot;non-broadcast channel&quot; or &quot;programming service&quot;, the latter being mainly used in legal contexts. The abbreviation CATV is used in the US for cable television and originally stood for community antenna television, from cable television&#x27;s origins in 1948; in areas where over-the-air TV reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large &quot;community antennas&quot; were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes.

In 1968, 6.4% of Americans had cable television. The number increased to 7.5% in 1978. By 1988, 52.8% of all households were using cable. The number further increased to 62.4% in 1994.

==Distribution==

To receive cable television at a given location, cable distribution lines must be available on the local utility poles or underground utility lines. Coaxial cable brings the signal to the customer&#x27;s building through a service drop, an overhead or underground cable. If the subscriber&#x27;s building does not have a cable service drop, the cable company will install one. The standard cable used in the U.S. is RG-6, which has a 75 ohm impedance, and connects with a type F connector. The cable company&#x27;s portion of the wiring usually ends at a distribution box on the building exterior, and built-in cable wiring in the walls usually distributes the signal to jacks in different rooms to which televisions are connected. Multiple cables to different rooms are split off the incoming cable with a small device called a splitter. There are two standards for cable television; older analog cable, and newer digital cable which can carry data signals used by digital television receivers such as high-definition television (HDTV) equipment. All cable companies in the United States have switched to or are in the course of switching to digital cable television since it was first introduced in the late 1990s.

Most cable companies require a set-top box (cable converter box) or a slot on one&#x27;s TV set for conditional access module cards to view their cable channels, even on newer televisions with digital cable QAM tuners, because most digital cable channels are now encrypted, or &quot;scrambled&quot;, to reduce cable service theft. A cable from the jack in the wall is attached to the input of the box, and an output cable from the box is attached to the television, usually the RF-IN or composite input on older TVs. Since the set-top box only decodes the single channel that is being watched, each television in the house requires a separate box. Some unencrypted channels, usually traditional over-the-air broadcast networks, can be displayed without a receiver box. The cable company will provide set-top boxes based on the level of service a customer purchases, from basic set-top boxes with a standard-definition picture connected through the standard coaxial connection on the TV, to high-definition wireless digital video recorder (DVR) receivers connected via HDMI or component. Older analog television sets are &quot;cable ready&quot; and can receive the old analog cable without a set-top box. To receive digital cable channels on an analog television set, even unencrypted ones, requires a different type of box, a digital television adapter supplied by the cable company or purchased by the subscriber. Another new distribution method that takes advantage of the low cost high quality DVB distribution to residential areas, uses TV gateways to convert the DVB-C, DVB-C2 stream to IP for distribution of TV over IP network in the home. Many cable companies offer internet access through DOCSIS.

==Principle of operation==
In the most common system, multiple television channels (as many as 500, although this varies depending on the provider&#x27;s available channel capacity) are distributed to subscriber residences through a coaxial cable, which comes from a trunkline supported on utility poles originating at the cable company&#x27;s local distribution facility, called the headend. Many channels can be transmitted through one coaxial cable by a technique called frequency division multiplexing. At the headend, each television channel is translated to a different frequency. By giving each channel a different frequency &quot;slot&quot; on the cable, the separate television signals do not interfere with each other. At an outdoor cable box on the subscriber&#x27;s residence, the company&#x27;s service drop cable is connected to cables distributing the signal to different rooms in the building. At each television, the subscriber&#x27;s television or a set-top box provided by the cable company translates the desired channel back to its original frequency (baseband), and it is displayed onscreen. Due to widespread cable theft in earlier analog systems, the signals are typically encrypted on modern digital cable systems, and the set-top box must be activated by an activation code sent by the cable company before it will function, which is only sent after the subscriber signs up. If the subscriber fails to pay their bill, the cable company can send a signal to deactivate the subscriber&#x27;s box, preventing reception.

There are also usually upstream channels on the cable to send data from the customer box to the cable headend, for advanced features such as requesting pay-per-view shows or movies, cable internet access, and cable telephone service. The downstream channels occupy a band of frequencies from approximately 50 MHz to 1 GHz, while the upstream channels occupy frequencies of 5 to 42 MHz. Subscribers pay with a monthly fee. Subscribers can choose from several levels of service, with premium packages including more channels but costing a higher rate. At the local headend, the feed signals from the individual television channels are received by dish antennas from communication satellites. Additional local channels, such as local broadcast television stations, educational channels from local colleges, and community access channels devoted to local governments (PEG channels) are usually included on the cable service. Commercial advertisements for local business are also inserted in the programming at the headend (the individual channels, which are distributed nationally, also have their own nationally oriented commercials).

===Hybrid fiber-coaxial===
Modern cable systems are large, with a single network and headend often serving an entire metropolitan area. Most systems use hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) distribution; this means the trunklines that carry the signal from the headend to local neighborhoods are optical fiber to provide greater bandwidth and also extra capacity for future expansion. At the headend, the electrical signal is translated into an optical signal and sent through the fiber. The fiber trunkline goes to several &quot;distribution hubs&quot;, from which multiple fibers fan out to carry the signal to boxes called &quot;optical nodes&quot; in local communities. At the optical node, the optical signal is translated back into an electrical signal and carried by coaxial cable distribution lines on utility poles, from which cables branch out to a series of signal amplifiers and line extenders. These devices carry the signal to customers via passive RF devices called taps.

== History ==
The very first cable networks were operated locally, notably in 1936 by Rediffusion in London in the United Kingdom and the same year in Berlin in Germany, notably for the Olympic Games, and from 1948 onwards in the United States and Switzerland. This type of local cable network was mainly used to relay terrestrial channels in geographical areas poorly served by terrestrial television signals.

=== In the United States ===
Cable television began in the United States as a commercial business in 1950s.

The early systems simply received weak (broadcast) channels, amplified them, and sent them over unshielded wires to the subscribers, limited to a community or to adjacent communities. The receiving antenna would be taller than any individual subscriber could afford, thus bringing in stronger signals; in hilly or mountainous terrain it would be placed at a high elevation.

At the outset, cable systems only served smaller communities without television stations of their own, and which could not easily receive signals from stations in cities because of distance or hilly terrain. In Canada, however, communities with their own signals were fertile cable markets, as viewers wanted to receive American signals. Rarely, as in the college town of Alfred, New York, U.S. cable systems retransmitted Canadian channels.

Although early (VHF) television receivers could receive 12 channels (2–13), the maximum number of channels that could be broadcast in one city was 7: channels 2, 4, either 5 or 6, 7, 9, 11 and 13, as receivers at the time were unable to receive strong (local) signals on adjacent channels without distortion. (There were frequency gaps between 4 and 5, and between 6 and 7, which allowed both to be used in the same city).

As equipment improved, all twelve channels could be utilized, except where a local VHF television station broadcast. Local broadcast channels were not usable for signals deemed to be a priority, but technology allowed low-priority signals to be placed on such channels by synchronizing their blanking intervals. TVs were unable to reconcile these blanking intervals and the slight changes due to travel through a medium, causing ghosting. The bandwidth of the amplifiers also was limited, meaning frequencies over 250 MHz were difficult to transmit to distant portions of the coaxial network, and UHF channels could not be used at all. To expand beyond 12 channels, non-standard &quot;midband&quot; channels had to be used, located between the FM band and Channel 7, or &quot;superband&quot; beyond Channel 13 up to about 300 MHz; these channels initially were only accessible using separate tuner boxes that sent the chosen channel into the TV set on Channel 2, 3 or 4. Initially, UHF broadcast stations were at a disadvantage because the standard TV sets in use at the time were unable to receive their channels. With the passage of the All-Channel Receiver Act in 1964, all new television sets were required to include a UHF tuner, nonetheless, it would still take a few years for UHF stations to become competitive.

Before being added to the cable box itself, these midband channels were used for early incarnations of pay TV, e.g. The Z Channel (Los Angeles) and HBO but transmitted in the clear i.e. not scrambled as standard TV sets of the period could not pick up the signal nor could the average consumer &quot;de-tune&quot; the normal stations to be able to receive it.

Once tuners that could receive select mid-band and super-band channels began to be incorporated into standard television sets, broadcasters were forced to either install scrambling circuitry or move these signals further out of the range of reception for early cable-ready TVs and VCRs. However, once consumer sets had the ability to receive all 181 FCC allocated channels, premium broadcasters were left with no choice but to scramble.

The descrambling circuitry was often published in electronics hobby magazines such as &quot;Popular Science&quot; and &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; allowing anybody with anything more than a rudimentary knowledge of broadcast electronics to be able to build their own and receive the programming without cost.

Later, the cable operators began to carry FM radio stations, and encouraged subscribers to connect their FM stereo sets to cable. Before stereo and bilingual TV sound became common, Pay-TV channel sound was added to the FM stereo cable line-ups. About this time, operators expanded beyond the 12-channel dial to use the &quot;midband&quot; and &quot;superband&quot; VHF channels adjacent to the &quot;high band&quot; 7–13 of North American television frequencies. Some operators as in Cornwall, Ontario, used a dual distribution network with Channels 2–13 on each of the two cables.

During the 1980s, United States regulations not unlike public, educational, and government access (PEG) created the beginning of cable-originated live television programming. As cable penetration increased, numerous cable-only TV stations were launched, many with their own news bureaus that could provide more immediate and more localized content than that provided by the nearest network newscast.

Such stations may use similar on-air branding as that used by the nearby broadcast network affiliate, but the fact that these stations do not broadcast over the air and are not regulated by the FCC, their call signs are meaningless. These stations evolved partially into today&#x27;s over-the-air digital subchannels, where a main broadcast TV station e.g. NBC 37* would – in the case of no local CBS or ABC station being available – rebroadcast the programming from a nearby affiliate but fill in with its own news and other community programming to suit its own locale. Many live local programs with local interests were subsequently created all over the United States in most major television markets in the early 1980s.

This evolved into today&#x27;s many cable-only broadcasts of diverse programming, including cable-only produced television movies and miniseries. Cable specialty channels, starting with channels oriented to show movies and large sporting or performance events, diversified further, and narrowcasting became common. By the late 1980s, cable-only signals outnumbered broadcast signals on cable systems, some of which by this time had expanded beyond 35 channels. By the mid-1980s in Canada, cable operators were allowed by the regulators to enter into distribution contracts with cable networks on their own.

By the 1990s, tiers became common, with customers able to subscribe to different tiers to obtain different selections of additional channels above the basic selection. By subscribing to additional tiers, customers could get specialty channels, movie channels, and foreign channels. Large cable companies used addressable descramblers to limit access to premium channels for customers not subscribing to higher tiers, however the above magazines often published workarounds for that technology as well.

During the 1990s, the pressure to accommodate the growing array of offerings resulted in digital transmission that made more efficient use of the VHF signal capacity; fibre optics was common to carry signals into areas near the home, where coax could carry higher frequencies over the short remaining distance. Although for a time in the 1980s and 1990s, television receivers and VCRs were equipped to receive the mid-band and super-band channels. Because the descrambling circuitry was for a time present in these tuners, depriving the cable operator of much of their revenue, such cable-ready tuners are rarely used now – requiring a return to the set-top boxes used from the 1970s onward.

The digital television transition in the United States has put all signals, broadcast and cable, into digital form, rendering analog cable television service a rarity, found in an ever-dwindling number of markets. Analog television sets are accommodated, their tuners mostly obsolete and dependent entirely on the set-top box.

==Deployments by continent==

Cable television is mostly available in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia and South America. Cable television has had little success in Africa, as it is not cost-effective to lay cables in sparsely populated areas. Multichannel multipoint distribution service, a microwave-based system, may be used instead.

==Other cable-based services==
Coaxial cables are capable of bi-directional carriage of signals as well as the transmission of large amounts of data. Cable television signals use only a portion of the bandwidth available over coaxial lines. This leaves plenty of space available for other digital services such as cable internet, cable telephony and wireless services, using both unlicensed and licensed spectra. Broadband internet access is achieved over coaxial cable by using cable modems to convert the network data into a type of digital signal that can be transferred over coaxial cable. One problem with some cable systems is the older amplifiers placed along the cable routes are unidirectional thus in order to allow for uploading of data the customer would need to use an analog telephone modem to provide for the upstream connection. This limited the upstream speed to 31.2 Kbp/s and prevented the always-on convenience broadband internet typically provides. Many large cable systems have upgraded or are upgrading their equipment to allow for bi-directional signals, thus allowing for greater upload speed and always-on convenience, though these upgrades are expensive.

In North America, Australia and Europe, many cable operators have already introduced cable telephone service, which operates just like existing fixed line operators. This service involves installing a special telephone interface at the customer&#x27;s premises that converts the analog signals from the customer&#x27;s in-home wiring into a digital signal, which is then sent on the local loop (replacing the analog last mile, or plain old telephone service (POTS) to the company&#x27;s switching center, where it is connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The biggest obstacle to cable telephone service is the need for nearly 100% reliable service for emergency calls. One of the standards available for digital cable telephony, PacketCable, seems to be the most promising and able to work with the quality of service (QOS) demands of traditional analog plain old telephone service (POTS) service. The biggest advantage to digital cable telephone service is similar to the advantage of digital cable, namely that data can be compressed, resulting in much less bandwidth used than a dedicated analog circuit-switched service. Other advantages include better voice quality and integration to a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network providing cheap or unlimited nationwide and international calling. In many cases, digital cable telephone service is separate from cable modem service being offered by many cable companies and does not rely on Internet Protocol (IP) traffic or the Internet.

Traditional cable television providers and traditional telecommunication companies increasingly compete in providing voice, video and data services to residences. The combination of television, telephone and Internet access is commonly called &quot;triple play&quot;, regardless of whether CATV or telcos offer it.

<text>Cholera () is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;. Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe. The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea lasting a few days. Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur. Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet. Dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish. Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.

Cholera is caused by a number of types of &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, with some types producing more severe disease than others. It is spread mostly by unsafe water and unsafe food that has been contaminated with human feces containing the bacteria. Undercooked shellfish is a common source. Humans are the only known host for the bacteria. Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, insufficient clean drinking water, and poverty. Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test, or a rapid dipstick test, although the dipstick test is less accurate.

Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months, and confer the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by &quot;E. coli&quot;. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a single-dose, live, oral cholera vaccine called Vaxchora for adults aged 18–64 who are travelling to an area of active cholera transmission. It offers limited protection to young children. People who survive an episode of cholera have long-lasting immunity for at least three years (the period tested).

The primary treatment for affected individuals is oral rehydration salts (ORS), the replacement of fluids and electrolytes by using slightly sweet and salty solutions. Rice-based solutions are preferred. In children, zinc supplementation has also been found to improve outcomes. In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer&#x27;s lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial. The choice of antibiotic is aided by antibiotic sensitivity testing.

Cholera continues to affect an estimated 3–5 million people worldwide and causes 28,800–130,000 deaths a year. To date, seven cholera pandemics have occurred, with the most recent beginning in 1961, and continuing today. The illness is rare in high-income countries, and affects children most severely. Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas. Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia. The risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5%, given improved treatment, but may be as high as 50% without such access to treatment. Descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BCE in Sanskrit literature. In Europe, cholera was a term initially used to describe any kind of gastroenteritis, and was not used for this disease until the early 19th century. The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology because of his insights about transmission via contaminated water, and a map of the same was the first recorded incidence of epidemiological tracking. 
== Signs and symptoms ==

The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid. These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria. The diarrhea is frequently described as &quot;rice water&quot; in nature and may have a fishy odor. An untreated person with cholera may produce of diarrhea a day. Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals. If the severe diarrhea is not treated, it can result in life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100. Cholera has been nicknamed the &quot;blue death&quot; because a person&#x27;s skin may turn bluish-gray from extreme loss of fluids.

Fever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection. Patients can be lethargic and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet. Kussmaul breathing, a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of acidosis from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion. Blood pressure drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time. Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, seizures, or even coma due to electrolyte imbalances are common, especially in children.

== Cause ==


=== Transmission ===
Cholera bacteria have been found in shellfish and plankton.

Transmission is usually through the fecal-oral route of contaminated food or water caused by poor sanitation. Most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food, while in developing countries it is more often water. Food transmission can occur when people harvest seafood such as oysters in waters infected with sewage, as &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; accumulates in planktonic crustaceans and the oysters eat the zooplankton.

People infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and disease transmission may occur if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as &quot;rice-water&quot;, contaminates water used by others. A single diarrheal event can cause a one-million fold increase in numbers of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; in the environment. The source of the contamination is typically other people with cholera when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, groundwater or drinking water supplies. Drinking any contaminated water and eating any foods washed in the water, as well as shellfish living in the affected waterway, can cause a person to contract an infection. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person.

&quot;V. cholerae&quot; also exists outside the human body in natural water sources, either by itself or through interacting with phytoplankton, zooplankton, or biotic and abiotic detritus. Drinking such water can also result in the disease, even without prior contamination through fecal matter. Selective pressures exist however in the aquatic environment that may reduce the virulence of &quot;V. cholerae&quot;. Specifically, animal models indicate that the transcriptional profile of the pathogen changes as it prepares to enter an aquatic environment. This transcriptional change results in a loss of ability of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; to be cultured on standard media, a phenotype referred to as &#x27;viable but non-culturable&#x27; (VBNC) or more conservatively &#x27;active but non-culturable&#x27; (ABNC). One study indicates that the culturability of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; drops 90% within 24 hours of entering the water, and furthermore that this loss in culturability is associated with a loss in virulence.

Both toxic and non-toxic strains exist. Non-toxic strains can acquire toxicity through a temperate bacteriophage.

=== Susceptibility ===
About 100million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult. This dose, however, is less in those with lowered gastric acidity (for instance those using proton pump inhibitors). Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having the highest rates of infection. Individuals&#x27; susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible. Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or malnourished children, are more likely to develop a severe case if they become infected. Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can undergo a severe case, and each person&#x27;s case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional health care provider.

The cystic fibrosis genetic mutation known as delta-F508 in humans has been said to maintain a selective heterozygous advantage: heterozygous carriers of the mutation (who are not affected by cystic fibrosis) are more resistant to &quot;V. cholerae&quot; infections. In this model, the genetic deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the intestinal epithelium, thus reducing the effects of an infection.

== Mechanism ==

When consumed, most bacteria do not survive the acidic conditions of the human stomach. The few surviving bacteria conserve their energy and stored nutrients during the passage through the stomach by shutting down protein production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the small intestine, they must propel themselves through the thick mucus that lines the small intestine to reach the intestinal walls where they can attach and thrive.

Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they no longer need the flagella to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins that they express in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, &quot;V. cholerae&quot; start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.

The cholera toxin (CTX or CT) is an oligomeric complex made up of six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a disulfide bond. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to GM1 gangliosides on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that ADP-ribosylates G proteins, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6). Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the Gs alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. This results in constitutive cAMP production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into &quot;V. cholerae&quot; by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; carry a variant of a temperate bacteriophage called CTXφ.

Microbiologists have studied the genetic mechanisms by which the &quot;V. cholerae&quot; bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall. Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump chloride ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless treated properly.

By inserting separate, successive sections of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as &quot;E. coli&quot; that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which &quot;V. cholerae&quot; responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; virulence determinants. In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the &quot;V. cholerae&quot; bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of virulence genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine. Current research aims at discovering &quot;the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine.&quot;

=== Genetic structure ===

Amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the pandemic isolates of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two clusters have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II. For the most part, Cluster I consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s, while Cluster II largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s, based on the change in the clone structure. This grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the African continent.

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
In many areas of the world, antibiotic resistance is increasing within cholera bacteria. In Bangladesh, for example, most cases are resistant to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin. Rapid diagnostic assay methods are available for the identification of multi-drug resistant cases. New generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against cholera bacteria in &quot;in vitro&quot; studies.

== Diagnosis ==
A rapid dipstick test is available to determine the presence of &quot;V. cholerae&quot;. In those samples that test positive, further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance. In epidemic situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a patient history and doing a brief examination. Treatment via hydration and over-the-counter hydration solutions can be started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis, especially where cholera is a common problem.

Stool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is &quot;V. cholerae&quot; O1. If &quot;V. cholerae&quot; serogroup O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for &quot;V. cholerae&quot; O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.

Infection with &quot;V. cholerae&quot; O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by &quot;V. cholerae&quot; O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States.

== Prevention ==

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends focusing on prevention, preparedness, and response to combat the spread of cholera. They also stress the importance of an effective surveillance system. Governments can play a role in all of these areas.

=== Water, sanitation and hygiene ===

Although cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper sanitation practices are followed. In developed countries, due to their nearly universal advanced water treatment and sanitation practices, cholera is rare. For example, the last major outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1910–1911. Cholera is mainly a risk in developing countries in those areas where access to WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) infrastructure is still inadequate.

Effective sanitation practices, if instituted and adhered to in time, are usually sufficient to stop an epidemic. There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted:
* Sterilization: Proper disposal and treatment of all materials that may have come into contact with the feces of other people with cholera (e.g., clothing, bedding, etc.) are essential. These should be sanitized by washing in hot water, using chlorine bleach if possible. Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective antimicrobial agents.
* Sewage and fecal sludge management: In cholera-affected areas, sewage and fecal sludge need to be treated and managed carefully in order to stop the spread of this disease via human excreta. Provision of sanitation and hygiene is an important preventative measure. Open defecation, release of untreated sewage, or dumping of fecal sludge from pit latrines or septic tanks into the environment need to be prevented. In many cholera affected zones, there is a low degree of sewage treatment. Therefore, the implementation of dry toilets that do not contribute to water pollution, as they do not flush with water, may be an interesting alternative to flush toilets.
* Sources: Warnings about possible cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions on how to decontaminate the water (boiling, chlorination etc.) for possible use.
* Water purification: All water used for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, chlorination, ozone water treatment, ultraviolet light sterilization (e.g., by solar water disinfection), or antimicrobial filtration in any area where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. Cloth filters or sari filtration, though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in Bangladesh that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.

Handwashing with soap or ash after using a toilet and before handling food or eating is also recommended for cholera prevention by WHO Africa.

=== Surveillance ===

Surveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provides guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable. For prevention to be effective, it is important that cases be reported to national health authorities.

=== Vaccination ===
Spanish physician Jaume Ferran i Clua developed the first successful cholera inoculation in 1885, the first to immunize humans against a bacterial disease. His vaccine and inoculation was rather controversial and was rejected by his peers and several investigation commissions but it ended up demonstrating its effectiveness and being recognized for it: out of the 30 thousand people he vaccinated only 54 died. Russian-Jewish bacteriologist Waldemar Haffkine also developed a human cholera vaccine in July 1892. He conducted a massive inoculation program in British India.

Persons who survive an episode of cholera have long-lasting immunity for at least 3 years (the period tested). A number of safe and effective oral vaccines for cholera are available. The World Health Organization (WHO) has three prequalified oral cholera vaccines (OCVs): Dukoral, Sanchol, and Euvichol. Dukoral, an orally administered, inactivated whole-cell vaccine, has an overall efficacy of about 52% during the first year after being given and 62% in the second year, with minimal side effects. It is available in over 60 countries. However, it is not currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for most people traveling from the United States to endemic countries. The vaccine that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends, Vaxchora, is an oral attenuated live vaccine, that is effective for adults aged 18–64 as a single dose.

One injectable vaccine was found to be effective for two to three years. The protective efficacy was 28% lower in children less than five years old. However, , it has limited availability. Work is under way to investigate the role of mass vaccination. The WHO recommends immunization of high-risk groups, such as children and people with HIV, in countries where this disease is endemic. If people are immunized broadly, herd immunity results, with a decrease in the amount of contamination in the environment.

WHO recommends that oral cholera vaccination be considered in areas where the disease is endemic (with seasonal peaks), as part of the response to outbreaks, or in a humanitarian crisis during which the risk of cholera is high. OCV has been recognized as an adjunct tool for prevention and control of cholera. The WHO has prequalified three bivalent cholera vaccines—Dukoral (SBL Vaccines), containing a non-toxic B-subunit of cholera toxin and providing protection against &quot;V. cholerae&quot; O1; and two vaccines developed using the same transfer of technology—ShanChol (Shantha Biotec) and Euvichol (EuBiologics Co.), which have bivalent O1 and O139 oral killed cholera vaccines. Oral cholera vaccination could be deployed in a diverse range of situations from cholera-endemic areas and locations of humanitarian crises, but no clear consensus exists.

=== Sari filtration ===


Developed for use in Bangladesh, the &quot;sari filter&quot; is a simple and cost-effective appropriate technology method for reducing the contamination of drinking water. Used sari cloth is preferable but other types of used cloth can be used with some effect, though the effectiveness will vary significantly. Used cloth is more effective than new cloth, as the repeated washing reduces the space between the fibers. Water collected in this way has a greatly reduced pathogen count—though it will not necessarily be perfectly safe, it is an improvement for poor people with limited options. In Bangladesh this practice was found to decrease rates of cholera by nearly half. It involves folding a &quot;sari&quot; four to eight times. Between uses the cloth should be rinsed in clean water and dried in the sun to kill any bacteria on it. A nylon cloth appears to work as well but is not as affordable.

== Treatment ==

Continued eating speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. The WHO recommends this generally for cases of diarrhea no matter what the underlying cause. A CDC training manual specifically for cholera states: &quot;Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently.&quot;

=== Fluids ===
The most common error in caring for patients with cholera is to underestimate the speed
and volume of fluids required. In most cases, cholera can be successfully treated with oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which is highly effective, safe, and simple to administer. Rice-based solutions are preferred to glucose-based ones due to greater efficiency. In severe cases with significant dehydration, intravenous rehydration may be necessary. Ringer&#x27;s lactate is the preferred solution, often with added potassium. Large volumes and continued replacement until diarrhea has subsided may be needed. Ten percent of a person&#x27;s body weight in fluid may need to be given in the first two to four hours. This method was first tried on a mass scale during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and was found to have much success. Despite widespread beliefs, fruit juices and commercial fizzy drinks like cola are not ideal for rehydration of people with serious infections of the intestines, and their excessive sugar content may even harm water uptake.

If commercially produced oral rehydration solutions are too expensive or difficult to obtain, solutions can be made. One such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste.

=== Electrolytes ===
As there frequently is initially acidosis, the potassium level may be normal, even though large losses have occurred. As the dehydration is corrected, potassium levels may decrease rapidly, and thus need to be replaced. This is best done by Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS).

=== Antibiotics ===
Antibiotic treatments for one to three days shorten the course of the disease and reduce the severity of the symptoms. Use of antibiotics also reduces fluid requirements. People will recover without them, however, if sufficient hydration is maintained. The WHO only recommends antibiotics in those with severe dehydration.

Doxycycline is typically used first line, although some strains of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; have shown resistance. Testing for resistance during an outbreak can help determine appropriate future choices. Other antibiotics proven to be effective include cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and furazolidone. Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, also may be used, but resistance has been reported.

Antibiotics improve outcomes in those who are both severely and not severely dehydrated. Azithromycin and tetracycline may work better than doxycycline or ciprofloxacin.

=== Zinc supplementation ===
In Bangladesh zinc supplementation reduced the duration and severity of diarrhea in children with cholera when given with antibiotics and rehydration therapy as needed. It reduced the length of disease by eight hours and the amount of diarrhea stool by 10%. Supplementation appears to be also effective in both treating and preventing infectious diarrhea due to other causes among children in the developing world.

== Prognosis ==
If people with cholera are treated quickly and properly, the mortality rate is less than 1%; however, with untreated cholera, the mortality rate rises to 50–60%.

For certain genetic strains of cholera, such as the one present during the 2010 epidemic in Haiti and the 2004 outbreak in India, death can occur within two hours of becoming ill.

== Epidemiology ==
Cholera affects an estimated 2.8 million people worldwide, and causes approximately 95,000 deaths a year (uncertainty range: 21,000–143,000) . This occurs mainly in the developing world.

In the early 1980s, death rates are believed to have still been higher than three million a year. It is difficult to calculate exact numbers of cases, as many go unreported due to concerns that an outbreak may have a negative impact on the tourism of a country. As of 2004, cholera remained both epidemic and endemic in many areas of the world.

Recent major outbreaks are the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak and the 2016–2022 Yemen cholera outbreak. In October 2016, an outbreak of cholera began in war-ravaged Yemen. WHO called it &quot;the worst cholera outbreak in the world&quot;. In 2019, 93% of the reported 923,037 cholera cases were from Yemen (with 1911 deaths reported). Between September 2019 and September 2020, a global total of over 450,000 cases and over 900 deaths was reported; however, the accuracy of these numbers suffer from over-reporting from countries that report suspected cases (and not laboratory confirmed cases), as well as under-reporting from countries that do not report official cases (such as Bangladesh, India and Philippines).

Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, researchers still do not have a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human feces and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread. Bodies of water have been found to serve as a reservoir of infection, and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease.

Cholera had disappeared from the Americas for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared toward the end of that century, beginning with a severe outbreak in Peru. This was followed by the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak and another outbreak of cholera in Haiti amid the 2018–2023 Haitian crisis. the disease is endemic in Africa and some areas of eastern and western Asia (Bangladesh, India and Yemen). Cholera is not endemic in Europe; all reported cases had a travel history to endemic areas.

=== History of outbreaks ===


The word cholera is from &quot;kholera&quot; from χολή &quot;kholē&quot; &quot;bile&quot;. Cholera likely has its origins in the Indian subcontinent as evidenced by its prevalence in the region for centuries.

References to cholera appear in the European literature as early as 1642, from the Dutch physician Jakob de Bondt&#x27;s description in his De Medicina Indorum. (The &quot;Indorum&quot; of the title refers to the East Indies. He also gave first European descriptions of other diseases.) But at the time, the word &quot;cholera&quot; was historically used by European physicians to refer to any gastrointestinal upset resulting in yellow diarrhea. De Bondt thus used a common word already in regular use to describe the new disease. This was a frequent practice of the time. It was not until the 1830s that the name for severe yellow diarrhea changed in English from &quot;cholera&quot; to &quot;cholera morbus&quot; to differentiate it from what was then known as &quot;Asiatic cholera&quot;, or that associated with origins in India and the East.

Early outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent are believed to have been the result of crowded, poor living conditions, as well as the presence of pools of still water, both of which provide ideal conditions for cholera to thrive. The disease first spread by travelers along trade routes (land and sea) to Russia in 1817, later to the rest of Europe, and from Europe to North America and the rest of the world, (hence the name &quot;Asiatic cholera&quot;). Seven cholera pandemics have occurred since the early 19th century; the first one did not reach the Americas. The seventh pandemic originated in Indonesia in 1961.

The first cholera pandemic occurred in the Bengal region of India, near Calcutta starting in 1817 through 1824. The disease dispersed from India to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Eastern Africa. The movement of British Army and Navy ships and personnel is believed to have contributed to the range of the pandemic, since the ships carried people with the disease to the shores of the Indian Ocean, from Africa to Indonesia, and north to China and Japan.

The second pandemic lasted from 1826 to 1837 and particularly affected North America and Europe. Advancements in transport and global trade, and increased human migration, including soldiers, meant that more people were carrying the disease more widely.

The third pandemic erupted in 1846, persisted until 1860, extended to North Africa, and reached North and South America. It was introduced to North America at Quebec, Canada, via Irish immigrants from the Great Famine. In this pandemic, Brazil was affected for the first time.

The fourth pandemic lasted from 1863 to 1875, spreading from India to Naples and Spain, and reaching the United States at New Orleans, Louisiana in 1873. It spread throughout the Mississippi River system on the continent.

The fifth pandemic was from 1881 to 1896. It started in India and spread to Europe, Asia, and South America. The sixth pandemic ran from 1899 to 1923. These epidemics had a lower number of fatalities because physicians and researchers had a greater understanding of the cholera bacteria. Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, Persia, India, and the Philippines were hit hardest during these epidemics. Other areas, such as Germany in 1892 (primarily the city of Hamburg, where more than 8.600 people died) and Naples from 1910 to 1911, also had severe outbreaks.

The seventh pandemic originated in 1961 in Indonesia and is marked by the emergence of a new strain, nicknamed &quot;El Tor&quot;, which still persists () in developing countries. This pandemic had initially subsided about 1975 and was thought to have ended, but, as noted, it has persisted. There were a rise in cases in the 1990s and since.

Cholera became widespread in the 19th century. Since then it has killed tens of millions of people. In Russia alone, between 1847 and 1851, more than one million people died from the disease. It killed 150,000 Americans during the second pandemic. Between 1900 and 1920, perhaps eight million people died of cholera in India. Cholera officially became the first reportable disease in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health. John Snow, in England, in 1854 was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water as its source of transmission. Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies, but it still strongly affects populations in developing countries.

In the past, vessels flew a yellow quarantine flag if any crew members or passengers had cholera. No one aboard a vessel flying a yellow flag would be allowed ashore for an extended period, typically 30 to 40 days.

Historically many different claimed remedies have existed in folklore. Many of the older remedies were based on the miasma theory, that the disease was transmitted by bad air. Some believed that abdominal chilling made one more susceptible, and flannel and cholera belts were included in army kits. In the 1854–1855 outbreak in Naples, homeopathic camphor was used according to Hahnemann. Dr. Hahnemann laid down three main remedies that would be curative in that disease; in early and simple cases camphor; in later stages with excessive cramping, cuprum or with excessive evacuations and profuse cold sweat, veratrum album. These are the Trio Cholera remedies used by homoeopaths around the world.
T. J. Ritter&#x27;s &quot;Mother&#x27;s Remedies&quot; book lists tomato syrup as a home remedy from northern America. Elecampane was recommended in the United Kingdom, according to William Thomas Fernie. The first effective human vaccine was developed in 1885, and the first effective antibiotic was developed in 1948.

Cholera cases are much less frequent in developed countries where governments have helped to establish water sanitation practices and effective medical treatments. In the 19th century the United States, for example, had a severe cholera problem similar to those in some developing countries. It had three large cholera outbreaks in the 1800s, which can be attributed to &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; spread through interior waterways such as the Erie Canal and the extensive Mississippi River valley system, as well as the major ports along the Eastern Seaboard and their cities upriver. The island of Manhattan in New York City touches the Atlantic Ocean, where cholera collected from river waters and ship discharges just off the coast. At this time, New York City did not have as effective a sanitation system as it developed in the later 20th century, so cholera spread through the city&#x27;s water supply.

Cholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically to what is now defined as the disease of cholera.

=== Research ===


One of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist John Snow (1813–1858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water. Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849. In his major &quot;state of the art&quot; review of 1855, he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the cause of the disease. In two pioneering epidemiological field studies, he was able to demonstrate human sewage contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in London in 1854. His model was not immediately accepted, but it was increasingly seen as plausible as medical microbiology developed over the next 30 years or so. For his work on cholera, John Snow is often regarded as the &quot;Father of Epidemiology&quot;.

The bacterium was isolated in 1854 by Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini, but its exact nature and his results were not widely known. In the same year, the Catalan Joaquim Balcells i Pascual discovered the bacterium. In 1856 António Augusto da Costa Simões and José Ferreira de Macedo Pinto, two Portuguese researchers, are believed to have done the same.

Between the mid-1850s and the 1900s, cities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and well-separated sewage treatment infrastructures. This eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world. In 1883, Robert Koch identified &quot;V. cholerae&quot; with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease.

Hemendra Nath Chatterjee, a Bengali scientist, was the first to formulate and demonstrate the effectiveness of oral rehydration salt (ORS) to treat diarrhea. In his 1953 paper, published in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, he states that promethazine can stop vomiting during cholera and then oral rehydration is possible. The formulation of the fluid replacement solution was 4 g of sodium chloride, 25 g of glucose and 1000 ml of water.
Indian medical scientist Sambhu Nath De discovered the cholera toxin, the &quot;animal model of cholera&quot;, and successfully demonstrated the method of transmission of cholera pathogen &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;.

Robert Allan Phillips, working at US Naval Medical Research Unit Two in Southeast Asia, evaluated the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques. He developed a protocol for rehydration. His research led the Lasker Foundation to award him its prize in 1967.

More recently, in 2002, Alam, &quot;et al.&quot;, studied stool samples from patients at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease in Dhaka, Bangladesh. From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of &quot;V. cholerae&quot; through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state. Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where genes that control biosynthesis of amino acids, iron uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the &quot;rice water&quot; stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection.

=== Global Strategy ===
In 2017, the WHO launched the &quot;Ending Cholera: a global roadmap to 2030&quot; strategy which aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by 2030. The strategy was developed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) which develops country-specific plans and monitors progress. The approach to achieve this goal combines surveillance, water sanitation, rehydration treatment and oral vaccines. Specifically, the control strategy focuses on three approaches: i) early detection and response to outbreaks to contain outbreaks, ii) stopping cholera transmission through improved sanitation and vaccines in hotspots, and iii) a global framework for cholera control through the GTFCC.

The WHO and the GTFCC do not consider global cholera eradication a viable goal. Even though humans are the only host of cholera, the bacterium can persist in the environment without a human host. While global eradication is not possible, elimination of human to human transmission may be possible. Local elimination is possible, which has been underway most recently during the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak. Haiti aims to achieve certification of elimination by 2022.

The GTFCC targets 47 countries, 13 of which have established vaccination campaigns.

== Society and culture ==

=== Health policy ===
In many developing countries, cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease. Governments can play a role in this. In 2008, for example, the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak was due partly to the government&#x27;s role, according to a report from the James Baker Institute. The Haitian government&#x27;s inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well.

Similarly, South Africa&#x27;s cholera outbreak was exacerbated by the government&#x27;s policy of privatizing water programs. The wealthy elite of the country were able to afford safe water while others had to use water from cholera-infected rivers.

According to Rita R. Colwell of the James Baker Institute, if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government&#x27;s ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; specimens. Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government&#x27;s ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be &quot;Cholera-affected&quot;; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health. These task forces promoted the boiling of water to obtain safe water, and provided chlorine and oral rehydration salts. Ultimately, this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government&#x27;s surveillance program. This inhibited physicians&#x27; abilities to detect cholera cases early.

According to Colwell, the quality and inclusiveness of a country&#x27;s health care system affects the control of cholera, as it did in the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak. While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the country&#x27;s poor. The speed with which government leaders respond to cholera outbreaks is important.

Besides contributing to an effective or declining public health care system and water sanitation treatments, government can have indirect effects on cholera control and the effectiveness of a response to cholera. A country&#x27;s government can impact its ability to prevent disease and control its spread. A speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent cholera&#x27;s spread. This limits cholera&#x27;s ability to cause death, or at the very least a decline in education, as children are kept out of school to minimize the risk of infection. Inversely, poor government response can lead to civil unrest and cholera riots.

=== Notable cases ===
* Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death has traditionally been attributed to cholera, most probably contracted through drinking contaminated water several days earlier. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s mother died of cholera, and his father became sick with cholera at this time but made a full recovery. Some scholars, however, including English musicologist and Tchaikovsky authority David Brown and biographer Anthony Holden, have theorized that his death was a suicide.
* 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak. Ten months after the 2010 earthquake, an outbreak swept over Haiti, traced to a United Nations base of peacekeepers from Nepal. This marks the worst cholera outbreak in recent history, as well as the best documented cholera outbreak in modern public health.
* Adam Mickiewicz, Polish poet and novelist, is thought to have died of cholera in Istanbul in 1855.
* Sadi Carnot, physicist, a pioneer of thermodynamics (d. 1832)
* Charles X, King of France (d. 1836)
* James K. Polk, eleventh president of the United States (d. 1849)
* Carl von Clausewitz, Prussian soldier and German military theorist (d. 1831)
* Elliot Bovill, Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements (1893)
*Nikola Tesla, Serbian-American inventor, engineer and futurist known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system, contracted cholera in 1873 at the age of 17. He was bedridden for nine months, and near death multiple times, but survived and fully recovered.

===In popular culture===
Unlike tuberculosis (&quot;consumption&quot;) which in literature and the arts was often romanticized as a disease of denizens of the demimonde or those with an artistic temperament, cholera is a disease which almost entirely affects the poor living in unsanitary conditions. This, and the unpleasant course of the disease – which includes voluminous &quot;rice-water&quot; diarrhea, the hemorrhaging of liquids from the mouth, and violent muscle contractions which continue even after death – has discouraged the disease from being romanticized, or even being factually presented in popular culture.
* The 1889 novel &quot;Mastro-don Gesualdo&quot; by Giovanni Verga presents the course of a cholera epidemic across the island of Sicily, but does not show the suffering of those affected.
* Cholera is a major plot device in The Painted Veil, a 1925 novel by W. Somerset Maugham. The story concerns a shy bacteriologist who discovers his young, pretty wife is having an adulterous affair. The doctor exacts revenge on his wife by inducing her to travel with him to mainland China which is in the grips of an horrific cholera outbreak. The ravages of the disease are frankly described in the novel.
* In Thomas Mann&#x27;s novella &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, first published in 1912 as &quot;Der Tod in Venedig&quot;, Mann &quot;presented the disease as emblematic of the final &#x27;bestial degradation&#x27; of the sexually transgressive author Gustav von Aschenbach.&quot; Contrary to the actual facts of how violently cholera kills, Mann has his protagonist die peacefully on a beach in a deck chair. Luchino Visconti&#x27;s 1971 film version also hid from the audience the actual course of the disease. Mann&#x27;s novella was also made into an opera by Benjamin Britten in 1973, his last one, and into a ballet by John Neumeier for his Hamburg Ballet company, in December 2003.*
* &quot;The Horseman on the Roof&quot; (orig. French &quot;Le Hussard sur le toit&quot;) is a 1951 adventure novel written by Jean Giono. It tells the story of Angelo Pardi, a young Italian carbonaro colonel of hussars, caught up in the 1832 cholera epidemic in Provence. In 1995, it was made into a film of the same name directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau.
* In Gabriel Garcia Márquez&#x27;s 1985 novel &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;, cholera is &quot;a looming background presence rather than a central figure requiring vile description.&quot; The novel was adapted in 2007 for the film of the same name directed by Mike Newell.
* In &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, Mary Lennox&#x27;s parents die from cholera.

== Country examples ==

=== Zambia ===
In Zambia, widespread cholera outbreaks have occurred since 1977, most commonly in the capital city of Lusaka. In 2017, an outbreak of cholera was declared in Zambia after laboratory confirmation of &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa, from stool samples from two patients with acute watery diarrhea. There was a rapid increase in the number of cases from several hundred cases in early December 2017 to approximately 2,000 by early January 2018. With intensification of the rains, new cases increased on a daily basis reaching a peak on the first week of January 2018 with over 700 cases reported.

In collaboration with partners, the Zambia Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a multifaceted public health response that included increased chlorination of the Lusaka municipal water supply, provision of emergency water supplies, water quality monitoring and testing, enhanced surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, a cholera vaccination campaign, aggressive case management and health care worker training, and laboratory testing of clinical samples.

The Zambian Ministry of Health implemented a reactive one-dose Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in April 2016 in three Lusaka compounds, followed by a pre-emptive second-round in December.

Nigeria

In June 2024, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) announced a total of 1,141 suspected and 65 confirmed cases of cholera with 30 deaths from 96 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 30 states of the country. NCDC, in its public health advisory, said Abia, Bayelsa, Bauchi, Cross River, Delta, Imo, Katsina, Lagos, Nasarawa and Zamfara states were the 10 states that contributed 90 percent of the burden of cholera in the country at the time.

=== India ===

The city of Kolkata, India, in the state of West Bengal in the Ganges delta, has been described as the &quot;homeland of cholera&quot;, with regular outbreaks and pronounced seasonality. In India, where the disease is endemic, cholera outbreaks occur every year between dry seasons and rainy seasons. India is also characterized by high population density, unsafe drinking water, open drains, and poor sanitation, which provide an optimal niche for survival, sustenance, and transmission of &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;.

=== Democratic Republic of Congo ===
In Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, cholera has left an enduring mark on human and medical history. Cholera pandemics in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the growth of epidemiology as a science and in recent years it has continued to press advances in the concepts of disease ecology, basic membrane biology, and transmembrane signaling and in the use of scientific information and treatment design.

<text>A caldera ( ) is a large cauldron-like hollow that forms shortly after the emptying of a magma chamber in a volcanic eruption. An eruption that ejects large volumes of magma over a short period of time can cause significant detriment to the structural integrity of such a chamber, greatly diminishing its capacity to support its own roof, and any substrate or rock resting above. The ground surface then collapses into the emptied or partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a large depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Compared to the thousands of volcanic eruptions that occur over the course of a century, the formation of a caldera is a rare event, occurring only a few times within a given window of 100 years. Only eight caldera-forming collapses are known to have occurred between 1911 and 2018, with a caldera collapse at Kīlauea, Hawaii in 2018. Volcanoes that have formed a caldera are sometimes described as &quot;caldera volcanoes&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;caldera&quot; comes from Spanish &#x27;, and Latin &#x27;, meaning &quot;cooking pot&quot;. In some texts the English term &quot;cauldron&quot; is also used, though in more recent work the term &quot;cauldron&quot; refers to a caldera that has been deeply eroded to expose the beds under the caldera floor. The term &quot;caldera&quot; was introduced into the geological vocabulary by the German geologist Leopold von Buch when he published his memoirs of his 1815 visit to the Canary Islands, where he first saw the Las Cañadas caldera on Tenerife, with Mount Teide dominating the landscape, and then the Caldera de Taburiente on La Palma.

==Caldera formation==


A collapse is triggered by the emptying of the magma chamber beneath the volcano, sometimes as the result of a large explosive volcanic eruption (see Tambora in 1815), but also during effusive eruptions on the flanks of a volcano (see Piton de la Fournaise in 2007) or in a connected fissure system (see Bárðarbunga in 2014–2015). If enough magma is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it. A roughly circular fracture, the &quot;ring fault&quot;, develops around the edge of the chamber. Ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions which are also known as ring dikes. Secondary volcanic vents may form above the ring fracture. As the magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse. The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions. The total area that collapses may be hundreds of square kilometers.

== Mineralization in calderas ==
Some calderas are known to host rich ore deposits. Metal-rich fluids can circulate through the caldera, forming hydrothermal ore deposits of metals such as lead, silver, gold, mercury, lithium, and uranium. One of the world&#x27;s best-preserved mineralized calderas is the Sturgeon Lake Caldera in northwestern Ontario, Canada, which formed during the Neoarchean era about 2.7 billion years ago. In the San Juan volcanic field, ore veins were emplaced in fractures associated with several calderas, with the greatest mineralization taking place near the youngest and most silicic intrusions associated with each caldera.

== Types of caldera ==

===Explosive caldera eruptions===

Explosive caldera eruptions are produced by a magma chamber whose magma is rich in silica. Silica-rich magma has a high viscosity, and therefore does not flow easily like basalt. The magma typically also contains a large amount of dissolved gases, up to 7 wt% for the most silica-rich magmas. When the magma approaches the surface of the Earth, the drop in confining pressure causes the trapped gases to rapidly bubble out of the magma, fragmenting the magma to produce a mixture of volcanic ash and other tephra with the very hot gases.

The mixture of ash and volcanic gases initially rises into the atmosphere as an eruption column. However, as the volume of erupted material increases, the eruption column is unable to entrain enough air to remain buoyant, and the eruption column collapses into a tephra fountain that falls back to the surface to form pyroclastic flows. Eruptions of this type can spread ash over vast areas, so that ash flow tuffs emplaced by silicic caldera eruptions are the only volcanic product with volumes rivaling those of flood basalts. For example, when Yellowstone Caldera last erupted some 650,000 years ago, it released about 1,000 km3 of material (as measured in dense rock equivalent (DRE)), covering a substantial part of North America in up to two metres of debris.

Eruptions forming even larger calderas are known, such as the La Garita Caldera in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, where the Fish Canyon Tuff was blasted out in eruptions about 27.8 million years ago.
The caldera produced by such eruptions is typically filled in with tuff, rhyolite, and other igneous rocks. The caldera is surrounded by an outflow sheet of ash flow tuff (also called an ash flow sheet).

If magma continues to be injected into the collapsed magma chamber, the center of the caldera may be uplifted in the form of a &quot;resurgent dome&quot; such as is seen at the Valles Caldera, Lake Toba, the San Juan volcanic field, Cerro Galán, Yellowstone, and many other calderas.

Because a silicic caldera may erupt hundreds or even thousands of cubic kilometers of material in a single event, it can cause catastrophic environmental effects. Even small caldera-forming eruptions, such as Krakatoa in 1883 or Mount Pinatubo in 1991, may result in significant local destruction and a noticeable drop in temperature around the world. Large calderas may have even greater effects. The ecological effects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record of the Lake Toba eruption in Indonesia.

At some points in geological time, rhyolitic calderas have appeared in distinct clusters. The remnants of such clusters may be found in places such as the Eocene Rum Complex of Scotland, the San Juan Mountains of Colorado (formed during the Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene epochs) or the Saint Francois Mountain Range of Missouri (erupted during the Proterozoic eon).

====Valles====
For their 1968 paper that first introduced the concept of a resurgent caldera to geology, R.L. Smith and R.A. Bailey chose the Valles caldera as their model. Although the Valles caldera is not unusually large, it is relatively young (1.25 million years old) and unusually well preserved, and it remains one of the best studied examples of a resurgent caldera. The ash flow tuffs of the Valles caldera, such as the Bandelier Tuff, were among the first to be thoroughly characterized.

====Toba====
About 74,000 years ago, this Indonesian volcano released about dense-rock equivalent of ejecta. This was the largest known eruption during the ongoing Quaternary period (the last 2.6 million years) and the largest known explosive eruption during the last 25 million years. In the late 1990s, anthropologist Stanley Ambrose proposed that a volcanic winter induced by this eruption reduced the human population to about 2,000–20,000 individuals, resulting in a population bottleneck. More recently, Lynn Jorde and Henry Harpending proposed that the human species was reduced to approximately 5,000–10,000 people. There is no direct evidence, however, that either theory is correct, and there is no evidence for any other animal decline or extinction, even in environmentally sensitive species. There is evidence that human habitation continued in India after the eruption.


===Non-explosive calderas===
Some volcanoes, such as the large shield volcanoes Kīlauea and Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii, form calderas in a different fashion. The magma feeding these volcanoes is basalt, which is silica poor. As a result, the magma is much less viscous than the magma of a rhyolitic volcano, and the magma chamber is drained by large lava flows rather than by explosive events. The resulting calderas are also known as subsidence calderas and can form more gradually than explosive calderas. For instance, the caldera atop Fernandina Island collapsed in 1968 when parts of the caldera floor dropped .

==Extraterrestrial calderas==
Since the early 1960s, it has been known that volcanism has occurred on other planets and moons in the Solar System. Through the use of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, volcanism has been discovered on Venus, Mars, the Moon, and Io, a satellite of Jupiter. None of these worlds have plate tectonics, which contributes approximately 60% of the Earth&#x27;s volcanic activity (the other 40% is attributed to hotspot volcanism). Caldera structure is similar on all of these planetary bodies, though the size varies considerably. The average caldera diameter on Venus is . The average caldera diameter on Io is close to , and the mode is ; Tvashtar Paterae is likely the largest caldera with a diameter of . The average caldera diameter on Mars is , smaller than Venus. Calderas on Earth are the smallest of all planetary bodies and vary from as a maximum.

===The Moon===

The Moon has an outer shell of low-density crystalline rock that is a few hundred kilometers thick, which formed due to a rapid creation. The craters of the Moon have been well preserved through time and were once thought to have been the result of extreme volcanic activity, but are currently believed to have been formed by meteorites, nearly all of which took place in the first few hundred million years after the Moon formed. Around 500 million years afterward, the Moon&#x27;s mantle was able to be extensively melted due to the decay of radioactive elements. Massive basaltic eruptions took place generally at the base of large impact craters. Also, eruptions may have taken place due to a magma reservoir at the base of the crust. This forms a dome, possibly the same morphology of a shield volcano where calderas universally are known to form. Although caldera-like structures are rare on the Moon, they are not completely absent. The Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex on the far side of the Moon is thought to be a caldera, possibly an ash-flow caldera.

===Mars===

The volcanic activity of Mars is concentrated in two major provinces: Tharsis and Elysium. Each province contains a series of giant shield volcanoes that are similar to what we see on Earth and likely are the result of mantle hot spots. The surfaces are dominated by lava flows, and all have one or more collapse calderas. Mars has the tallest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, which is more than three times the height of Mount Everest, with a diameter of 520 km (323 miles). The summit of the mountain has six nested calderas.

===Venus===

Because there is no plate tectonics on Venus, heat is mainly lost by conduction through the lithosphere. This causes enormous lava flows, accounting for 80% of Venus&#x27; surface area. Many of the mountains are large shield volcanoes that range in size from in diameter and high. More than 80 of these large shield volcanoes have summit calderas averaging across.

===Io===

Io, unusually, is heated by solid flexing due to the tidal influence of Jupiter and Io&#x27;s orbital resonance with neighboring large moons Europa and Ganymede, which keep its orbit slightly eccentric. Unlike any of the planets mentioned, Io is continuously volcanically active. For example, the NASA &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft detected nine erupting volcanoes while passing Io in 1979. Io has many calderas with diameters tens of kilometers across.

<text>An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are scientific calculators, which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space. , basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.

Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and interactive BASIC could be used to do calculations on most 1970s and 1980s home computers. Calculator functions are included in most smartphones, tablets, and personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices. With the very wide availability of smartphones and the like, dedicated hardware calculators, while still widely used, are less common than they once were. In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world&#x27;s general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information. By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%.

==Design==
===Input===
Electronic calculators contain a keyboard with buttons for digits and arithmetical operations; some even contain &quot;00&quot; and &quot;000&quot; buttons to make larger or smaller numbers easier to enter. Most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button; however, in more specific calculators, a button can perform multi-function working with key combinations.

===Display output===
Calculators usually have liquid-crystal displays (LCD) as output in place of historical light-emitting diode (LED) displays and vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD); details are provided in the section &quot;Technical improvements&quot;.

Large-sized figures are often used to improve readability; while using decimal separator (usually a point rather than a comma) instead of or in addition to vulgar fractions. Various symbols for function commands may also be shown on the display. Fractions such as are displayed as decimal approximations, for example rounded to . Also, some fractions (such as , which is ; to 14 significant figures) can be difficult to recognize in decimal form; as a result, many scientific calculators are able to work in vulgar fractions or mixed numbers.

===Memory===
Calculators also have the ability to save numbers into computer memory. Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in variables. Usually these variables are named ans or ans(0). The variables can also be used for constructing formulas. Some models have the ability to extend memory capacity to store more numbers; the extended memory address is termed an array index.

===Power source===
Power sources of calculators are batteries, solar cells or mains electricity (for old models), turning on with a switch or button. Some models even have no turn-off button but they provide some way to put off (for example, leaving no operation for a moment, covering solar cell exposure, or closing their lid). Crank-powered calculators were also common in the early computer era.

===Key layout===
The following keys are common to most pocket calculators. While the arrangement of the digits is standard, the positions of other keys vary from model to model; the illustration is an example.
The arrangement of digits on calculator and other numeric keypads with the -- keys two rows above the -- keys is derived from calculators and cash registers. It is notably different from the layout of telephone Touch-Tone keypads which have the -- keys on top and -- keys on the third row.

==Internal workings==
In general, a basic electronic calculator consists of the following components:

* Power source (mains electricity, battery and/or solar cell)
* Keypad (input device) – consists of keys used to input numbers and function commands (addition, multiplication, square root, etc.)
* Display panel (output device) – displays input numbers, commands and results. Liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), vacuum fluorescent displays (VFDs), and light-emitting diode (LED) displays use seven segments to represent each digit in a basic calculator. Advanced calculators may use dot matrix displays.
** A printing calculator, in addition to a display panel, has a printing unit that prints results in ink onto a roll of paper, using a printing mechanism.
* Processor chip (microprocessor or central processing unit).


Clock rate of a processor chip refers to the frequency at which the central processing unit (CPU) is running. It is used as an indicator of the processor&#x27;s speed, and is measured in &quot;clock cycles per second&quot; or hertz (Hz). For basic calculators, the speed can vary from a few hundred hertz to the kilohertz range.

===Example===

A basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four-function calculator:

To perform the calculation , one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators:     .

:* When   is entered, it is picked up by the scanning unit; the number 25 is encoded and sent to the X register;
:* Next, when the key is pressed, the &quot;addition&quot; instruction is also encoded and sent to the flag or the status register;
:* The second number is encoded and sent to the X register. This &quot;pushes&quot; (shifts) the first number out into the Y register;
:* When the key is pressed, a &quot;message&quot; (signal) from the flag or status register tells the permanent or non-volatile memory that the operation to be done is &quot;addition&quot;;
:* The numbers in the X and Y registers are then loaded into the ALU and the calculation is carried out following instructions from the permanent or non-volatile memory;
:* The answer, 34 is sent (shifted) back to the X register. From there, it is converted by the binary decoder unit into a decimal number (usually binary-coded decimal), and then shown on the display panel.

Other functions are usually performed using repeated additions or subtractions.

====Numeric representation====
Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in binary-coded decimal (BCD) rather than binary. BCD is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical seven-segment displays to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary. (For example, CDs keep the track number in BCD, limiting them to 99 tracks.)

The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.

Where calculators have added functions (such as square root, or trigonometric functions), software algorithms are required to produce high precision results. Sometimes significant design effort is needed to fit all the desired functions in the limited memory space available in the calculator chip, with acceptable calculation time.

==History==

===Precursors to the electronic calculator===

The first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were: bones (used to tally items), pebbles, and counting boards, and the abacus, known to have been used by Sumerians and Egyptians before 2000 BC. Except for the Antikythera mechanism (an &quot;out of the time&quot; astronomical device), development of computing tools arrived near the start of the 17th century: the geometric-military compass (by Galileo), logarithms and Napier bones (by Napier), and the slide rule (by Edmund Gunter).
The Renaissance saw the invention of the mechanical calculator by Wilhelm Schickard in 1623, and later by Blaise Pascal in 1642. A device that was at times somewhat over-promoted as being able to perform all four arithmetic operations with minimal human intervention. Pascal&#x27;s calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus, if the tedium could be borne, multiply and divide by repetition. Schickard&#x27;s machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation. There is a debate about whether Pascal or Shickard should be credited as the known inventor of a calculating machine due to the differences (like the different aims) of both inventions. Schickard and Pascal were followed by Gottfried Leibniz who spent forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, the stepped reckoner, inventing in the process his leibniz wheel, but who couldn&#x27;t design a fully operational machine. There were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th century.
The 18th century saw the arrival of some notable improvements, first by Poleni with the first fully functional calculating clock and four-operation machine, but these machines were almost always &quot;one of a kind&quot;. Luigi Torchi invented the first direct multiplication machine in 1834: this was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White (1822). It was not until the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution that real developments began to occur. Although machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed prior to the 19th century, the refinement of manufacturing and fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made large scale production of more compact and modern units possible. The Arithmometer, invented in 1820 as a four-operation mechanical calculator, was released to production in 1851 as an adding machine and became the first commercially successful unit; forty years later, by 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold plus a few hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany, 1878 and Layton, UK, 1883) and Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100 comptometers.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1902 that the familiar push-button user interface was developed, with the introduction of the Dalton Adding Machine, developed by James L. Dalton in the United States.

In 1921, Edith Clarke invented the &quot;Clarke calculator&quot;, a simple graph-based calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions. This allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for inductance and capacitance in power transmission lines.

The Curta calculator was developed in 1948 and, although costly, became popular for its portability. This purely mechanical hand-held device could do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.

===Development of electronic calculators===
The first mainframe computers, initially using vacuum tubes and later transistors in the logic circuits, appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. Electronic circuits developed for computers also had application to electronic calculators.

The Casio Computer Company, in Japan, released the Model &quot;14-A&quot; calculator in 1957, which was the world&#x27;s first all-electric (relatively) compact calculator. It did not use electronic logic but was based on relay technology, and was built into a desk. The IBM 608 plugboard programmable calculator was IBM&#x27;s first all-transistor product, released in 1957; this was a console type system, with input and output on punched cards, and replaced the earlier, larger, vacuum-tube IBM 603. 
In October 1961, the world&#x27;s first &quot;all-electronic desktop&quot; calculator, the British Bell Punch/Sumlock Comptometer ANITA (A New Inspiration To Arithmetic/Accounting) was announced. This machine used vacuum tubes, cold-cathode tubes and Dekatrons in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode &quot;Nixie&quot; tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical comptometers of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later Sharp CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly due to its large tube system. Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names &quot;Plus&quot; and &quot;Sumlock&quot;, and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British Pilot ACE computer project, to lead the development. The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.

The tube technology of the ANITA was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured Friden EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a cathode-ray tube (CRT), and introduced Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: Sharp introduced the CS-10A, which weighed and cost 500,000 yen ($), and Industria Macchine Elettroniche of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time). The Victor 3900 was the first to use integrated circuits in place of individual transistors, but production problems delayed sales until 1966.
There followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including Canon, Mathatronics, Olivetti, SCM (Smith-Corona-Marchant), Sony, Toshiba, and Wang. The early calculators used hundreds of germanium transistors, which were cheaper than silicon transistors, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were CRT, cold-cathode Nixie tubes, and filament lamps. Memory technology was usually based on the delay-line memory or the magnetic-core memory, though the Toshiba &quot;Toscal&quot; BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of dynamic RAM built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.

Bulgaria&#x27;s ELKA 6521, introduced in 1965, was developed by the Central Institute for Calculation Technologies and built at the Elektronika factory in Sofia. The name derives from &quot;ELektronen KAlkulator&quot;, and it weighed around . It is the first calculator in the world which includes the square root function. Later that same year were released the ELKA 22 (with a luminescent display) and the ELKA 25, with an built-in printer. Several other models were developed until the first pocket model, the ELKA 101, was released in 1974. The writing on it was in Roman script, and it was exported to western countries.

====Programmable calculators====

The first desktop &quot;programmable calculators&quot; were produced in the mid-1960s. They included the Mathatronics Mathatron (1964) and the Olivetti Programma 101 (late 1965) which were solid-state, desktop, printing, floating point, algebraic entry, programmable, stored-program electronic calculators. Both could be programmed by the end user and print out their results. The Programma 101 saw much wider distribution and had the added feature of offline storage of programs via magnetic cards.

Another early programmable desktop calculator (and maybe the first Japanese one) was the Casio (AL-1000) produced in 1967. It featured a nixie tubes display and had transistor electronics and ferrite core memory.

The &quot;Monroe Epic&quot; programmable calculator came on the market in 1967. A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only &quot;branch&quot; instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) at the end of the operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any conditional branch (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer.

The first Soviet programmable desktop calculator ISKRA 123, powered by the power grid, was released at the start of the 1970s.

===1970s to mid-1980s===

The electronic calculators of the mid-1960s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of transistors on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an AC power supply. There were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer integrated circuits (chips) and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of semiconductor development. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers led the world in large scale integration (LSI) semiconductor development, squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits. This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U.S. semiconductor companies: Canon Inc. with Texas Instruments, Hayakawa Electric (later renamed Sharp Corporation) with North-American Rockwell Microelectronics (later renamed Rockwell International), Busicom with Mostek and Intel, and General Instrument with Sanyo.

====Pocket calculators====
By 1970, a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption, allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries. The first handheld calculator was a 1967 prototype called Cal Tech, whose development was led by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in a research project to produce a portable calculator. It could add, multiply, subtract, and divide, and its output device was a paper tape. As a result of the &quot;Cal-Tech&quot; project, Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators.

The first commercially produced portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the Sanyo ICC-0081 &quot;Mini Calculator&quot;, the Canon Pocketronic, and the Sharp QT-8B &quot;micro Compet&quot;. The Canon Pocketronic was a development from the &quot;Cal-Tech&quot; project. It had no traditional display; numerical output was on thermal paper tape.

Sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in January 1971 the Sharp EL-8, also marketed as the Facit 1111, which was close to being a pocket calculator. It weighed 1.59 pounds (721 grams), had a vacuum fluorescent display, rechargeable NiCad batteries, and initially sold for US$395.

However, integrated circuit development efforts culminated in early 1971 with the introduction of the first &quot;calculator on a chip&quot;, the MK6010 by Mostek, followed by Texas Instruments later in the year. Although these early hand-held calculators were very costly, these advances in electronics, together with developments in display technology (such as the vacuum fluorescent display, LED, and LCD), led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all.

In 1971, Pico Electronics and General Instrument also introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a full single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Royal Digital III calculator. Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. Pico and GI went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market.

The first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the Busicom LE-120A &quot;HANDY&quot;, which was marketed early in 1971. Made in Japan, this was also the first calculator to use an LED display, the first hand-held calculator to use a single integrated circuit (then proclaimed as a &quot;calculator on a chip&quot;), the Mostek MK6010, and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries. Using four AA-size cells the LE-120A measures .

The first European-made pocket-sized calculator, DB 800 was made in May 1971 by Digitron in Buje, Croatia (former Yugoslavia) with four functions and an eight-digit display and special characters for a negative number and a warning that the calculation has too many digits to display.

The first American-made pocket-sized calculator, the Bowmar 901B (popularly termed &quot;The Bowmar Brain&quot;), measuring , came out in the Autumn of 1971, with four functions and an eight-digit red LED display, for , while in August 1972 the four-function Sinclair Executive became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring and weighing . It retailed for around £79 ( at the time). By the end of the decade, similar calculators were priced less than £5 ($). Following protracted development over the course of two years including a botched partnership with Texas Instruments, Eldorado Electrodata released five pocket calculators in 1972. One called the Touch Magic was &quot;no bigger than a pack of cigarettes&quot; according to &quot;Administrative Management&quot;.

The first Soviet Union made pocket-sized calculator, the &quot;Elektronika B3-04&quot; was developed by the end of 1973 and sold at the start of 1974.

One of the first low-cost calculators was the Sinclair Cambridge, launched in August 1973. It retailed for £29.95 ($), or £5 ($) less in kit form, and later models included some scientific functions. The Sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition; however, their design led to slow and less accurate computations of transcendental functions (maximum three decimal places of accuracy).

===Scientific pocket calculators===

Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard (HP) had been developing a pocket calculator. Launched in early 1972, it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with &quot;scientific&quot; functions that could replace a slide rule. The $395 HP-35, along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, uses reverse Polish notation (RPN), also called postfix notation. A calculation like &quot;8 plus 5&quot; is, using RPN, performed by pressing , , , and ; instead of the algebraic infix notation: , , , . It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.

The first Soviet &quot;scientific&quot; pocket-sized calculator the &quot;B3-18&quot; was completed by the end of 1975.

In 1973, Texas Instruments (TI) introduced the SR-10, (&quot;SR&quot; signifying slide rule) an &quot;algebraic entry&quot; pocket calculator using scientific notation for $150. Shortly after the SR-11 featured an added key for entering pi (π). It was followed the next year by the SR-50 which added log and trig functions to compete with the HP-35, and in 1977 the mass-marketed TI-30 line which is still produced.

In 1978, a new company, Calculated Industries arose which focused on specialized markets. Their first calculator, the Loan Arranger (1978) was a pocket calculator marketed to the Real Estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values. In 1985, CI launched a calculator for the construction industry called the Construction Master which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations (such as angles, stairs, roofing math, pitch, rise, run, and feet-inch fraction conversions). This would be the first in a line of construction related calculators.

====Programmable pocket calculators====
The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced &quot;continuous memory&quot;, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first &quot;alphanumeric&quot;, programmable, &quot;expandable&quot; calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random-access memory (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).

The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, Elektronika &quot;B3-21&quot;, was developed by the end of 1976 and released at the start of 1977. The successor of B3-21, the Elektronika B3-34 wasn&#x27;t backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the reverse Polish notation (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including adventure games and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The Elektronika MK-52 calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal EEPROM memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for Soyuz TM-7 flight) as a backup of the board computer.

This series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter-intuitive mysterious undocumented features, somewhat similar to &quot;synthetic programming&quot; of the American HP-41, which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages, jumping to nonexistent addresses and other methods. A number of respected monthly publications, including the popular science magazine &quot;Nauka i Zhizn&quot; (&quot;Наука и жизнь&quot;, &quot;Science and Life&quot;), featured special columns, dedicated to optimization methods for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers, which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches, named &quot;yeggogology&quot; (&quot;еггогология&quot;). The error messages on those calculators appear as a Russian word &quot;YEGGOG&quot; (&quot;ЕГГОГ&quot;) which, unsurprisingly, is translated to &quot;Error&quot;.

A similar hacker culture in the US revolved around the HP-41, which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than B3-34.

====Technical improvements====

Through the 1970s the hand-held electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom &quot;LE-120A &quot;HANDY&quot;&quot; calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an LED display, and announced the Busicom &quot;LC&quot; with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by Rockwell International and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking &quot;LC-800&quot;, Harden &quot;DT/12&quot;, Ibico &quot;086&quot;, Lloyds &quot;40&quot;, Lloyds &quot;100&quot;, Prismatic &quot;500&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;P500&quot;), Rapid Data &quot;Rapidman 1208LC&quot;. The LCDs were an early form using the &quot;Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM&quot; with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.

A more successful series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD was launched in 1972 by Sharp Inc with the Sharp &quot;EL-805&quot;, which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharp&#x27;s &quot;Calculator On Substrate&quot; (COS) technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.

In the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with field-effect, &quot;twisted nematic&quot; (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging ultraviolet rays. The advantage of LCDs is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the Casio &quot;Mini Card LC-78&quot; of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.

There were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators. All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first &quot;calculator on a chip&quot; integrated circuits (ICs) in 1971, but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high. Many calculators continued to use two or more ICs, especially the scientific and the programmable ones, into the late 1970s.

The power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced, especially with the introduction of CMOS technology. Appearing in the Sharp &quot;EL-801&quot; in 1972, the transistors in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state. The LED and VFD displays often required added driver transistors or ICs, whereas the LCDs were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself.

With this low power consumption came the possibility of using solar cells as the power source, realised around 1978 by calculators such as the Royal &quot;Solar 1&quot;, Sharp &quot;EL-8026&quot;, and Teal &quot;Photon&quot;.

====Mass-market phase====
At the start of the 1970s, hand-held electronic calculators were very costly, at two or three weeks&#x27; wages, and so were a luxury item. The high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were costly to produce, and production runs that were too small to exploit economies of scale. Many firms saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on such high prices. However, the cost of calculators fell as components and their production methods improved, and the effect of economies of scale was felt.

By 1976, the cost of the cheapest four-function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars, about 1/20 of the cost five years before. The results of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable, and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit from calculators, leading to many firms dropping out of the business or closing. The firms that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators, or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators.

===Mid-1980s to present===

The first calculator capable of symbolic computing was the HP-28C, released in 1987. It could, for example, solve quadratic equations symbolically. The first graphing calculator was the Casio fx-7000G released in 1985.

The two leading manufacturers, HP and TI, released increasingly feature-laden calculators during the 1980s and 1990s. At the turn of the millennium, the line between a graphing calculator and a handheld computer was not always clear, as some very advanced calculators such as the TI-89, the Voyage 200 and HP-49G could differentiate and integrate functions, solve differential equations, run word processing and PIM software, and connect by wire or IR to other calculators/computers.

The HP 12c financial calculator is still produced. It was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with few changes. The HP 12c featured the reverse Polish notation mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the &quot;HP 12c platinum edition&quot; which added more memory, more built-in functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry.

Calculated Industries competed with the HP 12c in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling; changing the &quot;I&quot;, &quot;PV&quot;, &quot;FV&quot; to easier labeling terms such as &quot;Int&quot;, &quot;Term&quot;, &quot;Pmt&quot;, and not using the reverse Polish notation. However, CI&#x27;s more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators, which evolved and expanded in the 1990s to present. According to Mark Bollman, a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at Albion College, the &quot;Construction Master is the first in a long and profitable line of CI construction calculators&quot; which carried them through the 1980s, 1990s, and to the present.

==Use in education==

In most countries, students use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic or elementary arithmetic skills would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations &quot;in the head&quot;, with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching estimation methods and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in. Others have argued that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy, or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts. In December 2011 the UK&#x27;s Minister of State for Schools, Nick Gibb, voiced concern that children can become &quot;too dependent&quot; on the use of calculators. As a result, the use of calculators is to be included as part of a review of the Curriculum. In the United States, many math educators and boards of education have enthusiastically endorsed the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards and actively promoted the use of classroom calculators from kindergarten through high school.

Calculators may in some circumstances be used within school and college examinations. In the United Kingdom there are limitations on the type of calculator which may be used in an examination to avoid malpractice. Some calculators which offer additional functionality have an &quot;exam mode&quot; setting which makes them compliant with examination regulations.

==Personal computers==

Personal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functions of a calculator, using the graphical user interface to portray a calculator. Examples include the Windows Calculator, Apple&#x27;s Calculator, and KDE&#x27;s KCalc. Most personal data assistants (PDAs) and smartphones also have such a feature.

==Calculators compared to computers==

The fundamental difference between a calculator and computer is that a computer can be programmed in a way that allows the program to take different branches according to intermediate results, while calculators are pre-designed with specific functions (such as addition, multiplication, and logarithms) built in. The distinction is not clear-cut: some devices classed as programmable calculators have programming functions, sometimes with support for programming languages (such as RPL or TI-BASIC).

For instance, instead of a hardware multiplier, a calculator might implement floating point mathematics with code in read-only memory (ROM), and compute trigonometric functions with the CORDIC algorithm because CORDIC does not require much multiplication. Bit serial logic designs are more common in calculators whereas bit parallel designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes chip complexity, but takes many more clock cycles. This distinction blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, more so the Z80, MC68000, and ARM architectures, and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market.

<text>A cash register, sometimes called a till or automated money handling system, is a mechanical or electronic device for registering and calculating transactions at a point of sale. It is usually attached to a drawer for storing cash and other valuables. A modern cash register is usually attached to a printer that can print out receipts for record-keeping purposes.

==History==

An early mechanical cash register was invented by James Ritty and John Birch following the American Civil War. James was the owner of a saloon in Dayton, Ohio, US, and wanted to stop employees from pilfering his profits. The Ritty Model I was invented in 1879 after seeing a tool that counted the revolutions of the propeller on a steamship. With the help of James&#x27; brother John Ritty, they patented it in 1879. It was called &quot;Ritty&#x27;s Incorruptible Cashier&quot; and it was invented to stop cashiers from pilfering and eliminate employee theft and embezzlement.

Early mechanical registers were entirely mechanical, without receipts. The employee was required to ring up every transaction on the register, and when the total key was pushed, the drawer opened and a bell would ring, alerting the manager to a sale taking place. Those original machines were nothing but simple adding machines. For example, the Rittys’ patent application filed in 1879 for their “improved cash register” describes the device as follows: “The machine consists, essentially, of an inclosed case or frame provided with an index dial and indicator operated by a system of levers or keys and connected with a series of co-operating disks marked with numbers on their peripheries, a row of which numbers are disclosed by a transverse opening or openings in the case to show at a glance the sum-total of cash receipts.” 

Since the registration is done with the process of returning change, according to Bill Bryson odd pricing came about because by charging odd amounts like 49 and 99 cents (or 45 and 95 cents when nickels are more used than pennies), the cashier very probably had to open the till for the penny change and thus announce the sale.

Shortly after the patent, Ritty became overwhelmed with the responsibilities of running two businesses, so he sold all of his interests in the cash register business to Jacob H. Eckert of Cincinnati, a china and glassware salesman, who formed the National Manufacturing Company. In 1884 Eckert sold the company to John H. Patterson, who renamed the company the National Cash Register Company and improved the cash register by adding a paper roll to record sales transactions, thereby creating the journal for internal bookkeeping purposes, and the receipt for external bookkeeping purposes. The original purpose of the receipt was enhanced fraud protection. The business owner could read the receipts to ensure that cashiers charged customers the correct amount for each transaction and did not embezzle the cash drawer. It also prevents a customer from defrauding the business by falsely claiming receipt of a lesser amount of change or a transaction that never happened in the first place. The first evidence of an actual cash register was used in Coalton, Ohio, at the old mining company.

In 1906, while working at the National Cash Register company, inventor Charles F. Kettering designed a cash register with an electric motor.

A leading designer, builder, manufacturer, seller and exporter of cash registers from the 1950s until the 1970s was London-based (and later Brighton-based) Gross Cash Registers Ltd., founded by brothers Sam and Henry Gross. Their cash registers were particularly popular around the time of decimalisation in Britain in early 1971, Henry having designed one of the few known models of cash register which could switch currencies from £sd to £p so that retailers could easily change from one to the other on or after Decimal Day. Sweda also had decimal-ready registers where the retailer used a special key on Decimal Day for the conversion.

==In current use==
In some jurisdictions the law also requires customers to collect the receipt and keep it at least for a short while after leaving the shop, again to check that the shop records sales, so that it cannot evade sales taxes.

Often cash registers are attached to scales, barcode scanners, checkstands, and debit card or credit card terminals. Increasingly, dedicated cash registers are being replaced with general purpose computers with POS software.

Today, point of sale systems scan the barcode (usually EAN or UPC) for each item, retrieve the price from a database, calculate deductions for items on sale (or, in British retail terminology, &quot;special offer&quot;, &quot;multibuy&quot; or &quot;buy one, get one free&quot;), calculate the sales tax or VAT, calculate differential rates for preferred customers, actualize inventory, time and date stamp the transaction, record the transaction in detail including each item purchased, record the method of payment, keep totals for each product or type of product sold as well as total sales for specified periods, and do other tasks as well. These POS terminals will often also identify the cashier on the receipt, and carry additional information or offers.

Currently, many cash registers are individual computers. They may be running traditionally in-house software or general purpose software such as DOS. Many of the newer ones have touch screens. They may be connected to computerized point of sale networks using any type of protocol. Such systems may be accessed remotely for the purpose of obtaining records or troubleshooting. Many businesses also use tablet computers as cash registers, utilizing the sale system as downloadable app-software.

===Cash drawer===
A cash drawer is usually a compartment underneath a cash register in which the cash from transactions is kept. The drawer typically contains a removable till. The till is usually a plastic or wooden tray divided into compartments used to store each denomination of bank notes and coins separately in order to make counting easier. The removable till allows money to be removed from the sales floor to a more secure location for counting and creating bank deposits. Some modern cash drawers are individual units separate from the rest of the cash register.

A cash drawer is usually of strong construction and may be integral with the register or a separate piece that the register sits atop. It slides in and out of its lockable box and is secured by a spring-loaded catch. When a transaction that involves cash is completed, the register sends an electrical impulse to a solenoid to release the catch and open the drawer. Cash drawers that are integral to a stand-alone register often have a manual release catch underneath to open the drawer in the event of a power failure. More advanced cash drawers have eliminated the manual release in favor of a cylinder lock, requiring a key to manually open the drawer. The cylinder lock usually has several positions: locked, unlocked, online (will open if an impulse is given), and release. The release position is an intermittent position with a spring to push the cylinder back to the unlocked position. In the &quot;locked&quot; position, the drawer will remain latched even when an electric impulse is sent to the solenoid.

Some cash drawers are designed to store notes upright &amp; facing forward, instead of the traditional flat and front to back position. This allows more varieties of notes to be stored. Some cash drawers are flip top in design, where they flip open instead of sliding out like an ordinary drawer, resembling a cashbox instead.

A cash register&#x27;s drawer can only be opened by an instruction from the cash register except when using special keys, generally held by the owner and some employees (e.g. manager). This reduces the amount of contact most employees have with cash and other valuables. It also reduces risks of an employee taking money from the drawer without a record and the owner&#x27;s consent, such as when a customer does not expressly ask for a receipt but still has to be given change (cash is more easily checked against recorded sales than inventory). Cash registers include a key labeled &quot;No Sale&quot;, abbreviated &quot;NS&quot; on many modern electronic cash registers. Its function is to open the drawer, printing a receipt stating &quot;No Sale&quot; and recording in the register log that the register was opened. Some cash registers require a numeric password or physical key to be used when attempting to open the till.

===Management functions===
An often used non-sale function is the aforementioned &quot;no sale&quot;. In case of needing to correct change given to the customer, or to make change from a neighboring register, this function will open the cash drawer of the register. Where non-management staff are given access, management can scrutinize the count of &quot;no sales&quot; in the log to look for suspicious patterns. Generally requiring a management key, besides programming prices into the register, are the report functions. An X-report will read the current sales figures from memory and produce a paper printout. A Z-report will act like an &quot;X&quot; report, except that counters will be reset to zero.

===Manual input===

Registers will typically feature a numerical pad, QWERTY or custom keyboard, touch screen interface, or a combination of these input methods for the cashier to enter products and fees by hand and access information necessary to complete the sale. For older registers as well as at restaurants and other establishments that do not sell barcoded items, the manual input may be the only method of interacting with the register. While customization was previously limited to larger chains that could afford to have physical keyboards custom-built for their needs, the customization of register inputs is now more widespread with the use of touch screens that can display a variety of point of sale software.

===Scanner===

Modern cash registers may be connected to a handheld or stationary barcode reader so that a customer&#x27;s purchases can be more rapidly scanned than would be possible by keying numbers into the register by hand. The use of scanners should also help prevent errors that result from manually entering the product&#x27;s barcode or pricing. At grocers, the register&#x27;s scanner may be combined with a scale for measuring product that is sold by weight.

===Receipt printer===
Cashiers are often required to provide a receipt to the customer after a purchase has been made. Registers typically use thermal printers to print receipts, although older dot matrix printers are still in use at some retailers. Alternatively, retailers can forgo issuing paper receipts in some jurisdictions by instead asking the customer for an email to which their receipt can be sent. The receipts of larger retailers tend to include unique barcodes or other information identifying the transaction so that the receipt can be scanned to facilitate returns or other customer services.

===Security deactivation===
In stores that use electronic article surveillance, a pad or other surface will be attached to the register that deactivates security devices embedded in or attached to the items being purchased. This will prevent a customer&#x27;s purchase from setting off security alarms at the store&#x27;s exit.

===Remote peripherals===
In settings like a restaurant, remote pheripherals are sometimes used to speed up processing of orders. These include printers or screens in the kitchen to show staff the incoming orders. Waiters often use mobile devices like phones or tablets connected to a central cash register to takes orders and can use small, mobile bluetooth printers to print receipts directly at the table.

==Self-service cash register==
Some corporations and supermarkets have introduced self-checkout machines, where the customer is trusted to scan the barcodes (or manually identify uncoded items like fruit), and place the items into a bagging area. The bag is weighed, and the machine halts the checkout when the weight of something in the bag does not match the weight in the inventory database. Normally, an employee is watching over several such checkouts to prevent theft or exploitation of the machines&#x27; weaknesses (for example, intentional misidentification of expensive produce or dry goods). Payment on these machines is accepted by debit card/credit card, or cash via coin slot and bank note scanner. Store employees are also needed to authorize &quot;age-restricted&quot; purchases, such as alcohol, solvents or knives, which can either be done remotely by the employee observing the self-checkout, or by means of a &quot;store login&quot; which the operator has to enter.

<text>Processor design is a subfield of computer science and computer engineering (fabrication) that deals with creating a processor, a key component of computer hardware.

The design process involves choosing an instruction set and a certain execution paradigm (e.g. VLIW or RISC) and results in a microarchitecture, which might be described in e.g. VHDL or Verilog. For microprocessor design, this description is then manufactured employing some of the various semiconductor device fabrication processes, resulting in a die which is bonded onto a chip carrier. This chip carrier is then soldered onto, or inserted into a socket on, a printed circuit board (PCB).

The mode of operation of any processor is the execution of lists of instructions. Instructions typically include those to compute or manipulate data values using registers, change or retrieve values in read/write memory, perform relational tests between data values and to control program flow.

Processor designs are often tested and validated on one or several FPGAs before sending the design of the processor to a foundry for semiconductor fabrication.

== Details ==
=== Basics ===
CPU design is divided into multiple components. Information is transferred through datapaths (such as ALUs and pipelines). These datapaths are controlled through logic by control units. Memory components include register files and caches to retain information, or certain actions. Clock circuitry maintains internal rhythms and timing through clock drivers, PLLs, and clock distribution networks. Pad transceiver circuitry with allows signals to be received and sent and a logic gate cell library which is used to implement the logic. Logic gates are the foundation for processor design as they are used to implement most of the processor&#x27;s components.

CPUs designed for high-performance markets might require custom (optimized or application specific (see below)) designs for each of these items to achieve frequency, power-dissipation, and chip-area goals whereas CPUs designed for lower performance markets might lessen the implementation burden by acquiring some of these items by purchasing them as intellectual property. Control logic implementation techniques (logic synthesis using CAD tools) can be used to implement datapaths, register files, and clocks. Common logic styles used in CPU design include unstructured random logic, finite-state machines, microprogramming (common from 1965 to 1985), and Programmable logic arrays (common in the 1980s, no longer common).

=== Implementation logic ===
Device types used to implement the logic include:
* Individual vacuum tubes, individual transistors and semiconductor diodes, and transistor-transistor logic small-scale integration logic chips – no longer used for CPUs
* Programmable array logic and programmable logic devices – no longer used for CPUs
* Emitter-coupled logic (ECL) gate arrays – no longer common
* CMOS gate arrays – no longer used for CPUs
* CMOS mass-produced ICs – the vast majority of CPUs by volume
* CMOS ASICs – only for a minority of special applications due to expense
* Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) – common for soft microprocessors, and more or less required for reconfigurable computing

A CPU design project generally has these major tasks:
* Programmer-visible instruction set architecture, which can be implemented by a variety of microarchitectures
* Architectural study and performance modeling in ANSI C/C++ or SystemC
* High-level synthesis (HLS) or register transfer level (RTL, e.g. logic) implementation
* RTL verification
* Circuit design of speed critical components (caches, registers, ALUs)
* Logic synthesis or logic-gate-level design
* Timing analysis to confirm that all logic and circuits will run at the specified operating frequency
* Physical design including floorplanning, place and route of logic gates
* Checking that RTL, gate-level, transistor-level and physical-level representations are equivalent
* Checks for signal integrity, chip manufacturability

Re-designing a CPU core to a smaller die area helps to shrink everything (a &quot;photomask shrink&quot;), resulting in the same number of transistors on a smaller die. It improves performance (smaller transistors switch faster), reduces power (smaller wires have less parasitic capacitance) and reduces cost (more CPUs fit on the same wafer of silicon). Releasing a CPU on the same size die, but with a smaller CPU core, keeps the cost about the same but allows higher levels of integration within one very-large-scale integration chip (additional cache, multiple CPUs or other components), improving performance and reducing overall system cost.

As with most complex electronic designs, the logic verification effort (proving that the design does not have bugs) now dominates the project schedule of a CPU.

Key CPU architectural innovations include index register, cache, virtual memory, instruction pipelining, superscalar, CISC, RISC, virtual machine, emulators, microprogram, and stack.

=== Microarchitectural concepts ===
=== Research topics ===

A variety of new CPU design ideas have been proposed,
including reconfigurable logic, clockless CPUs, computational RAM, and optical computing.

===Performance analysis and benchmarking===

Benchmarking is a way of testing CPU speed. Examples include SPECint and SPECfp, developed by Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation, and ConsumerMark developed by the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium EEMBC.

Some of the commonly used metrics include:
* Instructions per second - Most consumers pick a computer architecture (normally Intel IA32 architecture) to be able to run a large base of pre-existing pre-compiled software. Being relatively uninformed on computer benchmarks, some of them pick a particular CPU based on operating frequency (see Megahertz Myth).
* FLOPS - The number of floating point operations per second is often important in selecting computers for scientific computations.
* Performance per watt - System designers building parallel computers, such as Google, pick CPUs based on their speed per watt of power, because the cost of powering the CPU outweighs the cost of the CPU itself.
* Some system designers building parallel computers pick CPUs based on the speed per dollar.
* System designers building real-time computing systems want to guarantee worst-case response. That is easier to do when the CPU has low interrupt latency and when it has deterministic response. (DSP)
* Computer programmers who program directly in assembly language want a CPU to support a full featured instruction set.
* Low power - For systems with limited power sources (e.g. solar, batteries, human power).
* Small size or low weight - for portable embedded systems, systems for spacecraft.
* Environmental impact - Minimizing environmental impact of computers during manufacturing and recycling as well during use. Reducing waste, reducing hazardous materials. (see Green computing). 

There may be tradeoffs in optimizing some of these metrics. In particular, many design techniques that make a CPU run faster make the &quot;performance per watt&quot;, &quot;performance per dollar&quot;, and &quot;deterministic response&quot; much worse, and vice versa.

==Markets==

There are several different markets in which CPUs are used. Since each of these markets differ in their requirements for CPUs, the devices designed for one market are in most cases inappropriate for the other markets.

===General-purpose computing===
, in the general-purpose computing market, that is, desktop, laptop, and server computers commonly used in businesses and homes, the Intel IA-32 and the 64-bit version x86-64 architecture dominate the market, with its rivals PowerPC and SPARC maintaining much smaller customer bases. Yearly, hundreds of millions of IA-32 architecture CPUs are used by this market. A growing percentage of these processors are for mobile implementations such as netbooks and laptops.

Since these devices are used to run countless different types of programs, these CPU designs are not specifically targeted at one type of application or one function. The demands of being able to run a wide range of programs efficiently has made these CPU designs among the more advanced technically, along with some disadvantages of being relatively costly, and having high power consumption.

====High-end processor economics====
In 1984, most high-performance CPUs required four to five years to develop.

===Scientific computing===

Scientific computing is a much smaller niche market (in revenue and units shipped). It is used in government research labs and universities. Before 1990, CPU design was often done for this market, but mass market CPUs organized into large clusters have proven to be more affordable. The main remaining area of active hardware design and research for scientific computing is for high-speed data transmission systems to connect mass market CPUs.

===Embedded design===

As measured by units shipped, most CPUs are embedded in other machinery, such as telephones, clocks, appliances, vehicles, and infrastructure. Embedded processors sell in the volume of many billions of units per year, however, mostly at much lower price points than that of the general purpose processors.

These single-function devices differ from the more familiar general-purpose CPUs in several ways:
* Low cost is of high importance.
* It is important to maintain a low power dissipation as embedded devices often have a limited battery life and it is often impractical to include cooling fans.
* To give lower system cost, peripherals are integrated with the processor on the same silicon chip.
* Keeping peripherals on-chip also reduces power consumption as external GPIO ports typically require buffering so that they can source or sink the relatively high current loads that are required to maintain a strong signal outside of the chip.
** Many embedded applications have a limited amount of physical space for circuitry; keeping peripherals on-chip will reduce the space required for the circuit board.
** The program and data memories are often integrated on the same chip. When the only allowed program memory is ROM, the device is known as a microcontroller.
* For many embedded applications, interrupt latency will be more critical than in some general-purpose processors.

====Embedded processor economics====
The embedded CPU family with the largest number of total units shipped is the 8051, averaging nearly a billion units per year. The 8051 is widely used because it is very inexpensive. The design time is now roughly zero, because it is widely available as commercial intellectual property. It is now often embedded as a small part of a larger system on a chip. The silicon cost of an 8051 is now as low as US$0.001, because some implementations use as few as 2,200 logic gates and take 0.4730 square millimeters of silicon.

As of 2009, more CPUs are produced using the ARM architecture family instruction sets than any other 32-bit instruction set.
The ARM architecture and the first ARM chip were designed in about one and a half years and 5 human years of work time.

The 32-bit Parallax Propeller microcontroller architecture and the first chip were designed by two people in about 10 human years of work time.

The 8-bit AVR architecture and first AVR microcontroller was conceived and designed by two students at the Norwegian Institute of Technology.

The 8-bit 6502 architecture and the first MOS Technology 6502 chip were designed in 13 months by a group of about 9 people.

====Research and educational CPU design====
The 32-bit Berkeley RISC I and RISC II processors were mostly designed by a series of students as part of a four quarter sequence of graduate courses.
This design became the basis of the commercial SPARC processor design.

For about a decade, every student taking the 6.004 class at MIT was part of a team—each team had one semester to design and build a simple 8 bit CPU out of 7400 series integrated circuits.
One team of 4 students designed and built a simple 32 bit CPU during that semester.

Some undergraduate courses require a team of 2 to 5 students to design, implement, and test a simple CPU in a FPGA in a single 15-week semester.

The MultiTitan CPU was designed with 2.5 man years of effort, which was considered &quot;relatively little design effort&quot; at the time.
24 people contributed to the 3.5 year MultiTitan research project, which included designing and building a prototype CPU.

==== Soft microprocessor cores ====

For embedded systems, the highest performance levels are often not needed or desired due to the power consumption requirements. This allows for the use of processors which can be totally implemented by logic synthesis techniques. These synthesized processors can be implemented in a much shorter amount of time, giving quicker time-to-market.

<doc id="7598" wikidata="Q941411" url="?curid=7598" title="Carinatae">
<text>Carinatae is the group of all birds and their extinct relatives to possess a keel, or &quot;carina&quot;, on the underside of the breastbone used to anchor large flight muscles.

==Definition==
Traditionally, Carinatae were defined as all birds whose sternum (breast bone) has a keel (&quot;carina&quot;). The keel is a strong median ridge running down the length of the sternum. This is an important area for the attachment of flight muscles. Thus, all flying birds have a pronounced keel. Ratites, all of which are flightless, lack a strong keel. Thus, living birds were divided into carinatae (keeled) and ratites (from &quot;ratis&quot;, &quot;raft&quot;, referring to the flatness of the sternum). The difficulty with this scheme phylogenetically was that some flightless birds, without strong keels, are descended directly from ordinary flying birds possessing one. Examples include the kākāpō, a flightless parrot, and the dodo, a columbiform (the pigeon family). Neither of these birds are a ratite. Thus, this supposedly distinctive feature was easy to use, but had nothing to do with actual phylogenetic relationship.

Beginning in the 1980s, Carinatae was given several phylogenetic definitions. The first was as a node-based clade uniting &quot;Ichthyornis&quot; with modern birds. However, in many analyses, this definition would be synonymous with the more widely used name Ornithurae. An alternate definition was provided in 2001, naming Carinatae an apomorphy-based clade defined by the presence of a keeled sternum.

The most primitive known bird relative with a keeled breastbone is &quot;Confuciusornis&quot;. While some specimens of this stem-bird have flat breastbones, some show a small ridge that could have supported a cartilaginous keel.

<doc id="7599" wikidata="Q134768" url="?curid=7599" title="Cocktail">
<text>A cocktail is a mixed drink, usually alcoholic. Most commonly, a cocktail is a combination of one or more spirits mixed with other ingredients, such as juices, flavored syrups, tonic water, shrubs, and bitters. Cocktails vary widely across regions of the world, and many websites publish both original recipes and their own interpretations of older and more famous cocktails.

== History ==
A well-known &#x27;cocktail&#x27; in ancient Greece was named kykeon. It is mentioned in the Homeric texts and was used in the Eleusinian Mysteries. &#x27;Cocktail&#x27; accessories are exposed in the Museum of the Royal Tombs of Aigai (Greece). They were used in the court of Philip II of Macedon to prepare and serve mixtures of wine, water, honey as well as extracts of aromatic herbs and flowers, during the banquets. 

In the United States, a written mention of &#x27;cocktail&#x27; as a beverage appeared in &quot;The Farmers Cabinet,&quot; 1803. The first definition of a cocktail as an alcoholic beverage appeared three years later in &quot;The Balance and Columbian Repository&quot; (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806. Traditionally, cocktail ingredients included spirits, sugar, water and bitters; however, this definition evolved throughout the 1800s to include the addition of a liqueur.

In 1862, Jerry Thomas published a bartender&#x27;s guide called &quot;How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant&#x27;s Companion&quot; which included 10 cocktail recipes using bitters, to differentiate from other drinks such as punches and cobblers.

Cocktails continued to evolve and gain popularity throughout the 1900s, with the term eventually expanding to cover all mixed drinks. In 1917, the term &quot;cocktail party&quot; was coined by Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri. With wine and beer being less available during the Prohibition in the United States (1920–1933), liquor-based cocktails became more popular due to accessibility, followed by a decline in popularity during the late 1960s. The early to mid-2000s saw the rise of cocktail culture through the style of mixology which mixes traditional cocktails and other novel ingredients. By 2023, the so-called &quot;cocktail in a can&quot; had proliferated (at least in the United States) to become a common item in liquor stores.

In the modern world and the Information Age, cocktail recipes are widely shared online on websites. Cocktails and restaurants that serve them are frequently covered and reviewed in tourism magazines and guides. Some cocktails, such as the Mojito, Manhattan, and Martini, have become staples in restaurants and pop culture.

== Components ==
In general terms the most important elements consist of the base, a modifying, smoothing or aromatizing agent, and an additional special flavouring or coloring agent.

The base will always be the most dominant ingredient. It constitutes at least 50% of the entire volume of the cocktail, and always consists of spirit based liquors or wine based liquors. The type of base will determine the style of liquor, thus gin based cocktails, such as the Martini, will differ from whisky based cocktails, such as the Manhattan. It is possible to mix a cocktail combining a number of bases, as long as they share essential characteristics, though it is considered &quot;dangerous&quot;.

The modifying agent functions as a buffer for the sharp bite of the base, and adds character to its natural flavour. Modifiers can be classified into the three categories of aromatics and bitters, fruit juices (with or without sugar), and smoothing agents (such as cream, sugar or eggs). Modifiers are often used sparingly so as not to overpower the base, Embury suggested a maximum of half an egg white, one quarter of a whole egg, one tablespoon of heavy cream or one teaspoon of sugar per drink.

Special flavouring agents, including not only non-alcoholic syrups but also various liqueurs and cordials, as well as other ingredients which could also be used as modifiers. Like the modifiers, special care must be taken so that the special flavouring agent does not overpower the base. For this reason quantities are often limited to drops and dashes.

== Usage and related terms ==

The term &quot;cocktail&quot; can refer to a wide variety of drinks; it is typically a mixed drink containing alcohol.

When a combined drink contains only a distilled spirit and a mixer, such as soda or fruit juice, it is a highball. Many of the International Bartenders Association Official Cocktails are highballs. When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a liqueur, it is a duo, and when it adds cream or a cream-based liqueur, it is a trio. Additional ingredients may be sugar, honey, milk, cream, and various herbs.

Mixed drinks without alcohol that resemble cocktails can be known as &quot;zero-proof&quot; or &quot;virgin&quot; cocktails or &quot;mocktails&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word &quot;cocktail&quot; is disputed. It is presumably from &quot;cock-tail&quot;, meaning &quot;with tail standing up, like a cock&#x27;s&quot;, in particular of a horse, but how this came to be applied to alcoholic mixed drinks is unclear. The most prominent theories are that it refers to a stimulant, hence a &quot;stimulating&quot; drink, or to a non-purebred horse, hence a &quot;mixed&quot; drink.

Cocktail historian David Wondrich speculates that &quot;cocktail&quot; is a reference to gingering, a practice for perking up an old horse by means of a ginger suppository so that the animal would &quot;cock its tail up and be frisky&quot;, hence by extension a stimulating drink, like &quot;pick-me-up&quot;. This agrees with usage in early citations (1798: &quot;&#x27;cock-tail&#x27; (vulgarly called ginger)&quot;, 1803: drink at 11 a.m. to clear the head, 1806: &quot;stimulating liquor&quot;), and suggests that a cocktail was initially considered a medicinal drink, which accords with the use of bitters.

Etymologist Anatoly Liberman endorses as &quot;highly probable&quot; the theory advanced by Låftman (1946), which Liberman summarizes as follows:

=== Citations ===
The first recorded use of cocktail not referring to a horse is found in &quot;The Morning Post and Gazetteer&quot; in London, England, March 20, 1798:

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites the word as originating in the U.S. The first recorded use of &quot;cocktail&quot; as a beverage (possibly non-alcoholic) in the United States appears in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Cabinet&quot;, April 28, 1803:


The first definition of cocktail known to be an alcoholic beverage appeared in &quot;The Balance and Columbian Repository&quot; (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806; editor Harry Croswell answered the question, &quot;What is a cocktail?&quot;:

=== Folk etymologies ===
Other origins have been suggested, as corruptions of other words or phrases. These can be dismissed as folk etymologies, given the well-attested term &quot;cock-tail&quot; for a horse.

Dale DeGroff hypothesizes that the word evolved from the French , for an eggcup in which Antoine A. Peychaud, creator of Peychaud&#x27;s Bitters, allegedly used to serve his guests a mix of cognac with a dash of his bitters.

Several authors have theorized that &quot;cocktail&quot; may be a corruption of &quot;cock ale&quot;.

== Development ==

There is a lack of clarity on the origins of cocktails. Traditionally cocktails were a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters. By the 1860s, however, a cocktail frequently included a liqueur.

The first publication of a bartenders&#x27; guide which included cocktail recipes was in 1862 – &quot;How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant&#x27;s Companion&quot;, by &quot;Professor&quot; Jerry Thomas. In addition to recipes for punches, sours, slings, cobblers, shrubs, toddies, flips, and a variety of other mixed drinks were 10 recipes for &quot;cocktails&quot;. A key ingredient distinguishing cocktails from other drinks in this compendium was the use of bitters. Mixed drinks popular today that conform to this original meaning of &quot;cocktail&quot; include the Old Fashioned whiskey cocktail, the Sazerac cocktail, and the Manhattan cocktail.

The ingredients listed (spirits, sugar, water, and bitters) match the ingredients of an Old Fashioned, which originated as a term used by late 19th-century bar patrons to distinguish cocktails made the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; way from newer, more complex cocktails.

In the 1869 recipe book &quot;Cooling Cups and Dainty Drinks&quot;, by William Terrington, cocktails are described as:
The term highball appears during the 1890s to distinguish a drink composed only of a distilled spirit and a mixer.

Published in 1902 by Farrow and Jackson, &quot;Recipes of American and Other Iced Drinks&quot; contains recipes for nearly two dozen cocktails, some still recognizable today.
The first &quot;cocktail party&quot; ever thrown was allegedly by Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri, in May 1917. Walsh invited 50 guests to her home at noon on a Sunday. The party lasted an hour until lunch was served at 1p.m. The site of this first cocktail party still stands. In 1924, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis bought the Walsh mansion at 4510 Lindell Boulevard, and it has served as the local archbishop&#x27;s residence ever since.

During Prohibition in the United States (1920–1933), when alcoholic beverages were illegal, cocktails were still consumed illegally in establishments known as speakeasies. The quality of the liquor available during Prohibition was much worse than previously. There was a shift from whiskey to gin, which does not require aging and is, therefore, easier to produce illicitly. Honey, fruit juices, and other flavorings served to mask the foul taste of the inferior liquors. Sweet cocktails were easier to drink quickly, an important consideration when the establishment might be raided at any moment. With wine and beer less readily available, liquor-based cocktails took their place, even becoming the centerpiece of the new cocktail party.

Cocktails became less popular in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, until resurging in the 1980s with vodka often substituting for the original gin in drinks such as the martini. Traditional cocktails began to make a comeback in the 2000s, and by the mid-2000s there was a renaissance of cocktail culture in a style typically referred to as mixology that draws on traditional cocktails for inspiration but uses novel ingredients and often complex flavors.

<text>The Coptic Orthodox Church (), also known as the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria, is an Oriental Orthodox Christian church based in Egypt. The head of the church and the See of Alexandria is the pope of Alexandria on the Holy Apostolic See of Saint Mark, who also carries the title of Father of fathers, Shepherd of shepherds, Ecumenical Judge and the 13th among the Apostles. 

The See of Alexandria is titular. The Coptic pope presides from Saint Mark&#x27;s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in the Abbassia District in Cairo. The church follows the Coptic Rite for its liturgy, prayer and devotional patrimony. Adherents of the Coptic Orthodox Church make up Egypt&#x27;s largest and most significant minority population, and the largest population of Christians in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). They make up the largest share of the approximately 20 million Christians in Egypt.

The Coptic Orthodox Church was established by Mark, an apostle and evangelist, during the middle of the 1st century (). Due to disputes concerning the nature of Christ, the Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Eastern Orthodox Church were in schism after the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, resulting in a conflict with the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria.

After AD 639, Egypt was ruled by its Islamic conquerors from Arabia. In the 12th century, the church relocated its seat from Alexandria to Cairo. The same century also saw the Copts become a religious minority. During the 14th and 15th centuries, Nubian Christianity was supplanted by Islam. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the larger body of ethnic Egyptian Christians began to call themselves Coptic Orthodox, to distinguish themselves from the Catholic Copts and from the Eastern Orthodox, who are mostly Greek. In 1959, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was granted autocephaly. This was extended to the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church in 1998 following the successful Eritrean War of Independence from Ethiopia. Since the 2011 Egyptian revolution, Coptic Christians have suffered increased religious discrimination and violence.

== History ==

=== Apostolic foundation ===
According to tradition, the Coptic Church was founded by Mark the Evangelist , and regards itself as the subject of many prophecies in the Old Testament. 
==== Coptic language in the church ====
The Coptic language is a universal language used in Coptic churches in every country. It descends from Ancient Egyptian and uses the Coptic alphabet, a script descended from the Greek alphabet with added characters derived from the Demotic script. Today, the Bohairic dialect of Coptic is used primarily for liturgical purposes. Many of the hymns in the liturgy are in Coptic and have been passed down for many centuries. The language is used to preserve Egypt&#x27;s original language, which was banned by the Arab invaders, who ordered Arabic to be used instead. However, most Copts speak Arabic, the official language of Egypt. Hence, Arabic is also used in church services nowadays. The service books, though written in Coptic, have the Arabic text in parallel columns.

==== Catechetical School of Alexandria ====
The Catechetical School of Alexandria is the oldest catechetical school in the world. Jerome records that the Christian School of Alexandria was founded by Mark himself.

The theological college of the catechetical school was re-established in 1893.

The school became a leading center of the allegorical method of biblical interpretation, espoused a rapprochement between Greek culture and Christian faith, and attempted to assert orthodox Christian teachings against heterodox views in an era of doctrinal flux.

==== Role and participation in the ecumenical councils ====
==== Council of Nicaea ====
In the 4th century, an Alexandrian presbyter named Arius began a theological dispute about the nature of Christ that spread throughout the Christian world and is now known as Arianism. The Council of Nicea in AD 325 was convened by Emperor Constantine I after Pope Alexander I of Alexandria requested to hold a council to respond to heresies, under the presidency of Hosius of Cordova to resolve the dispute. This eventually led to the formulation of the Symbol of Faith, also known as the Nicene Creed.

==== Council of Constantinople ====
In AD 381, Pope Timothy I of Alexandria presided over the second ecumenical council known as the First Council of Constantinople, to judge Macedonius, who denied the Divinity of the Holy Spirit. This council completed the Nicene Creed with this confirmation of the divinity of the Holy Spirit:

We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified who spoke by the Prophets and in One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic church. We confess one Baptism for the remission of sins and we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the coming age, Amen

==== Council of Ephesus ====

Another theological dispute in the 5th century occurred over the teachings of Nestorius, the patriarch of Constantinople who taught that God the Word was not hypostatically joined with human nature, but rather dwelt in the man Jesus. As a consequence of this, he denied the title &quot;Mother of God&quot; (Theotokos) to the Virgin Mary, declaring her instead to be &quot;Mother of Christ&quot; &quot;Christotokos&quot;.

The council confirmed the teachings of Athanasius and confirmed the title of Mary as &quot;Mother of God&quot;. It also clearly stated that anyone who separated Christ into two hypostases was anathema, as Cyril had said that there is &quot;One Nature for God the Word Incarnate&quot; (&quot;Mia Physis tou Theou Logou Sesarkōmenē&quot;). The introduction to the creed is formulated as follows:

We magnify you O Mother of the True Light and we glorify you O saint and Mother of God &quot;(Theotokos)&quot; for you have borne unto us the Saviour of the world. Glory to you O our Master and King: Christ, the pride of the Apostles, the crown of the martyrs, the rejoicing of the righteous, firmness of the churches and the forgiveness of sins. We proclaim the Holy Trinity in One Godhead: we worship Him, we glorify Him, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord bless us, Amen.

==== Council of Chalcedon ====

The church of Alexandria was part in communion with the rest of Christendom until the Council of Chalcedon. When, in AD 451, Emperor Marcian attempted to heal divisions in the church, the response of Pope Dioscorus–the Pope of Alexandria who was later exiled–was that the emperor should not intervene in the affairs of the church. It was at Chalcedon that the emperor, through the imperial delegates, enforced harsh disciplinary measures against Pope Dioscorus in response to his boldness. In AD 449, Pope Dioscorus headed the 2nd Council of Ephesus, called the &quot;Robber Council&quot; by Chalcedonian historians. It held to the Miaphysite formula which upheld the Christology of &quot;One Incarnate Nature of God the Word&quot; (Greek: μία φύσις Θεοῦ Λόγου σεσαρκωμένη (&quot;mia physis Theou Logou sesarkōmenē&quot;)).

In terms of Christology, the Oriental Orthodox (Non-Chalcedonians) understanding is that Christ is &quot;One Nature—the Logos Incarnate,&quot; &quot;of&quot; the full humanity and full divinity. The Chalcedonians&#x27; understanding is that Christ is &quot;recognized in&quot; two natures, full humanity and full divinity. Oriental Orthodoxy contends that such a formulation is no different from what the Nestorians teach.

From that point onward, Alexandria would have two patriarchs: the non-Chalcedonian native Egyptian one, now known as the Coptic pope of Alexandria and patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Apostolic See of St. Mark, and the Melkite or Imperial patriarch, now known as the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Alexandria.

Almost the entire Egyptian population rejected the terms of the Council of Chalcedon and remained faithful to the native Egyptian Church (now known as the Coptic Orthodox Church).

By anathematizing Pope Leo because of the tone and content of his tome, as per Alexandrine Theology perception, Pope Dioscorus was found guilty of doing so without due process; in other words, the Tome of Leo was not a subject of heresy in the first place, but it was a question of questioning the reasons behind not having it either acknowledged or read at the Second Council of Ephesus in AD 449. Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria was never labeled as a heretic by the council&#x27;s canons.
Copts also believe that the pope of Alexandria was forcibly prevented from attending the third congregation of the council from which he was ousted, apparently the result of a conspiracy tailored by the Roman delegates.

Before the current positive era of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox dialogues, Chalcedonians sometimes used to call the non-Chalcedonians &quot;Monophysites&quot;, though the Coptic Orthodox Church in reality regards Monophysitism as a heresy. The Chalcedonian doctrine in turn came to be known as &quot;Dyophysite&quot;. A term that comes closer to Coptic Orthodoxy is Miaphysite, which refers to a conjoined nature for Christ, both human and divine, united indivisibly in the Incarnate Logos.

=== From Chalcedon to the Arab conquest of Egypt ===
=== Muslim conquest of Egypt ===

The Muslim invasion of Egypt took place in AD 639. Relying on eyewitness testimony, Bishop John of Nikiu in his Chronicle provides a graphic account of the invasion from a Coptic perspective. Although the Chronicle has only been preserved in an Ethiopic (Ge&#x27;ez) text, some scholars believe that it was originally written in Coptic. John&#x27;s account is critical of the invaders who he says &quot;despoiled the Egyptians of their possessions and dealt cruelly with them&quot;, and he details the atrocities committed by the Muslims against the native population during the conquest:And when with great toil and exertion they had cast down the walls of the city, they forthwith made themselves masters of it, and put to the sword thousands of its inhabitants and of the soldiers, and they gained an enormous booty, and took the women and children captive and divided them amongst themselves, and they made that city a desolation.

Though critical of the Muslim commander (Amr ibn al-As), who, during the campaign, he says &quot;had no mercy on the Egyptians, and did not observe the covenant they had made with him, for he was of a barbaric race&quot;, he does note that following the completion of the conquest, Amr &quot;took none of the property of the Churches, and he committed no act of spoilation or plunder, and he preserved them throughout all his days.&quot;

Despite the political upheaval, the Egyptian population remained mainly Christian. However, gradual conversions to Islam over the centuries had changed Egypt from a Christian to a largely Muslim country by the end of the 12th century. Another scholar writes that a combination of &quot;repression of Coptic revolts&quot;, Arab-Muslim immigration, and Coptic conversion to Islam resulted in the demographic decline of the Copts. Egypt&#x27;s Umayyad rulers taxed Christians at a higher rate than Muslims, driving merchants towards Islam and undermining the economic base of the Coptic Church. Although the Coptic Church did not disappear, the Umayyad tax policies made it difficult for the church to retain the Egyptian elites.

=== Under Islamic rule (640–1800) ===

In 969, Egypt entered the Fatimid dynasty (in Egypt from 969 to 1171), who adopted a largely favorable attitude toward the Christians. The major exception to this was the persecution led by Caliph al-Hakim between 1004 and 1013, which included clothing regulations, prohibition of publicly celebrating Christian festivals, and dismissal of Christian and Jewish functionaries. However, at the end of his reign al-Hakim rescinded these measures, allowing the Copts to regain privileged positions within the administration.

The Coptic patriarchal residence moved from Alexandria to Cairo during the patriarchate of Cyril II (1078–92). This move was at the demand of the grand vizier Badr al-Jamali, who insisted that the pope establish himself in the capital. When Saladin entered Egypt in 1163, this ushered in a government focused on defending Sunni Islam. Christians were again discriminated against, and meant to show modesty in their religious ceremonies and buildings.

During the Ottoman period, Copts were classified alongside other Oriental Orthodox and Nestorian peoples under the Armenian millet.

In 1798, the French invaded Egypt unsuccessfully and the British helped the Turks to regain power over Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty.

=== From the 19th century to the 1952 revolution ===
The position of Copts began to improve early in the 19th century under the stability and tolerance of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty. The Coptic community ceased to be regarded by the state as an administrative unit. In 1855 the jizya tax was abolished by Sa&#x27;id Pasha. Shortly thereafter, the Copts started to serve in the Egyptian army.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the Coptic Church underwent phases of new development. In 1853, Pope Cyril IV established the first modern Coptic schools, including the first Egyptian school for girls. He also founded a printing press, which was only the second national press in the country. The pope established very friendly relations with other denominations, to the extent that when the Greek Patriarch in Egypt had to absent himself from the country for a long period of time, he left his church under the guidance of the Coptic patriarch.

The Theological College of the School of Alexandria was reestablished in 1893. It began its new history with five students, one of whom was later to become its dean. Today it has campuses in Alexandria and Cairo, and in various dioceses throughout Egypt, as well as outside Egypt. It has campuses in New Jersey, Los Angeles, Sydney, Melbourne, and London, where potential clergymen and other qualified men and women study many subjects, including theology, church history, missionary studies, and the Coptic language.

=== Present day ===
In 1959, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was granted its first own Patriarch Abuna Basilios by Pope Cyril VI. Furthermore, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church similarly became independent of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in 1994, when four bishops were consecrated by Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria to form the basis of a local Holy Synod of the Eritrean Church. In 1998, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church gained its autocephaly from the Coptic Orthodox Church when its first Patriarch was enthroned by Pope Shenouda III.

Since the 1980s theologians from the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) Orthodox and Eastern (Chalcedonian) Orthodox churches have been meeting in a bid to resolve theological differences, and have concluded that many of the differences are caused by the two groups using different terminology to describe the same thing.

In the summer of 2001, the Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox patriarchates of Alexandria agreed to mutually recognize baptisms performed in each other&#x27;s churches, making re-baptisms unnecessary, and to recognize the sacrament of marriage as celebrated by the other.

In Tahrir Square, Cairo, on Wednesday 2 February 2011, Coptic Christians joined hands to provide a protective cordon around their Muslim neighbors during salat (prayers) in the midst of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.

=== Modern persecution ===
While Copts have cited instances of persecution throughout their history, Human Rights Watch has noted growing religious intolerance and sectarian violence against Coptic Christians in recent years, and a failure by the Egyptian government to effectively investigate properly and prosecute those responsible. More than a hundred Egyptian copts were killed in sectarian clashes from 2011 to 2017, and many homes and businesses destroyed. In Minya, 77 cases of sectarian attacks on Copts between 2011 and 2016 were documented by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Coptic Christian women and girls are often abducted and disappear.

In 2015, 21 men traveled to Libya to support their families. There, they would be kidnapped and beheaded by the Islamic State in Libya.

=== Recent Church reforms ===
Under Pope Shenouda, from 1971 to 2012, the church underwent a large transformation. Writing in 2013, the theologian Samuel Tadros stated &quot;Today&#x27;s Coptic Church as an institution is built solely on his vision&quot;. For the first time in its history, the synod codified its internal laws. It also established numerous coptic institutions within and outside of Egypt. Shenouda raised the number of bishops from 26 to 117 and ordained hundreds of priests, which greatly reduced the influence of any one bishop. Shenouda also instituted a yearly meeting of the synod, which greatly expanded the number of laws governing the church. This included instituting church curriculums for the education of new priests, new deacons, and newly weds. For the first time in the Coptic Church&#x27;s modern history, women could become ordained as deacons. The synod also adopted a model for community development, dramatically increasing the scope of community services provided by the church, including: hospitals, adult literacy schools, orphanages, libraries, and community centres. Much of this work was fuelled by donations from wealthy Coptic industrialists and Copts from abroad. Shenouda also held talks with the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, in an effort to promote ecumenism . On 10 May 1973, Pope Shenouda visited the Vatican, where a joint Christological declaration was issued jointly by the Coptic Orthodox and Catholic churches.

Pope Shenouda III also increased the Church&#x27;s involvement in politics, seeing it as a way to advocate for the interest of Copts, during the rise of Islamism in Egypt and increase in terrorist attacks. The president of Egypt, Anwar Sadat ordered that Shenouda be put into exile in a Coptic Monastery far away from Cairo in 1981. This exile was short lived, ending when Sadat was assassinated by Muslim extremists a few months later. Under president Hosni Mubarak, Shenouda continued his political stance and often protested persecution of Copts by leaving Cairo and staying in seclusion, which often caused the regime to quickly address issues. Shenouda&#x27;s political involvement drew criticism from some church members, including the prominent monk Father Matta El Meskeen.

On 17 March 2012, the Coptic Orthodox Pope, Pope Shenouda III died, leaving many Copts mourning and worrying as tensions rose with Muslims. Pope Shenouda III constantly met with Muslim leaders in order to create peace. Many were worried about Muslims controlling Egypt as the Muslim Brotherhood won 70% of the parliamentary elections. Shenouda&#x27;s approach to church leadership has, in part, been adopted by the current patriarch. Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria maintains relations with the Egyptian government and other churches. However, while Shenouda was critical of the expanded influence of Protestant teaching and books in Coptic churches, Tawadros has increased ecumenical dialogue with several Protestant churches. Tawadros is also not as involved political protests and does not publicly criticize the Egyptian regime, often resorting to advocacy instead.

In 2020, a woman in Florida accused a former priest of sexual assault when she was a minor. She claimed that he was defrocked in 2014, but continued presenting himself as a priest. In response, the synod issued a public statement disavowing him and instituted anti-abuse measures. Several diocese in North America and Europe, issued statements in support of sexual assault survivors.

On 10 May 2023, Pope Tawadros visited the Vatican to celebrate Coptic Catholic Friendship day and the 50 year anniversary of the meeting between Pope Paul VI and Pope Shenouda. Pope Francis announced that the 21 Coptic Martyrs killed by ISIS in Libya in 2015 would be added to the Catholic Roman Martyrology. Pope Tawadros gifted relics from each of the 21 martyrs to the Vatican.

== Fasts, feasts, liturgy and canonical hours ==

Communicants of the Coptic Orthodox Church use a breviary known as the Agpeya to pray the canonical hours at seven fixed prayer times while facing in the eastward direction, in anticipation of the Second Coming of Jesus; this Christian practice has its roots in Psalm 119:164, in which the prophet David prays to God seven times a day. Church bells enjoin Christians to pray at these hours. Before praying, they wash their hands and face to be clean before and present their best to God; shoes are removed to acknowledge that one is offering prayer before a holy God. During each of the seven fixed prayer times, Coptic Orthodox Christians pray &quot;prostrating three times in the name of the Trinity; at the end of each Psalm … while saying the &#x27;Alleluia&#x27;;&quot; and 41 times for each of the Kyrie eleisons present in a canonical hour. In the Coptic Orthodox Church, it is customary for women to wear a Christian headcovering when praying. The Coptic Orthodox Church observes days of ritual purification. However, while meat that still contains blood after cooking is discouraged from being eaten, the Coptic Church does not forbid its members from consuming any particular type of food, unlike in Islam or Judaism.

All churches of the Coptic Orthodox Church are designed to face the eastward direction of prayer and efforts are made to remodel churches obtained from other Christian denominations that are not built in this fashion.

In Coptic Orthodox Christianity, fasting is defined as going without meat or dairy. With respect to Eucharistic discipline, Coptic Orthodox Christians fast from midnight onwards (or at least nine hours) prior to receiving the sacrament of Holy Communion. They fast every Wednesday and Friday of the year (Wednesdays in remembrance of the betrayal of Christ, and on Fridays in remembrance of His crucifixion and death). In total, fast days in a year for Coptic Orthodox Christians numbers between 210 and 240. This means that Copts abstain from all animal products for up to two-thirds of each year. The fasts for Advent and Lent are 43 days and 55 days, respectively. In August, before the celebration of the Dormition of the Mother of God, Coptic Christians fast 15 days; fasting is also done before the feast of Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, starting from the day of Pentecost. Married couples refrain from sexual relations during Lent &quot;to give themselves time for fasting and prayer&quot;.

Christmas has been a national holiday in Egypt since 2003. It is the only Christian holiday in Egypt. Coptic Christmas, which usually falls on January 6 or 7 is a major feast. Other major feasts are Epiphany, Palm Sunday, Easter, Pentecost, Ascension, and Annunciation. These are known in the Coptic world as the Seven Major Feasts. Major feasts are always preceded by fasts. Additionally, the Coptic Orthodox Church also has Seven Minor Feasts: the Circumcision of the Lord, Entrance into the Temple, Entrance into Egypt, Transfiguration, Maundy Thursday, Thomas Sunday, and Great Lent. Furthermore, there are several indigenous feasts of the Theotokos. There are also other feasts commemorating the martyrdom of important saints from Coptic history.

== Demographics ==
Available Egyptian census figures and other third-party survey reports have not reported more than 4 million Coptic Orthodox Christians in Egypt. However media and other agencies, sometimes taking into account the claims of the church itself, generally approximate the Coptic Orthodox population at 10% of the Egyptian population or 10 million people. Egyptian Copts are the biggest Christian community in the Arab world. Estimates of their numbers vary, but generally range between 4.7 and 7.1 million. The majority of them live in Egypt under the jurisdiction of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Since 2006, Egyptian censuses have not reported on religion and church leaders have alleged that Christians were under-counted in government surveys. In 2017, a government owned newspaper Al Ahram estimated the percentage of Copts at 10 to 15% and the membership claimed by the Coptic Orthodox Church is in the range of 20 to 25 million.

There are also significant numbers in the diaspora outside Africa in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, France, and Germany. The exact number of Egyptian born Coptic Orthodox Christians in the diaspora is hard to determine and is roughly estimated to be close to 1 million.

There are between 150,000 and 200,000 adherents in Sudan.

== Jurisdiction outside Egypt ==

Besides Egypt, the Church of Alexandria has jurisdiction over all of Africa. The following autocephalous churches have strong historical ties to the Coptic Orthodox Church.

=== Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church ===

Tradition holds that Ethiopia was first evangelized by St. Matthew and St. Bartholomew in the 1st century ce, and the first Ethiopian convert is thought to have been the eunuch in Jerusalem mentioned in The Acts of the Apostles (8:27–40). Ethiopia was further Christianized in the 4th century ce by two men (likely brothers) from Tyre—St. Frumentius. Ever since the conversion of Ezana of Axum to Christianity by Frumentius in 325 AD, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church has received its archbishops from the Coptic Orthodox Church. Until the mid-twentieth century, the metropolitans of the Ethiopian church were ethnic Copts. Joseph II consecrated Archbishop Abuna Basilios as the first native head of the Ethiopian Church on 14 January 1951. In 1959, Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria crowned Abuna Basilios as the first Patriarch of Ethiopia.

=== Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church ===

Following the independence of Eritrea from Ethiopia in 1993, the newly independent Eritrean government appealed to Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria for Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly. In 1994, Pope Shenouda ordained Abune Phillipos as first Archbishop of Eritrea.

=== Episcopal titles ===
== Administration ==

The Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria is governed by its Holy Synod, which is headed by the Patriarch of Alexandria. Under his authority are the metropolitan archbishops, metropolitan bishops, diocesan bishops, patriarchal exarchs, missionary bishops, auxiliary bishops, suffragan bishops, assistant bishops, chorbishops and the patriarchal vicars for the Church of Alexandria.

<text>The Family International (TFI) is an American new religious movement founded in 1968 by David Brandt Berg. The group has gone under a number of different names since its inception, including Teens for Christ, The Children of God (COG), The Family of Love, or simply The Family.

A British court case found the group was an authoritarian cult which engaged in the systematic physical and sexual abuse of children, resulting in lasting trauma among survivors. The group has also been accused of targeting vulnerable people.

== Overview ==
According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, &quot;at its height&quot; the Family movement had &quot;tens of thousands of members, including River and Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowan, and Jeremy Spencer&quot;.
TFI initially spread a message of salvation, apocalypticism, spiritual &quot;revolution and happiness&quot;, and distrust of the outside world, which the members called &quot;The System&quot;. Like some other fundamentalist groups, it &quot;foretold the coming of a dictator called the anti-Christ, the rise of a brutal One World Government, and its eventual overthrow by Jesus Christ, in the Second Coming&quot;.

In 1976, it began a method of evangelism called Flirty Fishing that used sex to &quot;show God&#x27;s love and mercy&quot; and win converts, resulting in controversy. TFI&#x27;s founder and prophetic leader, David Berg—who adopted the name &quot;Moses David&quot; while in Laurentide, Canada, and was also referred to &quot;Father David&quot; by members—gave himself the titles of &quot;King&quot;, &quot;The Last Endtime Prophet&quot;, &quot;Moses&quot;, and &quot;David&quot;.

Berg communicated with his followers via &quot;Mo Letters&quot;—letters of instruction and counsel on myriad spiritual and practical subjects—until his death in late 1994. After his death, his widow Karen Zerby became the leader of TFI, taking the titles of &quot;Queen&quot; and &quot;Prophetess&quot;. Zerby married Steve Kelly (also known as Peter Amsterdam), an assistant of Berg&#x27;s whom Berg had handpicked as her &quot;consort&quot;. Kelly took the title of &quot;King Peter&quot; and became the face of TFI, speaking in public more often than either Berg or Zerby. There have been multiple allegations of child sexual abuse made by past members.

Berg preached a combination of traditional Christian evangelism, with elements popular with the counterculture of the 1960s. There was much &quot;end-of-the-world imagery&quot; found in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament, preaching of impending doom for America and the ineffectiveness of established churches. Berg &quot;urged a return to the early Christian community described in the Bible&#x27;s Book of Acts, in which believers lived together and shared all,&quot; resembling the communal living of late 1960s hippies.

== History ==

=== The Children of God (1968–1977) ===
The founder of the movement, David Brandt Berg (1919–1994), was a former Christian and Missionary Alliance pastor. Berg started in 1968 as an evangelical preacher with a following of &quot;born-again hippies&quot; who gathered at a coffeehouse in Huntington Beach, in Orange County, California. In 1969, after having a revelation &quot;that California would be hit by a major earthquake&quot;, he left Huntington Beach and &quot;took his followers on the road&quot;.

They would proselytize in the streets and distribute pamphlets. Leaders within The Children of God (COG) were referred to as &quot;The Chain&quot;. Members of COG founded communes, first called colonies (now referred to as homes), in various cities.

Berg communicated with his followers by writing letters. He published nearly 3,000 letters over a period of 24 years, referred to as the &quot;Mo Letters&quot;. In a letter written in January 1972, Berg stated that he was God&#x27;s prophet for the contemporary world, attempting to further solidify his spiritual authority within the group. Berg&#x27;s letters also contained public acknowledgement of his own failings and weaknesses, for example, he issued a Mo Letter entitled &quot;My confession -- I was an alcoholic!&quot; (ML #1406 Summer 1982) relating his depression after some of his closest supporters quit in 1978.

In 1972, a Mo Letter reportedly entitled &quot;Flee as a Bird to Your Mountain&quot; was interpreted by some members, including Ruth Gordon, author of &quot;Children of Darkness&quot; about the cult, as a warning to leave America. &quot;God was going to destroy the U.S. ... and we had to get out.&quot; This, along with the pressure members felt that parents were trying to &quot;rescue&quot; children who had joined CoG, encouraged members to &quot;[migrate] abroad—first to Europe, eventually to Latin America and East Asia&quot;.

By 1972, COG stated it had 130 communities around the world, and by the mid-1970s, it had &quot;colonies&quot; in an estimated 70 countries. BBC reported 10,000 full-time COG members in the 1970s.

In 1976, Berg had introduced a new proselytizing method called Flirty Fishing (or FFing), which encouraged female members to &quot;show God&#x27;s love&quot; through sexual relationships with potential converts. Flirty Fishing was practiced by members of Berg&#x27;s inner circle starting in 1973, and was introduced to the general membership in 1976.

=== The Family of Love (1978–1981) ===
The Children of God was abolished in February 1978, and Berg renamed his group &quot;The Family of Love&quot; In what Berg called the &quot;Re-organization Nationalization Revolution&quot; (or RNR). Berg reorganized the movement, dismissing &quot;more than 300 leading members after hearing unspecified &#x27;reports of serious misconduct and abuse of their positions.&quot; Reportedly involved were The Chain&#x27;s abuse of authority, and disagreements within it about the continued use of Flirty Fishing. The group was also accused of sexually abusing and raping minors within the organization, with considerable evidence to support this claim. One eighth of the total membership left the movement. Those who remained became part of a reorganized movement called the Family of Love, and later, The Family. The majority of the group&#x27;s beliefs remained the same.

The Family of Love era was characterized by international expansion.

After 1978 Flirty Fishing &quot;increased drastically&quot; and became common practice within the group. A Mo Letter from 1980 (ML #999 May 1980) for example was headlined &quot;The Devil Hates Sex! --- But God Loves It!&quot;. 
In some areas flirty fishers used escort agencies to meet potential converts. According to TFI &quot;over 100,000 received God&#x27;s gift of salvation through Jesus, and some chose to live the life of a disciple and missionary&quot; as a result of Flirty Fishing. Researcher Bill Bainbridge obtained data from TFI suggesting that, from 1974 until 1987, members had sexual contact with 223,989 people while practicing Flirty Fishing.

=== The Family (1982–1994) ===

According to the Family&#x27;s official history, the group had &quot;far fewer common standards of conduct&quot; during The Family of Love stage than it had previously. In the late 1980s the group &quot;tightened its standards&quot; &quot;to ensure that all member communities provide a very wholesome environment for all, particularly the children&quot;, and changed its name to &quot;The Family&quot;. In March 1989, TF issued a statement that, in &quot;early 1985&quot;, an urgent memorandum had been sent to all members &quot;reminding them that any such activities [adult–child sexual contact] are within our group&quot; (emphasis in original), and such activities were grounds for immediate excommunication from the group. In January 2005, Claire Borowik, a spokesperson for TFI, stated:
 Due to the fact that our current zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual interaction between adults and underage minors was not in our literature published before 1986, we came to the realization that during a transitional stage of our movement, from 1978 until 1986, there were cases when some minors were subject to sexually inappropriate advances ... This was corrected officially in 1986, when any contact between an adult and minor (any person under 21 years of age) was declared an excommunicable offense.

After a 1993 expose in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the group broke &quot;years of virtual silence&quot; and began &quot;inviting reporters and religious scholars&quot; to visit its commune in La Habra, California, where at least a &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist (Gustav Niebuhr) found its members to be &quot;a clean-cut bunch, friendly and courteous&quot;. At that time The Family claimed to have &quot;about 9,000 members worldwide, with about 750 scattered across the United States&quot;. The group emphasized its mainstream Christian opposition to abortion, homosexuality, drugs and drunkenness and its respect for Rev. Billy Graham.

=== The Family (1995–2003) ===
After Berg&#x27;s death in October 1994, Karen Zerby (known in the group as Mama Maria, Queen Maria, Maria David, or Maria Fontaine) assumed leadership of the group.

In February 1995, the group introduced the &quot;Love Charter&quot;, which defined the rights and responsibilities of Charter Members and Homes. The Charter also included the &quot;Fundamental Family Rules&quot;, a summary of rules and guidelines from past TF publications which were still in effect.

In the 1994–95 British court case, the Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Alan Ward ruled that the group, including some of its top leaders, had in the past engaged in abusive sexual practices involving minors and had also used severe corporal punishment and sequestration of minors. He found that by 1995 TF had abandoned these practices and concluded that they were a safe environment for children. Nevertheless, he did require that the group cease all corporal punishment of children in the United Kingdom and denounce any of Berg&#x27;s writings that were &quot;responsible for children in TF having been subjected to sexually inappropriate behaviour&quot;.

=== The Family International (2004–present) ===

The Love Charter is The Family&#x27;s set governing document that entails each member&#x27;s rights, responsibilities and requirements, while the &quot;Missionary Member Statutes&quot; and &quot;Fellow Member Statutes&quot; were written for the governance of TFI&#x27;s Missionary member and Fellow Member circles, respectively. FD Homes were reviewed every six months against a published set of criteria. The Love Charter increased the number of single family homes as well as homes that relied on jobs such as self-employment.

==== Recent teachings ====
TFI&#x27;s recent teachings are based on beliefs which they term the &quot;new [spiritual] weapons&quot;. TFI members believe that they are soldiers in the spiritual war of good versus evil for the souls and hearts of men.

==== Spirit Helpers ====
&quot;Spirit Helpers&quot; include angels, other religious and mythical figures, and departed humans, including celebrities; for example the goddess Aphrodite, the Snowman, Merlin, the Sphinx, Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Richard Nixon, and Winston Churchill.

==== The Keys of the Kingdom ====
TFI believes that the Biblical passage &quot;I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven&quot; (Matthew 16:19), refers to an increasing amount of spiritual authority that was given to Peter and the early disciples. According to TFI beliefs, this passage refers to keys that were hidden and unused in the centuries that followed, but were again revealed through Karen Zerby as more power to pray and obtain miracles. TFI members call on the various Keys of the Kingdom for extra effect during prayer. The Keys, like most TFI beliefs, were published in magazines that looked like comic-books in order to make them teachable to children.

==== Loving Jesus ====
&quot;Loving Jesus&quot; is a term TFI members use to describe their intimate, sexual relationship with Jesus. TFI describes its &quot;Loving Jesus&quot; teaching as a radical form of bridal theology. They believe the church of followers is Christ&#x27;s bride, called to love and serve him with wifely fervor; however, this bridal theology is taken further, encouraging members to imagine Jesus is joining them during sexual intercourse and masturbation. Male members are cautioned to visualize themselves as women, in order to avoid a homosexual relationship with Jesus. Many TFI publications, and spirit messages claimed to be from Jesus himself, elaborate this intimate, sexual relation they believe Jesus desires and needs. TFI imagines itself as his special &quot;bride&quot; in graphic poetry, guided visualizations, artwork, and songs. Some TFI literature is not brought into conservative countries for fear it may be classified at customs as pornography. The literature outlining this view of Jesus and his desire for a sexual relationship with believers was edited for younger teens, then further edited for children.

== Criticism ==
The Family has been found liable in a British court, and also criticized by the press and the anti-cult movement. Ex-members have accused the Family&#x27;s leadership of following &quot;a policy of lying to outsiders&quot;, being &quot;steeped in a history of sexual deviance&quot; and even meddling &quot;in Third World politics&quot;. The Family replies that it is a victim of &quot;persecution&quot;.

Allegations of abuse and mistreatment have been publicly expressed by some of those who have left the group; examples include sisters Celeste Jones, Kristina Jones, and Juliana Buhring and Daniella Mestyanek Young, who both wrote books on their lives in TFI.

In 1971, an organization called FREECOG was founded by concerned parents and others, including deprogrammer Ted Patrick to free members of the COG from their involvement in the group.

At least one individual growing up in the family (Verity Carter) during the Children of God era described being sexually abused &quot;from the age of four by members of the... cult, including her own father&quot;. She blames the philosophy of David Berg, who told members that &quot;God was love and love was sex&quot;, so that sex should not be limited by age or relationship. Carter also complains of being &quot;repeatedly beaten and whipped for the smallest of transgressions&quot;, being denied &quot;music or television or culture&quot;, or other &quot;contact with the outside world&quot;, so that she had &quot;no idea how the world worked&quot; other than how to manipulate the &quot;systemites&quot; (outsiders), like social workers.

Author Don Lattin interviewed numerous members of the Family for his book &quot;Jesus Freaks&quot;. In a review of his book, Paul Burgarino describes Berg as &quot;drawing from the remnants of hippie life—people with nothing to lose, nowhere to go, and no Christian background&quot; to alert them to deviations in Berg&#x27;s preaching. One ex–Children of God member, Jerry Golland, describes himself at the time of joining the group as penniless and so depressed that the Children of God scraped him &quot;off the street&quot;. Members would &quot;learn to spot, you know... a vulnerable person. We called them sheep&quot;, Golland told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Pressure to raise money could also be intense. Ex-member Golland says that members who were good at raising money and distributing the pamphlets were called &quot;Shiners&quot;. Those with poor sales were called &quot;Shamers&quot;. &quot;If you missed your quota you could not come home for dinner&quot;, he said.

<doc id="7604" wikidata="Q93304" url="?curid=7604" title="Code of Hammurabi">
<text>The Code of Hammurabi is a Babylonian legal text composed during 1755–1750 BC. It is the longest, best-organized, and best-preserved legal text from the ancient Near East. It is written in the Old Babylonian dialect of Akkadian, purportedly by Hammurabi, sixth king of the First Dynasty of Babylon. The primary copy of the text is inscribed on a basalt stele tall.

The stele was rediscovered in 1901 at the site of Susa in present-day Iran, where it had been taken as plunder six hundred years after its creation. The text itself was copied and studied by Mesopotamian scribes for over a millennium. The stele now resides in the Louvre Museum.

The top of the stele features an image in relief of Hammurabi with Shamash, the Babylonian sun god and god of justice. Below the relief are about 4,130 lines of cuneiform text: one fifth contains a prologue and epilogue in poetic style, while the remaining four fifths contain what are generally called the laws. In the prologue, Hammurabi claims to have been granted his rule by the gods &quot;to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak&quot;. The laws are casuistic, expressed as &quot;if... then&quot; conditional sentences. Their scope is broad, including, for example, criminal law, family law, property law, and commercial law.

Modern scholars responded to the Code with admiration at its perceived fairness and respect for the rule of law, and at the complexity of Old Babylonian society. There was also much discussion of its influence on the Mosaic Law. Scholars quickly identified —the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; principle—underlying the two collections. Debate among Assyriologists has since centred around several aspects of the Code: its purpose, its underlying principles, its language, and its relation to earlier and later law collections.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding these issues, Hammurabi is regarded outside Assyriology as an important figure in the history of law and the document as a true legal code. The U.S. Capitol has a relief portrait of Hammurabi alongside those of other historic lawgivers. There are replicas of the stele in numerous institutions, including the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.
==Background==
===Hammurabi===

Hammurabi (or Hammurapi), the sixth king of the Amorite First Dynasty of Babylon, ruled from 1792 to 1750 BC (middle chronology). He secured Babylonian dominance over the Mesopotamian plain through military prowess, diplomacy, and treachery. When Hammurabi inherited his father Sin-Muballit&#x27;s throne, Babylon held little local sway; the local hegemon was Rim-Sin of Larsa. Hammurabi waited until Rim-Sin grew old, then conquered his territory in one swift campaign, leaving his organisation intact. Later, Hammurabi betrayed allies in Eshnunna, Elam, and Mari to gain their territories.

Hammurabi had an aggressive foreign policy, but his letters suggest he was concerned with the welfare of his many subjects and was interested in law and justice. He commissioned extensive construction works, and in his letters, he frequently presents himself as his people&#x27;s shepherd. Justice is also a theme of the prologue to the Code, and &quot;the word translated &#x27;justice&#x27; []... is one whose root runs through both prologue and epilogue&quot;.

===Earlier law collections===

Although Hammurabi&#x27;s Code was the first Mesopotamian law collection to be discovered, it was not the first written; several earlier collections survive. These collections were written in Sumerian and Akkadian. They also purport to have been written by rulers. There were almost certainly more such collections, as statements of other rulers suggest the custom was widespread. The similarities between these law collections make it tempting to assume a consistent underlying legal system. As with the Code of Hammurabi, however, it is difficult to interpret the purpose and underlying legal systems of these earlier collections, prompting numerous scholars to question whether this should be attempted. Extant collections include:

* The Code of Ur-Nammu of Ur.
* The Code of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin.
* The Laws of Eshnunna (written by Bilalama or by Dadusha).
* The &quot;Laws of X,&quot; which, rather than a distinct collection, may be the end of the Code of Ur-Nammu.

There are additionally thousands of documents from the practice of law, from before and during the Old Babylonian period. These documents include contracts, judicial rulings, letters on legal cases, and reform documents such as that of Urukagina, king of Lagash in the mid-3rd millennium BC, whose reforms combatted corruption. Mesopotamia has the most comprehensive surviving legal corpus from before the &quot; Digest&quot; of Justinian, even compared to those from ancient Greece and Rome.

==Copies==
===Louvre stele===

The first copy of the text found, and still the most complete, is on a stele. The stele is now displayed on the ground floor of the Louvre, in Room 227 of the Richelieu wing. At the top is an image of Hammurabi with Shamash, the Babylonian sun god and god of justice. Below the image are about 4,130 lines of cuneiform text: One-fifth contains a prologue and epilogue, while the remaining four-fifths contain what are generally called the laws. Near the bottom, seven columns of the laws, each with more than eighty lines, were polished and erased in antiquity. The stele was found in three large fragments and reconstructed. It is high, with a circumference is at the summit and at the base. Hammurabi&#x27;s image is high and wide.

The Louvre stele was found at the site of the ancient Elamite city of Susa. Susa is in modern-day Khuzestan Province, Iran (Persia at the time of excavation). The stele was excavated by the French Archaeological Mission under the direction of Jacques de Morgan. Father Jean-Vincent Scheil published the initial report in the fourth volume of the &quot;Reports of the Delegation to Persia&quot; (). According to Scheil, the stele&#x27;s fragments were found on the tell of the Susa acropolis (), between December 1901 and January 1902. The few, large fragments made assembly easy.

Scheil hypothesised that the stele had been taken to Susa by the Elamite king Shutruk-Nakhunte and that he had commissioned the erasure of several columns of laws to write his legend there. It has been proposed that the relief portion of the stele, especially the beards of Hammurabi and Shamash, was reworked at the same time. Roth suggests the stele was taken as plunder from Sippar, where Hammurabi lived towards the end of his reign.

===Other copies===
Fragments of a second and possibly third stele recording the Code were found along with the Louvre stele at Susa. Over fifty manuscripts containing the laws are known. They were found not only in Susa but also in Babylon, Nineveh, Assur, Borsippa, Nippur, Sippar, Ur, Larsa, and more. Copies were created during Hammurabi&#x27;s reign, and also after it, since the text became a part of the scribal curriculum. Copies have been found dating from one thousand years after the stele&#x27;s creation, and a catalog from the library of Neo-Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (685–631 BC) lists a copy of the &quot;judgments of Hammurabi&quot;. The additional copies fill in most of the stele&#x27;s original text, including much of the erased section.

==Early scholarship==

The of the Code was published by Father Jean-Vincent Scheil in 1902, in the fourth volume of the &quot;Reports of the Delegation to Persia&quot; (). After a brief introduction with details of the excavation, Scheil gave a transliteration and a free translation into French, as well as a selection of images. Editions in other languages soon followed: in German by Hugo Winckler in 1902, in English by C. H. W. Johns in 1903, and in Italian by Pietro Bonfante, also in 1903.

The Code was thought to be the earliest Mesopotamian law collection when it was rediscovered in 1902—for example, C. H. W. Johns&#x27; 1903 book was titled &quot;The Oldest Code of Laws in the World&quot;. The English writer H. G. Wells included Hammurabi in the first volume of &quot;The Outline of History&quot;, and to Wells too the Code was &quot;the earliest known code of law&quot;. However, three earlier collections were rediscovered afterwards: the Code of Lipit-Ishtar in 1947, the Laws of Eshnunna in 1948, and the Code of Ur-Nammu in 1952. Early commentators dated Hammurabi and the stele to the 23rd century BC. However, this is an earlier estimate than even the &quot;ultra-long chronology&quot; would support. The Code was compiled near the end of Hammurabi&#x27;s reign. This was deduced partly from the list of his achievements in the prologue.

Scheil enthused about the stele&#x27;s importance and perceived fairness, calling it &quot;a moral and political masterpiece&quot;. C. H. W. Johns called it &quot;one of the most important monuments in the history of the human race&quot;. He remarked that &quot;there are many humanitarian clauses and much protection is given the weak and the helpless&quot;, and even lauded a &quot;wonderful modernity of spirit&quot;. John Dyneley Prince called the Code&#x27;s rediscovery &quot;the most important event which has taken place in the development of Assyriological science since the days of Rawlinson and Layard&quot;. Charles Francis Horne commended the &quot;wise law-giver&quot; and his &quot;celebrated code&quot;. James Henry Breasted noted the Code&#x27;s &quot;justice to the widow, the orphan, and the poor&quot;, but remarked that it &quot;also allows many of the old and naïve ideas of justice to stand&quot;. Commentators praised the advanced society they believed the Code evinced. Several singled out perceived secularism: Owen Jenkins, for example, but even Charles Souvay for the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, who opined that unlike the Mosaic Law the Code was &quot;founded upon the dictates of reason&quot;. The question of the Code&#x27;s influence on the Mosaic Law received much early attention. Scholars also identified Hammurabi with the Biblical figure Amraphel, but this proposal has since been abandoned.

==Frame==
===Relief===
The relief appears to show Hammurabi standing before a seated Shamash. Shamash wears the horned crown of divinity and has a solar attribute, flames, spouting from his shoulders. Contrastingly, Scheil, in his , identified the seated figure as Hammurabi and the standing figure as Shamash. Scheil also held that the scene showed Shamash dictating to Hammurabi while Hammurabi held a scribe&#x27;s stylus, gazing attentively at the god. Martha Roth lists other interpretations: &quot;that the king is offering the laws to the god; that the king is accepting or offering the emblems of sovereignty of the rod and ring; or—most probably—that these emblems are the measuring tools of the rod-measure and rope-measure used in temple-building&quot;. Hammurabi may even be imitating Shamash. It is certain, though, that the draughtsman showed Hammurabi&#x27;s close links to the divine realm, using composition and iconography.

===Prologue===
The prologue and epilogue together occupy one-fifth of the text. Out of around 4,130 lines, the prologue occupies 300 lines and the epilogue occupies 500. They are in ring composition around the laws, though there is no visual break distinguishing them from the laws. Both are written in poetic style, and, as William W. Davies wrote, &quot;contain much... which sounds very like braggadocio&quot;.

The 300-line prologue begins with an etiology of Hammurabi&#x27;s royal authority (1–49). Anum, the Babylonian sky god and king of the gods, granted rulership over humanity to Marduk. Marduk chose the centre of his earthly power to be Babylon, which in the real world worshipped him as its tutelary god. Marduk established the office of kingship within Babylon. Finally, Anum, along with the Babylonian wind god Enlil, chose Hammurabi to be Babylon&#x27;s king. Hammurabi was to rule &quot;to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak&quot; (37–39: ). He was to rise like Shamash over the Mesopotamians (the , literally the &quot;black-headed people&quot;) and illuminate the land (40–44).

Hammurabi then lists his achievements and virtues (50–291). These are expressed in noun form, in the Akkadian first person singular nominal sentence construction &quot;[noun]... &quot; (&quot;I am [noun]&quot;). The first nominal sentence (50–53) is short: &quot;I am Hammurabi, the shepherd, selected by the god Enlil&quot; (). Then Hammurabi continues for over 200 lines in a single nominal sentence with the delayed to the very end (291).

Hammurabi repeatedly calls himself , &quot;pious&quot; (lines 61, 149, 241, and 272). The metaphor of Hammurabi as his people&#x27;s shepherd also recurs. It was a common metaphor for ancient Near Eastern kings, but is perhaps justified by Hammurabi&#x27;s interest in his subjects&#x27; affairs. His affinities with many different gods are stressed throughout. He is portrayed as dutiful in restoring and maintaining temples and peerless on the battlefield. The list of his accomplishments has helped establish that the text was written late in Hammurabi&#x27;s reign. After the list, Hammurabi explains that he fulfilled Marduk&#x27;s request to establish &quot;truth and justice&quot; () for the people (292–302), although the prologue never directly references the laws. The prologue ends &quot;at that time:&quot; (303: ) and the laws begin.

===Epilogue===

Unlike the prologue, the 500-line epilogue is explicitly related to the laws. The epilogue begins (3144&#x27;–3151&#x27;): &quot;These are the just decisions which Hammurabi... has established&quot; (). He exalts his laws and his magnanimity (3152&#x27;–3239&#x27;). He then expresses a hope that &quot;any wronged man who has a lawsuit&quot; () may have the laws of the stele read aloud to him and know his rights (3240&#x27;–3256&#x27;). This would bring Hammurabi praise (3257&#x27;–3275&#x27;) and divine favour (3276&#x27;–3295&#x27;). Hammurabi wishes for good fortune for any ruler who heeds his pronouncements and respects his stele (3296&#x27;–3359&#x27;). However, he invokes the wrath of the gods on any man who disobeys or erases his pronouncements (3360&#x27;–3641&#x27;, the end of the text).

The epilogue contains much legal imagery, and the phrase &quot;to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak&quot; (3202&#x27;–3203&#x27;: ) is reused from the prologue. However, the king&#x27;s main concern appears to be ensuring that his achievements are not forgotten and his name not sullied. The list of curses heaped upon any future defacer is 281 lines long and extremely forceful. Some of the curses are very vivid: &quot;may the god Sin... decree for him a life that is no better than death&quot; (3486&#x27;–3508&#x27;: ); &quot;may he [the future defacer] conclude every day, month, and year of his reign with groaning and mourning&quot; (3497&#x27;–3501&#x27;: ); may he experience &quot;the spilling of his life force like water&quot; (3435&#x27;–3436&#x27;: ). Hammurabi implores a variety of gods individually to turn their particular attributes against the defacer. For example: &quot;may the [storm] god Adad... deprive him of the benefits of rain from heaven and flood from the springs&quot; (3509&#x27;–3515&#x27;: ); &quot;may the god [of wisdom] Ea... deprive him of all understanding and wisdom, and may he lead him into confusion&quot; (3440&#x27;–3451&#x27;: ). Gods and goddesses are invoked in this order:
# Anum (3387&#x27;–3394&#x27;)
# Enlil (3395&#x27;–3422&#x27;)
# Ninlil (3423&#x27;–3439&#x27;)
# Ea (3440&#x27;–3458&#x27;)
# Shamash (3459&#x27;–3485&#x27;)
# Sin (3486&#x27;–3508&#x27;)
# Adad (3509&#x27;–3525&#x27;)
# Zababa (3526&#x27;–3536&#x27;)
# Ishtar (3537&#x27;–3573&#x27;)
# Nergal (3574&#x27;–3589&#x27;)
# Nintu (3590&#x27;–3599&#x27;)
# Ninkarrak (3600&#x27;–3619&#x27;)
# All the gods (3620&#x27;–3635&#x27;)
# Enlil, a second time (3636&#x27;–3641&#x27;)
==Laws==
The Code of Hammurabi is the longest and best-organised legal text from the ancient Near East, as well as the best-preserved. The classification below (columns 1–3) is Driver &amp; Miles&#x27;, with several amendments, and Roth&#x27;s translation is used. Laws represented by letters are those reconstructed primarily from documents other than the Louvre stele.

==Theories of purpose==
The purpose and legal authority of the Code have been disputed since the mid-20th century. Theories fall into three main categories: that it is legislation, whether a code of law or a body of statutes; that it is a sort of law report, containing records of past cases and judgments; and that it is an abstract work of jurisprudence. The jurisprudence theory has gained much support within Assyriology.

===Legislation===
The term &quot;code&quot; presupposes that the document was intended to be enforced as legislation. It was used by Scheil in his , and widely adopted afterwards. C. H. W. Johns, one of the most prolific early commentators on the document, proclaimed that &quot;the Code well deserves its name&quot;. Recent Assyriologists have used the term without comment, as well as scholars outside Assyriology. However, only if the text was intended as enforced legislation can it truly be called a code of law and its provisions laws.

The document, on first inspection, resembles a highly organised code similar to the Code of Justinian and the Napoleonic Code. There is also evidence that , which in the Code of Hammurabi sometimes denote individual &quot;laws&quot;, were enforced. One copy of the Code calls it a , &quot;royal decree&quot;, which denotes a kind of enforced legislation.

However, the arguments against this view are strong. Firstly, it would make a very unusual code—Reuven Yaron called the designation &quot;Code&quot; a &quot;persistent misnomer&quot;. Vital areas of society and commerce are omitted. For example, Marc Van De Mieroop observes that the Code &quot;deals with cattle and agricultural fields, but it almost entirely ignores the work of shepherds, vital to Babylonia&#x27;s economy&quot;. Then, against the legislation theory more generally, highly implausible circumstances are covered, such as threshing with goats, animals far too unruly for the task (law 270). The laws are also strictly casuistic (&quot;if... then&quot;); unlike in the Mosaic Law, there are no apodictic laws (general commands). These would more obviously suggest prescriptive legislation. The strongest argument against the legislation theory, however, is that most judges appear to have paid the Code no attention. This line of criticism originated with Benno Landsberger in 1950. No Mesopotamian legal document explicitly references the Code or any other law collection, despite the great scale of the corpus. Two references to prescriptions on &quot;a stele&quot; () come closest. In contrast, numerous judgments cite royal -decrees. Raymond Westbrook held that this strengthened the argument from silence that ancient Near Eastern legal &quot;codes&quot; had legal import. Furthermore, many Old Babylonian judgments run entirely counter to the Code&#x27;s prescriptions.

===Law report===
A second theory is that the Code is a sort of law report, and as such contains records of past cases and judgments, albeit phrased abstractly. This would provide one explanation for the casuistic format of the &quot;laws&quot;; indeed, Jean Bottéro believed he had found a record of a case that inspired one. However, such finds are inconclusive and very rare, despite the scale of the Mesopotamian legal corpus. Furthermore, legal judgments were frequently recorded in Mesopotamia, and they recount the facts of the case without generalising them. These judgments were concerned almost exclusively with points of fact, prompting Martha Roth to comment: &quot;I know of only one case out of thousands extant that might be said to revolve around a point of law&quot;.

===Jurisprudence===
A third theory, which has gained traction within Assyriology, is that the Code is not a true code but an abstract treatise on how judgments should be formulated. This led Fritz Rudolf Kraus, in an early formulation of the theory, to call it jurisprudence (). Kraus proposed that it was a work of Mesopotamian scholarship in the same category as omen collections like and . Others have provided their own versions of this theory. A. Leo Oppenheim remarked that the Code of Hammurabi and similar Mesopotamian law collections &quot;represent an interesting formulation of social criticism and should not be taken as normative directions&quot;.

This interpretation bypasses the problem of low congruence between the Code and actual legal judgments. Secondly, the Code does bear striking similarities to other works of Mesopotamian scholarship. Key points of similarity are the list format and the order of the items, which Ann Guinan describes as a complex &quot;serial logic&quot;. Marc Van De Mieroop explains that, in common with other works of Mesopotamian scholarship such as omen lists, king lists, and god lists, the entries of the Code of Hammurabi are arranged according to two principles. These are &quot;opposition&quot;—whereby a variable in one entry is altered to make another entry—and &quot;pointillism&quot;—whereby new conditions are added to an entry, or paradigmatic series pursued, to generate a sequence. Van De Mieroop provides the following examples:


Laws 215 and 218 illustrate the principle of opposition: one variable of the first law, the outcome of the operations, is altered to create the second.

Here, following the principle of pointillism, circumstances are added to the first entry to create more entries. Pointillism also lets list entries be generated by following paradigmatic series common to multiple branches of scholarship. It can thus explain the implausible entries. For example, in the case of the goat used for threshing (law 270), the previous laws concern other animals that &quot;were&quot; used for threshing. The established series of domesticated beasts dictated that a goat come next.

Wolfram von Soden, who decades earlier called this way of thinking (&quot;list science&quot;), often denigrated it. However, more recent writers, such as Marc Van De Mieroop, Jean Bottéro, and Ann Guinan, have either avoided value judgments or expressed admiration. Lists were central to Mesopotamian science and logic, and their distinctive structural principles let entries be generated infinitely. Linking the Code to the scribal tradition within which &quot;list science&quot; emerged also explains why trainee scribes copied and studied it for over a millennium. The Code appears in a late Babylonian (7th–6th century BC) list of literary and scholarly texts. No other law collection became so entrenched in the curriculum. Rather than a code of laws, then, it may be a scholarly treatise.

Much has been written on what the Code suggests about Old Babylonian society and its legal system. For example, whether it demonstrates that there were no professional advocates, or that there were professional judges. Scholars who approach the Code as a self-contained document renounce such claims.

==Underlying principles==
One principle widely accepted to underlie the Code is , or &quot;eye for an eye&quot;. Laws 196 and 200 respectively prescribe an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth when one man destroys another&#x27;s. Punishments determined by could be transferred to the sons of the wrongdoer. For example, law 229 states that the death of a homeowner in a house collapse necessitates the death of the house&#x27;s builder. The following law 230 states that if the homeowner&#x27;s son died, the builder&#x27;s son must die also.

Persons were not equal before the law; not just age and profession but also class and gender dictated the punishment or remedy they received. Three main kinds of person, , , and (male)/ (female), are mentioned throughout the Code. A / was a male/female slave. As for and , though contentious, it seems likely that the difference was one of social class, with meaning something like &quot;gentleman&quot; and something like &quot;commoner&quot;. The penalties were not necessarily stricter for a than an : a &#x27;s life may have been cheaper, but so were some of his fines. There was also inequality within these classes: laws 200 and 202, for example, show that one could be of higher rank than another.

The above principles are distant in spirit from modern systems of common and civil law, but some may be more familiar. One such principle is the presumption of innocence; the first two laws of the stele prescribe punishments, determined by , for unsubstantiated accusations. Written evidence was valued highly, especially in matters of contract. One crime was given only one punishment. The laws also recognized the importance of the intentions of a defendant. Lastly, the Code&#x27;s establishment on public stelae was supposedly intended to increase access to justice. Whether or not this was true, suggesting that a wronged man have the stele read aloud to him (lines 3240&#x27;–3254&#x27;) is a concrete measure in this direction, given the inaccessibility of scribal education in the Old Babylonian period.

The prologue asserts that Hammurabi was chosen by the gods. Raymond Westbrook observed that in ancient Near Eastern law, &quot;the king was the primary source of legislation&quot;. However, they could delegate their god-given legal authority to judges. However, as Owen B. Jenkins observed, the prescriptions themselves bear &quot;an astonishing absence... of all theological or even ceremonial law&quot;.

==Language==

The laws are written in the Old Babylonian dialect of Akkadian. Their style is regular and repetitive, and today they are a standard set text for introductory Akkadian classes. However, as A. Leo Oppenheim summarises, the cuneiform signs themselves are &quot;vertically arranged... within boxes placed in bands side by side from right to left&quot;, an arrangement already antiquated by Hammurabi&#x27;s time.

The laws are expressed in casuistic format: they are conditional sentences with the case detailed in the protasis (&quot;if&quot; clause) and the remedy given in the apodosis (&quot;then&quot; clause). The protasis begins , &quot;if&quot;, except when it adds to circumstances already specified in a previous law (e.g. laws 36, 38, and 40). The preterite is used for simple past verbs in the protasis, or possibly for a simple conditional. The perfect often appears at the end of the protasis after one or more preterites to convey sequence of action, or possibly a hypothetical conditional. The durative, sometimes called the &quot;present&quot; in Assyriology, may express intention in the laws. For ease of English reading, some translations give preterite and perfect verbs in the protasis a present sense. In the apodosis, the verbs are in the durative, though the sense varies between permissive—&quot;it is permitted that &quot;x&quot; happen&quot;—and instructive—&quot;&quot;x&quot; must/will happen&quot;. In both protasis and apodosis, sequence of action is conveyed by suffixing verbs with , &quot;and&quot;. can also have the sense &quot;but&quot;.

The Code is relatively well-understood, but some items of its vocabulary are controversial. As mentioned, the terms and have proved difficult to translate. They probably denote respectively a male member of a higher and lower social class. Wolfram von Soden, in his &quot;Akkadisches Handwörterbuch&quot;, proposed that was derived from , &quot;to bow down/supplicate&quot;. As a word for a man of low social standing, it has endured, possibly from a Sumerian root, into Arabic (), Italian (), Spanish (), and French (). However, some earlier translators, also seeking to explain the &#x27;s special treatment, translated it as &quot;leper&quot; and even &quot;noble&quot;. Some translators have supplied stilted readings for , such as &quot;seignior&quot;, &quot;elite man&quot;, and &quot;member of the aristocracy&quot;; others have left it untranslated. Certain legal terms have also proved difficult to translate. For example, and can denote the law in general as well as individual laws, verdicts, divine pronouncements and other phenomena. can likewise denote the law in general as well as a kind of royal decree.

==Relation to other law collections==
===Other Mesopotamian===

The Code of Hammurabi bears strong similarities to earlier Mesopotamian law collections. Many purport to have been written by rulers, and this tradition was probably widespread. Earlier law collections express their god-given legitimacy similarly. Like the Code of Hammurabi, they feature prologues and epilogues: the Code of Ur-Nammu has a prologue, the Code of Lipit-Ishtar a prologue and an epilogue, and the Laws of Eshnunna an epilogue. Also, like the Code of Hammurabi, they uphold the &quot;one crime, one punishment&quot; principle. The cases covered and language used are, overall, strikingly similar. Scribes were still copying earlier law collections, such as the Code of Ur-Nammu, when Hammurabi produced his own Code. This suggests that earlier collections may have not only resembled the Code but influenced it. Raymond Westbrook maintained that there was a fairly consistent tradition of &quot;ancient Near Eastern law&quot; which included the Code of Hammurabi, and that this was largely customary law. Nonetheless, there are differences: for example, Stephen Bertman has suggested that where earlier collections are concerned with compensating victims, the Code is concerned with physically punishing offenders. Additionally, the above conclusions of similarity and influence apply only to the law collections themselves. The actual legal practices from the context of each code are mysterious.

The Code of Hammurabi also bears strong similarities to later Mesopotamian law collections: to the casuistic Middle Assyrian Laws and to the Neo-Babylonian Laws, whose format is largely relative (&quot;a man who...&quot;). It is easier to posit direct influence for these later collections, given the Code&#x27;s survival through the scribal curriculum. Lastly, although influence is more difficult to trace, there is evidence that the Hittite laws may have been part of the same tradition of legal writing outside Mesopotamia proper.

===Mosaic, Graeco-Roman, and modern===
The relationship of the Code of Hammurabi to the Mosaic Law, specifically the Covenant Code of Exodus 20:22–23:19, has been a subject of discussion since its discovery. Friedrich Delitzsch argued the case for strong influence in a 1902 lecture, in one episode of the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Babel and Bible&quot;, or &quot;Panbabylonism&quot;) debate on the influence of ancient Mesopotamian cultures on ancient Israel. However, he was met with strong resistance. There was cultural contact between Mesopotamia and the Levant, and Middle Bronze Age tablets of casuistic cuneiform law have been found at Hazor. There are also similarities between the Code of Hamurabi and the Covenant Code: in the casuistic format, in principles such as (&quot;eye for an eye&quot;), and in the content of the provisions. Some similarities are striking, such as in the provisions concerning a man-goring ox (Code of Hammurabi laws 250–252, Exodus 21:28–32). Certain writers have posited direct influence: David P. Wright, for example, asserts that the Covenant Code is &quot;directly, primarily, and throughout dependent upon the Laws of Hammurabi&quot;, &quot;a creative rewriting of Mesopotamian sources... to be viewed as an academic abstraction rather than a digest of laws&quot;. Others posit indirect influence, such as via Aramaic or Phoenician intermediaries. The consensus, however, is that the similarities are a result of inheriting common traditions. In 1916, George A. Barton cited &quot;a similarity of antecedents and of general intellectual outlook&quot;. More recently, David Winton Thomas has stated: &quot;There is no ground for assuming any direct borrowing by the Hebrew from the Babylonian. Even where the two sets of laws differ little in the letter, they differ much in the spirit&quot;.

The influence of the Code of Hammurabi on later law collections is difficult to establish. Marc Van De Mieroop suggests that it may have influenced the Greek Gortyn Code and the Roman Twelve Tables. However, even Van De Mieroop acknowledges that most Roman law is not similar to the Code, or likely to have been influenced by it.

Knowing the Code&#x27;s influence on modern law requires knowing its influence on Mosaic and Graeco-Roman law. Since this is contentious, commentators have restricted themselves to observing similarities and differences between the Code and, e.g., United States law and medieval law. Some have remarked that the punishments found in the Code are no more severe, and, in some cases, less so.

Law 238 stipulates that a sea captain, ship-manager, or ship charterer that saved a ship from total loss was only required to pay one-half the value of the ship to the ship-owner. In the &quot;Digesta seu Pandectae&quot; (533), the second volume of the codification of laws ordered by Justinian I (527–565) of the Eastern Roman Empire, a legal opinion written by the Roman jurist Paulus at the beginning of the Crisis of the Third Century in 235 AD was included about the &quot;Lex Rhodia&quot; (&quot;Rhodian law&quot;) that articulates the general average principle of marine insurance established on the island of Rhodes in approximately 1000 to 800 BC as a member of the Doric Hexapolis, plausibly by the Phoenicians during the proposed Dorian invasion and emergence of the purported Sea Peoples during the Greek Dark Ages (c. 1100 – c. 750) that led to the proliferation of the Doric Greek dialect. The law of general average constitutes the fundamental principle that underlies all insurance.

==Reception outside Assyriology==
The Code is often referred to in legal scholarship, where its provisions are assumed to be laws, and the document is assumed to be a true code of laws. This is also true outside academia.

There is a relief portrait of Hammurabi over the doors to the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol, along with portraits of 22 others &quot;noted for their work in establishing the principles that underlie American law&quot;. There are replicas of the Louvre stele in institutions around the world, including the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City and the Peace Palace in The Hague (seat of the International Court of Justice).

==Medico-legal legacy and political implications==
Hammurabi&#x27;s Code is notable for its comprehensive approach to law, covering subjects from criminal acts to medical practices. The Code includes specific rules that regulate medical treatments, set surgery fees, and punish malpractice. For instance, if a physician caused the death of a noble during surgery, they would be severely punished, sometimes having their hand cut off. This harshness portrays how seriously medical responsibility was taken even in ancient times.

From a political science perspective, Hammurabi&#x27;s Code is valuable and fundamental because it demonstrates how law was used to reinforce social hierarchies and maintain control. writes that the Code&#x27;s laws were applied differently depending on a person&#x27;s social class, so nobles received greater protection than commoners and enslaved people. This legal stratification reflects the power dynamic of Babylonian society and shows how law was used not just to govern but also to preserve the social order.

Finally, the Hammurabi&#x27;s Code could be considered impressive by its power (despite its modern irrelevancy) and severity. The harsh punishments may seem extreme by modern standards, but they were likely necessary to maintain order in a society where survival depended on strict adherence to rules. At the same time, Hammurabi&#x27;s Code represents a significant step forward in the development of law, medicine and the medico-legal system.

<text>Rum and Coke, or the Cuba libre ( , ; literally &quot;Free Cuba&quot;), is a highball cocktail consisting of cola, rum, and in many recipes lime juice on ice. Traditionally, the cola ingredient is Coca-Cola (&quot;Coke&quot;) and the alcohol is a light rum such as Bacardi; however, the drink may be made with various types of rums and cola brands, and lime juice may or may not be included.

The cocktail originated in the early 20th century in Cuba, after the country won independence in the Spanish–American War. It subsequently became popular across Cuba, the United States, and other countries. Its simple recipe and inexpensive, ubiquitous ingredients have made it one of the world&#x27;s most-popular alcoholic drinks. Drink critics often consider the drink mediocre, but it has been noted for its historical significance.

==History==
The drink was created in Cuba in the early 1900s, but its exact origins are not certain. It became popular shortly after 1900, when bottled Coca-Cola was first imported into Cuba from the United States. Its origin is associated with the heavy U.S. presence in Cuba following the Spanish–American War of 1898; the drink&#x27;s traditional name, &quot;Cuba libre&quot; (Free Cuba), was the slogan of the Cuban independence movement. The Cuba libre is sometimes said to have been created during the Spanish–American War. However, this predates the first distribution of Coca-Cola to Cuba in 1900. A drink called a &quot;Cuba libre&quot; was indeed known in 1898, but this was a mix of water and brown sugar.

Fausto Rodriguez, a Bacardi advertising executive, claimed to have been present when the drink was first poured, and produced a notarized affidavit to that effect in 1965. According to Rodriguez, this took place in August 1900, when he was a 14-year-old messenger working for a member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps in Havana. One day at a local bar, Rodriguez&#x27;s employer ordered Bacardi rum mixed with Coca-Cola. This intrigued a nearby group of American soldiers, who ordered a round for themselves, giving birth to a popular new drink. Bacardi published Rodriguez&#x27;s affidavit in a &quot;Life&quot; magazine ad in 1966. However, Rodriguez&#x27;s status as a Bacardi executive has led some commentators to doubt the veracity of his story. Another story states that the drink was first created in 1902 at Havana&#x27;s El Floridita restaurant to celebrate the anniversary of Cuban independence.

The drink became a staple in Cuba, catching on due to the pervasiveness of its ingredients. Havana was already known for its iced drinks in the 19th century, as it was one of the few warm-weather cities that had abundant stores of ice shipped down from colder regions. Bacardi and other Cuban rums also boomed after independence brought in large numbers of foreign tourists and investors, as well as new opportunities for exporting alcohol. Light rums such as Bacardi became favored for cocktails as they were considered to mix well. Coca-Cola had been a common mixer in the United States ever since it was first bottled in 1886, and it became a ubiquitous drink in many countries after it was first exported in 1900.

Rum and Coke quickly spread from Cuba to the United States. In the early 20th century the cocktail, like Coca-Cola itself, was most popular in the Southern United States. During the Prohibition era from 1922 to 1933, Coca-Cola became a favored mixer for disguising the taste of low-quality rums, as well as other liquors. In 1921 H. L. Mencken jokingly wrote of a South Carolina variant called the &quot;jump stiddy&quot;, which consisted of Coca-Cola mixed with denatured alcohol drained from automobile radiators. After Prohibition, rum and Coke became prevalent in the northern and western U.S. as well, and in both high-brow and low-brow circles.

Rum and Coke achieved a new level of popularity during World War II. Starting in 1940, the United States established a series of outposts in the British West Indies to defend against the German Navy. The American presence created cross-cultural demand, with American servicemen and the locals developing tastes for each other&#x27;s products. In particular, American military personnel took to Caribbean rum due to its inexpensiveness, while Coca-Cola became especially prevalent in the islands thanks to the company shipping it out with the military. Within the United States, imported rum became increasingly popular, as government quotas for industrial alcohol reduced the output of American distillers of domestic liquors.

In 1943, Lord Invader&#x27;s Calypso song &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot; drew further attention to the drink in Trinidad. The song was an adaptation of Lionel Belasco&#x27;s 1904 composition &quot;L&#x27;Année Passée&quot; with new lyrics about American soldiers in Trinidad cavorting with local girls and drinking rum and Coke. Comedian Morey Amsterdam plagiarized &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot; and licensed it to the Andrews Sisters as his own work. The Andrews Sisters&#x27; version was a major hit in 1945 and further boosted the popularity of rum and Coke, especially in the military. Lord Invader and the owners of Belasco&#x27;s composition successfully sued Amsterdam for the song&#x27;s rights.

During the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Bacardi fled to Puerto Rico. The following year, the U.S. placed an embargo against Cuba, which made Cuban-made rum unavailable in the U.S. and Coca-Cola largely unavailable in Cuba. As such, it became difficult to make a rum and Coke with its traditional ingredients in either country.

==Popularity and reception==

The rum and Coke is very popular; Bacardi says that it is the world&#x27;s second-most-popular alcoholic drink. Its popularity derives from the ubiquity and low cost of the main ingredients, and the fact that it is very easy to make. As it can be made with any quantity or style of rum, it is simple to prepare and difficult to ruin.

Drink critics often have a low opinion of the cocktail. Writer Wayne Curtis called it &quot;a drink of inspired blandness&quot;, while Jason Wilson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a lazy person&#x27;s drink&quot;. Troy Patterson of &quot;Slate&quot; called it &quot;the classic mediocre Caribbean-American highball&quot;, which &quot;became a classic despite not being especially good&quot;.

Charles A. Coulombe considers the Cuba libre a historically important drink, writing that it is &quot;a potent symbol of a changing world order – the marriage of rum, lubricant of the old colonial empires, and Coca-Cola, icon of modern American global capitalism&quot;. Additionally, both rum and Coca-Cola are made from Caribbean ingredients and became global commodities through European and American commerce. According to Coulombe, the drink &quot;seems to reflect perfectly the historical elements of the modern world&quot;.

==Recipe and variations==
Recipes vary somewhat in measures and additional ingredients, but the main ingredients are always rum and cola. The International Bartenders Association recipe calls for 5 centiliters of light rum, 12 cl of cola, and 1 cl of fresh lime juice on ice. However, any amount and proportion of rum and cola may be used. Additionally, while light rum is traditional, dark rums and other varieties are also common.

Coca-Cola is the conventional cola in the drink, to the point that customers rarely order anything else. This dates back to the origin of the drink in Cuba and was solidified in the 1920s when Coca-Cola emerged as the primary cola brand following the bankruptcy of Pepsi and Chero-Cola, and therefore the preferred cola mixer in alcoholic drinks. Pepsi&#x27;s later attempts to enter the cocktail market were unsuccessful, especially after the song &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot; solidified the association in the public imagination.

Nonetheless, different colas are sometimes used. In Cuba, as Coca-Cola has not been imported since the U.S. embargo of 1960, the domestic TuKola is used in Cuba libres. Other common variants call for Mexican Coke (which uses cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup), Moxie, Diet Coke (the Cuba Lite or rum and Diet) and Dr. Pepper (the Captain and Pepper, featuring Captain Morgan spiced rum).

Lime is traditionally included in the drink, though it is often left out, especially when the order is for just &quot;rum and Coke&quot;. Some early recipes called for lime juice to be mixed in; others included lime only as a garnish. Other early recipes called for additional ingredients such as gin and bitters. Some sources consider lime essential for a drink to be a true Cuba libre, which they distinguish from a mere rum and Coke. However, lime is frequently included even in orders for &quot;rum and Coke&quot;.

When aged añejo rum is used, the drink is sometimes called a &quot;Cubata&quot;, a name also used informally in Spain for any Cuba libre. Some modern recipes inspired by older ones include additional ingredients such as bitters. More elaborate variants with further ingredients include the cinema highball, which uses rum infused with buttered popcorn and mixed with cola. Another is the Mandeville cocktail, which includes light and dark rum, cola, and citrus juice along with Pernod absinthe and grenadine.

<doc id="7607" wikidata="Q24768908" url="?curid=7607" title="Collagen helix">
<text>In molecular biology, the collagen triple helix or type-2 helix is the main secondary structure of various types of fibrous collagen, including type I collagen. In 1954, Ramachandran &amp; Kartha (13, 14) advanced a structure for the collagen triple helix on the basis of fiber diffraction data. It consists of a triple helix made of the repetitious amino acid sequence glycine-X-Y, where X and Y are frequently proline or hydroxyproline. Collagen folded into a triple helix is known as tropocollagen. Collagen triple helices are often bundled into fibrils which themselves form larger fibres, as in tendons.

==Structure==
Glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline must be in their designated positions with the correct configuration. For example, hydroxyproline in the Y position increases the thermal stability of the triple helix, but not when it is located in the X position. The thermal stabilization is also hindered when the hydroxyl group has the wrong configuration. Due to the high abundance of glycine and proline contents, collagen fails to form a regular α-helix and β-sheet structure. Three left-handed helical strands twist to form a right-handed triple helix. A collagen triple helix has 3.3 residues per turn.

Each of the three chains is stabilized by the steric repulsion due to the pyrrolidine rings of proline and hydroxyproline residues. The pyrrolidine rings keep out of each other&#x27;s way when the polypeptide chain assumes this extended helical form, which is much more open than the tightly coiled form of the alpha helix.
The three chains are hydrogen bonded to each other. The hydrogen bond donors are the peptide NH groups of glycine residues. The hydrogen bond acceptors are the CO groups of residues on the other chains. The OH group of hydroxyproline does not participate in hydrogen bonding but stabilises the trans isomer of proline by stereoelectronic effects, therefore stabilizing the entire triple helix.

The rise of the collagen helix (superhelix) is 2.9 Å (0.29 nm) per residue. The center of the collagen triple helix is very small and hydrophobic, and every third residue of the helix must have contact with the center. Due to the very tiny and tight space at the center, only the small hydrogen of the glycine side chain is capable of interacting with the center. This contact is impossible even when a slightly bigger amino acid residue is present other than glycine.

<doc id="7609" wikidata="Q1191211" url="?curid=7609" title="Cosmic censorship hypothesis">
<text>The weak and the strong cosmic censorship hypotheses are two mathematical conjectures about the structure of gravitational singularities arising in general relativity.

Singularities that arise in the solutions of Einstein&#x27;s equations are typically hidden within event horizons, and therefore cannot be observed from the rest of spacetime. Singularities that are not so hidden are called &quot;naked&quot;. The weak cosmic censorship hypothesis was conceived by Roger Penrose in 1969 and posits that no naked singularities exist in the universe.

==Basics==
Since the physical behavior of singularities is unknown, if singularities can be observed from the rest of spacetime, causality may break down, and physics may lose its predictive power. The issue cannot be avoided, since according to the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems, singularities are inevitable in physically reasonable situations. Still, in the absence of naked singularities, the universe, as described by the general theory of relativity, is deterministic: it is possible to predict the entire evolution of the universe (possibly excluding some finite regions of space hidden inside event horizons of singularities), knowing only its condition at a certain moment of time (more precisely, everywhere on a spacelike three-dimensional hypersurface, called the Cauchy surface). Failure of the cosmic censorship hypothesis leads to the failure of determinism, because it is yet impossible to predict the behavior of spacetime in the causal future of a singularity. Cosmic censorship is not merely a problem of formal interest; some form of it is assumed whenever black hole event horizons are mentioned.
The hypothesis was first formulated by Roger Penrose in 1969, and it is not stated in a completely formal way. In a sense it is more of a research program proposal: part of the research is to find a proper formal statement that is physically reasonable, falsifiable, and sufficiently general to be interesting. Because the statement is not a strictly formal one, there is sufficient latitude for (at least) two independent formulations: a weak form, and a strong form.

== Weak and strong cosmic censorship hypothesis ==

The weak and the strong cosmic censorship hypotheses are two conjectures concerned with the global geometry of spacetimes.

The weak cosmic censorship hypothesis asserts there can be no singularity visible from future null infinity. In other words, singularities need to be hidden from an observer at infinity by the event horizon of a black hole. Mathematically, the conjecture states that, for generic initial data, the causal structure is such that the maximal Cauchy development possesses a complete future null infinity.

The strong cosmic censorship hypothesis asserts that, generically, general relativity is a deterministic theory, in the same sense that classical mechanics is a deterministic theory. In other words, the classical fate of all observers should be predictable from the initial data. Mathematically, the conjecture states that the maximal Cauchy development of generic compact or asymptotically flat initial data is locally inextendible as a regular Lorentzian manifold. Taken in its strongest sense, the conjecture suggests locally inextendibility of the maximal Cauchy development as a continuous Lorentzian manifold [very Strong Cosmic Censorship]. This strongest version was disproven in 2018 by Mihalis Dafermos and Jonathan Luk for the Cauchy horizon of an uncharged, rotating black hole. 

The two conjectures are mathematically independent, as there exist spacetimes for which weak cosmic censorship is valid but strong cosmic censorship is violated and, conversely, there exist spacetimes for which weak cosmic censorship is violated but strong cosmic censorship is valid.

==Example==
The Kerr metric, corresponding to a black hole of mass formula_1 and angular momentum formula_2, can be used to derive the effective potential for particle orbits restricted to the equator (as defined by rotation). This potential looks like:
formula_3
where formula_4 is the coordinate radius, formula_5 and formula_6 are the test-particle&#x27;s conserved energy and angular momentum respectively (constructed from the Killing vectors).

To preserve &quot;cosmic censorship&quot;, the black hole is restricted to the case of formula_7. For there to exist an event horizon around the singularity, the requirement formula_7 must be satisfied. This amounts to the angular momentum of the black hole being constrained to below a critical value, outside of which the horizon would disappear. 

The following thought experiment is reproduced from Hartle&#x27;s &quot;Gravity&quot;:

==Problems with the concept==
There are a number of difficulties in formalizing the hypothesis:

* There are technical difficulties with properly formalizing the notion of a singularity.
* It is not difficult to construct spacetimes which have naked singularities, but which are not &quot;physically reasonable&quot;; the canonical example of such a spacetime is perhaps the &quot;superextremal&quot; formula_9 Reissner–Nordström solution, which contains a singularity at formula_10 that is not surrounded by a horizon. A formal statement needs some set of hypotheses which exclude these situations.
* Caustics may occur in simple models of gravitational collapse, and can appear to lead to singularities. These have more to do with the simplified models of bulk matter used, and in any case have nothing to do with general relativity, and need to be excluded.
* Computer models of gravitational collapse have shown that naked singularities can arise, but these models rely on very special circumstances (such as spherical symmetry). These special circumstances need to be excluded by some hypotheses.

In 1991, John Preskill and Kip Thorne bet against Stephen Hawking that the hypothesis was false. Hawking conceded the bet in 1997, due to the discovery of the special situations just mentioned, which he characterized as &quot;technicalities&quot;. Hawking later reformulated the bet to exclude those technicalities. The revised bet is still open (although Hawking died in 2018), the prize being &quot;clothing to cover the winner&#x27;s nakedness&quot;.

== Counter-example ==

An exact solution to the scalar-Einstein equations formula_11 which forms a counterexample to many formulations of the 
cosmic censorship hypothesis was found by Mark D. Roberts in 1985:
formula_12
where formula_13 is a constant.

<doc id="7610" wikidata="Q29568419" url="?curid=7610" title="Catholic (term)">
<text>The word catholic (derived via Late Latin , from the ancient Greek adjective () ) comes from the Greek phrase () , and is a combination of the Greek words () and () . The first known use of &quot;Catholic&quot; was by the church father Saint Ignatius of Antioch in his &quot;Letter to the Smyrnaeans&quot; (circa 110 AD). In the context of Christian ecclesiology, it has a rich history and several usages. 

The word in English can mean either &quot;of the Catholic faith&quot; or &quot;relating to the historic doctrine and practice of the Western Church&quot;. &quot;Catholicos&quot;, the title used for the head of some churches in Eastern Christian traditions, is derived from the same linguistic origin.

In non-ecclesiastical use, it derives its English meaning directly from its root, and is currently used to mean the following: 
* including a wide variety of things, or all-embracing;
* universal or of general interest;
* having broad interests, or wide sympathies;
* inclusive, inviting.

The term has been incorporated into the name of the largest Christian communion, the Roman Catholic Church. All of the three main branches of Christianity in the East – Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church and Church of the East – had always identified themselves as &quot;Catholic&quot; in accordance with apostolic traditions and the Nicene Creed. Lutherans, Reformed, Anglicans and Methodists also believe that their churches are &quot;Catholic&quot; in the sense that they too are in continuity with the original universal church founded by the Apostles. However, each church defines the scope of the &quot;Catholic Church&quot; differently. For instance, the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox churches, and Church of the East, each maintain that their own denomination is identical with the original universal church, from which all other denominations broke away.

An early definition for what is &quot;catholic&quot; was summarized in what is known as the Vincentian Canon in the 5th century &quot;Commonitory&quot;: &quot;what has been believed everywhere, always, and by all.&quot; Distinguishing beliefs of Catholicity, the beliefs of most Christians who call themselves &quot;Catholic&quot;, include the episcopal polity, that bishops are considered the highest order of ministers within the Christian religion, as well as the Nicene Creed of AD 381. In particular, along with unity, sanctity, and apostolicity, catholicity is considered one of Four Marks of the Church, found in the line of the Nicene Creed: &quot;I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&quot; 

During the medieval and modern times, additional distinctions arose regarding the use of the terms &quot;Western Catholic&quot; and &quot;Eastern Catholic&quot;. Before the East–West Schism of 1054, those terms had just the basic geographical meanings, since only one undivided Catholicity existed, uniting the Latin-speaking Christians of West and the Greek-speaking Christians of the East. After the Schism, terminology became much more complicated, resulting in the creation of parallel and conflicting terminological systems.

==Etymology==

The Greek adjective &quot;katholikos&quot;, the origin of the term &quot;catholic&quot;, means &#x27;universal&#x27;. Directly from the Greek, or via Late Latin &quot;catholicus&quot;, the term &quot;catholic&quot; entered many other languages, becoming the base for the creation of various theological terms such as &quot;catholicism&quot; and &quot;catholicity&quot; (Late Latin &quot;catholicismus&quot;, &quot;catholicitas&quot;).

The term &quot;catholicism&quot; is the English form of Late Latin &quot;catholicismus&quot;, an abstract noun based on the adjective &quot;catholic&quot;. The Modern Greek equivalent &quot;&quot; is back-formed and usually refers to the Catholic Church. The terms &quot;catholic&quot;, &quot;catholicism&quot;, and &quot;catholicity&quot; are closely related to the use of the term &quot;Catholic Church&quot;. (See Catholic Church (disambiguation) for more uses.)

The earliest evidence of the use of that term is the &quot;Letter to the Smyrnaeans&quot; that Ignatius of Antioch wrote in about 107 to Christians in Smyrna. Exhorting Christians to remain closely united with their bishop, he wrote: &quot;Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.&quot;

From the second half of the second century, the word &quot;catholic&quot; began to be used to mean &quot;orthodox&quot; (non-heretical), &quot;because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local&quot;. In 380, Emperor Theodosius I limited use of the term &quot;Catholic Christian&quot; exclusively to those who followed the same faith as Pope Damasus I of Rome and Pope Peter of Alexandria. Numerous other early writers including Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 315–386), Augustine of Hippo (354–430) further developed the use of the term &quot;catholic&quot; in relation to Christianity. The 5th century Vincentian Canon, published in &quot;Commonitory&quot;, defined &quot;catholic&quot; as &quot;what has been believed everywhere, always, and by all.&quot;

== Historical use ==
===Ignatius of Antioch===

The earliest recorded evidence of the use of the term &quot;Catholic Church&quot; is the &quot;Letter to the Smyrnaeans&quot; that Ignatius of Antioch wrote in about 107 AD to Christians in Smyrna. Exhorting Christians to remain closely united with their bishop, he wrote: 

Of the meaning for Ignatius of this phrase J.H. Srawley wrote:
This is the earliest occurrence in Christian literature of the phrase &#x27;the Catholic Church&#x27; (ἡ καθολικὴ ἐκκλησία). The original sense of the word is &#x27;universal&#x27;. Thus Justin Martyr (&quot;Dial&quot;. 82) speaks of the &#x27;universal or general resurrection&#x27;, using the words ἡ καθολικὴ ἀνάστασις. Similarly here the Church universal is contrasted with the particular Church of Smyrna. Ignatius means by the Catholic Church &#x27;the aggregate of all the Christian congregations&#x27; (Swete, &quot;Apostles Creed&quot;, p. 76). So too the letter of the Church of Smyrna is addressed to all the congregations of the Holy Catholic Church in every place. And this primitive sense of &#x27;universal&#x27; the word has never lost, although in the latter part of the second century it began to receive the secondary sense of &#x27;orthodox&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;heretical&#x27;. Thus it is used in an early Canon of Scripture, the Muratorian fragment (&quot;circa&quot; 170 A.D.), which refers to certain heretical writings as &#x27;not received in the Catholic Church&#x27;. So too Cyril of Jerusalem, in the fourth century, says that the Church is called Catholic not only &#x27;because it is spread throughout the world&#x27;, but also &#x27;because it teaches completely and without defect all the doctrines which ought to come to the knowledge of men&#x27;. This secondary sense arose out of the original meaning because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local.

By &quot;Catholic Church&quot; Ignatius designated the universal church. Ignatius considered that certain heretics of his time, who disavowed that Jesus was a material being who actually suffered and died, saying instead that &quot;he only seemed to suffer&quot; (Smyrnaeans, 2), were not really Christians.

===Martyrdom of Polycarp===
The term is also used in the &quot;Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot; (AD 156):

===Muratorian fragment===
The Muratorian fragment (AD 177) mentions:

===Tertullian=== 
The term is employed by Tertullian (AD 200):

===Clement of Alexandria===

Clement of Alexandria (AD 202) cites:

===Cyprian of Carthage===

Cyprian of Carthage (AD 254) wrote a large number of epistles where he makes use of the term:



In addition to epistles 66, 69 and 70, the term is also found in the epistles 19, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 50, 51, 54, 63, 68, 71, 72, 74, 75.

===Cyril of Jerusalem===

As mentioned in the above quotation from J.H. Srawley, Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 315–386), who is venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion, distinguished what he called the &quot;Catholic Church&quot; from other groups who could also refer to themselves as an ἐκκλησία (assembly or church):
Since the word Ecclesia is applied to different things (as also it is written of the multitude in the theatre of the Ephesians, &quot;And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the Assembly&quot; (Acts 19:41), and since one might properly and truly say that there is a &quot;Church of evil doers&quot;, I mean the meetings of the heretics, the Marcionists and Manichees, and the rest, for this cause the Faith has securely delivered to you now the Article, &quot;And in one Holy Catholic Church&quot;; that you may avoid their wretched meetings, and ever abide with the Holy Church Catholic in which you were regenerated. And if ever you are sojourning in cities, inquire not simply where the Lord&#x27;s House is (for the other sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens houses of the Lord), nor merely where the Church is, but where is the Catholic Church. For this is the peculiar name of this Holy Church, the mother of us all, which is the spouse of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God(Catechetical Lectures, XVIII, 26).

===Theodosius I===

Theodosius I, Emperor from 379 to 395, declared &quot;Catholic&quot; Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, declaring in the Edict of Thessalonica of 27 February 380:

It is our desire that all the various nations which are subject to our clemency and moderation, should continue the profession of that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition and which is now professed by the Pontiff Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness. According to the apostolic teaching and the doctrine of the Gospel, let us believe in the one Deity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity. We authorize the followers of this law to assume the title &quot;Catholic&quot; Christians; but as for the others, since in our judgment they are foolish madmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics, and shall not presume to give their conventicles the name of churches. They will suffer in the first place the chastisement of the divine condemnation, and in the second the punishment which our authority, in accordance with the will of heaven, will decide to inflict. Theodosian Code XVI.i.2

===Jerome===
Jerome wrote to Augustine of Hippo in 418: &quot;You are known throughout the world; Catholics honour and esteem you as the one who has established anew the ancient Faith&quot;

===Augustine of Hippo===

Only slightly later, Saint Augustine of Hippo (354–430) also used the term &quot;Catholic&quot; to distinguish the &quot;true&quot; church from heretical groups:
In the Catholic Church, there are many other things which most justly keep me in her bosom. The consent of peoples and nations keeps me in the Church; so does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by hope, enlarged by love, established by age. The succession of priests keeps me, beginning from the very seat of the Apostle Peter, to whom the Lord, after His resurrection, gave it in charge to feed His sheep (Jn 21:15–19), down to the present episcopate.
And so, lastly, does the very name of Catholic, which, not without reason, amid so many heresies, the Church has thus retained; so that, though all heretics wish to be called Catholics, yet when a stranger asks where the Catholic Church meets, no heretic will venture to point to his own chapel or house.
Such then in number and importance are the precious ties belonging to the Christian name which keep a believer in the Catholic Church, as it is right they should ... With you, where there is none of these things to attract or keep me... No one shall move me from the faith which binds my mind with ties so many and so strong to the Christian religion... For my part, I should not believe the gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic Church. —St. Augustine (354–430): &quot;Against the Epistle of Manichaeus called Fundamental&quot;, chapter 4: Proofs of the Catholic Faith.
:— St. Augustine (354–430): &quot;Against the Epistle of Manichaeus called Fundamental&quot;, chapter 4: Proofs of the Catholic Faith.

===St Vincent of Lerins===
A contemporary of Augustine, St. Vincent of Lerins, wrote in 434 (under the pseudonym Peregrinus) a work known as the &quot;Commonitoria&quot; (&quot;Memoranda&quot;). While insisting that, like the human body, church doctrine develops while truly keeping its identity (sections 54–59, chapter XXIII), he stated:

===Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church===
In the early centuries of Christian history, the majority of Christians who followed doctrines represented in Nicene Creed were bound by one common and undivided Catholicity that united the Latin-speaking Christians of the west and the Greek-speaking Christians of the east. In those days, the terms &quot;eastern Catholic&quot; and &quot;western Catholic&quot; had geographical meanings, generally corresponding to existing linguistic distinctions between Greek east and Latin west. In spite of various theological and ecclesiastical disagreements between Christian sees, a common Catholicity was preserved. A great dispute arose between the 9th and 11th century. After the East–West Schism, the notion of common Catholicity was broken and each side started to develop its own terminological practice.

All major theological and ecclesiastical disputes in the Christian East or West have been commonly accompanied by attempts of arguing sides to deny each other the right to use the word &quot;Catholic&quot; as term of self-designation. After the acceptance of Filioque clause into the Nicene Creed by the Rome, Orthodox Christians in the East started to refer to adherents of Filioquism in the West just as &quot;Latins&quot; considering them no longer to be &quot;Catholics&quot;.

The dominant view in the Eastern Orthodox Church, that all Western Christians who accepted Filioque interpolation and unorthodox Pneumatology ceased to be Catholics, was held and promoted by famous Eastern Orthodox canonist Theodore Balsamon who was patriarch of Antioch. He wrote in 1190:

On the other side of the widening rift, Eastern Orthodox were considered by western theologians to be &quot;Schismatics&quot;. Relations between East and West were further estranged by the tragic events of the Massacre of the Latins in 1182 and Sack of Constantinople in 1204. Those bloody events were followed by several failed attempts to reach reconciliation (see: Second Council of Lyon, Council of Florence, Union of Brest, Union of Uzhhorod). During the late medieval and early modern period, terminology became much more complicated, resulting in the creation of parallel and confronting terminological systems that exist today in all of their complexity.

During the Early Modern period, a special term &quot;Acatholic&quot; was widely used in the West to mark all those who were considered to hold heretical theological views and irregular ecclesiastical practices. In the time of Counter-Reformation the term &quot;Acatholic&quot; was used by zealous members of the Catholic Church to designate Protestants as well as Eastern Orthodox Christians. The term was considered to be so insulting that the Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church, held in Temeswar in 1790, decided to send an official plea to emperor Leopold II, begging him to ban the use of the term &quot;Acatholic&quot;.

=== Lutheranism ===
The Augsburg Confession found within the Book of Concord, a compendium of belief of the Lutheranism, teaches that &quot;the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church&quot;. When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1530, they believe to have &quot;showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils&quot;.

<text>Crystal Catherine Eastman (June 25, 1881 – July 28, 1928) was an American lawyer, antimilitarist, feminist, socialist, and journalist. She was a leader in the fight for women&#x27;s suffrage, a co-founder and co-editor with her brother Max Eastman of the radical arts and politics magazine &quot;The Liberator,&quot; co-founder of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, and co-founder in 1920 of the American Civil Liberties Union. In 2000, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.

==Early life and education==

Crystal Eastman was born in Marlborough, Massachusetts, on June 25, 1881, the third of four children. Her oldest brother, Morgan, was born in 1878 and died in 1884. The second brother, Anstice Ford Eastman, who became a general surgeon, was born in 1878 and died in 1937. Max was the youngest, born in 1883.

In 1883, their parents, Samuel Elijah Eastman and Annis Bertha Ford, moved the family to Canandaigua, New York. In 1889, their mother became one of the first women ordained as a Protestant minister in America when she became a minister of the Congregational church. Her father was also a Congregational minister, and the two served as pastors at the church of Thomas K. Beecher near Elmira. Mark Twain&#x27;s family also attended the church and it was this shared association that young Crystal also became acquainted with him.

This part of New York was in the so-called &quot;Burnt Over District.&quot; During the Second Great Awakening earlier in the 19th century, its frontier had been a center of evangelizing and much religious excitement, which resulted in the founding of such beliefs as Millerism and Mormonism. During the antebellum period, some were inspired by religious ideals to support such progressive social causes as abolitionism and the Underground Railroad.

This humanitarian tradition influenced Crystal and her brother Max Eastman. He became a socialist activist early on, and Crystal had several common causes with him. They were close throughout her life, even after he had become more conservative.

The siblings lived together on 11th Street in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village among other radical activists for several years. The group, including Ida Rauh, Inez Milholland, Floyd Dell, and Doris Stevens, also spent summers and weekends in Croton-on-Hudson, where Max bought a house in 1916.

Eastman graduated from Vassar College in 1903 and received a Master of Arts degree in sociology (then a relatively new field) from Columbia University in 1904. She then attended New York University Law School, graduating in 1907 as the second in her class. While pursuing her graduate degree, Eastman worked nights as a recreation leader at the Greenwich House Settlement, where she encountered Paul Underwood Kellogg.

==Social efforts==
Social work pioneer and journal editor Paul Kellogg offered Eastman her first job: investigating labor conditions for &quot;The Pittsburgh Survey&quot;. Her report, &quot;Work Accidents and the Law&quot; (1910), became a crucial tool in the fight for occupation health and safety and an early weapon in the ongoing battle. In 1909, Justice Hughes, who at the time was governor of New York, appointed Eastman to the New York State Commission of Employee&#x27;s Liability and Causes of Industrial Accidents, Unemployment and Lack of Farm Labor. The first woman to be appointed a commission member, she drafted the inaugural workers&#x27; compensation law. This model became the standard for the U.S. During Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s presidency, she continued to campaign for occupational safety and health while working as an investigating attorney for the U.S. Commission on Industrial Relations from 1913 to 1914. She advocated for &quot;motherhood endowments&quot; whereby mothers of young children would receive monetary benefits. She argued it would reduce forced dependence of mothers on men, as well as economically empower women.

==Emancipation==
Wallace J. Benedict was an insurance agent in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and so when Eastman married him in 1911, she moved there after the wedding. There she managed the unsuccessful 1912 Wisconsin suffrage campaign.

Divorcing in 1913, she returned east where she joined Alice Paul, Lucy Burns, and others in founding the militant Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, which became the National Woman&#x27;s Party. After the passage of the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote in 1920, Eastman and Paul wrote the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), first introduced in 1923. One of the few socialists to endorse the ERA, Eastman warned that protective legislation for women would mean only discrimination against women. Eastman claimed that one could assess the importance of the ERA by the intensity of the opposition to it. However, she felt that it was still a struggle worth fighting. She also delivered the speech &quot;Now We Can Begin&quot; after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment;it outlined the work that needed to be done in the political and economic spheres to achieve gender equality.

==Peace efforts==

During World War I, Eastman was one of the founders of the Woman&#x27;s Peace Party, soon joined by Jane Addams, Lillian D. Wald, and others. She served as president of the New York City branch. Renamed the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom in 1921, it remains the oldest extant women&#x27;s peace organization. Eastman also became executive director of the American Union Against Militarism, which lobbied against America&#x27;s entrance into the European war and more successfully against war with Mexico in 1916. This group sought to remove profiteering from arms manufacturing and campaigned against conscription, imperial adventures, and military intervention.

When the United States entered World War I, Eastman, together with Roger Baldwin and Norman Thomasorganized the National Civil Liberties Bureau (NCLB) to protect conscientious objectors or, in her words: &quot;To maintain something over here that will be worth coming back to when the weary war is over.&quot; The NCLB grew into the American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU), with Baldwin at the head and Eastman functioning as attorney-in-charge. Eastman is credited as a founding member of the ACLU, but her role as founder of the NCLB may have been largely ignored by posterity because of her personal differences with Baldwin.

==Marriage and family==
In 1916, Eastman married the British editor and antiwar activist Walter Fuller, who had come to the United States to direct his sisters&#x27; singing of folksongs. They had two children, Jeffrey Fuller born in 1917 and Annis Fuller born in 1921. Choosing to keep her last name, Eastman explored family practices aimed at fostering gender equality within the realms of marriage and family life. The publication of her 1923 confessional article titled &quot;Marriage Under Two Roofs&quot; caused an uproar as Eastman revealed the specifics of their unconventional living arrangement. She argues that residing in two separate residences is better than in one because by ultimately leading to an authentic expression of sexual desire and marital love, which in turn contributes to the overall happiness of the family unit. Eastman and Walter worked together as activists until the end of the war, when he worked as the managing editor of &quot;The Freeman&quot; until 1922, when he returned to London, England. For eight years, Eastman traveled by ship between London and New York to be with her husband. Walter died in 1927 from a stroke, which ended his career of editing &quot;Radio Times&quot; for the BBC.

After Max Eastman&#x27;s periodical &quot;The Masses&quot; was forced to close by government censorship in 1917, he and Crystal co-founded a radical journal of politics, art, and literature: the &quot;Liberator&quot;, in early 1918. She and Max co-edited it until they put it in the hands of faithful friends in 1922.

===Post-War===
After the war, Eastman organized the First Feminist Congress in 1919. In New York, her activities led to her being blacklisted during the Red Scare of 1919–1920. During the 1920s, Eastman was a columnist for Alice Paul&#x27;s feminist journal, &quot;Equal Rights,&quot; and the British feminist weekly publication &quot;Time and Tide&quot;. Eastman claimed that &quot;life was a big battle for the complete feminist,&quot; but she was convinced that the complete feminist would someday achieve total victory.

===Death===
Crystal Eastman died at age 47, on July 8, 1928, of nephritis, a year after her husband had passed. Friends were entrusted with their two orphaned children, then seven and eleven years old, to rear them until adulthood.

==Legacy==
Eastman has been called one of the most neglected leaders in the United States because although she wrote pioneering legislation and created long-lasting political organizations, she disappeared from history for 50 years. Freda Kirchwey, the editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;, wrote at the time of her death, &quot;When she spoke to people—whether it was to a small committee or a swarming crowd—hearts beat faster. She was for thousands a symbol of what the free woman might be.&quot;

Her speech &quot;Now We Can Begin,&quot; given in 1920, is listed as #83 in American Rhetoric&#x27;s Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).

In 2000, Eastman was inducted into the (American) National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.

In 2018, &quot;The Socialist&quot;, the official publication of the Socialist Party USA, published the article &quot;Remembering Socialist Feminist Crystal Eastman&quot; by Lisa Petriello, which was written &quot;on the 90th-year anniversary of her [Eastman&#x27;s] death to bring her life and legacy once again to the public eye.&quot;
