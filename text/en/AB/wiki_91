<doc id="9764" wikidata="Q79969" url="?curid=9764" title="Emma Goldman">
<text>Emma Goldman (June 27, 1869 – May 14, 1940) was a Lithuanian-born anarchist revolutionary, political activist, and writer. She played a pivotal role in the development of anarchist political philosophy in North America and Europe in the first half of the 20th century.

Born in Kaunas, Lithuania (then within the Russian Empire), to an Orthodox Lithuanian Jewish family, Goldman immigrated to the United States in 1885. Attracted to anarchism after the Chicago Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women&#x27;s rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892, and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for &quot;inciting to riot&quot; and illegally distributing information about birth control. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal &quot;Mother Earth&quot;.

In 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to &quot;induce persons not to register&quot; for the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with 248 others—in the so-called Palmer Raids during the First Red Scare and deported to Russia in December 1919. Initially supportive of that country&#x27;s October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion; she denounced the Soviet Union for its violent repression of independent voices. She left the Soviet Union and in 1923 published a book about her experiences, &quot;My Disillusionment in Russia&quot;. While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called &quot;Living My Life&quot;. It was published in two volumes, in 1931 and 1935. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Goldman traveled to Spain to support the anarchist revolution there. She died in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1940, aged 70.

During her life, Goldman was lionized as a freethinking &quot;rebel woman&quot; by admirers, and denounced by detractors as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from first-wave feminism and its efforts toward women&#x27;s suffrage, she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman gained iconic status in the 1970s by a revival of interest in her life, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest.

== Biography ==

=== Family ===
Emma Goldman was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Kaunas in Lithuania, then within the Russian Empire. Goldman&#x27;s mother Taube Bienowitch had been married before to a man with whom she had two daughters—Helena in 1860 and Lena in 1862. When her first husband died of tuberculosis, Taube was devastated. Goldman later wrote: &quot;Whatever love she had had died with the young man to whom she had been married at the age of fifteen.&quot;

Taube&#x27;s second marriage was arranged by her family and, as Goldman puts it, &quot;mismated from the first&quot;. Her second husband, Abraham Goldman, invested Taube&#x27;s inheritance in a business that quickly failed. The ensuing hardship, combined with the emotional distance between husband and wife, made the household a tense place for the children. When Taube became pregnant, Abraham hoped desperately for a son; a daughter, he believed, would be one more sign of failure. They eventually had three sons, but their first child was Emma.

Emma Goldman was born on June 27, 1869. Her father used violence to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him. He used a whip on Emma, the most rebellious of them. Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham to tone down his beatings. Goldman later speculated that her father&#x27;s furious temper was at least partly a result of sexual frustration.

Goldman&#x27;s relationships with her elder half-sisters, Helena and Lena, were a study in contrasts. Helena, the oldest, provided the comfort the children lacked from their mother and filled Goldman&#x27;s childhood with &quot;whatever joy it had&quot;. Lena, however, was distant and uncharitable. The three sisters were joined by brothers Louis (who died at the age of six), Herman (born in 1872), and Moishe (born in 1879).

=== Adolescence ===

When Emma Goldman was a young girl, the Goldman family moved to the village of Papilė, where her father ran an inn. While her sisters worked, she became friends with a servant named Petrushka, who excited her &quot;first erotic sensations&quot;. Later in Papilė she witnessed a peasant being whipped with a knout in the street. This event traumatized her and contributed to her lifelong distaste for violent authority.

At the age of seven, Goldman moved with her family to the Prussian city of Königsberg (then part of the German Empire), and she was enrolled in a &quot;Realschule&quot;. One teacher punished disobedient students—targeting Goldman in particular—by beating their hands with a ruler. Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back. She found a sympathetic mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a gymnasium, but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and she was unable to attend.

The family moved to the Russian capital of Saint Petersburg, where her father opened one unsuccessful store after another. Their poverty forced the children to work, and Goldman took an assortment of jobs, including one in a corset shop. As a teenager Goldman begged her father to allow her to return to school, but instead he threw her French book into the fire and shouted: &quot;Girls do not have to learn much! All a Jewish daughter needs to know is how to prepare gefilte fish, cut noodles fine, and give the man plenty of children.&quot;

Goldman pursued an independent education on her own. She studied the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Nikolai Chernyshevsky&#x27;s novel, &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot; (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained a source of inspiration throughout her life.

Her father, meanwhile, continued to insist on a domestic future for her, and he tried to arrange for her to be married at the age of fifteen. They fought about the issue constantly; he complained that she was becoming a &quot;loose&quot; woman, and she insisted that she would marry for love alone. At the corset shop, she was forced to fend off unwelcome advances from Russian officers and other men. One man took her into a hotel room and committed what Goldman described as &quot;violent contact&quot;; two biographers call it rape. She was stunned by the experience, overcome by &quot;shock at the discovery that the contact between man and woman could be so brutal and painful.&quot; Goldman felt that the encounter forever soured her interactions with men.

=== Rochester, New York ===

In 1885, her sister Helena made plans to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it. Despite Helena&#x27;s offer to pay for the trip, Abraham turned a deaf ear to their pleas. Desperate, Goldman threatened to throw herself into the Neva River if she could not go. Their father finally agreed. On December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City&#x27;s Castle Garden, the entry for immigrants.

They settled upstate, living in the Rochester home which Lena had made with her husband Samuel. Fleeing the rising antisemitism of Saint Petersburg, their parents and brothers joined them a year later. Goldman began working as a seamstress, sewing overcoats for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half dollars a week. She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby.

At her new job, Goldman met a fellow worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared her love for books, dancing, and traveling, as well as her frustration with the monotony of factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman&#x27;s family, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious and threatened to commit suicide should she leave him. Meanwhile, Goldman was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her, particularly the aftermath of executions related to the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the anti-authoritarian political philosophy of anarchism.

Less than a year after the wedding, the couple were divorced; Kershner begged Goldman to return and threatened to poison himself if she did not. They reunited, but after three months she left once again. Her parents considered her behavior &quot;loose&quot; and refused to allow Goldman into their home. Carrying her sewing machine in one hand and a bag with five dollars in the other, she left Rochester and headed southeast to New York City.

=== Most and Berkman ===
On her first day in New York City, Goldman met two men who would have a significant and enduring influence on the course of her life. At Sachs&#x27; Café, a gathering place for radicals, she was introduced to Alexander Berkman, an anarchist who invited her to a public speech that evening. They went to hear Johann Most, editor of a radical publication called &quot;Freiheit&quot; and an advocate of &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot;—the use of violence to instigate change. She was impressed by his fiery oration, and Most took her under his wing, training her in methods of public speaking. He encouraged her vigorously, telling her that she was &quot;to take my place when I am gone.&quot; One of her first public talks in support of &quot;the Cause&quot; was in Rochester. After convincing Helena not to tell their parents of her speech, Goldman found her mind a blank once on stage. She later wrote, suddenly:

Excited by the experience, Goldman refined her public persona during subsequent engagements. She quickly found herself arguing with Most over her independence. After a momentous speech in Cleveland, she felt as though she had become &quot;a parrot repeating Most&#x27;s views&quot; and resolved to express herself on the stage. When she returned to New York, Most became furious and told her: &quot;Who is not with me is against me!&quot; She left &quot;Freiheit&quot; and joined another publication, &quot;Die Autonomie&quot;.

Meanwhile, Goldman had begun a friendship with Berkman, whom she affectionately called Sasha. Before long they became lovers and moved into a communal apartment with his cousin Modest &quot;Fedya&quot; Stein and Goldman&#x27;s friend, Helen Minkin, on 42nd Street. Although their relationship had numerous difficulties, Goldman and Berkman would share a close bond for decades, united by their anarchist principles and commitment to personal equality.

In 1892, Goldman joined with Berkman and Stein in opening an ice cream shop in Worcester, Massachusetts. After a few months of operating the shop, Goldman and Berkman were diverted to participate in the Homestead Strike near Pittsburgh.

=== Homestead plot ===

Berkman and Goldman came together through the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania, owned by Andrew Carnegie became the focus of national attention when talks between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) broke down. The factory&#x27;s manager was Henry Clay Frick, a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out the workers, who immediately went on strike. Strikebreakers were brought in and the company hired Pinkerton guards to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.

When a majority of the nation&#x27;s newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail. He would be in charge of &quot;the deed&quot;; she of the associated propaganda. Berkman set off for Pittsburgh on his way to Homestead, where he planned to shoot Frick.

Goldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1866), she mused: &quot;She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters...Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?&quot; Once on the street, Goldman caught the eye of a man who took her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have &quot;the knack,&quot; and told her to quit the business. She was &quot;too astounded for speech&quot;. She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars.

On July 23, Berkman gained access to Frick&#x27;s office while carrying a concealed handgun; he shot Frick three times, and stabbed him in the leg. A group of workers—far from joining in his &quot;attentat&quot;—beat Berkman unconscious, and he was carried away by the police. Berkman was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman suffered during his long absence.

Convinced Goldman was involved in the plot, police raided her apartment. Although they found no evidence, they pressured her landlord into evicting her. Furthermore, the &quot;attentat&quot; had failed to rouse the masses: workers and anarchists alike condemned Berkman&#x27;s action. Johann Most, their former mentor, lashed out at Berkman and the assassination attempt. Furious at these attacks, Goldman brought a toy horsewhip to a public lecture and demanded, onstage, that Most explain his betrayal. He dismissed her, whereupon she struck him with the whip, broke it on her knee, and hurled the pieces at him. She later regretted her assault, confiding to a friend: &quot;At the age of twenty-three, one does not reason.&quot;

=== &quot;Inciting to riot&quot; ===
When the Panic of 1893 struck in the following year, the United States suffered one of its worst economic crises. By year&#x27;s end, the unemployment rate was higher than 20%, and &quot;hunger demonstrations&quot; sometimes gave way to riots. Goldman began speaking to crowds of frustrated men and women in New York City. On August 21, she spoke to a crowd of nearly 3,000 people in Union Square, where she encouraged unemployed workers to take immediate action. Her exact words are unclear: undercover agents insist she ordered the crowd to &quot;take everything ... by force&quot;. But Goldman later recounted this message: &quot;Well then, demonstrate before the palaces of the rich; demand work. If they do not give you work, demand bread. If they deny you both, take bread.&quot; Later in court, Detective-Sergeant Charles Jacobs offered yet another version of her speech.

A week later, Goldman was arrested in Philadelphia and returned to New York City for trial, charged with &quot;inciting to riot&quot;. During the train ride, Jacobs offered to drop the charges against her if she would inform on other radicals in the area. She responded by throwing a glass of ice water in his face. As she awaited trial, Goldman was visited by Nellie Bly, a reporter for the &quot;New York World.&quot; She spent two hours talking to Goldman and wrote a positive article about the woman she described as a &quot;modern Joan of Arc.&quot;

Despite this positive publicity, the jury was persuaded by Jacobs&#x27; testimony and frightened by Goldman&#x27;s politics. The assistant district attorney questioned Goldman about her anarchism, as well as her atheism; the judge spoke of her as &quot;a dangerous woman&quot;. She was sentenced to one year in the Blackwell&#x27;s Island Penitentiary. Once inside, she suffered an attack of rheumatism and was sent to the infirmary. There, she befriended a visiting doctor and received informal training in nursing, eventually being placed in charge of a 16-bed women&#x27;s ward in the infirmary. She also read dozens of books, including works by the American activist-writers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau; novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne; poet Walt Whitman, and philosopher John Stuart Mill. When Goldman was released after ten months, a raucous crowd of nearly 3,000 people greeted her at the Thalia Theater in New York City. She soon became swamped with requests for interviews and lectures.

To make money, Goldman decided to continue the medical studies she had started in prison, but her preferred fields of specialization—midwifery and massage—were unavailable to nursing students in the US. She sailed to Europe, lecturing in London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. She met with renowned anarchists such as Errico Malatesta, Louise Michel, and Peter Kropotkin. In Vienna, she received two diplomas for midwifery and put them immediately to use back in the US.

Alternating between lectures and midwifery, Goldman conducted the first cross-country tour by an anarchist speaker. In November 1899, she returned to Europe to speak, where she met the Czech anarchist Hippolyte Havel in London. They went together to France and helped organize the 1900 International Anarchist Congress on the outskirts of Paris. Afterward, Havel immigrated to the United States, traveling with Goldman to Chicago. They shared a residence there with friends of Goldman.

=== McKinley assassination ===
On September 6, 1901, Leon Czolgosz, an unemployed factory worker and anarchist, shot US President William McKinley twice during a public speaking event in Buffalo, New York. McKinley was hit in the breastbone and stomach, and died eight days later. Czolgosz was arrested, and interrogated around the clock. During interrogation he claimed to be an anarchist and said he had been inspired to act after attending a speech by Goldman. The authorities used this as a pretext to charge Goldman with planning McKinley&#x27;s assassination. They tracked her to the residence in Chicago she shared with Havel, as well as with Mary and Abe Isaak, an anarchist couple and their family. Goldman was arrested, along with Isaak, Havel, and ten other anarchists.

Earlier, Czolgosz had tried but failed to become friends with Goldman and her companions. During a talk in Cleveland, Czolgosz had approached Goldman and asked her advice on which books he should read. In July 1901, he had appeared at the Isaak house, asking a series of unusual questions. They assumed he was an infiltrator, like a number of police agents sent to spy on radical groups. They had remained distant from him, and Abe Isaak sent a notice to associates warning of &quot;another spy&quot;.

Although Czolgosz repeatedly denied Goldman&#x27;s involvement, the police held her in close custody, subjecting her to what she called the &quot;third degree&quot; (). She explained her housemates&#x27; distrust of Czolgosz, and the police finally recognized that she had not had any significant contact with the attacker. No evidence was found linking Goldman to the attack, and she was released after two weeks of detention. Before McKinley died, Goldman offered to provide nursing care, referring to him as &quot;merely a human being&quot;. Czolgosz, despite considerable evidence of mental illness, was convicted of murder and executed.

Throughout her detention and after her release, Goldman steadfastly refused to condemn Czolgosz&#x27;s actions, standing virtually alone in doing so. Friends and supporters—including Berkman—urged her to quit his cause. But Goldman defended Czolgosz as a &quot;supersensitive being&quot; and chastised other anarchists for abandoning him. She was vilified in the press as the &quot;high priestess of anarchy&quot;, while many newspapers declared the anarchist movement responsible for the murder. In the wake of these events, socialism gained support over anarchism among US radicals. McKinley&#x27;s successor, Theodore Roosevelt, declared his intent to crack down &quot;not only against anarchists, but against all active and passive sympathizers with anarchists&quot;.

=== &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and Berkman&#x27;s release ===
After Czolgosz was executed, Goldman withdrew from society and, from 1903 to 1913, lived at 208–210 East 13th Street, New York City. Scorned by her fellow anarchists, vilified by the press, and separated from her love, Berkman, she retreated into anonymity and nursing. &quot;It was bitter and hard to face life anew,&quot; she wrote later.

Using the name E. G. Smith, she left public life and took on a series of private nursing jobs while suffering from severe depression. The US Congress&#x27; passage of the Anarchist Exclusion Act (1903) stirred a new wave of oppositional activism, pulling Goldman back into the movement. A coalition of people and organizations across the left end of the political spectrum opposed the law on grounds that it violated freedom of speech, and she had the nation&#x27;s ear once again.

After an English anarchist named John Turner was arrested under the Anarchist Exclusion Act and threatened with deportation, Goldman joined forces with the Free Speech League to champion his cause. The league enlisted the aid of noted attorneys Clarence Darrow and Edgar Lee Masters, who took Turner&#x27;s case to the US Supreme Court. Although Turner and the League lost, Goldman considered it a victory of propaganda. She had returned to anarchist activism, but it was taking its toll on her. &quot;I never felt so weighed down,&quot; she wrote to Berkman. &quot;I fear I am forever doomed to remain public property and to have my life worn out through the care for the lives of others.&quot;

In 1906, Goldman decided to start a publication, &quot;a place of expression for the young idealists in arts and letters&quot;. &quot;Mother Earth&quot; was staffed by a cadre of radical activists, including Hippolyte Havel, Max Baginski, and Leonard Abbott. In addition to publishing original works by its editors and anarchists around the world, &quot;Mother Earth&quot; reprinted selections from a variety of writers. These included the French philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and British writer Mary Wollstonecraft. Goldman wrote frequently about anarchism, politics, labor issues, atheism, sexuality, and feminism, and was the first editor of the magazine.

On May 18 of the same year, Alexander Berkman was released from prison. Carrying a bouquet of roses, Goldman met him on the train platform and found herself &quot;seized by terror and pity&quot; as she beheld his gaunt, pale form. Neither was able to speak; they returned to her home in silence. For weeks, he struggled to readjust to life on the outside: An abortive speaking tour ended in failure, and in Cleveland he purchased a revolver with the intent of killing himself. Upon returning to New York, he learned that Goldman had been arrested with a group of activists meeting to reflect on Czolgosz. Invigorated anew by this violation of freedom of assembly, he declared, &quot;My resurrection has come!&quot; and set about securing their release.

Berkman took the helm of &quot;Mother Earth&quot; in 1907, while Goldman toured the country to raise funds to keep it operating. Editing the magazine was a revitalizing experience for Berkman. But his relationship with Goldman faltered, and he had an affair with a 15-year-old anarchist named Becky Edelsohn. Goldman was pained by his rejection of her but considered it a consequence of his prison experience. Later that year she served as a delegate from the US to the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam. Anarchists and syndicalists from around the world gathered to sort out the tension between the two ideologies, but no decisive agreement was reached. Goldman returned to the US and continued speaking to large audiences.

=== Reitman, essays, and birth control ===
For the next ten years, Goldman traveled around the country nonstop, delivering lectures and agitating for anarchism. The coalitions formed in opposition to the Anarchist Exclusion Act had given her an appreciation for reaching out to those of other political positions. When the US Justice Department sent spies to observe, they reported the meetings as &quot;packed&quot;. Writers, journalists, artists, judges, and workers from across the spectrum spoke of her &quot;magnetic power&quot;, her &quot;convincing presence&quot;, her &quot;force, eloquence, and fire&quot;.
In the spring of 1908, Goldman met and fell in love with Ben Reitman, the so-called &quot;Hobo doctor&quot;. Having grown up in Chicago&#x27;s Tenderloin District, Reitman spent several years as a drifter before earning a medical degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago. As a doctor, he treated people suffering from poverty and illness, particularly venereal diseases. He and Goldman began an affair. They shared a commitment to free love and Reitman took a variety of lovers, but Goldman did not. She tried to reconcile her feelings of jealousy with a belief in freedom of the heart but found it difficult.

Two years later, Goldman began feeling frustrated with lecture audiences. She yearned to &quot;reach the few who really want to learn, rather than the many who come to be amused&quot;. She collected a series of speeches and items she had written for &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and published a book titled &quot;Anarchism and Other Essays.&quot; Covering a wide variety of topics, Goldman tried to represent &quot;the mental and soul struggles of twenty-one years&quot;.

When Margaret Sanger, an advocate of access to contraception, coined the term &quot;birth control&quot; and disseminated information about various methods in the June 1914 issue of her magazine &quot;The Woman Rebel,&quot; she received aggressive support from Goldman. The latter had already been active in efforts to increase birth control access for several years. In 1916, Goldman was arrested for giving lessons in public on how to use contraceptives. Sanger, too, was arrested under the Comstock Law, which prohibited the dissemination of &quot;obscene, lewd, or lascivious articles&quot;, which authorities defined as including information relating to birth control.

Although they later split from Sanger over charges of insufficient support, Goldman and Reitman distributed copies of Sanger&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Family Limitation&quot; (along with a similar essay of Reitman&#x27;s). In 1915 Goldman conducted a nationwide speaking tour, in part to raise awareness about contraception options. Although the nation&#x27;s attitude toward the topic seemed to be liberalizing, Goldman was arrested on February 11, 1916, as she was about to give another public lecture. Goldman was charged with violating the Comstock Law. Refusing to pay a $100 fine, she spent two weeks in a prison workhouse, which she saw as an &quot;opportunity&quot; to reconnect with those rejected by society.

=== World War I ===
Although President Woodrow Wilson was re-elected in 1916 under the slogan &quot;He kept us out of the war&quot;, at the start of his second term, he announced that Germany&#x27;s continued deployment of unrestricted submarine warfare was sufficient cause for the US to enter the Great War. Shortly afterward, Congress passed the Selective Service Act of 1917, which required all males aged 21–30 to register for military conscription. Goldman saw the decision as an exercise in militarist aggression, driven by capitalism. She declared in &quot;Mother Earth&quot; her intent to resist conscription, and to oppose US involvement in the war.

To this end, she and Berkman organized the No Conscription League of New York, which proclaimed: &quot;We oppose conscription because we are internationalists, antimilitarists, and opposed to all wars waged by capitalistic governments.&quot; The group became a vanguard for anti-draft activism, and chapters began to appear in other cities. When police began raiding the group&#x27;s public events to find young men who had not registered for the draft, Goldman and others focused their efforts on distributing pamphlets and other writings. In the midst of the nation&#x27;s patriotic fervor, many elements of the political left refused to support the League&#x27;s efforts. The Women&#x27;s Peace Party, for example, ceased its opposition to the war once the US entered it. The Socialist Party of America took an official stance against US involvement but supported Wilson in most of his activities.

On June 15, 1917, Goldman and Berkman were arrested during a raid of their offices, in which authorities seized &quot;a wagon load of anarchist records and propaganda&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Goldman asked to change into a more appropriate outfit, and emerged in a gown of &quot;royal purple&quot;. The pair were charged with conspiracy to &quot;induce persons not to register&quot; under the newly enacted Espionage Act, and were held on US$25,000 bail each. Defending herself and Berkman during their trial, Goldman invoked the First Amendment, asking how the government could claim to fight for democracy abroad while suppressing free speech at home:

We say that if America has entered the war to make the world safe for democracy, she must first make democracy safe in America. How else is the world to take America seriously, when democracy at home is daily being outraged, free speech suppressed, peaceable assemblies broken up by overbearing and brutal gangsters in uniform; when free press is curtailed and every independent opinion gagged? Verily, poor as we are in democracy, how can we give of it to the world? 

The jury found Goldman and Berkman guilty. Judge Julius Marshuetz Mayer imposed the maximum sentence: two years&#x27; imprisonment, a $10,000 fine each, and the possibility of deportation after their release from prison. As she was transported to Missouri State Penitentiary, Goldman wrote to a friend: &quot;Two years imprisonment for having made an uncompromising stand for one&#x27;s ideal. Why that is a small price.&quot;

In prison, she was assigned to work as a seamstress, under the eye of a &quot;miserable gutter-snipe of a 21-year-old boy paid to get results&quot;. She met the socialist Kate Richards O&#x27;Hare, who had also been imprisoned under the Espionage Act. Although they differed on political strategy—O&#x27;Hare believed in voting to achieve state power—the two women came together to agitate for better conditions among prisoners. Goldman also met and became friends with Gabriella Segata Antolini, an anarchist and follower of Luigi Galleani. Antolini had been arrested transporting a satchel filled with dynamite on a Chicago-bound train. She had refused to cooperate with authorities and was sent to prison for 14 months. Working together to make life better for the other inmates, the three women became known as &quot;The Trinity&quot;. Goldman was released on September 27, 1919.

=== Deportation ===

Goldman and Berkman were released from prison during the United States&#x27; Red Scare of 1919–20, when public anxiety about wartime pro-German activities had expanded into a pervasive fear of Bolshevism and the prospect of an imminent radical revolution. It was a time of social unrest due to union organizing strikes and actions by activist immigrants. Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer and J. Edgar Hoover, head of the US Department of Justice&#x27;s General Intelligence Division (now the FBI), were intent on using the Anarchist Exclusion Act and its 1918 expansion to deport any non-citizens they could identify as advocates of anarchy or revolution. &quot;Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman,&quot; Hoover wrote while they were in prison, &quot;are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country and return to the community will result in undue harm.&quot;

At her deportation hearing on October 27, 1919, Goldman refused to answer questions about her beliefs, on the grounds that her American citizenship invalidated any attempt to deport her under the Anarchist Exclusion Act, which could be enforced only against non-citizens of the US. She presented a written statement instead: &quot;Today so-called aliens are deported. Tomorrow native Americans will be banished. Already some patrioteers are suggesting that native American sons to whom democracy is a sacred ideal should be exiled.&quot; Louis Post at the Department of Labor, which had ultimate authority over deportation decisions, determined that the revocation of her husband Kershner&#x27;s American citizenship in 1908 after his conviction had revoked hers as well. After initially promising a court fight, Goldman decided not to appeal his ruling.

The Labor Department included Goldman and Berkman among 249 aliens it deported &quot;en masse,&quot; mostly people with only vague associations with radical groups, who had been swept up in government raids in November. &quot;Buford&quot;, a ship the press nicknamed the &quot;Soviet Ark&quot;, sailed from the Army&#x27;s New York Port of Embarkation on December 21. Some 58 enlisted men and four officers provided security on the journey, and pistols were distributed to the crew. Most of the press approved enthusiastically. The Cleveland &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; wrote: &quot;It is hoped and expected that other vessels, larger, more commodious, carrying similar cargoes, will follow in her wake.&quot; The ship landed her charges in Hanko, Finland, on Saturday, January 17, 1920. Upon arrival in Finland, authorities there conducted the deportees to the Russian frontier under a flag of truce.

=== Russia ===

Goldman initially viewed the Bolshevik revolution in a positive light. She wrote in &quot;Mother Earth&quot; that despite its dependence on Communist government, it represented &quot;the most fundamental, far-reaching and all-embracing principles of human freedom and of economic well-being&quot;. By the time she neared Europe, she expressed fears about what was to come. She was worried about the ongoing Russian Civil War and the possibility of being seized by anti-Bolshevik forces. The state, anti-capitalist though it was, also posed a threat. &quot;I could never in my life work within the confines of the State,&quot; she wrote to her niece, &quot;Bolshevist or otherwise.&quot;

She quickly discovered that her fears were justified. Days after returning to Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), she was shocked to hear a party official refer to free speech as a &quot;bourgeois superstition&quot;. As she and Berkman traveled around the country, they found repression, mismanagement, and corruption instead of the equality and worker empowerment they had dreamed of. Those who questioned the government were demonized as counter-revolutionaries, and workers labored under severe conditions. They met with Vladimir Lenin, who assured them that government suppression of press liberties was justified. He told them: &quot;There can be no free speech in a revolutionary period.&quot; Berkman was more willing to forgive the government&#x27;s actions in the name of &quot;historical necessity&quot;, but he eventually joined Goldman in opposing the Soviet state&#x27;s authority.

In March 1921, strikes erupted in Petrograd when workers took to the streets demanding better food rations and more union autonomy. Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: &quot;To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal.&quot; The unrest spread to the port town of Kronstadt, where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the Kronstadt rebellion, approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them. &quot;More and more&quot;, she wrote, &quot;we have come to the conclusion that we can do nothing here. And as we can not keep up a life of inactivity much longer we have decided to leave.&quot;

In December 1921, they left the country and went to the Latvian capital city of Riga. The US commissioner in that city wired officials in Washington DC, who began requesting information from other governments about the couple&#x27;s activities. After a short trip to Stockholm, they moved to Berlin for several years; during this time Goldman agreed to write a series of articles about her time in Russia for Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;New York World.&quot; These were later collected and published in book form as &quot;My Disillusionment in Russia&quot; (1923) and &quot;My Further Disillusionment in Russia&quot; (1924). The publishers added these titles to attract attention; Goldman protested, albeit in vain.

=== England, Canada, and France ===
Goldman found it difficult to acclimate to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her outspokenness about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist Rebecca West arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher Bertrand Russell, novelist H. G. Wells, and more than 200 other guests. When she spoke of her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government, the audience was shocked. Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment. Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.

In 1925, the spectre of deportation loomed again, but James Colton, a Scottish anarchist Goldman had first met in Glasgow whilst on a speaking tour in 1895, had offered to marry her and provide British citizenship. Although they were only distant acquaintances, she accepted and they were married on June 27, 1925, Goldman&#x27;s 58th birthday. Her new status gave her peace of mind and allowed her to travel to France and Canada. The pair sporadically exchanged correspondence until Colton&#x27;s death in 1936. Life in London was stressful for Goldman; she wrote to Berkman: &quot;I am awfully tired and so lonely and heartsick. It is a dreadful feeling to come back here from lectures and find not a kindred soul, no one who cares whether one is dead or alive.&quot; She worked on analytical studies of drama, expanding on the work she had published in 1914. But the audiences were &quot;awful,&quot; and she never finished her second book on the subject.

Goldman traveled to Canada in 1927, just in time to receive news of the impending executions of Italian anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti in Boston. Angered by the many irregularities of the case, she saw it as another travesty of justice in the US. She longed to join the mass demonstrations in Boston; memories of the Haymarket affair overwhelmed her, compounded by her isolation. &quot;Then,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I had my life before me to take up the cause for those killed. Now I have nothing.&quot;

In 1928, she began writing her autobiography, with the support of a group of American admirers, including journalist H. L. Mencken, poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, novelist Theodore Dreiser and art collector Peggy Guggenheim, who raised $4,000 for her. She secured a cottage in the French coastal city of Saint-Tropez and spent two years recounting her life. Berkman offered sharply critical feedback, which she eventually incorporated at the price of a strain on their relationship. Goldman intended the book, &quot;Living My Life,&quot; as a single volume for a price the working class could afford (she urged no more than $5.00); her publisher Alfred A. Knopf released it as two volumes sold together for $7.50. Goldman was furious, but unable to force a change. Due in large part to the Great Depression, sales were sluggish despite keen interest from libraries around the US. Critical reviews were generally enthusiastic; &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot; all listed it as one of the year&#x27;s top non-fiction books.

In 1933, Goldman received permission to lecture in the United States under the condition that she speak only about drama and her autobiography—but not current political events. She returned to New York on February 2, 1934, to generally positive press coverage—except from Communist publications. Soon she was surrounded by admirers and friends, besieged with invitations to talks and interviews. Her visa expired in May, and she went to Toronto in order to file another request to visit the US. This second attempt was denied. She stayed in Canada, writing articles for US publications.

In February and March 1936, Berkman underwent a pair of prostate gland operations. Recuperating in Nice and cared for by his companion, Emmy Eckstein, he missed Goldman&#x27;s sixty-seventh birthday in Saint-Tropez in June. She wrote in sadness, but he never read the letter; she received a call in the middle of the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for Nice immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose paralysis. He died later that evening.

=== Spanish Civil War ===
In July 1936, the Spanish Civil War started after an attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by parts of the Spanish Army against the government of the Second Spanish Republic. At the same time, the Spanish anarchists, fighting against the Nationalist forces, started an anarchist revolution. Goldman was invited to Barcelona and in an instant, as she wrote to her niece, &quot;the crushing weight that was pressing down on my heart since Sasha&#x27;s death left me as by magic&quot;. She was welcomed by the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI) organizations, and for the first time in her life lived in a community run by and for anarchists, according to true anarchist principles. &quot;In all my life&quot;, she wrote later, &quot;I have not met with such warm hospitality, comradeship and solidarity.&quot; After touring a series of collectives in the province of Huesca, she told a group of workers: &quot;Your revolution will destroy forever [the notion] that anarchism stands for chaos.&quot; She began editing the weekly &quot;CNT-FAI Information Bulletin&quot; and responded to English-language mail.

Goldman began to worry about the future of Spain&#x27;s anarchism when the CNT-FAI joined a coalition government in 1937—against the core anarchist principle of abstaining from state structures—and, more distressingly, made repeated concessions to Communist forces in the name of uniting against fascism. In November 1936, she wrote that cooperating with Communists in Spain was &quot;a denial of our comrades in Stalin&#x27;s concentration camps&quot;. The USSR, meanwhile, refused to send weapons to anarchist forces, and disinformation campaigns were being waged against the anarchists across Europe and the US. Her faith in the movement unshaken, Goldman returned to London as an official representative of the CNT-FAI.

Delivering lectures and giving interviews, Goldman enthusiastically supported the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists. She wrote regularly for &quot;Spain and the World&quot;, a biweekly newspaper focusing on the civil war. In May 1937, Communist-led forces attacked anarchist strongholds and broke up agrarian collectives. Newspapers in England and elsewhere accepted the timeline of events offered by the Second Spanish Republic at face value. British journalist George Orwell, present for the crackdown, wrote: &quot;[T]he accounts of the Barcelona riots in May ... beat everything I have ever seen for lying.&quot;

Goldman returned to Spain in September, but the CNT-FAI appeared to her like people &quot;in a burning house&quot;. Worse, anarchists and other radicals around the world refused to support their cause. The Nationalist forces declared victory in Spain just before she returned to London. Frustrated by England&#x27;s repressive atmosphere—which she called &quot;more fascist than the fascists&quot;—she returned to Canada in 1939. Her service to the anarchist cause in Spain was not forgotten. On her seventieth birthday, the former Secretary-General of the CNT, Mariano R. Vázquez, sent a message to her from Paris, praising her for her contributions and naming her as &quot;our spiritual mother&quot;. She called it &quot;the most beautiful tribute I have ever received&quot;.

=== Final years ===
As the events preceding World War II began to unfold in Europe, Goldman reiterated her opposition to wars waged by governments. &quot;[M]uch as I loathe Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and Franco&quot;, she wrote to a friend, &quot;I would not support a war against them and for the democracies which, in the last analysis, are only Fascist in disguise.&quot; She felt that Britain and France had missed their opportunity to oppose fascism, and that the coming war would only result in &quot;a new form of madness in the world&quot;.

=== Death ===
On Saturday, February 17, 1940, Goldman suffered a debilitating stroke. She became paralyzed on her right side, and although her hearing was unaffected, she could not speak. As one friend described it: &quot;Just to think that here was Emma, the greatest orator in America, unable to utter one word.&quot; For three months she improved slightly, receiving visitors and on one occasion gesturing to her address book to signal that a friend might find friendly contacts during a trip to Mexico. She suffered another stroke on May 8 and she died six days later in Toronto, aged 70.

The US Immigration and Naturalization Service allowed her body to be brought back to the United States. She was buried in German Waldheim Cemetery (now named Forest Home Cemetery) in Forest Park, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago, near the graves of those executed after the Haymarket affair. The bas relief on her grave marker was created by sculptor Jo Davidson, and the stone includes the quote &quot;Liberty will not descend to a people, a people must raise themselves to liberty&quot;.

== Philosophy ==
Goldman spoke and wrote extensively on a wide variety of issues. While she rejected orthodoxy and fundamentalist thinking, she was an important contributor to several fields of modern political philosophy. She was influenced by many diverse thinkers and writers, including Mikhail Bakunin, Henry David Thoreau, Peter Kropotkin, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nikolai Chernyshevsky, and Mary Wollstonecraft. Another philosopher who influenced Goldman was Friedrich Nietzsche. In her autobiography, she wrote: &quot;Nietzsche was not a social theorist, but a poet, a rebel, and innovator. His aristocracy was neither of birth nor of purse; it was the spirit. In that respect Nietzsche was an anarchist, and all true anarchists were aristocrats.&quot;

=== Anarchism ===
Anarchism was central to Goldman&#x27;s view of the world, and she is widely considered one of the most important figures in the history of anarchism and libertarian socialism. First drawn to it during the persecution of anarchists after the 1886 Haymarket affair, she wrote and spoke regularly on behalf of anarchism. In the title essay of her book &quot;Anarchism and Other Essays&quot;, she wrote:

Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.

Goldman&#x27;s anarchism was intensely personal. She believed it was necessary for anarchist thinkers to live their beliefs, demonstrating their convictions with every action and word. &quot;I don&#x27;t care if a man&#x27;s theory for tomorrow is correct,&quot; she once wrote. &quot;I care if his spirit of today is correct.&quot; Anarchism and free association were to her logical responses to the confines of government control and capitalism. &quot;It seems to me that &quot;these&quot; are the new forms of life,&quot; she wrote, &quot;and that they will take the place of the old, not by preaching or voting, but by living them.&quot; At the same time, she believed that the movement on behalf of human liberty must be staffed by liberated humans. While dancing among fellow anarchists one evening, she was chided by an associate for her carefree demeanor. In her autobiography, Goldman wrote:

I told him to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause constantly thrown in my face. I did not believe that a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. &quot;I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody&#x27;s right to beautiful, radiant things.&quot;

==== Tactical uses of violence ====
In her political youth, Goldman held targeted violence to be a legitimate means of revolutionary struggle. At that time, she believed that the use of violence, while distasteful, could be justified in relation to the social benefits it might accrue. She advocated propaganda of the deed—&quot;attentat&quot;, or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt. She supported her partner Alexander Berkman&#x27;s attempt to kill industrialist Henry Clay Frick, and even begged him to allow her to participate. She believed that Frick&#x27;s actions during the Homestead strike were reprehensible and that his murder would produce a positive result for working people. She later wrote in her autobiography, &quot;Yes, the end in this case justified the means.&quot; While she never gave explicit approval of Leon Czolgosz&#x27;s assassination of US President William McKinley, she defended his ideals and believed actions like his were a natural consequence of repressive institutions. As she wrote in &quot;The Psychology of Political Violence&quot; that &quot;the accumulated forces in our social and economic life, culminating in an act of violence, are similar to the terrors of the atmosphere, manifested in storm and lightning.&quot;

Her experiences in Russia led her to qualify her earlier belief that revolutionary ends might justify violent means. In the afterword to &quot;My Disillusionment in Russia&quot;, she wrote: &quot;There is no greater fallacy than the belief that aims and purposes are one thing, while methods and tactics are another. ... The means employed become, through individual habit and social practice, part and parcel of the final purpose ... .&quot; In the same chapter, Goldman affirmed that &quot;Revolution is indeed a violent process,&quot; and noted that violence was the &quot;tragic inevitability of revolutionary upheavals&quot;. Some misinterpreted her comments on the Bolshevik terror as a rejection of all militant force, but Goldman corrected this in the preface to the first US edition of &quot;My Disillusionment in Russia&quot;:

The argument that destruction and terror are part of revolution I do not dispute. I know that in the past every great political and social change necessitated violence. ... Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet it is one thing to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.

Goldman saw the militarization of Soviet society not as a result of armed resistance per se, but of the statist vision of the Bolsheviks, writing that &quot;an insignificant minority bent on creating an absolute State is necessarily driven to oppression and terrorism.&quot;

=== Capitalism and labor ===
Goldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. &quot;The only demand that property recognizes,&quot; she wrote in &quot;Anarchism and Other Essays&quot;, &quot;is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade.&quot; She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, &quot;turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron.&quot; Originally opposed to anything less than complete revolution, Goldman was challenged during one talk by an elderly worker in the front row. In her autobiography, she wrote:

He said that he understood my impatience with such small demands as a few hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week... But what were men of his age to do? They were not likely to live to see the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.

===State===
Goldman viewed the state as essentially and inevitably a tool of control and domination. As a result of her anti-state views, Goldman believed that voting was useless at best and dangerous at worst. Voting, she wrote, provided an illusion of participation while masking the true structures of decision-making. Instead, Goldman advocated targeted resistance in the form of strikes, protests, and &quot;direct action against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code&quot;. She maintained an anti-voting position even when many anarcho-syndicalists in 1930s Spain voted for the formation of a liberal republic. Goldman wrote that any power anarchists wielded as a voting bloc should instead be used to strike across the country.

Goldman disagreed with the movement for women&#x27;s suffrage, which demanded the right of women to vote. In her essay &quot;Woman Suffrage&quot;, she ridicules the idea that women&#x27;s involvement would infuse the democratic state with a more just orientation: &quot;As if women have not sold their votes, as if women politicians cannot be bought!&quot; She agreed with the suffragists&#x27; assertion that women are equal to men but disagreed that their participation alone would make the state more just. &quot;To assume, therefore, that she would succeed in purifying something which is not susceptible of purification, is to credit her with supernatural powers.&quot; Goldman was also critical of Zionism, which she saw as another failed experiment in state control.

Goldman was a passionate critic of the prison system, critiquing both the treatment of prisoners and the social causes of crime. Goldman viewed crime as a natural outgrowth of an unjust economic system, and in her essay &quot;Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure&quot;, she quoted liberally from the 19th-century authors Fyodor Dostoevsky and Oscar Wilde on prisons, and wrote:

Year after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an emaciated, deformed, will-less, shipwrecked crew of humanity, with the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their natural inclinations thwarted. With nothing but hunger and inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink back into crime as the only possibility of existence.

Goldman was a committed war resister and was particularly opposed to the draft, viewing it as one of the worst of the state&#x27;s forms of coercion, and was one of the founders of the No-Conscription League for which she was ultimately arrested and imprisoned in 1917 before being deported in 1919.

Goldman was routinely surveilled, arrested, and imprisoned for her speech and organizing activities in support of workers and various strikes, access to birth control, and in opposition to World War I. As a result, she became active in the early 20th century free speech movement, seeing freedom of expression as a fundamental necessity for achieving social change. Her outspoken championship of her ideals, in the face of persistent arrests, inspired Roger Baldwin, one of the founders of the American Civil Liberties Union. Goldman&#x27;s and Reitman&#x27;s experiences with vigilantism in the San Diego free speech fight in 1912 is an example of their persistence in the fight for free speech despite risking their safety.

=== Feminism and sexuality ===

Although she was hostile to the suffragist goals of first-wave feminism, Goldman advocated passionately for the rights of women, and is today heralded as a founder of anarcha-feminism, which challenges patriarchy as a hierarchy to be resisted alongside state power and class divisions. In 1897, she wrote: &quot;I demand the independence of woman, her right to support herself; to live for herself; to love whomever she pleases, or as many as she pleases. I demand freedom for both sexes, freedom of action, freedom in love and freedom in motherhood.&quot;
A nurse by training, Goldman was an early advocate for educating women concerning contraception. Like many feminists of her time, she saw abortion as a tragic consequence of social conditions, and birth control as a positive alternative. Goldman was also an advocate of free love, and a strong critic of marriage. She saw early feminists as confined in their scope and bounded by social forces of Puritanism and capitalism. She wrote: &quot;We are in need of unhampered growth out of old traditions and habits. The movement for women&#x27;s emancipation has so far made but the first step in that direction.&quot;

Goldman was an outspoken critic of prejudice against homosexual and genderqueer people. Her belief that social liberation should extend to gay men and lesbians was virtually unheard of at the time, even among anarchists. As German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld wrote, &quot;she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.&quot; In numerous speeches and letters, she defended the right of gay men and lesbians to love as they pleased and condemned the fear and stigma associated with homosexuality. As Goldman wrote in a letter to Hirschfeld, &quot;It is a tragedy, I feel, that people of a different sexual type are caught in a world which shows so little understanding for homosexuals and is so crassly indifferent to the various gradations and variations of gender and their great significance in life.&quot;

=== Atheism ===
A committed atheist, Goldman viewed religion as another instrument of control and domination. Her essay &quot;The Philosophy of Atheism&quot; quoted Bakunin at length on the subject and added:

Consciously or unconsciously, most theists see in gods and devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment... The philosophy of Atheism expresses the expansion and growth of the human mind. The philosophy of theism, if we can call it a philosophy, is static and fixed.

In essays like &quot;The Hypocrisy of Puritanism&quot; and a speech entitled &quot;The Failure of Christianity&quot;, Goldman made more than a few enemies among religious communities by attacking their moralistic attitudes and efforts to control human behavior. She blamed Christianity for &quot;the perpetuation of a slave society&quot;, arguing that it dictated individuals&#x27; actions on Earth and offered poor people a false promise of a plentiful future in heaven.

== Legacy ==

Goldman was well known during her life, described as—among other things—&quot;the most dangerous woman in America&quot;. After her death and through the middle part of the 20th century, her fame faded. Scholars and historians of anarchism viewed her as a great speaker and activist but did not regard her as a philosophical or theoretical thinker on par with, for example, Kropotkin.

In 1970, Dover Press reissued Goldman&#x27;s biography, &quot;Living My Life&quot;, and in 1972, feminist writer Alix Kates Shulman issued a collection of Goldman&#x27;s writing and speeches, &quot;Red Emma Speaks&quot;. These works brought Goldman&#x27;s life and writings to a larger audience, and she was in particular lionized by the women&#x27;s movement of the late 20th century. In 1973, Shulman was asked by a printer friend for a quotation by Goldman for use on a T-shirt. She sent him the selection from &quot;Living My Life&quot; about &quot;the right to self-expression, everybody&#x27;s right to beautiful, radiant things&quot;, recounting that she had been admonished &quot;that it did not behoove an agitator to dance&quot;. The printer created a statement based on these sentiments that has become one of the most famous quotations attributed to Goldman even though she probably never said or wrote it as such: &quot;If I can&#x27;t dance I don&#x27;t want to be in your revolution.&quot; Variations of this saying have appeared on thousands of T-shirts, buttons, posters, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, hats, and other items.

The women&#x27;s movement of the 1970s that &quot;rediscovered&quot; Goldman was accompanied by a resurgent anarchist movement, beginning in the late 1960s, which also reinvigorated scholarly attention to earlier anarchists. The growth of feminism also initiated some reevaluation of Goldman&#x27;s philosophical work, with scholars pointing out the significance of Goldman&#x27;s contributions to anarchist thought in her time. Goldman&#x27;s belief in the value of aesthetics, for example, can be seen in the later influences of anarchism and the arts. Similarly, Goldman is now given credit for significantly influencing and broadening the scope of activism on issues of sexual liberty, reproductive rights, and freedom of expression.

Goldman has been honored by a number of organizations named in her memory. The Emma Goldman Clinic, a women&#x27;s health center located in Iowa City, Iowa, selected Goldman as a namesake &quot;in recognition of her challenging spirit.&quot; Red Emma&#x27;s Bookstore Coffeehouse, an infoshop in Baltimore, Maryland adopted her name out of their belief &quot;in the ideas and ideals that she fought for her entire life: free speech, sexual and racial equality and independence, the right to organize in our jobs and in our own lives, ideas and ideals that we continue to fight for, even today&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Goldman has been depicted in numerous works of fiction.

Goldman appeared in Warren Beatty&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Reds&quot;, in which she was portrayed by Maureen Stapleton, who won an Academy Award for her performance.

Goldman has been a character in two Broadway musicals, &quot;Ragtime&quot; and &quot;Assassins&quot;. Plays depicting Goldman&#x27;s life include: Howard Zinn&#x27;s play, &quot;Emma&quot;; Martin Duberman&#x27;s &quot;Mother Earth&quot;; Jessica Litwak&#x27;s &quot;Love, Anarchy, and Other Affairs&quot; (about Goldman&#x27;s arrest in connection with McKinley&#x27;s assassination); Lynn Rogoff&#x27;s &quot;Love Ben, Love Emma&quot; (about Goldman&#x27;s relationship with Reitman); Carol Bolt&#x27;s &quot;Red Emma&quot;; and Alexis Roblan&#x27;s &quot;Red Emma and the Mad Monk&quot;.

Ethel Mannin&#x27;s 1941 novel &quot;Red Rose&quot; is based on Goldman&#x27;s Life.

Lisa Norton portrays Goldman three times in the Canadian television period detective series Murdoch Mysteries, in episode 4 of season 5 &quot;War on Terror&quot; (March 20, 2012), in episode 15 of season 7 &quot;The Spy Who Came Up to the Cold&quot; (March 10, 2014), and in episode 11 of season 13 &quot;Staring Blindly into the Future&quot; (January 13, 2020).

<doc id="9765" wikidata="Q10438" url="?curid=9765" title="Equuleus">
<text>Equuleus is a faint constellation located just north of the celestial equator. Its name is Latin for &quot;little horse&quot;, a foal. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is the second smallest of the modern constellations (after Crux), spanning only 72 square degrees. It is also very faint, having no stars brighter than the fourth magnitude.

==Notable features==


===Stars===

The brightest star in Equuleus is α Equulei, traditionally called Kitalpha, a yellow star magnitude 3.9, 186 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means &quot;the section of the horse&quot;.

There are few variable stars in Equuleus. Only around 25 are known, most of which are faint. γ Equulei is an α2 CVn variable star, ranging between magnitudes 4.58 and 4.77 over a period of around 12½ minutes. It is a white star 115 light-years from Earth, and has an optical companion of magnitude 6.1, 6 Equulei. It is divisible in binoculars. 6 Equulei is an astrometric binary system itself, with an apparent magnitude of 6.07. R Equulei is a Mira variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 15.7 over nearly 261 days. It has a spectral type of M3e-M4e and has an average B-V colour index of +1.41.

Equuleus contains some double stars of interest. γ Equulei consists of a primary star with a magnitude around 4.7 (slightly variable) and a secondary star of magnitude 11.6, separated by 2 arcseconds. ε Equulei is a triple star also designated 1 Equulei. The system, 197 light-years away, has a primary of magnitude 5.4 that is itself a binary star; its components are of magnitude 6.0 and 6.3 and have a period of 101 years. The secondary is of magnitude 7.4 and is visible in small telescopes. The components of the primary are becoming closer together and will not be divisible in amateur telescopes beginning in 2015. δ Equulei is a binary star with an orbital period of 5.7 years, which at one time was the shortest known orbital period for an optical binary. The two components of the system are never more than 0.35 arcseconds apart.

===Deep-sky objects===
Due to its small size and its distance from the plane of the Milky Way, Equuleus is rather devoid of deep sky objects. Some very faint galaxies in the NGC catalog between magnitudes 13 and 15 include NGC 7015, NGC 7040, and NGC 7046. NGC 7045 is a triple star that was mistaken as a nebula by its discoverer, John Herschel. Other faint galaxies in the IC Catalog include IC 1360, IC 1361, IC 1364, IC 1367, IC 1375, and IC 5083. IC 1365 is a group of galaxies. The magnitudes of these objects vary from 14.5 to 15.5, making them hard to see in even the largest of amateur telescopes.

==Mythology==

In Greek mythology, one myth associates Equuleus with the foal Celeris (meaning &quot;swiftness&quot; or &quot;speed&quot;), who was the offspring or brother of the winged horse Pegasus. Celeris was given to Castor by Mercury. Other myths say that Equuleus is the horse struck from Poseidon&#x27;s trident, during the contest between him and Athena when deciding which would be the superior. Because this section of stars rises before Pegasus, it is often called Equus Primus, or the First Horse. Equuleus is also linked to the story of Philyra and Saturn.

Created by Hipparchus and included by Ptolemy, it abuts Pegasus; unlike the larger horse, it is depicted as a horse&#x27;s head alone.
==Equivalents==
In Chinese astronomy, the stars that correspond to Equuleus are located within the Black Tortoise of the North (北方玄武, &quot;Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ&quot;).

<doc id="9767" wikidata="Q66086" url="?curid=9767" title="Eucharist">
<text>The Eucharist ( ; from , ), also called Holy Communion, the Blessed Sacrament or the Lord&#x27;s Supper, is a Christian rite, considered a sacrament in most churches and an ordinance in others. Christians believe that the rite was instituted by Jesus at the Last Supper, the night before his crucifixion, giving his disciples bread and wine. Passages in the New Testament state that he commanded them to &quot;do this in memory of me&quot; while referring to the bread as &quot;my body&quot; and the cup of wine as &quot;the blood of my covenant, which is poured out for many&quot;. According to the synoptic Gospels, this was at a Passover meal.

The elements of the Eucharist, bread, either leavened or unleavened, and wine (non-alcoholic grape juice in some Protestant traditions, such as Methodism), are consecrated on an altar or a communion table and consumed thereafter. The consecrated elements are the end product of the Eucharistic Prayer. Christians generally recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite, though they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present.

The Catholic Church states that the Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ under the species of bread and wine. It maintains that by the consecration, the substances of the bread and wine actually become the substances of the body and blood of Jesus Christ (transubstantiation) while the form and appearances of the bread and wine remain unaltered (e.g. colour, taste, feel, and smell). The Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches agree that an objective change occurs of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. Lutherans believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present &quot;in, with, and under&quot; the forms of the bread and wine, known as the sacramental union. Reformed Christians believe in a real spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Anglican eucharistic theologies universally affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, though Evangelical Anglicans believe that this is a spiritual presence, while Anglo-Catholics hold to a presence. Others, such as the Plymouth Brethren, hold the Lord&#x27;s Supper to be purely a memorial. As a result of these different understandings, &quot;the Eucharist has been a central issue in the discussions and deliberations of the ecumenical movement.&quot;

==Terminology==
===Eucharist===
The New Testament was originally written in the Greek language and the Greek noun (), meaning &quot;thanksgiving&quot;, appears a few times in it, while the related Greek verb is found several times in New Testament accounts of the Last Supper, including the earliest such account:

The term (thanksgiving) is that by which the rite is referred to in the &quot;Didache&quot; (a late 1st or early 2nd century document), by Ignatius of Antioch (who died between 98 and 117) and by Justin Martyr (&quot;First Apology&quot; written between 155 and 157). Today, &quot;the Eucharist&quot; is the name still used by Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Catholics, Anglicans, Presbyterians, and Lutherans. Other Protestant denominations rarely use this term, preferring &quot;Communion&quot;, &quot;the Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;, &quot;Remembrance&quot;, or &quot;the Breaking of Bread&quot;. Latter-day Saints call it &quot;the Sacrament&quot;.

===Lord&#x27;s Supper===
In the First Epistle to the Corinthians Paul uses the term &quot;Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;, in Greek (), in the early 50s of the 1st century:

So Paul&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot; in reference to the Corinthian banquet is powerful and interesting; but to be an actual name for the Christian meal, rather than a meaningful phrase connected with an ephemeral rhetorical contrast, it would have to have some history, previous or subsequent. Nevertheless, given its existence in the biblical text, &quot;Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot; came into use after the Protestant Reformation and remains the predominant term among Evangelicals, such as Baptists and Pentecostals. They also refer to the observance as an ordinance rather than a sacrament.


===Communion===

Use of the term &quot;Communion&quot; (or &quot;Holy Communion&quot;) to refer to the Eucharistic rite began by some groups originating in the Protestant Reformation. Others, such as the Catholic Church, do not formally use this term for the rite, but instead mean by it the act of partaking of the consecrated elements; they speak of receiving Holy Communion at Mass or outside of it, they also use the term First Communion when one receives the Eucharist for the first time. The term &quot;Communion&quot; is derived from Latin (&quot;sharing in common&quot;), translated from the Greek () in 1 Corinthians 10:16:

===Other terms===
====Breaking of bread====
The phrase (, &#x27;breaking of the bread&#x27;; in later liturgical Greek also ) appears in various related forms five times in the New Testament in contexts which, according to some, may refer to the celebration of the Eucharist, in either closer or symbolically more distant reference to the Last Supper. This term is used by the Plymouth Brethren.

====Sacrament or Blessed Sacrament====
The &quot;Blessed Sacrament&quot;, the &quot;Sacrament of the Altar&quot;, and other variations, are common terms used by Catholics, Lutherans and some Anglicans (Anglo-Catholics) for the consecrated elements, particularly when reserved in a tabernacle. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the term &quot;The Sacrament&quot; is used of the rite.

====Mass====

The term &quot;Mass&quot; is used in the Catholic Church, the Lutheran churches (especially the Churches of Sweden, Norway and Finland), and by some Anglicans. It derives from the Latin word , a dismissal: or &quot;go, it is sent&quot;, the very last phrase of the service. That Latin word has come to imply &quot;mission&quot; as well because the congregation is sent out to serve Christ.

At least in the Catholic Church, the Mass is a long rite in two parts: the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist. The former consists of readings from the Bible and a homily, or sermon, given by a priest or deacon. The latter, which follows seamlessly, includes the &quot;Offering&quot; of the bread and wine at the altar, their consecration by the priest through prayer, and their reception by the congregation in Holy Communion. Among the many other terms used in the Catholic Church are &quot;Holy Mass&quot;, &quot;the Memorial of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the Lord&quot;, the &quot;Holy Sacrifice of the Mass&quot;, and the &quot;Holy Mysteries&quot;.

====Divine Liturgy and Divine Service====
The term Divine Liturgy () is used in Byzantine Rite traditions, whether in the Eastern Orthodox Church or among the Eastern Catholic Churches. These also speak of &quot;the Divine Mysteries&quot;, especially in reference to the consecrated elements, which they also call &quot;the Holy Gifts&quot;.

The term Divine Service () has often been used to refer to Christian worship more generally and is still used in Lutheran churches, in addition to the terms &quot;Eucharist&quot;, &quot;Mass&quot; and &quot;Holy Communion&quot;. Historically this refers (like the term &quot;worship&quot; itself) to service of God, although more recently it has been associated with the idea that God is serving the congregants in the liturgy.

====Other Eastern rites====
Some Eastern rites have yet more names for the Eucharist. Holy Qurbana is common in Syriac Christianity and &quot;Badarak&quot; in the Armenian Rite; in the Alexandrian Rite, the term &quot;prosphora&quot; (from the Greek ) is common in Coptic Christianity and &quot;Keddase&quot; in Ethiopian and Eritrean Christianity.

==History==

===Biblical basis===
The Last Supper appears in all three synoptic Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke. It also is found in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, which suggests how early Christians celebrated what Paul the Apostle called the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Although the Gospel of John does not reference the Last Supper explicitly, some argue that it contains theological allusions to the early Christian celebration of the Eucharist, especially in the chapter 6 Bread of Life Discourse but also in other passages.

====Gospels====
The synoptic Gospels, Mark 14:22–25, Matthew 26:26–29 and Luke 22:13–20 depict Jesus as presiding over the Last Supper prior to his crucifixion. The versions in Matthew and Mark are almost identical, but the Gospel of Luke presents a textual difference, in that a few manuscripts omit the second half of verse 19 and all of verse 20 (&quot;given for you […] poured out for you&quot;), which are found in the vast majority of ancient witnesses to the text. If the shorter text is the original one, then Luke&#x27;s account is independent of both that of Paul and that of Matthew/Mark. If the majority longer text comes from the author of the third gospel, then this version is very similar to that of Paul in 1 Corinthians, being somewhat fuller in its description of the early part of the Supper, particularly in making specific mention of a cup being blessed before the bread was broken.

In the one prayer given to posterity by Jesus, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, the word epiousion—which is otherwise unknown in Classical Greek literature—was interpreted by some early Christian writers as meaning &quot;super-substantial&quot;, and hence a possible reference to the Eucharist as the Bread of Life.

In the Gospel of John, however, the account of the Last Supper does not mention Jesus taking bread and &quot;the cup&quot; and speaking of them as his body and blood; instead, it recounts other events: his humble act of washing the disciples&#x27; feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on to speak of the importance of the unity of the disciples with him, with each other, and with God. Some would find in this unity and in the washing of the feet the deeper meaning of the Communion bread in the other three Gospels. In John 6:26–65, a long discourse is attributed to Jesus that deals with the subject of the living bread; John 6:51–59 also contains echoes of Eucharistic language.

====First Epistle to the Corinthians====
1 Corinthians 11:23–25 gives the earliest recorded description of Jesus&#x27; Last Supper: &quot;The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, &#x27;This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&#x27;&quot; The Greek word used in the passage for &#x27;remembrance&#x27; is (), which itself has a much richer theological history than the English word &quot;remember&quot;.
The expression &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;, derived from Paul&#x27;s usage in 1 Corinthians 11:17–34, may have originally referred to the Agape feast (or love feast), the shared communal meal with which the Eucharist was originally associated. The Agape feast is mentioned in Jude 12 but &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot; is now commonly used in reference to a celebration involving no food other than the sacramental bread and wine.

===Early Christian sources===
The &quot;Didache&quot; (Greek: , &quot;teaching&quot;) is an Early Church treatise that includes instructions for baptism and the Eucharist. Most scholars date it to the late 1st century, and distinguish in it two separate Eucharistic traditions, the earlier tradition in chapter 10 and the later one preceding it in chapter 9. The Eucharist is mentioned again in chapter 14.

Ignatius of Antioch (born , died between 98 and 117), one of the Apostolic Fathers, mentions the Eucharist as &quot;the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ&quot;:

Justin Martyr (born , died ) mentions in this regard:

Paschasius Radbertus (785–865) was a Carolingian theologian, and the abbot of Corbie, whose best-known and influential work is an exposition on the nature of the Eucharist written around 831, entitled . In it, Paschasius agrees with St Ambrose in affirming that the Eucharist contains the true, historical body of Jesus Christ. According to Paschasius, God is truth itself, and therefore, his words and actions must be true. Christ&#x27;s proclamation at the Last Supper that the bread and wine were his body and blood must be taken literally, since God is truth. He thus believes that the transubstantiation of the bread and wine offered in the Eucharist really occurs. Only if the Eucharist is the actual body and blood of Christ can a Christian know it is salvific.

=== Jews and the Eucharist ===
The concept of the Jews both destroying and partaking in some perverted version of the Eucharist has been a vessel to promote anti-Judaism and anti-Jewish ideology and violence. In medieval times, Jews were often depicted stabbing or in some other way physically harming communion wafers. These characterizations drew parallels to the idea that the Jews killed Christ; murdering this transubstantiation or &quot;host&quot; was thought of as a repetition of the event. Jewish people&#x27;s eagerness to destroy hosts were also a variation of blood libel charges, with Jews being accused of murdering bodies of Christ, whether they be communion wafers or Christian children. The blood libel charges and the concept of Eucharist are also related in the belief that blood is efficacious, meaning it has some sort of divine power.

==Eucharistic theology==

Most Christians, even those who deny that there is any real change in the elements used, recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite. However, Christians differ about exactly how, where and how long Christ is present in it. Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Church of the East teach that the reality (the &quot;substance&quot;) of the elements of bread and wine is wholly changed into the body and blood of Jesus Christ, while the appearances (the &quot;species&quot;) remain. Transubstantiation (&quot;change of the substance&quot;) is the term used by Catholics to denote is changed, not to explain the change occurs, since the Catholic Church teaches that &quot;the signs of bread and wine become, &quot;in a way surpassing understanding&quot;, the Body and Blood of Christ&quot;. The Orthodox use various terms such as transelementation, but no explanation is official as they prefer to leave it a mystery.

Lutherans believe Christ to be &quot;truly and substantially present&quot; with the bread and wine that are seen in the Eucharist, in a manner referred to as the sacramental union. They attribute the real presence of Jesus&#x27; living body to his word spoken in the Eucharist, and not to the faith of those receiving it. They also believe that &quot;forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation&quot; are given through the words of Christ in the Eucharist to those who believe his words (&quot;given and shed for you&quot;).

Reformed Christians also believe Christ to be present in the Eucharist, but describe this presence as a spiritual presence, not a physical one. Anglicans adhere to a range of views depending on churchmanship although the teaching in the Anglican Thirty-Nine Articles also holds that the body of Christ is received by the faithful only in a heavenly and spiritual manner, a doctrine also taught in the Methodist Articles of Religion.

Christians adhering to the theology of Memorialism, such as the Anabaptist Churches, do not believe in the concept of the real presence, believing that the Eucharist is only a ceremonial remembrance or memorial of the death of Christ.

The &quot;Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry&quot; document of the World Council of Churches, attempting to present the common understanding of the Eucharist on the part of the generality of Christians, describes it as &quot;essentially the sacrament of the gift which God makes to us in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit&quot;, &quot;Thanksgiving to the Father&quot;, &quot;Anamnesis or Memorial of Christ&quot;, &quot;the sacrament of the unique sacrifice of Christ, who ever lives to make intercession for us&quot;, &quot;the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, the sacrament of his real presence&quot;, &quot;Invocation of the Spirit&quot;, &quot;Communion of the Faithful&quot;, and &quot;Meal of the Kingdom&quot;.

==Ritual and liturgy==
Many Christian denominations classify the Eucharist as a sacrament. Some Protestants (though not all) prefer to instead call it an &quot;ordinance&quot;, viewing it not as a specific channel of divine grace but as an expression of faith and of obedience to Christ.

===Catholic Church===

In the Catholic Church the Eucharist is considered as a sacrament, according to the church the Eucharist is &quot;the source and summit of the Christian life&quot;. &quot;The other sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are oriented toward it. For in the blessed Eucharist is contained the whole spiritual good of the Church, namely Christ himself, our Pasch.&quot; (&quot;Pasch&quot; is a word that sometimes means Easter, sometimes Passover.)

====As a sacrifice====

In the Eucharist the same sacrifice that Jesus made only once on the cross is believed to be made present at every Mass. According to Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, &quot;The Eucharist is the very sacrifice of the Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus which he instituted to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until his return in glory.&quot;

&quot;When the Church celebrates the Eucharist, she commemorates Christ&#x27;s Passover, and it is made present the sacrifice Christ offered once for all on the cross remains ever present. [...] The Eucharist is thus a sacrifice because it re-presents (makes present) the same and only sacrifice offered once for all on the cross&quot;

The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are considered as one single sacrifice: &quot;The victim is one and the same: the same now offers through the ministry of priests, who then offered himself on the cross; only the manner of offering is different.&quot; In the holy sacrifice of the Mass, &quot;it is Christ himself, the eternal high priest of the New Covenant who, acting through the ministry of the priests, offers the Eucharistic sacrifice. And it is the same Christ, really present under the species of bread and wine, who is the offering of the Eucharistic sacrifice.&quot;

====As a real presence====
According to the Catholic Church Jesus Christ is present in the Eucharist in a true, real and substantial way, with his body, blood, soul and divinity. By the consecration, the substances of the bread and wine actually become the substances of the body and blood of Christ (transubstantiation) while the appearances or &quot;species&quot; of the bread and wine remain unaltered (e.g. colour, taste, feel, and smell). This change is brought about in the eucharistic prayer through the efficacy of the word of Christ and by the action of the Holy Spirit. The Eucharistic presence of Christ begins at the moment of the consecration and endures as long as the Eucharistic species subsist, that is, until the Eucharist is digested, physically destroyed, or decays by some natural process (at which point, theologian Thomas Aquinas argued, the substance of the bread and wine cannot return).

The Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215 spoke of the bread and wine as &quot;transubstantiated&quot; into the body and blood of Christ: &quot;His body and blood are truly contained in the sacrament of the altar under the forms of bread and wine, the bread and wine having been transubstantiated, by God&#x27;s power, into his body and blood&quot;. In 1551, the Council of Trent definitively declared: &quot;Because Christ our Redeemer said that it was truly his body that he was offering under the species of bread, it has always been the conviction of the Church of God, and this holy Council now declares again that by the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called transubstantiation.&quot;

The church holds that the body and blood of Jesus can no longer be truly separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or extraordinary minister of Holy Communion) says &quot;The Body of Christ&quot; when administering the Host and &quot;The Blood of Christ&quot; when presenting the chalice, the communicant who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire. &quot;Christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and whole and entire in each of their parts, in such a way that the breaking of the bread does not divide Christ.&quot;
The Catholic Church sees as the main basis for this belief the words of Jesus himself at his Last Supper: the synoptic Gospels and Paul&#x27;s recount that Jesus at the time of taking the bread and the cup said: &quot;This is my body […] this is my blood.&quot; The Catholic understanding of these words, from the Patristic authors onward, has emphasized their roots in the covenantal history of the Old Testament. The interpretation of Christ&#x27;s words against this Old Testament background coheres with and supports belief in the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

===Reception and devotions===
According to the Catholic Church doctrine receiving the Eucharist in a state of mortal sin is a sacrilege and only those who are in a state of grace, that is, without any mortal sin, can receive it. Based on 1 Corinthians 11:27–29, it affirms the following: &quot;Anyone who is aware of having committed a mortal sin must not receive Holy Communion, even if he experiences deep contrition, without having first received sacramental absolution, unless he has a grave reason for receiving Communion and there is no possibility of going to confession.&quot;

Since the Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ, &quot;the worship due to the sacrament of the Eucharist, whether during the celebration of the Mass or outside it, is the worship of , that is, the adoration given to God alone.&quot;&quot; The Blessed Sacrament can be exposed (displayed) on an altar in a monstrance. Rites involving the exposure of the Blessed Sacrament include Benediction and eucharistic adoration. According to Catholic theology, the host, after the Rite of Consecration, is no longer bread, but is the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ. Catholics believe that Jesus is the sacrificial Lamb of God prefigured in the Old Testament Passover. The flesh of that Passover sacrificial lamb was to be consumed by the family members. Any left overs were to be burned before daybreak so that none of the Passover Lamb&#x27;s flesh remained. Only by marking the doorposts and lintel of one&#x27;s home with the Blood of the Lamb were the members of the household saved from death. The consumption of the Lamb was not to save them but rather to give them energy for the journey of escape (Exodus = escape from slavery in Egypt) as was also true for the unleavened bread () As the Passover was the Old Covenant, so the Eucharist became the New Covenant. (, , , and )

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
Within Eastern Christianity, the Eucharistic service is called the &quot;Divine Liturgy&quot; (Byzantine Rite) or similar names in other rites. It comprises two main divisions: the first is the &quot;Liturgy of the Catechumens&quot; which consists of introductory litanies, antiphons and scripture readings, culminating in a reading from one of the Gospels and, often, a homily; the second is the &quot;Liturgy of the Faithful&quot; in which the Eucharist is offered, consecrated, and received as Holy Communion. Within the latter, the actual Eucharistic prayer is called the &quot;anaphora&quot;, (literally &quot;offering&quot; or &quot;carrying up&quot;, from the Greek ). In the Rite of Constantinople, two different anaphoras are currently used: one is attributed to John Chrysostom, the other to Basil the Great. In the Oriental Orthodox Church, a variety of anaphoras are used, but all are similar in structure to those of the Constantinopolitan Rite, in which the Anaphora of Saint John Chrysostom is used most days of the year; Saint Basil&#x27;s is offered on the Sundays of Great Lent, the eves of Christmas and Theophany, Holy Thursday, Holy Saturday, and upon his feast day (1 January). At the conclusion of the Anaphora the bread and wine are held to be the body and blood of Christ. Unlike the Latin Church, the Byzantine Rite uses leavened bread, with the leaven symbolizing the presence of the Holy Spirit. The Greek Orthodox Church utilizes leavened bread in their celebration.

In Eastern theology, one idea of consecration as a process has been suggested. This understands the change in the elements to be accomplished at the epiclesis (&quot;invocation&quot;) by which the Holy Spirit is invoked and the consecration of the bread and wine as the genuine body and blood of Christ is specifically requested, but since the anaphora as a whole is considered a unitary (albeit lengthy) prayer, no one moment within it can readily be singled out.

===Protestantism===
====Anabaptists====
Anabaptist denominations, such as the Mennonites and German Baptist Brethren Churches like the Church of the Brethren churches and congregations have the Agape feast, footwashing, as well as the serving of the bread and wine in the celebration of the Lovefeast. In the more modern groups, Communion is only the serving of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. In the communion meal, the members of the Mennonite churches renew their covenant with God and with each other.

====Moravian/Hussite ====
The Moravian Church adheres to a view known as the &quot;sacramental presence&quot;, teaching that in the sacrament of Holy Communion:
Nicolaus Zinzendorf, a bishop of the Moravian Church, stated that Holy Communion is the &quot;most intimate of all connection with the person of the Saviour.&quot;
The Order of Service for the observance of the Lord&#x27;s Supper includes a salutation, hymns, the right hand of fellowship, prayer, consecration of the elements, distribution of the elements, partaking of the elements, and a benediction. Moravian Christians traditionally practice footwashing before partaking in the Lord&#x27;s Supper, although in certain Moravian congregations, this rite is observed chiefly on Maundy Thursday.

====Anglican====

Anglican theology on the matter of the Eucharist is nuanced. The Eucharist is neither wholly a matter of transubstantiation nor simply devotional and memorialist in orientation. The Anglican churches do not adhere to the belief that the Lord&#x27;s Supper is merely a devotional reflection on Christ&#x27;s death. For some Anglicans, Christ is spiritually present in the fullness of his person in the Eucharist.

The Church of England itself has repeatedly refused to make official any definition of &quot;the presence of Christ&quot;. Church authorities prefer to leave it a mystery while proclaiming the consecrated bread and wine to be &quot;spiritual food&quot; of &quot;Christ&#x27;s Most Precious Body and Blood&quot;; the bread and wine are an &quot;outward sign of an inner grace&quot;. The words of administration at communion allow for real presence or for a real but spiritual presence (Calvinist receptionism and virtualism). This concept was congenial to most Anglicans well into the 19th century. From the 1840s, the Tractarians reintroduced the idea of &quot;the real presence&quot; to suggest a corporeal presence, which could be done since the language of the BCP rite referred to the body and blood of Christ without details as well as referring to these as spiritual food at other places in the text. Both are found in the Latin and other rites, but in the former, a definite interpretation as corporeal is applied.

Both receptionism and virtualism assert the real presence. The former places emphasis on the recipient and the latter states &quot;the presence&quot; is confected by the power of the Holy Spirit but not in Christ&#x27;s natural body. His presence is objective and does not depend on its existence from the faith of the recipient. The liturgy petitions that elements &quot;be&quot; rather than &quot;become&quot; the body and blood of Christ leaving aside any theory of a change in the natural elements: bread and wine are the outer reality and &quot;the presence&quot; is the inner invisible except as perceived in faith.

In 1789, the Episcopal Church in the United States restored explicit language that the Eucharist is an oblation (sacrifice) to God. Subsequent revisions of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; by member churches of the Anglican Communion have done likewise (the Church of England did so in the proposed 1928 prayer book).

The so-called &quot;Black Rubric&quot; in the 1552 prayer book, which allowed kneeling when receiving Holy Communion was omitted in the 1559 edition at Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s insistence. It was reinstated in the 1662 prayer book, modified to deny any corporal presence of Christ&#x27;s natural flesh and blood, which are in Heaven and not here. 

====Baptists====

The bread and &quot;fruit of the vine&quot; indicated in Matthew, Mark and Luke as the elements of the Lord&#x27;s Supper are interpreted by many Baptists as unleavened bread (although leavened bread is often used) and, in line with the historical stance of some Baptist groups (since the mid-19th century) against partaking of alcoholic beverages, grape juice, which they commonly refer to simply as &quot;the Cup&quot;. The unleavened bread also underscores the symbolic belief attributed to Christ&#x27;s breaking the bread and saying that it was his body. A soda cracker is often used.

Some Baptists consider the Communion to be primarily an act of remembrance of Christ&#x27;s atonement, and a time of renewal of personal commitment (memorialism) such as Free Will Baptists, while others, such as Particular Baptists affirm the Reformed doctrine of a pneumatic presence, which is expressed in the Second London Baptist Confession, specifically in Chapter 30, Articles 3 and 7. This view is prevalent among Southern Baptists, those in the Founders movement (a Calvinistic movement among some Independent Baptists),and several individuals in other Baptist associations.

Communion practices and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice is to have small cups of juice and plates of broken bread distributed to the seated congregation. In other congregations, communicants may proceed to the altar to receive the elements, then return to their seats. A widely accepted practice is for all to receive and hold the elements until everyone is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, music is performed and Scripture such as the precise verses of Jesus speaking at the Last Supper is read during the receiving of the elements.

Some Baptist churches are closed-Communionists (even requiring full membership in the local church congregation before partaking), with others being partially or fully open-Communionists. It is rare to find a Baptist church where the Lord&#x27;s Supper is observed every Sunday; most observe monthly or quarterly, with some holding Communion only during a designated Communion service or following a worship service. Adults and children in attendance who have not made a profession of faith in Christ are expected to not participate.

====Lutheran====

Lutherans believe that the body and blood of Christ are &quot;truly and substantially present in, with, and under the forms&quot; of the consecrated bread and wine (the elements), so that communicants eat and drink the body and blood of Christ himself as well as the bread and wine in the Eucharistic sacrament. The Lutheran doctrine of the Real Presence is more accurately and formally known as the &quot;sacramental union&quot;. Others have erroneously called this consubstantiation, a Lollardist doctrine, though this term is specifically rejected by Lutheran churches and theologians since it creates confusion about the actual doctrine and subjects the doctrine to the control of a non-biblical philosophical concept in the same manner as, in their view, does the term &quot;transubstantiation&quot;.

While an official movement exists in Lutheran congregations to celebrate Eucharist weekly, using formal rites very similar to the Catholic and &quot;high&quot; Anglican services, it was historically common for congregations to celebrate monthly or even quarterly. Even in congregations where Eucharist is offered weekly, there is not a requirement that every church service be a Eucharistic service, nor that all members of a congregation must receive it weekly.

====Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren====
Among Open assemblies, also termed Plymouth Brethren, the Eucharist is more commonly called the Breaking of Bread or the Lord&#x27;s Supper. They believe it is only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper and a memorial &quot;to remind believers of his body given and his blood shed for their salvation&quot;. and is central to the worship of both individual and assembly. In principle, the service is open to all baptized Christians, but an individual&#x27;s eligibility to participate depends on the views of each particular assembly. The service takes the form of non-liturgical, open worship with all male participants allowed to pray audibly and select hymns or readings. The breaking of bread itself typically consists of one leavened loaf, which is prayed over and broken by a participant in the meeting and then shared around. The wine is poured from a single container into one or several vessels, and these are again shared around.

The Exclusive Brethren follow a similar practice to the Open Brethren. They also call the Eucharist the Breaking of Bread or the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

====Reformed (Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist)====

In the Reformed tradition (which includes the Continental Reformed Churches, the Presbyterian Churches, and the Congregationalist Churches), the Eucharist is variously administered. The Calvinist view of the Sacrament sees a real presence of Christ in the supper which differs both from the objective ontological presence of the Catholic view, and from the real absence of Christ and the mental recollection of the memorialism of the Zwinglians and their successors.
The bread and wine become the means by which the believer has real communion with Christ in his death and Christ&#x27;s body and blood are present to the faith of the believer as really as the bread and wine are present to their senses but this presence is &quot;spiritual&quot;, that is the work of the Holy Spirit. There is no standard frequency; John Calvin desired weekly communion, but the city council only approved monthly, and monthly celebration has become the most common practice in Reformed churches today.

Many, on the other hand, follow John Knox in celebration of the Lord&#x27;s supper on a quarterly basis, to give proper time for reflection and inward consideration of one&#x27;s own state and sin. Recently, Presbyterian and Reformed Churches have been considering whether to restore more frequent communion, including weekly communion in more churches, considering that infrequent communion was derived from a memorialist view of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, rather than Calvin&#x27;s view of the sacrament as a means of grace. Some churches use bread without any raising agent (whether yeast or another leaven.) in view of the use of unleavened bread at Jewish Passover meals, while others use any bread available.

The Presbyterian Church (USA), for instance, prescribes &quot;bread common to the culture&quot;. Harking back to the regulative principle of worship, the Reformed tradition had long eschewed coming forward to receive communion, preferring to have the elements distributed throughout the congregation by the presbyters (elders) more in the style of a shared meal. Over the last half a century it is much more common in Presbyterian churches to have Holy Communion monthly or on a weekly basis. It is also becoming common to receive the elements by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). Wine and grape juice are both used, depending on the congregation. Most Reformed churches practice &quot;open communion&quot;, i.e., all believers who are united to a church of like faith and practice, and who are not living in sin, would be allowed to join in the Sacrament.

====Methodist====

The British &quot;Catechism for the use of the people called Methodists&quot; states that, &quot;[in the Eucharist] Jesus Christ is present with his worshipping people and gives himself to them as their Lord and Saviour&quot;. Methodist theology of this sacrament is reflected in one of the fathers of the movement, Charles Wesley, who wrote a Eucharistic hymn with the following stanza:
&lt;poem&gt;
We need not now go up to Heaven,
To bring the long sought Saviour down;
Thou art to all already given,
Thou dost e&#x27;en now Thy banquet crown:
To every faithful soul appear,
And show Thy real presence here!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Reflecting Wesleyan covenant theology, Methodists also believe that the Lord&#x27;s Supper is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace.

In many Methodist denominations, non-alcoholic wine (grape juice) is used, so as to include those who do not take alcohol for any reason, as well as a commitment to the Church&#x27;s historical support of temperance. Variations of the Eucharistic Prayer are provided for various occasions, including communion of the sick and brief forms for occasions that call for greater brevity. Though the ritual is standardized, there is great variation amongst Methodist churches, from typically high-church to low-church, in the enactment and style of celebration. Methodist clergy are not required to be vested when celebrating the Eucharist.

John Wesley, a founder of Methodism, said that it was the duty of Christians to receive the sacrament as often as possible. Methodists in the United States are encouraged to celebrate the Eucharist every Sunday, though it is typically celebrated on the first Sunday of each month, while a few go as long as celebrating quarterly (a tradition dating back to the days of circuit riders that served multiple churches). Communicants may receive standing, kneeling, or while seated. Gaining more wide acceptance is the practice of receiving by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). The most common alternative to intinction is for the communicants to receive the consecrated juice using small, individual, specially made glass or plastic cups known as communion cups. The United Methodist Church practices open communion (which it describes as an &quot;open table&quot;), inviting &quot;all who intend a Christian life, together with their children&quot; to receive the eucharistic elements. &quot;The Doctrines and Discipline of the Methodist Church&quot; specifies, on days during which Holy Communion is celebrated, that &quot;Upon entering the church let the communicants bow in prayer and in the spirit of prayer and meditation approach the Blessed Sacrament.&quot;

====Nondenominational Christians====

Many non-denominational Christians, including the Churches of Christ, receive communion every Sunday. Others, including Evangelical churches such as the Church of God and Calvary Chapel, typically receive communion on a monthly or periodic basis. Many non-denominational Christians hold to the Biblical autonomy of local churches and have no universal requirement among congregations.

Some Churches of Christ, among others, use grape juice and unleavened wafers or unleavened bread and practice open communion.

===Syriac Christianity===
====Edessan Rite (Church of the East)====

Holy Qurbana or Qurbana Qaddisha, the &quot;Holy Offering&quot; or &quot;Holy Sacrifice&quot;, refers to the Eucharist as celebrated according to the East Syriac Christianity. The main Anaphora of the East Syrian tradition is the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari.

====Syro-Antiochene Rite (West Syriac)====

Holy Qurobo or Qurobo Qadisho refers to the Eucharist as celebrated in the West Syrian traditions of Syriac Christianity, while that of the West Syrian tradition is the Liturgy of Saint James.

Both are extremely old, going back at least to the third century, and are the oldest extant liturgies continually in use.

===Restorationism===
====Irvingian====
In the Irvingian Churches, Holy Communion, along with Holy Baptism and Holy Sealing, is one of the three sacraments. It is the focus of the Divine Service in the liturgies of Irvingism.

Edward Irving, who founded the Irvingian Churches, such as the New Apostolic Church, taught the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, emphasizing &quot;the &quot;humiliated&quot; humanity of Christ in the Lord&#x27;s Supper.&quot; Additionally, the Irvingian Churches affirm the &quot;real presence of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ in Holy Communion&quot;:
In the Irvingian tradition of Restorationist Christianity, consubstantiation is taught as the explanation of how the real presence is effected in the liturgy.

====Seventh-day Adventists====
In the Seventh-day Adventist Church the Holy Communion service customarily is celebrated once per quarter. The service includes the ordinance of footwashing and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Unleavened bread and unfermented (non-alcoholic) grape juice is used. Open communion is practised: all who have committed their lives to the Saviour may participate. The communion service must be conducted by an ordained pastor, minister or church elder.

====Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses====

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses commemorate Jesus&#x27; death annually on the evening that corresponds to the Passover, Nisan 14, according to the ancient Jewish calendar. They generally refer to the observance as &quot;the Lord&#x27;s Evening Meal&quot; or the &quot;Memorial of Christ&#x27;s Death&quot;. They believe the event is the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians in the Bible.

Of those who attend the Memorial, a small minority worldwide partake of the wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that only 144,000 people will go to heaven, to serve as under-priests and co-rulers with Christ the King in God&#x27;s Kingdom. They are referred to as the &quot;anointed&quot; class. They believe that the baptized &quot;other sheep&quot; also benefit from the ransom sacrifice, and are respectful observers and viewers of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, but they hope to obtain everlasting life in Paradise restored on earth.

The Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that the bread represents Jesus&#x27; perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which he shed to redeem fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as &quot;emblems&quot;) are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in transubstantiation or consubstantiation.

====Latter-day Saints====

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the &quot;Holy Sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;, more simply referred to as the Sacrament, is administered every Sunday (except General Conference or other special Sunday meeting) in each Latter-Day Saint Ward or branch worldwide at the beginning of Sacrament meeting. The Sacrament, which consists of both ordinary bread and water (rather than wine or grape juice), is prepared by priesthood holders prior to the beginning of the meeting. At the beginning of the Sacrament, priests say specific prayers to bless the bread and water. The Sacrament is passed row-by-row to the congregation by priesthood holders (typically deacons).

The prayer recited for the bread and the water is found in the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants. The prayer contains the above essentials given by Jesus: &quot;Always remember him, and keep his commandments […] that they may always have his Spirit to be with them.&quot; (Moroni, 4:3.)

==Non-observing denominations==
===Salvation Army===
While the Salvation Army does not reject the Eucharistic practices of other churches or deny that their members truly receive grace through this sacrament, it does not practice the sacraments of Communion or Baptism. This is because they believe that these are unnecessary for the living of a Christian life, and because in the opinion of Salvation Army founders William and Catherine Booth, the sacrament placed too much stress on outward ritual and too little on inward spiritual conversion.

===Quakers===
Emphasizing the inward spiritual experience of their adherents over any outward ritual, Quakers (members of the Religious Society of Friends) generally do not baptize or observe Communion.

===Christian Scientists===
Although the early Church of Christ, Scientist observed Communion, founder Mary Baker Eddy eventually discouraged the physical ritual as she believed it distracted from the true spiritual nature of the sacrament. As such, Christian Scientists do not observe physical communion with bread and wine, but spiritual communion at two special Sunday services each year by &quot;uniting together with Christ in silent prayer and on bended knee&quot;.

===Shakers===
The United Society of Believers (commonly known as Shakers) do not take communion, instead viewing every meal as a Eucharistic feast.

==Practice and customs==
===Open and closed communion===

Christian denominations differ in their understanding of whether they may celebrate the Eucharist with those with whom they are not in full communion. The apologist Justin Martyr () wrote of the Eucharist &quot;of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined.&quot; This was continued in the practice of dismissing the catechumens (those still undergoing instruction and not yet baptized) before the sacramental part of the liturgy, a custom which has left traces in the expression &quot;Mass of the Catechumens&quot; and in the Byzantine Rite exclamation by the deacon or priest, &quot;The doors! The doors!&quot;, just before recitation of the Creed.

Churches such as the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches practice closed communion under normal circumstances. However, the Catholic Church allows administration of the Eucharist, at their spontaneous request, to properly disposed members of the eastern churches (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Church of the East) not in full communion with it and of other churches that the Holy See judges to be sacramentally in the same position as these churches; and in grave and pressing need, such as danger of death, it allows the Eucharist to be administered also to individuals who do not belong to these churches but who share the Catholic Church&#x27;s faith in the reality of the Eucharist and have no access to a minister of their own community. Some Protestant communities exclude non-members from Communion.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) practices open communion, provided those who receive are baptized, but the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) practice closed communion, excluding non-members and requiring communicants to have been given catechetical instruction. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, the Evangelical Church in Germany, the Church of Sweden, and many other Lutheran churches outside of the U.S. also practice open communion.

Some use the term &quot;close communion&quot; for restriction to members of the same denomination, and &quot;closed communion&quot; for restriction to members of the local congregation alone.

Most Protestant communities including Congregational churches, the Church of the Nazarene, the Assemblies of God, Methodists, most Presbyterians and Baptists, Anglicans, and Churches of Christ and other non-denominational churches practice various forms of open communion. Some churches do not limit it to only members of the congregation, but to any people in attendance (regardless of Christian affiliation) who consider themselves to be Christian. Others require that the communicant be a baptized person, or a member of a church of that denomination or a denomination of &quot;like faith and practice&quot;. Some Progressive Christian congregations offer communion to any individual who wishes to commemorate the life and teachings of Christ, regardless of religious affiliation.

Most Latter-Day Saint churches practice closed communion; one notable exception is the Community of Christ, the second-largest denomination in this movement. While The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the largest of the LDS denominations) technically practice a closed communion, their official direction to local Church leaders (in Handbook 2, section 20.4.1, last paragraph) is as follows: &quot;Although the sacrament is for Church members, the bishopric should not announce that it will be passed to members only, and nothing should be done to prevent nonmembers from partaking of it.&quot;

In the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church the Eucharist is only given to those who have come prepared to receive the life-giving body and blood. Therefore, in a manner to worthily receive, believers fast the night before the liturgy, from around 6pm or the conclusion of evening prayer, and remain fasting until they receive Holy Qurbana the next morning. Additionally, members who plan to receive the holy communion have to follow a strict guide of prescribed prayers from the Shehimo, or the book of common prayers, for the week.

===Preparation===
====Catholic====
The Catholic Church requires its members to receive the sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation before taking Communion if they are aware of having committed a mortal sin and to prepare by fasting, prayer, and other works of piety.

====Eastern Orthodox====
Traditionally, the Eastern Orthodox church has required its members to have observed all church-appointed fasts (most weeks, this will be at least Wednesday and Friday) for the week prior to partaking of communion, and to fast from all food and water from midnight the night before. In addition, Orthodox Christians are to have made a recent confession to their priest (the frequency varying with one&#x27;s particular priest), and they must be at peace with all others, meaning that they hold no grudges or anger against anyone. In addition, one is expected to attend Vespers or the All-Night Vigil, if offered, on the night before receiving communion. Furthermore, various pre-communion prayers have been composed, which many (but not all) Orthodox churches require or at least strongly encourage members to say privately before coming to the Eucharist. However, all this will typically vary from priest to priest and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but abstaining from food and water for several hours beforehand is a fairly universal rule.

====Protestant confessions====
Many Protestant congregations generally reserve a period of time for self-examination and private, silent confession just before partaking in the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

===Adoration===

Eucharistic adoration is a practice in the Latin Church, Anglo-Catholic and some Lutheran traditions, in which the Blessed Sacrament is exposed to and adored by the faithful. When this exposure and adoration is constant (twenty-four hours a day), it is called &quot;Perpetual Adoration&quot;. In a parish, this is usually done by volunteer parishioners; in a monastery or convent, it is done by the resident monks or nuns. In the &quot;Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament&quot;, the Eucharist is displayed in a monstrance, typically placed on an altar, at times with a light focused on it, or with candles flanking it.

===Health issues===
====Gluten====

The gluten in wheat bread is dangerous to people with celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy. For the Catholic Church, this issue was addressed in the 24 July 2003 letter of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which summarized and clarified earlier declarations. The Catholic Church believes that the matter for the Eucharist must be wheaten bread and fermented wine from grapes: it holds that, if the gluten has been entirely removed, the result is not true wheaten bread. For celiacs, but not generally, it allows low-gluten bread. It also permits Holy Communion to be received under the form of either bread or wine alone, except by a priest who is celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant. Many Protestant churches offer communicants gluten-free alternatives to wheaten bread, usually in the form of a rice-based or other gluten-free wafer.

====Alcohol====

The Catholic Church believes that grape juice that has not begun even minimally to ferment cannot be accepted as wine, which it sees as essential for celebration of the Eucharist. For non-alcoholics, but not generally, it allows the use of mustum (grape juice in which fermentation has begun but has been suspended without altering the nature of the juice), and it holds that &quot;since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the species, communion under the species of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. For pastoral reasons, this manner of receiving communion has been legitimately established as the most common form in the Latin rite.&quot;

As already indicated, the one exception is in the case of a priest celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant. The water that in the Roman Rite is prescribed to be mixed with the wine must be only a relatively small quantity. The practice of the Coptic Church is that the mixture should be two parts wine to one part water.

Some Protestant churches allow communion in a non-alcoholic form, either normatively or as a pastoral exception. Since the invention of the necessary technology, grape juice which has been pasteurized to stop the fermentation process the juice naturally undergoes and de-alcoholized wine from which most of the alcohol has been removed (between 0.5% and 2% remains) are commonly used, and more rarely water may be offered. Exclusive use of unfermented grape juice is common in Baptist churches, the United Methodist Church, Seventh-day Adventists, Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, Church of God (Anderson, Indiana), some Lutherans, Assemblies of God, Pentecostals, Evangelicals, the Christian Missionary Alliance, and other American independent Protestant churches. 

For members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, water is exclusively used in place of wine. From the church’s General Handbook, section 18.9, ”During this ordinance, they partake of the bread and water to remember the Savior’s sacrifice of His flesh and blood and to renew their sacred covenants…”

====Transmission of diseases====

Risk of infectious disease transmission related to use of a common communion cup exists but it is low. No case of transmission of an infectious disease related to a common communion cup has ever been documented. Experimental studies have demonstrated that infectious diseases can be transmitted. The most likely diseases to be transmitted would be common viral illnesses such as the common cold. A study of 681 individuals found that taking communion up to daily from a common cup did not increase the risk of infection beyond that of those who did not attend services at all.

In influenza epidemics, some churches suspend the giving wine at communion, for fear of spreading the disease. This is in full accord with Catholic Church belief that communion under the form of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. However, the same measure has also been taken by churches that normally insist on the importance of receiving communion under both forms. This was done in 2009 by the Church of England.

Some fear contagion through the handling involved in distributing the hosts to the communicants, even if they are placed on the hand rather than on the tongue. Accordingly, some churches use mechanical wafer dispensers or &quot;pillow packs&quot; (communion wafers with wine inside them). While these methods of distributing communion are not generally accepted in Catholic parishes, one parish provides a mechanical dispenser to allow those intending to commune to place in a bowl, without touching them by hand, the hosts for use in the celebration.

<text>An eclipse is an astronomical event which occurs when an astronomical object or spacecraft is temporarily obscured, by passing into the shadow of another body or by having another body pass between it and the viewer. This alignment of three celestial objects is known as a &quot;syzygy&quot;. An eclipse is the result of either an &quot;occultation&quot; (completely hidden) or a &quot;transit&quot; (partially hidden). A &quot;deep eclipse&quot; (or &quot;deep occultation&quot;) is when a small astronomical object is behind a bigger one.

The term &quot;eclipse&quot; is most often used to describe either a solar eclipse, when the Moon&#x27;s shadow crosses the Earth&#x27;s surface, or a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into the Earth&#x27;s shadow. However, it can also refer to such events beyond the Earth–Moon system: for example, a planet moving into the shadow cast by one of its moons, a moon passing into the shadow cast by its host planet, or a moon passing into the shadow of another moon. A binary star system can also produce eclipses if the plane of the orbit of its constituent stars intersects the observer&#x27;s position.

For the special cases of solar and lunar eclipses, these only happen during an &quot;eclipse season&quot;, the two times of each year when the plane of the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun crosses with the plane of the Moon&#x27;s orbit around the Earth and the line defined by the intersecting planes points near the Sun. The type of solar eclipse that happens during each season (whether total, annular, hybrid, or partial) depends on apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon. If the orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the Moon&#x27;s orbit around the Earth were both in the same plane with each other, then eclipses would happen every month. There would be a lunar eclipse at every full moon, and a solar eclipse at every new moon. It is because of the non-planar differences that eclipses are not a common event. If both orbits were perfectly circular, then each eclipse would be the same type every month.

Lunar eclipses can be viewed from the entire nightside half of the Earth. But solar eclipses, particularly total eclipses occurring at any one particular point on the Earth&#x27;s surface, are very rare events that can be many decades apart.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the ancient Greek noun (&#x27;), which means &#x27;the abandonment&#x27;, &#x27;the downfall&#x27;, or &#x27;the darkening of a heavenly body&#x27;, which is derived from the verb (&#x27;) which means &#x27;to abandon&#x27;, &#x27;to darken&#x27;, or &#x27;to cease to exist&#x27;, a combination of prefix (&#x27;), from preposition (&#x27;), &#x27;out&#x27;, and of verb (&quot;&quot;), &#x27;to be absent&#x27;.

== Umbra, penumbra and antumbra ==


For any two objects in space, a line can be extended from the first through the second. The latter object will block some amount of light being emitted by the former, creating a region of shadow around the axis of the line. Typically these objects are moving with respect to each other and their surroundings, so the resulting shadow will sweep through a region of space, only passing through any particular location in the region for a fixed interval of time. As viewed from such a location, this shadowing event is known as an eclipse.

Typically the cross-section of the objects involved in an astronomical eclipse is roughly disk-shaped. The region of an object&#x27;s shadow during an eclipse is divided into three parts:
* The &quot;umbra&quot; (Latin for &#x27;shadow&#x27;), within which the object completely covers the light source. For the Sun, this light source is the photosphere.
* The &quot;antumbra&quot; (from Latin &quot;ante&quot;, &#x27;before, in front of&#x27;, plus &quot;umbra&quot;) extending beyond the tip of the umbra, within which the object is completely in front of the light source but too small to completely cover it.
* The &quot;penumbra&quot; (from the Latin &quot;paene&quot;, &#x27;almost, nearly&#x27;, plus &quot;umbra&quot;), within which the object is only partially in front of the light source.
A total eclipse occurs when the observer is within the umbra, an annular eclipse when the observer is within the antumbra, and a partial eclipse when the observer is within the penumbra. During a lunar eclipse only the umbra and penumbra are applicable, because the antumbra of the Sun-Earth system lies far beyond the Moon. Analogously, Earth&#x27;s apparent diameter from the viewpoint of the Moon is nearly four times that of the Sun and thus cannot produce an annular eclipse. The same terms may be used analogously in describing other eclipses, e.g., the antumbra of Deimos crossing Mars, or Phobos entering Mars&#x27;s penumbra.

The &quot;first contact&quot; occurs when the eclipsing object&#x27;s disc first starts to impinge on the light source; &quot;second contact&quot; is when the disc moves completely within the light source; &quot;third contact&quot; when it starts to move out of the light; and &quot;fourth&quot; or &quot;last contact&quot; when it finally leaves the light source&#x27;s disc entirely.

For spherical bodies, when the occulting object is smaller than the star, the length (&quot;L&quot;) of the umbra&#x27;s cone-shaped shadow is given by:

:formula_1

where &quot;Rs&quot; is the radius of the star, &quot;Ro&quot; is the occulting object&#x27;s radius, and &quot;r&quot; is the distance from the star to the occulting object. For Earth, on average &quot;L&quot; is equal to 1.384 km, which is much larger than the Moon&#x27;s semimajor axis of 3.844 km. Hence the umbral cone of the Earth can completely envelop the Moon during a lunar eclipse. If the occulting object has an atmosphere, however, some of the luminosity of the star can be refracted into the volume of the umbra. This occurs, for example, during an eclipse of the Moon by the Earth—producing a faint, ruddy illumination of the Moon even at totality.

On Earth, the shadow cast during an eclipse moves very approximately at 1 km per sec. This depends on the location of the shadow on the Earth and the angle in which it is moving.

== Eclipse cycles ==
An eclipse cycle takes place when eclipses in a series are separated by a certain interval of time. This happens when the orbital motions of the bodies form repeating harmonic patterns. A particular instance is the saros, which results in a repetition of a solar or lunar eclipse every 6,585.3 days, or a little over 18 years. Because this is not a whole number of days, successive eclipses will be visible from different parts of the world. In one saros period there are 239.0 anomalistic periods, 241.0 sidereal periods, 242.0 nodical periods, and 223.0 synodic periods. Although the orbit of the Moon does not give exact integers, the numbers of orbit cycles are close enough to integers to give strong similarity for eclipses spaced at 18.03 yr intervals.

==Earth–Moon system==

An eclipse involving the Sun, Earth, and Moon can occur only when they are nearly in a straight line, allowing one to be hidden behind another, viewed from the third. Because the orbital plane of the Moon is tilted with respect to the orbital plane of the Earth (the ecliptic), eclipses can occur only when the Moon is close to the intersection of these two planes (the nodes). The Sun, Earth and nodes are aligned twice a year (during an eclipse season), and eclipses can occur during a period of about two months around these times. There can be from four to seven eclipses in a calendar year, which repeat according to various eclipse cycles, such as a saros.

Between 1901 and 2100 there are the maximum of seven eclipses in:
* four (penumbral) lunar and three solar eclipses: 1908, 2038.
* four solar and three lunar eclipses: 1918, 1973, 2094.
* five solar and two lunar eclipses: 1934.

Excluding penumbral lunar eclipses, there are a maximum of seven eclipses in:
* 1591, 1656, 1787, 1805, 1918, 1935, 1982, and 2094.

===Solar eclipse===

As observed from the Earth, a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes in front of the Sun. The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Earth intersects the umbra portion of the Moon&#x27;s shadow. When the umbra does not reach the surface of the Earth, the Sun is only partially occulted, resulting in an annular eclipse. Partial solar eclipses occur when the viewer is inside the penumbra.

The eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the Sun&#x27;s diameter that is covered by the Moon. For a total eclipse, this value is always greater than or equal to one. In both annular and total eclipses, the eclipse magnitude is the ratio of the angular sizes of the Moon to the Sun.

Solar eclipses are relatively brief events that can only be viewed in totality along a relatively narrow track. Under the most favorable circumstances, a total solar eclipse can last for 7 minutes, 31 seconds, and can be viewed along a track that is up to 250 km wide. However, the region where a partial eclipse can be observed is much larger. The Moon&#x27;s umbra will advance eastward at a rate of 1,700 km/h, until it no longer intersects the Earth&#x27;s surface.

During a solar eclipse, the Moon can sometimes perfectly cover the Sun because its apparent size is nearly the same as the Sun&#x27;s when viewed from the Earth. A total solar eclipse is in fact an occultation while an annular solar eclipse is a transit.

When observed at points in space other than from the Earth&#x27;s surface, the Sun can be eclipsed by bodies other than the Moon. Two examples include when the crew of Apollo 12 observed the Earth to eclipse the Sun in 1969 and when the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe observed Saturn to eclipse the Sun in 2006.

===Lunar eclipse===
Lunar eclipses occur when the Moon passes through the Earth&#x27;s shadow. This happens only during a full moon, when the Moon is on the far side of the Earth from the Sun. Unlike a solar eclipse, an eclipse of the Moon can be observed from nearly an entire hemisphere. For this reason it is much more common to observe a lunar eclipse from a given location. A lunar eclipse lasts longer, taking several hours to complete, with totality itself usually averaging anywhere from about 30 minutes to over an hour.

There are three types of lunar eclipses: penumbral, when the Moon crosses only the Earth&#x27;s penumbra; partial, when the Moon crosses partially into the Earth&#x27;s umbra; and total, when the Moon crosses entirely into the Earth&#x27;s umbra. Total lunar eclipses pass through all three phases. Even during a total lunar eclipse, however, the Moon is not completely dark. Sunlight refracted through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere enters the umbra and provides a faint illumination. Much as in a sunset, the atmosphere tends to more strongly scatter light with shorter wavelengths, so the illumination of the Moon by refracted light has a red hue, thus the phrase &#x27;Blood Moon&#x27; is often found in descriptions of such lunar events as far back as eclipses are recorded.

===Historical record===

Records of solar eclipses have been kept since ancient times. Eclipse dates can be used for chronological dating of historical records. A Syrian clay tablet, in the Ugaritic language, records a solar eclipse which occurred on March 5, 1223, B.C., while Paul Griffin argues that a stone in Ireland records an eclipse on November 30, 3340 B.C. Positing classical-era astronomers&#x27; use of Babylonian eclipse records mostly from the 13th century BC provides a feasible and mathematically consistent explanation for the Greek finding all three lunar mean motions (synodic, anomalistic, draconitic) to a precision of about one part in a million or better. Chinese historical records of solar eclipses date back over 3,000 years and have been used to measure changes in the Earth&#x27;s rate of spin.

The first person to give scientific explanation on eclipses was Anaxagoras [c500BC - 428BC]. Anaxagoras stated that the Moon shines by reflected light from the Sun.

In 5th century AD, solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata, in his treatise &quot;Aryabhatiya.&quot; Aryabhata states that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight and explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth. Aryabhata provides the computation and the size of the eclipsed part during an eclipse. Indian computations were very accurate that 18th-century French scientist Guillaume Le Gentil, during a visit to Pondicherry, India, found the Indian computations of the duration of the lunar eclipse of 30 August 1765 to be short by only 41 seconds, whereas Le Gentil&#x27;s charts were long by 68 seconds.

By the 1600s, European astronomers were publishing books with diagrams explaining how lunar and solar eclipses occurred. In order to disseminate this information to a broader audience and decrease fear of the consequences of eclipses, booksellers printed broadsides explaining the event either using the science or via astrology.

=== Eclipses in mythology and religion ===

The American author Gene Weingarten described the tension between belief and eclipses thus: &quot;I am a devout atheist but can&#x27;t explain why the moon is exactly the right size, and gets positioned so precisely between the Earth and the sun, that total solar eclipses are perfect. It bothers me.&quot;

The Graeco-Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing between AD 211–229, relates the anecdote that Emperor Claudius considered it necessary to prevent disturbance among the Roman population by publishing a prediction for a solar eclipse which would fall on his birthday anniversary [1 August in the year AD 45]. In this context, Cassius Dio provides a detailed explanation of solar and lunar eclipses.

Typically in mythology, eclipses were understood to be one variation or another of a spiritual battle between the sun and evil forces or spirits of darkness. More specifically, in Norse mythology, it is believed that there is a wolf by the name of Fenrir that is in constant pursuit of the Sun, and eclipses are thought to occur when the wolf successfully devours the divine Sun. Other Norse tribes believed that there are two wolves by the names of Sköll and Hati that are in pursuit of the Sun and the Moon, known by the names of Sol and Mani, and these tribes believed that an eclipse occurs when one of the wolves successfully eats either the Sun or the Moon.

In most types of mythologies and certain religions, eclipses were seen as a sign that the gods were angry and that danger was soon to come, so people often altered their actions in an effort to dissuade the gods from unleashing their wrath. In the Hindu religion, for example, people often sing religious hymns for protection from the evil spirits of the eclipse, and many people of the Hindu religion refuse to eat during an eclipse to avoid the effects of the evil spirits. Hindu people living in India will also wash off in the Ganges River, which is believed to be spiritually cleansing, directly following an eclipse to clean themselves of the evil spirits. In early Judaism and Christianity, eclipses were viewed as signs from God, and some eclipses were seen as a display of God&#x27;s greatness or even signs of cycles of life and death. However, more ominous eclipses such as a blood moon were believed to be a divine sign that God would soon destroy their enemies.

==Other planets and dwarf planets==

===Gas giants===

The gas giant planets have many moons and thus frequently display eclipses. The most striking involve Jupiter, which has four large moons and a low axial tilt, making eclipses more frequent as these bodies pass through the shadow of the larger planet. Transits occur with equal frequency. It is common to see the larger moons casting circular shadows upon Jupiter&#x27;s cloudtops.

The eclipses of the Galilean moons by Jupiter became accurately predictable once their orbital elements were known. During the 1670s, it was discovered that these events were occurring about 17 minutes later than expected when Jupiter was on the far side of the Sun. Ole Rømer deduced that the delay was caused by the time needed for light to travel from Jupiter to the Earth. This was used to produce the first estimate of the speed of light.

The timing of the Jovian satellite eclipses was also used to calculate an observer&#x27;s longitude upon the Earth. By knowing the expected time when an eclipse would be observed at a standard longitude (such as Greenwich), the time difference could be computed by accurately observing the local time of the eclipse. The time difference gives the longitude of the observer because every hour of difference corresponded to 15° around the Earth&#x27;s equator. This technique was used, for example, by Giovanni D. Cassini in 1679 to re-map France.

On the other three gas giants (Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) eclipses only occur at certain periods during the planet&#x27;s orbit, due to their higher inclination between the orbits of the moon and the orbital plane of the planet. The moon Titan, for example, has an orbital plane tilted about 1.6° to Saturn&#x27;s equatorial plane. But Saturn has an axial tilt of nearly 27°. The orbital plane of Titan only crosses the line of sight to the Sun at two points along Saturn&#x27;s orbit. As the orbital period of Saturn is 29.7 years, an eclipse is only possible about every 15 years.

===Mars===
On Mars, only partial solar eclipses (transits) are possible, because neither of its moons is large enough, at their respective orbital radii, to cover the Sun&#x27;s disc as seen from the surface of the planet. Eclipses of the moons by Mars are not only possible, but commonplace, with hundreds occurring each Earth year. There are also rare occasions when Deimos is eclipsed by Phobos. Martian eclipses have been photographed from both the surface of Mars and from orbit.

===Pluto===

Pluto, with its proportionately largest moon Charon, is also the site of many eclipses. A series of such mutual eclipses occurred between 1985 and 1990. These daily events led to the first accurate measurements of the physical parameters of both objects.

===Mercury and Venus===
Eclipses are impossible on Mercury and Venus, which have no moons. However, as seen from the Earth, both have been observed to transit across the face of the Sun. Transits of Venus occur in pairs separated by an interval of eight years, but each pair of events happen less than once a century. According to NASA, the next pair of Venus transits will occur on December 10, 2117, and December 8, 2125. Transits of Mercury are much more common, occurring 13 times each century, on average.

==Eclipsing binaries==
A binary star system consists of two stars that orbit around their common centre of mass. The movements of both stars lie on a common orbital plane in space. When this plane is very closely aligned with the location of an observer, the stars can be seen to pass in front of each other. The result is a type of extrinsic variable star system called an eclipsing binary.

The maximum luminosity of an eclipsing binary system is equal to the sum of the luminosity contributions from the individual stars. When one star passes in front of the other, the luminosity of the system is seen to decrease. The luminosity returns to normal once the two stars are no longer in alignment.

The first eclipsing binary star system to be discovered was Algol, a star system in the constellation Perseus. Normally this star system has a visual magnitude of 2.1. However, every 2.867 days the magnitude decreases to 3.4 for more than nine hours. This is caused by the passage of the dimmer member of the pair in front of the brighter star. The concept that an eclipsing body caused these luminosity variations was introduced by John Goodricke in 1783.

<doc id="9771" wikidata="Q283992" url="?curid=9771" title="Ed (software)">
<text> (pronounced as distinct letters, ) is a line editor for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It was one of the first parts of the Unix operating system that was developed, in August 1969. It remains part of the POSIX and Open Group standards for Unix-based operating systems, alongside the more sophisticated full-screen editor vi.

== History and influence ==
The ed text editor was one of the first three key elements of the Unix operating system—assembler, editor, and shell—developed by Ken Thompson in August 1969 on a PDP-7 at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. Many features of ed came from the qed text editor developed at Thompson&#x27;s alma mater University of California, Berkeley. Thompson was very familiar with qed, and had reimplemented it on the CTSS and Multics systems. Thompson&#x27;s versions of qed were notable as the first to implement regular expressions. Regular expressions are also implemented in ed, though their implementation is considerably less general than that in qed.

Dennis M. Ritchie produced what Doug McIlroy later described as the &quot;definitive&quot; ed, and aspects of ed went on to influence ex, which in turn spawned vi. The non-interactive Unix command grep was inspired by a common special use of qed and later ed, where the command codice_1 performs a global regular expression search and prints the lines containing matches. The Unix stream editor, sed implemented many of the scripting features of qed that were not supported by ed on Unix.

== Features ==
Features of ed include:
* available on essentially all Unix systems (and mandatory on systems conforming to the Single Unix Specification).
* support for regular expressions
* powerful automation can be achieved by feeding commands from standard input

Known for its terseness, ed, compatible with teletype terminals like Teletype Model 33, gives almost no visual feedback, and has been called (by Peter H. Salus) &quot;the most user-hostile editor ever created&quot;, even when compared to the contemporary (and notoriously complex) TECO. For example, the message that ed will produce in case of error, &quot;and&quot; when it wants to make sure the user wishes to quit without saving, is &quot;?&quot;. It does not report the current filename or line number, or even display the results of a change to the text, unless requested. Older versions (c. 1981) did not even ask for confirmation when a quit command was issued without the user saving changes. This terseness was appropriate in the early versions of Unix, when consoles were teletypes, modems were slow, and memory was precious. As computer technology improved and these constraints were loosened, editors with more visual feedback became the norm.

In current practice, ed is rarely used interactively, but does find use in some shell scripts. For interactive use, ed was subsumed by the sam, vi and Emacs editors in the 1980s. ed can be found on virtually every version of Unix and Linux available, and as such is useful for people who have to work with multiple versions of Unix. On Unix-based operating systems, some utilities like SQL*Plus run ed as the editor if the EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables are not defined. If something goes wrong, ed is sometimes the only editor available. This is often the only time when it is used interactively.

The version of ed provided by GNU has a few switches to enhance the feedback. Using provides a simple prompt and enables more useful feedback messages. The switch is defined in POSIX since XPG2 (1987).

The ed commands are often imitated in other line-based editors. For example, EDLIN in early MS-DOS versions and 32-bit versions of Windows NT has a somewhat similar syntax, and text editors in many MUDs (LPMud and descendants, for example) use ed-like syntax. These editors, however, are typically more limited in function.

== Example ==
Here is an example transcript of an ed session. For clarity, commands and text typed by the user are in normal face, and output from ed is emphasized.

 a
 This is line number two.
 2i&lt;br&gt;
 ,l
 ed is the standard Unix text editor.$
 This is line number two.$
 w text.txt
 63
 ,l
 ed is the standard Unix text editor.$
 This is line number three.$
 w text.txt
 65
 q

The end result is a simple text file codice_2 containing the following text:

 ed is the standard Unix text editor.&lt;br&gt;
 This is line number three.

Started with an empty file, the codice_3 command appends text (all ed commands are single letters). The command puts ed in &quot;insert mode&quot;, inserting the characters that follow and is terminated by a single dot on a line. The two lines that are entered before the dot end up in the file buffer. The codice_4 command also goes into insert mode, and will insert the entered text (a single empty line in our case) before line two. All commands may be prefixed by a line number to operate on that line.

In the line codice_5, the lowercase L stands for the list command. The command is prefixed by a range, in this case codice_6 which is a shortcut for codice_7. A range is two line numbers separated by a comma (codice_8 means the last line). In return, ed lists all lines, from first to last. These lines are ended with dollar signs, so that white space at the end of lines is clearly visible.

Once the empty line is inserted in line 2, the line which reads &quot;This is line number two.&quot; is now actually the third line. This error is corrected with , a substitution command. The codice_9 will apply it to the correct line; following the command is the text to be replaced, and then the replacement. Listing all lines with codice_5 the line is shown now to be correct.

codice_11 writes the buffer to the file codice_2 making ed respond with &quot;65&quot;, the number of characters written to the file. codice_13 will end an ed session.

== Cultural references ==
The GNU Project has numerous jokes around ed hosted on its website. In addition, the glibc documentation notes an error code called with its description (errorstr) merely a single question mark, noting &quot;the experienced user will know what is wrong.&quot;

<doc id="9772" wikidata="Q648402" url="?curid=9772" title="Edlin">
<text>Edlin is a line editor, and the only text editor provided with early versions of IBM PC DOS, MS-DOS and OS/2. Although superseded in MS-DOS 5.0 and later by the full-screen MS-DOS Editor, and by Notepad in Microsoft Windows, it continues to be included in the 32-bit versions of current Microsoft operating systems.

==History==
Edlin was created by Tim Paterson in two weeks in 1980, for Seattle Computer Products&#x27;s 86-DOS (QDOS) based on the CP/M context editor &quot;ED&quot;, itself distantly inspired by the DEC PDP-10 TOPS-10 EDIT text editor.

Microsoft acquired 86-DOS and, after some further development, sold it as MS-DOS, so Edlin was included in v1.0–v5.0 of MS-DOS. From MS-DOS 6 onwards, the only editor included was the new full-screen MS-DOS Editor. 

Windows 95, 98 and ME ran on top of an embedded version of DOS, which reports itself as MS-DOS 7. As a successor to MS-DOS 6, this did not include Edlin. 

However, Edlin is included in the 32-bit versions of Windows NT and its derivatives—up to and including Windows 10—because the NTVDM&#x27;s DOS support in those operating systems is based on MS-DOS version 5.0. However, unlike most other external DOS commands, it has not been transformed into a native Win32 program. It also does not support long filenames, which were not added to MS-DOS and Windows until long after Edlin was written.

The FreeDOS version was developed by Gregory Pietsch.

==Usage==
There are only a few commands. The short list can be found by entering a ? at the edlin prompt.

When a file is open, typing L lists the contents (e.g., codice_1 lists lines 1 through 6). Each line is displayed with a line number in front of it.

 *1,6L
 1: Edlin: The only text editor in early versions of DOS.
 2:
 3: Back in the day, I remember seeing web pages
 4: branded with a logo at the bottom:
 5: &quot;This page created in edlin.&quot;
 6: The things that some people put themselves through. ;-)

The currently selected line has a *. To replace the contents of any line, the line number is entered and any text entered replaces the original. While editing a line pressing Ctrl-C cancels any changes. The * marker remains on that line.

Entering I (optionally preceded with a line number) inserts one or more lines before the * line or the line given. When finished entering lines, Ctrl-C returns to the edlin command prompt.

 *6I
 6:*(...or similar)
 7:*^C 
 *7D
 *L
 1: Edlin: The only text editor in early versions of DOS.
 2:
 3: Back in the day, I remember seeing web pages
 4: branded with a logo at the bottom:
 5: &quot;This page created in edlin.&quot;
 6: (...or similar)

:i - Inserts lines of text.
:D - deletes the specified line, again optionally starting with the number of a line, or a range of lines. E.g.: codice_2 deletes lines 2 through 4. In the above example, line 7 was deleted.

:R - is used to replace all occurrences of a piece of text in a given range of lines, for example, to replace a spelling error. Including the ? prompts for each change. E.g.: To replace &#x27;prit&#x27; with &#x27;print&#x27; and to prompt for each change: codice_3 (the ^Z represents pressing CTRL-Z). It is case-sensitive.

:S - searches for given text. It is used in the same way as replace, but without the replacement text. A search for &#x27;apple&#x27; in the first 20 lines of a file is typed codice_4 (no space, unless that is part of the search) followed by a press of enter. For each match, it asks if it is the correct one, and accepts n or y (or Enter).

:P - displays a listing of a range of lines. If no range is specified, P displays the complete file from the * to the end. This is different from L in that P changes the current line to be the last line in the range.

:T - transfers another file into the one being edited, with this syntax: [line to insert at]t[full path to file].

:W - (write) saves the file.

:E - saves the file and quits edlin.

:Q - quits edlin without saving.

===Scripts===
Edlin may be used as a non-interactive file editor in scripts by redirecting a series of edlin commands.

 edlin &lt; script

===FreeDOS Edlin===
A GPL-licensed clone of Edlin that includes long filename support is available for download as part of the FreeDOS project. This runs on operating systems such as Linux or Unix as well as MS-DOS.

<doc id="9773" wikidata="Q627945" url="?curid=9773" title="EBCDIC">
<text>Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC; ) is an eight-bit character encoding used mainly on IBM mainframe and IBM midrange computer operating systems. It descended from the code used with punched cards and the corresponding six-bit binary-coded decimal code used with most of IBM&#x27;s computer peripherals of the late 1950s and early 1960s. It is supported by various non-IBM platforms, such as Fujitsu-Siemens&#x27; BS2000/OSD, OS-IV, MSP, and MSP-EX, the SDS Sigma series, Unisys VS/9, Unisys MCP and ICL VME.

== History ==

EBCDIC was devised in 1963 and 1964 by IBM and was announced with the release of the IBM System/360 line of mainframe computers. It is an eight-bit character encoding, developed separately from the seven-bit ASCII encoding scheme. It was created to extend the existing Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) Interchange Code, or BCDIC, which itself was devised as an efficient means of encoding the two &quot;zone&quot; and &quot;number&quot; punches on punched cards into six bits. The distinct encoding of &#x27;s&#x27; and &#x27;S&#x27; (using position 2 instead of 1) was maintained from punched cards where it was desirable not to have hole punches too close to each other to ensure the integrity of the physical card.

While IBM was a chief proponent of the ASCII standardization committee, the company did not have time to prepare ASCII peripherals (such as card punch machines) to ship with its System/360 computers, so the company settled on EBCDIC. The System/360 became wildly successful, together with clones such as RCA Spectra 70, ICL System 4, and Fujitsu FACOM, thus so did EBCDIC.

All IBM&#x27;s mainframe operating systems, and its IBM i operating system for midrange computers, use EBCDIC as their inherent encoding (with toleration for ASCII, for example, ISPF in z/OS can browse and edit both EBCDIC and ASCII encoded files). Software can translate to and from encodings, and modern mainframes (such as IBM Z) include processor instructions, at the hardware level, to accelerate translation between character sets. Modern z/OS compilers for the C and C++ languages on IBM Z mainframes, and earlier OS/390 C and C++ compilers on IBM System/390 mainframes, support a POSIX-compatible execution environment that makes use of ASCII by default.

Not all operating systems running on IBM hardware use EBCDIC; IBM AIX, Linux on IBM Z, and Linux on Power all use ASCII, as do all operating systems that run on the IBM Personal Computer and its successors.

== Compatibility with ASCII ==

There were numerous difficulties to writing software that would work in both ASCII and EBCDIC.
* The gaps between letters made simple code that worked in ASCII fail on EBCDIC. For example would print the alphabet from A to Z if ASCII is used, but print 41 characters (including a number of unassigned ones) in EBCDIC.
* Sorting EBCDIC put lowercase letters before uppercase letters and letters before numbers, exactly the opposite of ASCII.
* Most programming languages and file formats and network protocols designed for ASCII used available punctuation marks (such as the curly braces and ) that did not exist in EBCDIC, making translation to EBCDIC systems difficult. Workarounds such as trigraphs were used. Conversely EBCDIC had a few characters such as (US cent) that were used on IBM systems and could not be translated to ASCII.
* The most common newline convention used with EBCDIC is to use a NEL (NEXT LINE) code between lines. Converters to other encodings often replace NEL with LF or CR/LF, even if there is a NEL in the target encoding. This causes the LF and NEL to translate to the same character and be unable to be distinguished.
* If seven-bit ASCII was used, there was an &quot;unused&quot; high bit in 8-bit bytes, and many pieces of software stored other information there. Software would also pack the seven bits and discard the eighth, such as packing five seven-bit ASCII characters in a 36-bit word. On the PDP-11, bytes with the high bit set were treated as negative numbers, behavior that was copied to C, causing unexpected problems if the high bit was set. These all made it difficult to switch from ASCII to the 8-bit EBCDIC (and also made it difficult to switch to 8-bit extended ASCII encodings).

== Code page layout ==
There are hundreds of EBCDIC code pages based on the original EBCDIC character encoding; there are a variety of EBCDIC code pages intended for use in different parts of the world, including code pages for non-Latin scripts such as Chinese, Japanese (e.g., EBCDIC 930, JEF, and KEIS), Korean, and Greek (EBCDIC 875). There is also a huge number of variations with the letters swapped around for no discernible reason.

The table below shows the &quot;invariant subset&quot; of EBCDIC, which are characters that &quot;should&quot; have the same assignments on all EBCDIC code pages that use the Latin alphabet. (This includes most of the ISO/IEC 646 invariant repertoire, except the exclamation mark.) It also shows (in gray) missing ASCII and EBCDIC punctuation, located where they are in Code Page 37 (one of the code page variants of EBCDIC). The blank cells are filled with region-specific characters in the variants, but the characters in gray are often swapped around or replaced as well. Like ASCII, the invariant subset works only for languages using the ISO basic Latin alphabet, such as English (excluding loanwords and some uncommon orthographic variations) and Dutch (if the &quot;ĳ&quot; and &quot;Ĳ&quot; ligatures are written as two characters).

== Definitions of non-ASCII EBCDIC controls ==
Following are the definitions of EBCDIC control characters which either do not map onto the ASCII control characters, or have additional uses. When mapped to Unicode, these are mostly mapped to C1 control character codepoints in a manner specified by IBM&#x27;s Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA).

Although the default mapping of New Line (NL) corresponds to the ISO/IEC 6429 Next Line (NEL) character (the behaviour of which is also specified, but not required, in Unicode Annex 14), most of these C1-mapped controls match neither those in the ISO/IEC 6429 C1 set, nor those in other registered C1 control sets such as ISO 6630. Although this effectively makes the non-ASCII EBCDIC controls a unique C1 control set, they are not among the C1 control sets registered in the ISO-IR registry, meaning that they do not have an assigned control set designation sequence (as specified by ISO/IEC 2022, and optionally permitted in ISO/IEC 10646 (Unicode)).

Besides U+0085 (Next Line), the Unicode Standard does not prescribe an interpretation of C1 control characters, leaving their interpretation to higher level protocols (it suggests, but does not require, their ISO/IEC 6429 interpretations in the absence of use for other purposes), so this mapping is permissible in, but not specified by, Unicode.
== Code pages with Latin-1 character sets ==
The following code pages have the full Latin-1 character set (ISO/IEC 8859-1). The first column gives the original code page number. The second column gives the number of the code page updated with the euro sign (€) replacing the universal currency sign (¤) (or in the case of EBCDIC 924, with the set changed to match ISO 8859-15)

Different countries have different code pages because these code pages originated as code pages with country-specific character repertoires, and were later expanded to contain the entire ISO 8859-1 repertoire, meaning that a given ISO 8859-1 character may have different code point values in different code pages. They are known as Country Extended Code Pages (CECPs).

== Criticism and humor ==

Open-source software advocate and software developer Eric S. Raymond writes in his &quot;Jargon File&quot; that EBCDIC was loathed by hackers, by which he meant members of a subculture of enthusiastic programmers. The Jargon File 4.4.7 gives the following definition:
EBCDIC design was also the source of many jokes. One such joke, found in the Unix fortune file of 4.3BSD Reno (1990) went:
References to the EBCDIC character set are made in the 1979 computer game series &quot;Zork&quot;. In the &quot;Machine Room&quot; in &quot;Zork II&quot;, EBCDIC is used to imply an incomprehensible language:
In 2021, it became public that a Belgian bank was still using EBCDIC internally in 2019. A customer insisted that the correct spelling of his surname included an umlaut, which the bank omitted, and the customer filed a complaint citing the guarantee in the General Data Protection Regulation of the right to timely &quot;rectification of inaccurate personal data.&quot; The bank&#x27;s argument included the fact that their system used EBCDIC, as well as that it did not support letters with diacritics (or lower case, for that matter). The appeals court ruled in favor of the customer.

<text>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a part of a transportation system of the eukaryotic cell, and has many other important functions such as protein folding. The word endoplasmic means &quot;within the cytoplasm&quot;, and reticulum is Latin for &quot;little net&quot;. It is a type of organelle made up of two subunits – rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). The endoplasmic reticulum is found in most eukaryotic cells and forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs known as cisternae (in the RER), and tubular structures in the SER. The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane. The endoplasmic reticulum is not found in red blood cells, or spermatozoa.

There are two types of ER that share many of the same proteins and engage in certain common activities such as the synthesis of certain lipids and cholesterol. Different types of cells contain different ratios of the two types of ER depending on the activities of the cell. RER is found mainly toward the nucleus of the cell and SER towards the cell membrane or plasma membrane of cell.

The outer (cytosolic) face of the RER is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis. The RER is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes. The SER lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid synthesis but not metabolism, the production of steroid hormones, and detoxification. The SER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells.

The ER was observed by light microscopy by Garnier in 1897, who coined the term &quot;ergastoplasm&quot;. The lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen by electron microscopy in 1945 by Keith R. Porter, Albert Claude, and Ernest F. Fullam.

== Structure ==
The general structure of the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes called cisternae. These sac-like structures are held together by the cytoskeleton. The phospholipid membrane encloses the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the perinuclear space but separate from the cytosol. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function. The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell. Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes. Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.

===Rough endoplasmic reticulum===

The surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (often abbreviated &quot;RER&quot; or &quot;rough ER&quot;; also called &quot;granular endoplasmic reticulum&quot;) is studded with protein-manufacturing ribosomes giving it a &quot;rough&quot; appearance (hence its name). The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the translocon. However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelle&#x27;s structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol. This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins translating the mRNA of a protein destined for the secretory pathway. The first 5–30 amino acids polymerized encode a signal peptide, a molecular message that is recognized and bound by a signal recognition particle (SRP). Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER translocon where translation continues with the nascent (new) protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme (a signal peptidase), which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.

The membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is in the form of large double-membrane sheets that are located near, and continuous with, the outer layer of the nuclear envelope. The double membrane sheets are stacked and connected through several right- or left-handed helical ramps, the &quot;Terasaki ramps&quot;, giving rise to a structure resembling a parking garage. Although there is no continuous membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, membrane-bound transport vesicles shuttle proteins between these two compartments. Vesicles are surrounded by coating proteins called COPI and COPII. COPII targets vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and COPI marks them to be brought back to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum works in concert with the Golgi complex to target new proteins to their proper destinations. The second method of transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum involves areas called membrane contact sites, where the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles are held closely together, allowing the transfer of lipids and other small molecules.

The rough endoplasmic reticulum is key in multiple functions:
* Manufacture of lysosomal enzymes with a mannose-6-phosphate marker added in the &quot;cis&quot;-Golgi network.
* Manufacture of secreted proteins, either secreted constitutively with no tag or secreted in a regulatory manner involving clathrin and paired basic amino acids in the signal peptide.
* Integral membrane proteins that stay embedded in the membrane as vesicles exit and bind to new membranes. Rab proteins are key in targeting the membrane; SNAP and SNARE proteins are key in the fusion event.
* Initial glycosylation as assembly continues. This is N-linked (O-linking occurs in the Golgi).
** N-linked glycosylation: If the protein is properly folded, oligosaccharyltransferase recognizes the AA sequence NXS or NXT (with the S/T residue phosphorylated) and adds a 14-sugar backbone (2-&quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine, 9-branching mannose, and 3-glucose at the end) to the side-chain nitrogen of Asn.

===Smooth endoplasmic reticulum===
In most cells the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (abbreviated SER) is scarce. Instead there are areas where the ER is partly smooth and partly rough, this area is called the transitional ER. The transitional ER gets its name because it contains ER exit sites. These are areas where the transport vesicles which contain lipids and proteins made in the ER, detach from the ER and start moving to the Golgi apparatus. Specialized cells can have a lot of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and in these cells the smooth ER has many functions. It synthesizes lipids, phospholipids, and steroids. Cells which secrete these products, such as those in the testes, ovaries, and sebaceous glands have an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. It also carries out the metabolism of carbohydrates, detoxification of natural metabolism products and of alcohol and drugs, attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins, and steroid metabolism. In muscle cells, it regulates calcium ion concentration. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in a variety of cell types (both animal and plant), and it serves different functions in each. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum also contains the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, a step in gluconeogenesis. It is connected to the nuclear envelope and consists of tubules that are located near the cell periphery. These tubes sometimes branch forming a network that is reticular in appearance. In some cells, there are dilated areas like the sacs of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The network of smooth endoplasmic reticulum allows for an increased surface area to be devoted to the action or storage of key enzymes and the products of these enzymes.

==== Sarcoplasmic reticulum ====


The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), from the Greek σάρξ &quot;sarx&quot; (&quot;flesh&quot;), is smooth ER found in muscle cells. The only structural difference between this organelle and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the composition of proteins they have, both bound to their membranes and drifting within the confines of their lumens. This fundamental difference is indicative of their functions: The endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes molecules, while the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium ions and pumps them out into the sarcoplasm when the muscle fiber is stimulated. After their release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, calcium ions interact with contractile proteins that utilize ATP to shorten the muscle fiber. The sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in excitation-contraction coupling.

==Functions==
The endoplasmic reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and the transport of synthesized proteins in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. Rough endoplasmic reticulum is also involved in protein synthesis. Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylprolyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus – unfolded proteins cause an unfolded protein response as a stress response in the ER. Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection or the over-expression of proteins can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ER stress), a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading to an increase in unfolded proteins. This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.

===Protein transport===
Secretory proteins, mostly glycoproteins, are moved across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a signal sequence. The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few amino acids that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the translocon, a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.

The endoplasmic reticulum is also part of a protein sorting pathway. It is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell. The majority of its resident proteins are retained within it through a retention motif. This motif is composed of four amino acids at the end of the protein sequence. The most common retention sequences are KDEL for lumen-located proteins and KKXX for transmembrane proteins. However, variations of KDEL and KKXX do occur, and other sequences can also give rise to endoplasmic reticulum retention. It is not known whether such variation can lead to sub-ER localizations. There are three KDEL (1, 2 and 3) receptors in mammalian cells, and they have a very high degree of sequence identity. The functional differences between these receptors remain to be established.

===Bioenergetics regulation of ER ATP supply by a CaATiER mechanism===

The endoplasmic reticulum does not harbor an ATP-regeneration machinery, and therefore requires ATP import from mitochondria. The imported ATP is vital for the ER to carry out its house keeping cellular functions, such as for protein folding and trafficking.

The ER ATP transporter, SLC35B1/AXER, was recently cloned and characterized, and the mitochondria supply ATP to the ER through a &quot;Ca2+-antagonized transport into the ER&quot; (&quot;CaATiER&quot;) mechanism. The &quot;CaATiER&quot; mechanism shows sensitivity to cytosolic Ca2+ ranging from high nM to low μM range, with the Ca2+-sensing element yet to be identified and validated.

==Clinical significance==
Increased and supraphysiological ER stress in pancreatic β cells disrupts normal insulin secretion, leading to hyperinsulinemia and consequently peripheral insulin resistance associated with obesity in humans. Human clinical trials also suggested a causal link between obesity-induced increase in insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance.

Abnormalities in XBP1 lead to a heightened endoplasmic reticulum stress response and subsequently causes a higher susceptibility for inflammatory processes that may even contribute to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In the colon, XBP1 anomalies have been linked to the inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn&#x27;s disease.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR is activated in response to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR functions to restore normal function of the cell by halting protein translation, degrading misfolded proteins, and activating the signaling pathways that lead to increasing the production of molecular chaperones involved in protein folding. Sustained overactivation of the UPR has been implicated in prion diseases as well as several other neurodegenerative diseases and the inhibition of the UPR could become a treatment for those diseases.

<doc id="9778" wikidata="Q2159918" url="?curid=9778" title="Executive Order 9066">
<text>Executive Order 9066 was a United States presidential executive order signed and issued during World War II by United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942. &quot;This order authorized the forced removal of all persons deemed a threat to national security from the West Coast to &#x27;relocation centers&#x27; further inland—resulting in the incarceration of Japanese Americans.&quot; Two-thirds of the 125,000 people displaced were U.S. citizens.

Notably, far more Americans of Asian descent were forcibly interned than Americans of European descent, both in total and as a share of their relative populations. German and Italian Americans who were sent to internment camps during the war were sent under the provisions of Presidential Proclamation 2526 and the Alien Enemy Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798.

==Transcript of Executive Order 9066==
The text of Executive Order 9066 was as follows:

==Background to the Order==
Originating from a proclamation that was signed on the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, December 7, 1941, Executive Order 9066 was enacted by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to strictly regulate the actions of Japanese Americans in the United States. At this point, Japanese Americans were not allowed to apply for citizenship in the United States, despite having lived in the United States for generations. This proclamation declared all Japanese American adults as the &quot;alien enemy,&quot; resulting in strict travel bans and mass xenophobia toward Asian Americans. Tensions rose in the United States, ultimately causing President Roosevelt to sign Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942.

The Order was consistent with Roosevelt&#x27;s long-time racial views toward Japanese Americans. During the 1920s, for example, he had written articles in the &quot;Macon Telegraph&quot; opposing white-Japanese intermarriage for fostering &quot;the mingling of Asiatic blood with European or American blood&quot; and praising California&#x27;s ban on land ownership by the first-generation Japanese. In 1936, while president he privately wrote that, in regard to contacts between Japanese sailors and the local Japanese American population in the event of war, &quot;every Japanese citizen or non-citizen on the Island of Oahu who meets these Japanese ships or has any connection with their officers or men should be secretly but definitely identified and his or her name placed on a special list of those who would be the first to be placed in a concentration camp.&quot; In addition, during the crucial period after Pearl Harbor the president had failed to speak out for the rights of Japanese Americans despite the urgings of advisors such as John Franklin Carter. During the same period, Roosevelt rejected the recommendations of Attorney General Francis Biddle and other top advisors, who opposed the incarceration of Japanese Americans.

==Exclusion under the Order==
The text of Roosevelt&#x27;s order did not use the terms &quot;Japanese&quot; or &quot;Japanese Americans,&quot; instead giving officials broad power to exclude &quot;any or all persons&quot; from a designated area. (The lack of a specific mention of Japanese or Japanese Americans also characterized Public Law 77-503, which Roosevelt signed on March 21, 1942, to enforce the order.) Nevertheless, EO 9066 was intended to be applied almost solely to persons of Japanese descent. Notably, in a 1943 letter, Attorney General Francis Biddle reminded Roosevelt that &quot;You signed the original Executive Order permitting the exclusions so the Army could handle the Japs. It was never intended to apply to Italians and Germans.&quot;

Public Law 77-50 was approved (after only an hour of discussion in the Senate and thirty minutes in the House) in order to provide for the enforcement of the executive order. Authored by War Department official Karl Bendetsen—who would later be promoted to Director of the Wartime Civilian Control Administration and oversee the incarceration of Japanese Americans—the law made violations of military orders a misdemeanor punishable by up to $5,000 in fines and one year in prison.

Using a broad interpretation of EO 9066, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt issued orders declaring certain areas of the western United States as zones of exclusion under the Executive Order. In contrast to EO 9066, the text of these orders specified &quot;all people of Japanese ancestry.&quot; As a result, approximately 112,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry were evicted from the West Coast of the continental United States and held in American relocation camps and other confinement sites across the country.

Roosevelt hoped to establish concentration camps for Japanese Americans in Hawaii even after he signed Executive Order 9066. On February 26, 1942, he informed Secretary of the Navy Knox that he had &quot;long felt most of the Japanese should be removed from Oahu to one of the other islands.&quot; Nevertheless, the tremendous cost, including the diversion of ships from the front lines, as well as the quiet resistance of the local military commander General Delos Emmons, made this proposal impractical, resulting in Japanese Americans in Hawaii never being incarcerated &quot;en masse&quot;. Although the Japanese-American population in Hawaii was nearly 40% of the population of the territory and Hawaii would have been first in line for a Japanese attack, only a few thousand people were temporarily detained there. This fact supported the government&#x27;s eventual conclusion that the mass removal of ethnic Japanese from the West Coast was motivated by reasons other than &quot;military necessity.&quot;

Japanese Americans and other Asians in the U.S. had suffered for decades from prejudice and racially motivated fears. Racially discriminatory laws prevented Asian Americans from owning land, voting, testifying against whites in court, and set up other restrictions. Additionally, the FBI, Office of Naval Intelligence and Military Intelligence Division had been conducting surveillance on Japanese-American communities in Hawaii and the continental U.S. from the early 1930s. In early 1941, President Roosevelt secretly commissioned a study to assess the possibility that Japanese Americans would pose a threat to U.S. security. The report, submitted one month before the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, predicted that in the event of war, &quot;There will be no armed uprising of Japanese&quot; in the United States. &quot;For the most part,&quot; the Munson Report said, &quot;the local Japanese are loyal to the United States or, at worst, hope that by remaining quiet they can avoid concentration camps or irresponsible mobs.&quot; A second investigation started in 1940, written by Naval Intelligence officer Kenneth Ringle and submitted in January 1942, likewise found no evidence of fifth column activity and urged against mass incarceration. Both were ignored by military and political leaders.

Over two-thirds of the people of Japanese ethnicity who were incarcerated were American citizens; many of the rest had lived in the country between 20 and 40 years. As a result, most Japanese Americans, particularly the first generation born in the United States (the &quot;Nisei&quot;), identified as loyal to the United States of America. In addition, no Japanese-American citizen or Japanese national residing in the United States was ever found guilty of sabotage or espionage.

There were 10 of these internment camps across the United States, euphemistically called &quot;relocation centers&quot;. There were two in Arkansas, two in Arizona, two in California, one in Idaho, one in Utah, one in Wyoming, and one in Colorado.

==World War II camps under the Order==
Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson was responsible for assisting relocated people with transport, food, shelter, and other accommodations and delegated Colonel Karl Bendetsen to administer the removal of West Coast Japanese. Over the spring of 1942, General John L. DeWitt issued Western Defense Command orders for Japanese Americans to present themselves for removal. The &quot;evacuees&quot; were taken first to temporary assembly centers, requisitioned fairgrounds and horse racing tracks where living quarters were often converted livestock stalls. As construction on the more permanent and isolated War Relocation Authority camps was completed, the population was transferred by truck or train. These accommodations consisted of tar paper-walled frame buildings in parts of the country with bitter winters and often hot summers. The camps were guarded by armed soldiers and fenced with barbed wire (security measures not shown in published photographs of the camps). Camps held up to 18,000 people, and were small cities, with medical care, food, and education provided by the government. Adults were offered &quot;camp jobs&quot; with wages of $12 to $19 per month, and many camp services such as medical care and education were provided by the camp inmates themselves.

Not only was there limited room for living but, &quot;Living in cramped barracks with minimal privacy and inadequate facilities. The camp&#x27;s location in Utah&#x27;s desert meant extreme temperatures and harsh weather, making daily life even more challenging.&quot; Based on the evidence listed, it is proven that these camps held poor living conditions for those relocated. On top of that children had to undergo education in these barracks as well as buildings for religion, all of these conditions add to the unpleasant way of life.

==Termination, apology, and redress==

In 1943 and 1944, Roosevelt did not release those incarcerated in the camps despite the urgings of Attorney General Francis Biddle, Secretary of Interior Harold L. Ickes. Ickes blamed the president&#x27;s failure to act on his need to win California in a potentially close election. In December 1944, Roosevelt suspended the Executive Order after the Supreme Court decision &quot;Ex parte Endo&quot;. Detainees were released, often to resettlement facilities and temporary housing, and the camps were shut down by 1946.

On February 19, 1976, President Gerald Ford signed a proclamation formally terminating Executive Order 9066 and apologizing for the internment, stated: &quot;We now know what we should have known then—not only was that evacuation wrong but Japanese Americans were and are loyal Americans. On the battlefield and at home the names of Japanese Americans have been and continue to be written in history for the sacrifices and the contributions they have made to the well-being and to the security of this, our common Nation.&quot;

In 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed legislation to create the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC). The CWRIC was appointed to conduct an official governmental study of Executive Order 9066, related wartime orders, and their effects on Japanese Americans in the West and Alaska Natives in the Pribilof Islands.

In December 1982, the CWRIC issued its findings in &quot;Personal Justice Denied&quot;, concluding that the incarceration of Japanese Americans had not been justified by military necessity. The report determined that the decision to incarcerate was based on &quot;race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership&quot;. The Commission recommended legislative remedies consisting of an official Government apology and redress payments of $20,000 to each of the survivors; a public education fund was set up to help ensure that this would not happen again ().

On August 10, 1988, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, based on the CWRIC recommendations, was signed into law by Ronald Reagan. On November 21, 1989, George H. W. Bush signed an appropriation bill authorizing payments to be paid out between 1990 and 1998. In 1990, surviving internees began to receive individual redress payments and a letter of apology. This bill applied to the Japanese Americans and to members of the Aleut people inhabiting the strategic Aleutian islands in Alaska who had also been relocated.

== Life after the camps ==
In the years after the war, the interned Japanese Americans had to rebuild their lives after having suffered heavy personal losses. United States citizens and long-time residents who had been incarcerated lost their liberties. Many also lost their homes, businesses, property, and savings. Individuals born in Japan were not allowed to become naturalized US citizens until after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which canceled the Immigration Act of 1924 and reinstated the legality of immigration from Japan into the US.

Many Japanese Americans hoped they would be going back to their homes, but soon realized that all of their possessions that they could carry with them were seized by the government. In place of their homes, the Federal government provided trailers in some areas for returning Japanese Americans. The populous Asian American community prior to the incarceration drastically decreased as many felt there was no life to go back to, choosing to start over somewhere else. With the residual effects of being incarcerated without committing a crime, the Japanese American community experienced strong trauma and continuing racism from their fellow Americans. Though they did receive redress of $20,000 per surviving incarcerate, many Japanese Americans feared increased xenophobia and a minimizing of the trauma that the Japanese community endured during the WWII incarceration. Managing the wrongs committed to their community, Japanese Americans slowly managed to overcome their community&#x27;s criminalization and incarceration and came to recognize February 19, the day President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, as a National Day of Remembrance for Americans to reflect on the events that took place.

== Court challenges ==

=== Korematsu v. United States ===
After the signing of Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, all Japanese Americans were required to be removed from their homes and moved into military camps as a matter of national security. Fred Korematsu, 23 at the time, was someone who elected not to comply, unlike his parents who left their home and flower nursery behind. Instead, Korematsu had plastic surgery to alter the appearance of his eyes and changed his name to Clyde Sarah, claiming Spanish and Hawaiian heritage. Six months later, on May 30, Korematsu was arrested for violating the order, leading to a trial in a San Francisco Federal Court. His case was presented by the American Civil Liberties Union, which attempted to challenge whether this order was constitutional or not. After losing the case, Korematsu appealed the decision all the way to the Supreme Court, where in a 6–3 decision, the order remained for reason of &quot;military necessity.&quot;

=== Hirabayashi v. United States ===

Included in FDR&#x27;s order was a curfew starting at 8pm and ended at 6 am for all those of Japanese descent. University of Washington student, Gordon Hirabayashi, refused to abide by the order in an act of civil disobedience, resulting in his arrest. Similar to Korematsu&#x27;s case, it was appealed and up to the Supreme Court. It was held by the Supreme Court in a unanimous decision that his arrest was constitutional on the basis of military necessity. He was sentenced six months in prison as a result of his civil disobedience.

=== Yasui v. United States ===

Earning his JD in 1939 from the University of Oregon, Minoru Yasui was the first Japanese American attorney admitted to the state of Oregon&#x27;s bar. He began working as a consulate in Chicago for the Japanese government, but resigned shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Returning to Oregon, where he was born, he tried to join the US Army but was denied. He was arrested in December 1941 for violating the military curfew, leading to his arrest and freezing of his assets. Looking to test the constitutionality of the curfew, Yasui turned himself into the police station as 11pm, five hours past the curfew. Yasui was found guilty of violating this curfew and was fined $5000 for not being a US citizen, despite being born in Oregon. He served a one-year prison sentence. Yasui appealed his case up to the Supreme Court, where it was held that the curfew was constitutional based on military necessity.

=== Reopening and justice ===
In 1983, Peter Irons and Aiko Herzig-Yoshinaga discovered crucial evidence that allowed for them to petition to reopen the Korematsu case. The evidence was a copy of Lieutenant Commander K.D. Ringle&#x27;s original report by the US Navy, which had not been destroyed. The report was in response to the question of Japanese loyalty to the US. It was stated in the report that Japanese Americans did not truly pose a threat to the US government, showing that the passage of Executive Order 9066 was entirely based on the false pretense that Japanese Americans were &quot;enemy aliens.&quot; This new found evidence was a document that failed to be destroyed by the US government in which included government intelligence agencies citing that Japanese Americans posed no military threat. The cases of Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and Yasui were reopened and overturned on the basis of government misconduct on November 10, 1983. In 2010, the state of California passed a bill that would name January 30 Fred Korematsu Day, making this the first day to be named after an Asian American. Korematsu v. United States was officially overturned in 2018, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor, describing the case as &quot;gravely wrong the day it was decided.&quot;

== Legacy ==
February 19, the anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066, is now the Day of Remembrance, an annual commemoration of the unjust incarceration of the Japanese-American community. In 2017, the Smithsonian launched an exhibit about these events with artwork by Roger Shimomura. It provides context and interprets the treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II. In February 2022, for the 80th anniversary of the signing of the order, supporters lobbied to pass the Amache National Historic Site Act historical designation for the Granada War Relocation Center in Colorado.

<doc id="9779" wikidata="Q41406" url="?curid=9779" title="Edvard Munch">
<text>Edvard Munch ( ; ; 12 December 1863 – 23 January 1944) was a Norwegian painter. His 1893 work &quot;The Scream&quot; has become one of Western art&#x27;s most acclaimed images.

His childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family. Studying at the Royal School of Art and Design in Kristiania (Oslo), Munch began to live a bohemian life under the influence of the nihilist Hans Jæger, who urged him to paint his own emotional and psychological state (&#x27;soul painting&#x27;); from this emerged his distinctive style.

Travel brought new influences and outlets. In Paris, he learned much from Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, especially their use of color. In Berlin, he met the Swedish dramatist August Strindberg, whom he painted, as he embarked on a major series of paintings he would later call &quot;The Frieze of Life&quot;, depicting a series of deeply-felt themes such as love, anxiety, jealousy and betrayal, steeped in atmosphere.

&quot;The Scream&quot; was conceived in Kristiania. According to Munch, he was out walking at sunset, when he &#x27;heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature&#x27;. The painting&#x27;s agonized face is widely identified with the &quot;angst&quot; of the modern person. Between 1893 and 1910, he made two painted versions and two in pastels, as well as a number of prints. One of the pastels would eventually command the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction.

As his fame and wealth grew, his emotional state remained insecure. He briefly considered marriage, but could not commit himself. A mental breakdown in 1908 forced him to give up heavy drinking, and he was cheered by his increasing acceptance by the people of Kristiania and exposure in the city&#x27;s museums. His later years were spent working in peace and privacy. Although his works were banned in Nazi-occupied Europe, most of them survived World War II, securing him a legacy.

==Life==
=== Childhood ===
Edvard Munch was born in a farmhouse in the village of Ådalsbruk in Løten, Norway, to Laura Catherine Bjølstad and Christian Munch, the son of a priest. Christian was a doctor and medical officer who married Laura, a woman half his age, in 1861. Edvard had an elder sister, Johanne Sophie, and three younger siblings: Peter Andreas, Laura Catherine, and Inger Marie. Laura was artistically talented and may have encouraged Edvard and Sophie. Edvard was related to the painter Jacob Munch and the historian Peter Andreas Munch.

The family moved to Oslo (then called Christiania and renamed Kristiania in 1877) in 1864 when Christian Munch was appointed medical officer at Akershus Fortress. In 1868 Edvard&#x27;s mother died of tuberculosis, probably aggravated by the exhaustion of five consecutive pregnancies in seven years, imposed on her by her religious husband. Munch&#x27;s favourite sister, Johanne Sophie, also died of tuberculosis, at the age of 15, in 1877. After their mother&#x27;s death, the Munch siblings were raised by their father and by their aunt Karen. Often ill for much of the winters and kept out of school, Edvard would draw to keep himself occupied. He was tutored by his school mates and his aunt. Christian Munch also instructed his son in history and literature, and entertained the children with vivid ghost-stories and the tales of the American writer Edgar Allan Poe.

As Edvard remembered it, Christian&#x27;s positive behavior towards his children was overshadowed by his morbid pietism. Munch wrote, &quot;My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to the point of psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born.&quot; Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvard&#x27;s poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; he felt that death was constantly approaching. One of Munch&#x27;s younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died a few months after the wedding. Munch would later write, &quot;I inherited two of mankind&#x27;s most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity.&quot;

Christian Munch&#x27;s military pay was very low, and his attempts to develop a private side practice failed, keeping his family in genteel but perennial poverty. They moved frequently from one cheap flat to another. Munch&#x27;s early drawings and watercolors depicted these interiors, and the individual objects, such as medicine bottles and drawing implements, plus some landscapes. By his teens, art dominated Munch&#x27;s interests. At 13, Munch had his first exposure to other artists at the newly formed Art Association, where he admired the work of the Norwegian landscape school. He returned to copy the paintings, and soon he began to paint in oils.

===Mental health===
Due in part to the mental health struggles and incarceration in an institution of his sister, Laura Catherine, and in part to then-prevailing beliefs in hereditary insanity, Edvard Munch often expressed his fear that he would become insane. Critics of his art also accused him of insanity, deploying this term in a purely abusive sense. When his painting &quot;The Sick Child&quot; was first displayed in Oslo in 1886, Gustav Wentzel and other young Realists encircled Munch and accused him of being a &quot;madman;&quot; another critic Johan Scharffenberg stated that because Munch derived from an &quot;insane family&quot; his art was also &quot;insane.&quot; He is claimed by some to have had borderline personality disorder, a mental health disorder characterized by fear of abandonment, chronic feelings of emptiness, impulsive behavior, and various other symptoms. Munch also displayed alcoholism, a trait often associated with impulsivity in BPD.

===Studies and influences===

In 1879, Munch enrolled in a technical college to study engineering, where he excelled in physics, chemistry and mathematics. He learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted his studies. The following year, much to his father&#x27;s disappointment, Munch left the college determined to become a painter. His father viewed art as an &quot;unholy trade&quot;, and his neighbors reacted bitterly and sent him anonymous letters. In contrast to his father&#x27;s rabid pietism, Munch adopted an undogmatic stance towards art. He wrote his goal in his diary: &quot;In my art I attempt to explain life and its meaning to myself.&quot;

In 1881, Munch enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design of Kristiania, one of whose founders was his distant relative Jacob Munch. His teachers were the sculptor Julius Middelthun and the naturalistic painter Christian Krohg. That year, Munch demonstrated his quick absorption of his figure training at the academy in his first portraits, including one of his father and his first self-portrait. In 1883, Munch took part in his first public exhibition and shared a studio with other students. His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town, earned a critic&#x27;s dismissive response: &quot;It is impressionism carried to the extreme. It is a travesty of art.&quot; Munch&#x27;s nude paintings from this period survive only in sketches, except for &quot;Standing Nude&quot; (1887). They may have been confiscated by his father.

Impressionism inspired Munch from a young age. During these early years, he experimented with many styles, including Naturalism and Impressionism. Some early works are reminiscent of Manet. Many of these attempts brought him unfavorable criticism from the press and garnered him constant rebukes by his father, who nonetheless provided him with small sums for living expenses. At one point, however, Munch&#x27;s father, perhaps swayed by the negative opinion of Munch&#x27;s cousin Edvard Diriks (an established, traditional painter), destroyed at least one painting (likely a nude) and refused to advance any more money for art supplies.

Munch also received his father&#x27;s ire for his relationship with Hans Jæger, the local nihilist who lived by the code &quot;a passion to destroy is also a creative passion&quot; and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom. Munch came under his malevolent, anti-establishment spell. &quot;My ideas developed under the influence of the bohemians or rather under Hans Jæger. Many people have mistakenly claimed that my ideas were formed under the influence of Strindberg and the Germans ... but that is wrong. They had already been formed by then.&quot; At that time, contrary to many of the other bohemians, Munch was still respectful of women, as well as reserved and well-mannered, but he began to give in to the binge drinking and brawling of his circle. He was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the independent women around him. He later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in his behavior and his art, but in his writings as well, an example being a long poem called &quot;The City of Free Love&quot;.

After numerous experiments, Munch concluded that the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression. He found it superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation. He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy. Under Jæger&#x27;s commandment that Munch should &quot;write his life&quot;, meaning that Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a period of reflection and self-examination, recording his thoughts in his &quot;soul&#x27;s diary&quot;. This deeper perspective helped move him to a new view of his art. He wrote that his painting &quot;The Sick Child&quot; (1886), based on his sister&#x27;s death, was his first &quot;soul painting&quot;, his first break from Impressionism. The painting received a negative response from critics and from his family, and caused another &quot;violent outburst of moral indignation&quot; from the community.

Only his friend Christian Krohg defended him:

He paints, or rather regards, things in a way that is different from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munch&#x27;s pictures are as a rule &quot;not complete&quot;, as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.

Munch continued to employ a variety of brushstroke techniques and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, as he struggled to define his style. His idiom continued to veer between naturalistic, as seen in &quot;Portrait of Hans Jæger&quot;, and impressionistic, as in &quot;Rue Lafayette&quot;. His &quot;Inger on the Beach&quot; (1889), which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, hints at the simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of his mature style to come. He began to carefully calculate his compositions to create tension and emotion. While stylistically influenced by the Post-Impressionists, what evolved was a subject matter which was symbolist in content, depicting a state of mind rather than an external reality. In 1889, Munch presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date. The recognition it received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter Léon Bonnat.

Munch seems to have been an early critic of photography as an art form, and remarked that it &quot;will never compete with the brush and the palette, until such time as photographs can be taken in Heaven or Hell!&quot;

Munch&#x27;s younger sister Laura was the subject of his 1899 interior &quot;Melancholy: Laura&quot;. Amanda O&#x27;Neill says of the work, &quot;In this heated claustrophobic scene Munch not only portrays Laura&#x27;s tragedy, but his own dread of the madness he might have inherited.&quot;

===Paris===
Munch arrived in Paris during the festivities of the Exposition Universelle (1889) and roomed with two fellow Norwegian artists. His picture &quot;Morning&quot; (1884) was displayed at the Norwegian pavilion. He spent his mornings at Bonnat&#x27;s busy studio (which included female models) and afternoons at the exhibition, galleries, and museums (where students were expected to make copies as a way of learning technique and observation). Munch recorded little enthusiasm for Bonnat&#x27;s drawing lessons—&quot;It tires and bores me—it&#x27;s numbing&quot;—but enjoyed the master&#x27;s commentary during museum trips.

Munch was enthralled by the vast display of modern European art, including the works of three artists who would prove influential: Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec—all notable for how they used color to convey emotion. Munch was particularly inspired by Gauguin&#x27;s &quot;reaction against realism&quot; and his credo that &quot;art was human work and not an imitation of Nature&quot;, a belief earlier stated by Whistler. As one of his Berlin friends said later of Munch, &quot;he need not make his way to Tahiti to see and experience the primitive in human nature. He carries his own Tahiti within him.&quot; Influenced by Gauguin, as well as the etchings of German artist Max Klinger, Munch experimented with prints as a medium to create graphic versions of his works. In 1896 he created his first woodcuts—a medium that proved ideal to Munch&#x27;s symbolic imagery. Together with his contemporary Nikolai Astrup, Munch is considered an innovator of the woodcut medium in Norway.

In December 1889 his father died, leaving Munch&#x27;s family destitute. He returned home and arranged a large loan from a wealthy Norwegian collector when wealthy relatives failed to help, and assumed financial responsibility for his family from then on. Christian&#x27;s death depressed him and he was plagued by suicidal thoughts: &quot;I live with the dead—my mother, my sister, my grandfather, my father...Kill yourself and then it&#x27;s over. Why live?&quot; Munch&#x27;s paintings of the following year included sketchy tavern scenes and a series of bright cityscapes in which he experimented with the pointillist style of Georges Seurat.

===Berlin===
By 1892, Munch had formulated his own characteristic, and original, synthetist style, as seen in &quot;Melancholy&quot; (1891), in which color is the symbol-laden element. Considered by the artist and journalist Christian Krohg as the first symbolist painting by a Norwegian artist, &quot;Melancholy&quot; was exhibited in 1891 at the Autumn Exhibition in Oslo. In 1892, Adelsteen Normann, on behalf of the Union of Berlin Artists, invited Munch to exhibit at its November exhibition, the society&#x27;s first one-man exhibition. However, his paintings evoked bitter controversy (dubbed &quot;The Munch Affair&quot;), and after one week the exhibition closed. Munch was pleased with the &quot;great commotion&quot;, and wrote in a letter: &quot;Never have I had such an amusing time—it&#x27;s incredible that something as innocent as painting should have created such a stir.&quot;

In Berlin, Munch became involved in an international circle of writers, artists and critics, including the Swedish dramatist and leading intellectual August Strindberg, whom he painted in 1892. He also met Danish writer and painter Holger Drachmann, whom he painted in 1898. Drachmann was 17 years Munch&#x27;s senior and a drinking companion at Zum schwarzen Ferkel (At the Black Piglet) in 1893–94. In 1894 Drachmann wrote of Munch: &quot;He struggles hard. Good luck with your struggles, lonely Norwegian.&quot;

During his four years in Berlin, Munch sketched out most of the ideas that would be comprised in his major work, &quot;The Frieze of Life&quot;, first designed for book illustration but later expressed in paintings. He sold little, but made some income from charging entrance fees to view his controversial paintings. Munch began allowing the appearance of drips in his paintings, as first subtly seen in the painted version of &quot;At the Deathbed&quot; (1895). This effect resulted from the use of highly diluted paint and the deliberate inclusion of drips. Initially, this effect was visible at the edges of his work, but later, the drips became more central, as seen in &quot;By the Deathbed&quot; (1915). The effect of running paint was later adopted by many artists.
His other paintings, including casino scenes, show a simplification of form and detail which marked his early mature style. Munch also began to favor a shallow pictorial space and a minimal backdrop for his frontal figures. Since poses were chosen to produce the most convincing images of states of mind and psychological conditions, as in &quot;Ashes&quot;, the figures impart a monumental, static quality. Munch&#x27;s figures appear to play roles on a theatre stage (&quot;Death in the Sick-Room&quot;), whose pantomime of fixed postures signify various emotions; since each character embodies a single psychological dimension, as in &quot;The Scream&quot;, Munch&#x27;s men and women began to appear more symbolic than realistic. He wrote, &quot;No longer should interiors be painted, people reading and women knitting: there would be living people, breathing and feeling, suffering and loving.&quot;

===&quot;The Scream&quot;===
&quot;The Scream&quot; exists in four versions: two pastels (1893 and 1895) and two paintings (1893 and 1910). There are also several lithographs of &quot;The Scream&quot; (1895 and later).

The 1895 pastel sold at auction on 2 May 2012 for US$119,922,500, including commission. It is the most colorful of the versions and is distinctive for the downward-looking stance of one of its background figures. It is also the only version not held by a Norwegian museum.

The 1893 version was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo in 1994 and was recovered. The 1910 painting was stolen in 2004 from the Munch Museum in Oslo, but recovered in 2006 with limited damage.

&quot;The Scream&quot; is Munch&#x27;s most famous work, and one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man. Painted with broad bands of garish color and highly simplified forms, and employing a high viewpoint, it reduces the agonized figure to a garbed skull in the throes of an emotional crisis.

With this painting, Munch met his stated goal of &quot;the study of the soul, that is to say the study of my own self&quot;. Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: &quot;I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature.&quot; He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, &quot;for several years I was almost mad... You know my picture, &#x27;The Scream?&#x27; I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood... After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again.&quot;

In 2003, comparing the painting with other great works, art historian Martha Tedeschi wrote:

&quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;, Wood&#x27;s &quot;American Gothic&quot;, Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and Edvard Munch&#x27;s &quot;The Scream&quot; have all achieved something that most paintings—regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value—have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture.

===&quot;Frieze of Life – A Poem about Life, Love and Death&quot;===
In December 1893, Unter den Linden in Berlin was the location of an exhibition of Munch&#x27;s work, showing, among other pieces, six paintings entitled &quot;Study for a Series: Love.&quot; This began a cycle he later called the &quot;Frieze of Life – A Poem about Life, Love and Death&quot;. &quot;Frieze of Life&quot; motifs, such as &quot;The Storm&quot; and &quot;Moonlight&quot;, are steeped in atmosphere. Other motifs illuminate the nocturnal side of love, such as &quot;Rose and Amelie&quot; and &quot;Love and Pain&quot;. In &quot;Death in the Sickroom&quot;, the subject is the death of his sister Sophie, which he re-worked in many future variations. The dramatic focus of the painting, portraying his entire family, is dispersed in the separate and disconnected figures of sorrow. In 1894, he enlarged the spectrum of motifs by adding &quot;Anxiety&quot;, &quot;Ashes&quot;, &quot;Madonna&quot; and &quot;Women in Three Stages&quot; (from innocence to old age).

Around the start of the 20th century, Munch worked to finish the &quot;Frieze&quot;. He painted a number of pictures, several of them in bigger format and to some extent featuring the Art Nouveau aesthetics of the time. He made a wooden frame with carved reliefs for the large painting &quot;Metabolism&quot; (1898), initially called &quot;Adam and Eve&quot;. This work reveals Munch&#x27;s pre-occupation with the &quot;fall of man&quot; and his pessimistic philosophy of love. Motifs such as &quot;The Empty Cross&quot; and &quot;Golgotha&quot; (both ) reflect a metaphysical orientation, and also reflect Munch&#x27;s pietistic upbringing. The entire &quot;Frieze&quot; was shown for the first time at the secessionist exhibition in Berlin in 1902.

&quot;The Frieze of Life&quot; themes recur throughout Munch&#x27;s work but he especially focused on them in the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped the depths of his feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death. These themes are expressed in paintings such as &quot;The Sick Child&quot; (1885), &quot;Love and Pain&quot; (retitled &quot;Vampire&quot;; 1893–94), &quot;Ashes&quot; (1894), and &quot;The Bridge&quot;. The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see &quot;Puberty&quot; and &quot;Love and Pain&quot;) or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see &quot;Separation&quot;, &quot;Jealousy&quot;, and &quot;Ashes&quot;).

Munch often uses shadows and rings of color around his figures to emphasize an aura of fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity. These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of the artist&#x27;s sexual anxieties, though it could also be argued that they represent his turbulent relationship with love itself and his general pessimism regarding human existence. Many of these sketches and paintings were done in several versions, such as &quot;Madonna&quot;, &quot;Hands&quot; and &quot;Puberty&quot;, and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs. Munch hated to part with his paintings because he thought of his work as a single body of expression. So to capitalize on his production and make some income, he turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of his paintings, including those in this series. Munch admitted to the personal goals of his work but he also offered his art to a wider purpose, &quot;My art is really a voluntary confession and an attempt to explain to myself my relationship with life—it is, therefore, actually a sort of egoism, but I am constantly hoping that through this I can help others achieve clarity.&quot;

While attracting strongly negative reactions, in the 1890s Munch began to receive some understanding of his artistic goals, as one critic wrote, &quot;With ruthless contempt for form, clarity, elegance, wholeness, and realism, he paints with intuitive strength of talent the most subtle visions of the soul.&quot; One of his great supporters in Berlin was Walther Rathenau, later the German foreign minister, who strongly contributed to his success.

=== Landscapes and Nature ===
Despite over half of his painted works being landscapes, Munch is rarely seen as a landscape artist. However, Munch had a fixation on several elements of nature that resulted in recurrent motifs throughout his work. The shoreline and the forest are both significant settings of Munch&#x27;s work. A focus on Munch&#x27;s use of nature to convey emotion is the topic of &quot;Edvard Munch: Trembling Earth&quot; at the Clark Art Institute.

===Paris, Berlin and Kristiania===

In 1896, Munch moved to Paris, where he focused on graphic representations of his &quot;Frieze of Life&quot; themes. He further developed his woodcut and lithographic technique. Munch&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait with Skeleton Arm&quot; (1895) is done with an etching needle-and-ink method also used by Paul Klee. Munch also produced multi-colored versions of &quot;The Sick Child&quot;, concerning tuberculosis, which sold well, as well as several nudes and multiple versions of &quot;Kiss&quot; (1892). In May 1896, Siegfried Bing held an exhibition of Munch&#x27;s work inside Bing&#x27;s Maison de l&#x27;Art Nouveau. The exhibition displayed 60 works, including &quot;The Kiss, The Scream, Madonna, The Sick Child, The Death Chamber, and The Day After.&quot; Bing&#x27;s exhibition helped to introduce Munch to a French audience. Still, many of the Parisian critics still considered Munch&#x27;s work &quot;violent and brutal&quot; even if his exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance. His financial situation improved considerably and, in 1897, Munch bought himself a summer house facing the fjords of Kristiania, a small fisherman&#x27;s cabin built in the late 18th century, in the small town of Åsgårdstrand in Norway. He dubbed this home the &quot;Happy House&quot; and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years. It was this place he missed when he was abroad and when he felt depressed and exhausted. &quot;To walk in Åsgårdstrand is like walking among my paintings—I get so inspired to paint when I am here&quot;.
In 1897 Munch returned to Kristiania, where he also received grudging acceptance—one critic wrote, &quot;A fair number of these pictures have been exhibited before. In my opinion these improve on acquaintance.&quot; In 1899, Munch began an intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a &quot;liberated&quot; upper-class woman. They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in &quot;The Frieze of Life&quot; series, &quot;The Dance of Life&quot; (1899). Larsen was eager for marriage, but Munch was not. His drinking and poor health reinforced his fears, as he wrote in the third person: &quot;Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage. His sick and nervous home had given him the feeling that he had no right to get married.&quot; Munch almost gave in to Tulla, but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin. His &quot;Girls on the Jetty&quot;, created in 18 different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations. In 1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing &quot;a symphonic effect—it made a great stir—a lot of antagonism—and a lot of approval.&quot; The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch&#x27;s work even though the public still found his work alien and strange.

The good press coverage gained Munch the attention of influential patrons Albert Kollman and Max Linde. He described the turn of events in his diary, &quot;After 20 years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany—and a bright door opens up for me.&quot; However, despite this positive change, Munch&#x27;s self-destructive and erratic behavior led him first to a violent quarrel with another artist, then to an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. Munch later sawed a self-portrait depicting him and Larsen in half as a consequence of the shooting and subsequent events. She finally left him and married a younger colleague of Munch. Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation for some time to come, channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings. His paintings &quot;Still Life (The Murderess)&quot; and &quot;The Death of Marat I&quot;, done in 1906–07, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after-effects.

In 1903–04, Munch exhibited in Paris where the coming Fauvists, famous for their boldly false colors, likely saw his works and might have found inspiration in them. When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs. After studying the sculpture of Rodin, Munch may have experimented with plasticine as an aid to design, but he produced little sculpture. During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition. In 1906, he painted the screen for an Ibsen play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin&#x27;s Deutsches Theater, in which the &quot;Frieze of Life&quot; was hung. The theatre&#x27;s director Max Reinhardt later sold it; it is now in the Berlin Nationalgalerie. After an earlier period of landscapes, in 1907 he turned his attention again to human figures and situations.

===Breakdown and recovery===

In the autumn of 1908, Munch&#x27;s anxiety, compounded by excessive drinking and brawling, had become acute. As he later wrote, &quot;My condition was verging on madness—it was touch and go.&quot; Subject to hallucinations and feelings of persecution, he entered the clinic of Daniel Jacobson. The therapy Munch received for the next eight months included diet and &quot;electrification&quot; (a treatment then fashionable for nervous conditions, not to be confused with electroconvulsive therapy). Munch&#x27;s stay in hospital stabilized his personality, and after returning to Norway in 1909, his work became more colorful and less pessimistic. Further brightening his mood, the general public of Kristiania finally warmed to his work, and museums began to purchase his paintings. He was made a Knight of the Royal Order of St. Olav &quot;for services in art&quot;. His first American exhibit was in 1912 in New York.

As part of his recovery, Jacobson advised Munch to only socialize with good friends and avoid drinking in public. Munch followed this advice and in the process produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons—honest portrayals devoid of flattery. He also created landscapes and scenes of people at work and play, using a new optimistic style—broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of white space and rare use of black—with only occasional references to his morbid themes. With more income Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family.

The outbreak of World War I found Munch with divided loyalties, as he stated, &quot;All my friends are German but it is France I love.&quot; Given his poor health history, during 1918 Munch felt himself lucky to have survived a bout of the Spanish flu, the worldwide pandemic of that year. In the 1930s, his German patrons, many Jewish, lost their fortunes and some their lives during the rise of the Nazi movement. Munch found Norwegian printers to substitute for the Germans who had been printing his graphic work.

===Later years===

Munch spent most of his last two decades in solitude at his nearly self-sufficient estate in Ekely, at Skøyen, Oslo. Many of his late paintings celebrate farm life, including several in which he used his work horse &quot;Rousseau&quot; as a model. Without any effort, Munch attracted a steady stream of female models, whom he painted as the subjects of numerous nude paintings. He likely had sexual relationships with some of them. Munch occasionally left his home to paint murals on commission, including those done for the Freia chocolate factory.

To the end of his life, Munch continued to paint unsparing self-portraits, adding to his self-searching cycle of his life and his unflinching series of takes on his emotional and physical states. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Nazis labeled Munch&#x27;s work &quot;degenerate art&quot; (along with that of Picasso, Klee, Matisse, Gauguin and many other modern artists) and removed his 82 works from German museums. Adolf Hitler announced in 1937, &quot;For all we care, those pre-historic Stone Age culture barbarians and art-stutterers can return to the caves of their ancestors and there can apply their primitive international scratching.&quot;

In 1940, the Germans invaded Norway and the Nazi party took over the government. Munch was 76 years old. With nearly an entire collection of his art in the second floor of his house, Munch lived in fear of a Nazi confiscation. Seventy-one of the paintings previously taken by the Nazis had been returned to Norway through purchase by collectors (the other 11 were never recovered), including &quot;The Scream&quot; and &quot;The Sick Child&quot;, and they too were hidden from the Nazis.

Munch died in his house at Ekely near Oslo on 23 January 1944, about a month after his 80th birthday. His Nazi-orchestrated funeral suggested to Norwegians that he was a Nazi sympathizer, a kind of appropriation of the independent artist. The city of Oslo bought the Ekely estate from Munch&#x27;s heirs in 1946; his house was demolished in May 1960.

==Legacy==


When Munch died, his remaining works were bequeathed to the city of Oslo, which built the Munch Museum at Tøyen (it opened in 1963). The museum holds a collection of approximately 1,100 paintings, 4,500 drawings, and 18,000 prints, the broadest collection of his works in the world. The Munch Museum serves as Munch&#x27;s official estate; it has been active in responding to copyright infringements as well as clearing copyright for the work, such as the appearance of Munch&#x27;s &quot;The Scream&quot; in a 2006 M&amp;M&#x27;s advertising campaign. The U.S. copyright representative for the Munch Museum and the Estate of Edvard Munch is the Artists Rights Society.

Munch&#x27;s art was highly personalized and he did little teaching. His &quot;private&quot; symbolism was far more personal than that of other Symbolist painters such as Gustave Moreau and James Ensor. Munch was still highly influential, particularly with the German Expressionists, who followed his philosophy, &quot;I do not believe in the art which is not the compulsive result of Man&#x27;s urge to open his heart.&quot; Many of his paintings, including &quot;The Scream&quot;, have universal appeal in addition to their highly personal meaning.

Munch&#x27;s works are now represented in numerous major museums and galleries in Norway and abroad. His cabin, &quot;the Happy House&quot;, was given to the municipality of Åsgårdstrand in 1944; it serves as a small Munch Museum. The inventory has been maintained exactly as he left it.

One version of &quot;The Scream&quot; was stolen from the National Gallery in 1994. In 2004, another version of &quot;The Scream&quot;, along with one of &quot;Madonna&quot;, was stolen from the Munch Museum in a daring daylight robbery. These were all eventually recovered, but the paintings stolen in the 2004 robbery were extensively damaged. They have been meticulously restored and are on display again. Three Munch works were stolen from the Hotel Refsnes Gods in 2005; they were shortly recovered, although one of the works was damaged during the robbery.

In October 2006, the color woodcut &quot;Two people. The lonely&quot; (&quot;To mennesker. De ensomme&quot;) set a new record for his prints when it was sold at an auction in Oslo for 8.1 million kroner (US$1.27 million ). It also set a record for the highest price paid in auction in Norway. On 3 November 2008, the painting &quot;Vampire&quot; set a new record for his paintings when it was sold for US$38,162,000 () at Sotheby&#x27;s New York.

Munch&#x27;s image appeared on the Norwegian 1,000-kroner note (Series VII; valid from 2001 to 2020), along with pictures inspired by his artwork.

In February 2012, a major Munch exhibition, &quot;Edvard Munch. The Modern Eye&quot;, opened at the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt; the exhibition was opened by Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway.

In May 2012, &quot;The Scream&quot; sold for US$119.9 million (), and is the second most expensive artwork ever sold at an open auction. (It was surpassed in November 2013 by &quot;Three Studies of Lucian Freud&quot;, which sold for US$142.4 million).

In 2013, four of Munch&#x27;s paintings were depicted in a series of stamps by the Norwegian postal service, to commemorate in 2014 the 150th anniversary of his birth.

On 14 November 2016 a version of Munch&#x27;s &quot;The Girls on the Bridge&quot; sold for US$54.5 million () at Sotheby&#x27;s, New York, making it the second highest price achieved for one of his paintings.

In April 2019 the British Museum hosted the exhibition, &quot;Edvard Munch: Love and Angst&quot;, comprising 83 artworks and including a rare original print of &quot;The Scream&quot;.

In May 2022 the Courtauld Gallery hosted the exhibition, &quot;Edvard Munch. Masterpieces from Bergen&quot;, showcasing 18 paintings from Norwegian industrialist Rasmus Meyer&#x27;s collection.

In June 2023 the Clark Art Institute hosted the exhibition &quot;Edvard Munch: Trembling Earth&quot;. It was the first exhibit in the United States to focus on how Munch used nature to convey deeper meaning in his painting. &quot;Trembling Earth&quot; featured more than 75 works, many from the Munchmuseet&#x27;s collection, and over 40 paintings and prints from rarely seen private collections.

In September 2023, the Berlinische Galerie Museum for Modern Art hosted an exhibition &quot;Edvard Munch. Magic of the North&quot; in collaboration with the Munch Museum Oslo. The exhibition included around 80 works by Edvard Munch, supplemented by works by other artists who shaped the idea of the north and the modern art scene on the Spree in Berlin at the end of the 19th century.

In November 2023, the Museum Barberini in Potsdam also hosted an exhibition &quot;Edvard Munch: Trembling Earth&quot; in collaboration with the Munch Museum Oslo. The exhibition overlapped the Berlinische Galerie exhibition by eight weeks; both exhibitions were under the joint patronage of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and His Majesty King Harald V of Norway. The exhibition included more than 110 loans from other institutions.

===University Aula===

In 1911 the final competition for the decoration of the large walls of the University of Oslo Aula (assembly hall) was held between Munch and Emanuel Vigeland. The episode is known as the &quot;Aula controversy&quot;. In 1914 Munch was finally commissioned to decorate the Aula and the work was completed in 1916. This major work in Norwegian monumental painting includes 11 paintings covering . &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;History&quot; and &quot;Alma Mater&quot; are the key works in this sequence. Munch declared: &quot;I wanted the decorations to form a complete and independent world of ideas, and I wanted their visual expression to be both distinctively Norwegian and universally human&quot;. In 2014 it was suggested that the Aula paintings have a value of at least 500 million kroner (approx $111 million USD in 2025).

=== Looted art controversies ===
In 2007, Munch&#x27;s &quot;Summer Night at the Beach&quot; was returned to the granddaughter of Alma Mahler, who was forced to flee the Nazis with her Jewish husband in March 1938, after Hitler&#x27;s annexation of Austria. In 2008 the Basel Fine Arts Museum rejected a claim for Munch&#x27;s &quot;Madonna, a&quot; lithograph of a nude in black, red and blue&quot;,&quot; from the heirs of the Jewish collector Curt Glaser. In 2012 Berlin&#x27;s Kupferstichkabinett restituted three drawings by Munch to the heirs of Curt Glaser, a Jewish collector forced into exile by the Nazis. In 2012, a claim for &quot;The Scream&quot; from the heirs of Hugo Simon was rejected as it went to auction. In 2023 Munch&#x27;s &quot;Dance on the Beach&quot; was the object of an accord between the Glaser heirs and the heirs of Thomas Olsen, a Norwegian shipowner and Munch&#x27;s neighbour and collector.

<text>The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (frequently known by the acronym EISA and pronounced &quot;eee-suh&quot;) is a bus standard for IBM PC compatible computers. It was announced in September 1988 by a consortium of PC clone vendors (the Gang of Nine) as an alternative to IBM&#x27;s proprietary Micro Channel architecture (MCA) in its PS/2 series.

In comparison with the AT bus, which the Gang of Nine retroactively renamed to the ISA bus to avoid infringing IBM&#x27;s trademark on its PC/AT computer, EISA is extended to 32 bits and allows more than one CPU to share the bus. The bus mastering support is also enhanced to provide access to 4 GB of memory. Unlike MCA, EISA can accept older ISA cards — the lines and slots for EISA are a superset of ISA.

EISA was much favoured by manufacturers due to the proprietary nature of MCA, and even IBM produced some machines supporting it. It was somewhat expensive to implement (though not as much as MCA), so it never became particularly popular in desktop PCs. However, it was reasonably successful in the server market, as it was better suited to bandwidth-intensive tasks such as disk access and networking. Most EISA cards produced were either SCSI or network cards. EISA was also available on some non-IBM-compatible machines such as the DEC AlphaServer, HP 9000 D-class, SGI Indigo2 and MIPS Magnum.

By the time there was a strong market need for a bus of these speeds and capabilities for desktop computers, the VESA Local Bus and later PCI filled this niche, and EISA vanished into obscurity.

== History ==
The original IBM PC included five 8-bit slots, running at the system clock speed of 4.77 MHz. The PC/AT, introduced in 1984, had three 8-bit slots and five 16-bit slots, all running at the system clock speed of 6 MHz in the earlier models and 8 MHz in the last version of the computer. The 16-bit slots were a superset of the 8-bit configuration, so &quot;most&quot; 8-bit cards were able to plug into a 16-bit slot (some cards used a &quot;skirt&quot; design that physically interfered with the extended portion of the slot) and continue to run in 8-bit mode. One of the key reasons for the success of the IBM PC (and the PC clones that followed it) was the active ecosystem of third-party expansion cards available for the machines. IBM was restricted from patenting the bus and widely published the bus specifications.

As the PC-clone industry continued to build momentum in the mid- to late-1980s, several problems with the bus began to be apparent. First, because the &quot;AT slot&quot; (as it was known at the time) was not managed by any central standards group, there was nothing to prevent a manufacturer from &quot;pushing&quot; the standard. One of the most common issues was that as PC clones became more common, PC manufacturers began increasing the processor speed to maintain a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, because the ISA bus was originally locked to the processor clock, this meant that some 286 machines had ISA buses that ran at 10, 12, or even 16 MHz. In fact, the first systems to clock the ISA bus at 8 MHz were the turbo Intel 8088 clones that clocked the processors at 8 MHz. This caused many issues with incompatibility, where a true IBM-compatible third-party card (designed for an 8 MHz or 4.77 MHz bus) might not work reliably or at all in a higher-clocked system. Most PC makers eventually decoupled the bus clock from the system clock, but there was still no standards body to &quot;police&quot; the industry.

As companies like Dell modified the AT bus design, Phoenix Technologies in 1986 proposed a 32-bit extension to the AT bus in 1986, but leading clone vendor Compaq refused to cooperate. The AT architecture was so well entrenched that no single clone manufacturer had the leverage to create a standardized alternative, and there was no compelling reason for them to cooperate on a new standard. Because of this, when the first 386-based system (the Compaq Deskpro 386) was sold in 1986, it still supported 16-bit slots. Other 386 PCs followed suit, and the AT (later ISA) bus remained a part of most systems even into the late 1990s.

Meanwhile, IBM began to worry that it was losing control of the industry it had created. In 1987, IBM released the PS/2 line of computers, most of which included the MCA bus. MCA included numerous enhancements over the 16-bit AT bus, including bus mastering, burst mode, software-configurable resources, and 32-bit capabilities. However, in an effort to reassert its dominant role, IBM patented the bus and placed stringent licensing and royalty policies on its use. A few manufacturers did produce licensed MCA machines (most notably, NCR), but overall the industry balked at IBM&#x27;s restrictions.

Steve Gibson proposed that clone makers adopt NuBus. After first stating that the AT bus was sufficient for customers, a group of companies led by Compaq (the &quot;Gang of Nine&quot;) developed a new bus instead. This new bus was named the Extended (or Enhanced) Industry Standard Architecture, or &quot;EISA&quot;, while the older AT bus had already been renamed Industry Standard Architecture, or &quot;ISA&quot;. This provided virtually all of the technical advantages of MCA, while remaining compatible with existing 8-bit and 16-bit cards, and (most enticing to system and card makers) minimal licensing cost.

The EISA bus slot is a two-level staggered pin system, with the upper part of the slot corresponding to the standard ISA bus pin layout. The additional features of the EISA bus are implemented on the lower part of the slot connector, using thin traces inserted into the insulating gap of the upper / ISA card card edge connector. Additionally, the lower part of the bus has five keying notches, so an ISA card with unusually long traces cannot accidentally extend down into the lower part of the slot.

Intel introduced its first EISA chipset (and also their first chipset in the modern sense of the word) as the 82350 in September 1989. Intel introduced a lower-cost variant as the 82350DT, announced in April 1991; it began shipping in June of that year.

The first EISA computer announced was the HP Vectra 486 in October 1989. The first EISA computers to hit the market were the Compaq Deskpro 486 and the SystemPro. The SystemPro, being one of the first PC-style systems designed as a network server, was built from the ground up to take full advantage of the EISA bus. It included such features as multiprocessing, hardware RAID, and bus-mastering network cards.

One of the benefits to come out of the EISA standard was a final codification of the standard to which ISA slots and cards should be held (in particular, clock speed was fixed at an industry standard of 8.33 MHz). Thus, even systems that didn&#x27;t use the EISA bus gained the advantage of having the ISA standardized, which contributed to its longevity.

The EISA had support for plug and play with special manufacturer drivers; however it was not widely used on desktop PCs.

==The Gang of Nine==
The &quot;Gang of Nine&quot; was the informal name given to the consortium of personal computer manufacturing companies, led by Compaq, that together created the EISA bus. The nine companies together had more than 33% market share for all PCs in 1987, compared to IBM&#x27;s 27%. The Gang of Nine had an even larger share of the market for 80386-based computers, with 43% compared to IBM&#x27;s 16%. Compaq was among the first clone makers after the IBM PC&#x27;s debut in 1981, and had 28% of the 80386 market; rival members generally acknowledged its leadership, with one stating in 1989 that within the Gang of Nine &quot;when you have 10 people sit down before a table to write a letter to the president, someone has to write the letter. Compaq is sitting down at the typewriter&quot;. The members were:

* AST Research, Inc.
* Compaq Computer Corporation
* Seiko Epson Corporation
* Hewlett-Packard Company
* NEC Corporation
* Olivetti
* Tandy Corporation
* WYSE
* Zenith Data Systems
== Technical data ==


Although the MCA bus had a slight performance advantage over EISA (bus speed of 10 MHz, compared to 8.33 MHz), EISA contained almost all of the technological benefits that MCA boasted, including bus mastering, burst mode, software-configurable resources, and 32-bit data/address buses. These brought EISA nearly to par with MCA from a performance standpoint, and EISA easily defeated MCA in industry support.

EISA replaced the tedious jumper configuration common with ISA cards with software-based configuration. Every EISA system shipped with an EISA configuration utility; this was usually a slightly customized version of the standard utilities written by the EISA chipset makers. The user would boot into this utility, either from floppy disk or on a dedicated hard-drive partition. The utility software would detect all EISA cards in the system and could configure any hardware resources (interrupts, memory ports, etc.) on any EISA card (each EISA card would include a disk with information that described the available options on the card) or on the EISA system motherboard. The user could also enter information about ISA cards in the system, allowing the utility to automatically reconfigure EISA cards to avoid resource conflicts.

Similarly, Windows 95, with its Plug-and-Play capability, was not able to change the configuration of EISA cards, but it could detect the cards, read their configuration, and reconfigure Plug-and-Play hardware to avoid resource conflicts. Windows 95 would also automatically attempt to install appropriate drivers for detected EISA cards.

== Industry acceptance ==
IBM had lost market share because of slow PS/2 sales and customers&#x27; reluctance to use MCA. It debuted the AT bus-based PS/2 Model 30 286 in Manhattan at the same time as the EISA announcement elsewhere in the city, 17 months after tellilng customers that the AT bus was obsolete. The Gang of Nine&#x27;s success with EISA was nonetheless uncertain. Some customers wished that a 32-bit bus had been available years earlier, and thought that IBM&#x27;s rivals should now adopt MCA, for which almost 400 expansion cards were available by EISA&#x27;s introduction. Dell was a notable clone maker that did not join the Gang of Nine. Many manufacturers, including those in the Gang of Nine, researched the possibility of using MCA. For example, Compaq actually produced prototype DeskPro systems using the bus. However, these were never put into production, and when it was clear that MCA had lost, Compaq allowed its MCA license to expire (the license actually cost relatively little; the primary costs associated with MCA, and at which the industry revolted, were royalties to be paid per system shipped).

Olivetti included EISA in its Olivetti NetStrada 7000 (CONDOR) product which embraced multiple bus architectures, its Adaptec RAID Controller occupied an EISA slot that could be accessed by up to 4 of its Pentium Pro 200 CPUs concurrently. 

On the other hand, when it became clear to IBM that Micro Channel was dying, IBM actually licensed EISA for use in a few server systems.

<doc id="9789" wikidata="Q5464" url="?curid=9789" title="Earthdawn">
<text>Earthdawn is a fantasy role-playing game, originally produced by FASA in 1993. In 1999 it was licensed to Living Room Games, which produced the &quot;Second Edition&quot;. It was licensed to RedBrick in 2003, who released the Classic Edition in 2005 and the game&#x27;s Third Edition in 2009 (the latter through Mongoose Publishing&#x27;s Flaming Cobra imprint). The license is now held by FASA Games, Inc. (from FASA), who have released the Fourth Edition, with updated mechanics and an advanced metaplot timeline. Vagrant Workshop released the &quot;Age of Legend&quot; edition in 2016 using alternative rules-lite mechanics.

The game is similar to fantasy games like &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, but draws more inspiration from games like &quot;RuneQuest&quot;. The rules of the game are tightly bound to the underlying magical metaphysics, with the goal of creating a rich, logical fantasy world. Like many role-playing games from the nineties, &quot;Earthdawn&quot; focuses much of its detail on its setting, a province called Barsaive. It was also originally written as a prequel to &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, mirroring its setting of returning magic with one where magic has just recently dropped from its peak. However, after &quot;Shadowrun&quot; was licensed out to a different publisher, the ties between the two were deliberately severed.

==History==
Starting in 1993, FASA released over 20 gaming supplements describing this universe; however, it closed down production of &quot;Earthdawn&quot; in January 1999. During that time several novels and short-story anthologies set in the &quot;Earthdawn&quot; universe were also released. In late 1999, FASA granted Living Room Games a licensing agreement to produce new material for the game.

The &quot;Second Edition&quot; did not alter the setting, though it did update the timeline to include events that took place in Barsaive. There were a few changes to the rules in the &quot;Second Edition&quot;; some classes were slightly different or altered abilities from the original. The changes were meant to allow for more rounded characters and better balance of play. Living Room Games last published in 2005 and they no longer have a license with FASA to publish Earthdawn material.

In 2003 a second license was granted to RedBrick, who developed their own edition based on the FASA products, in addition to releasing the original FASA books in PDF form. The &quot;Earthdawn Classic Player&#x27;s Compendium&quot; and &quot;Earthdawn Classic Gamemaster&#x27;s Compendium&quot; are essentially an alternative Second Edition, but without a version designation (since the material is compatible anyway). Each book has 524 pages and summarizes much of what FASA published—not only the game mechanics, but also the setting, narrations, and stories. For example, each Discipline has its own chapter, describing it from the point of view of different adepts. Likewise, Barsaive gets a complete treatment, and the chapters contain a lot of log entries and stories in addition to the setting descriptions; the same applies to Horrors and Dragons. Errata was incorporated into the text, correcting previous edition errors and providing rules clarifications.

While RedBrick tried to remain faithful to FASA&#x27;s vision and visual style, they revised almost everything and introduced new material to fill the gaps. RedBrick began publishing new Earthdawn novels in 2007. In 2009, RedBrick announced the Third Edition of the game. To gain a larger audience for this edition, RedBrick published the book through Mongoose Publishing&#x27;s Flaming Cobra imprint. The first two books were released in July 2009. In 2012, RedBrick ceased publishing and announced the transfer of the Earthdawn license to FASA Games, Inc.

In 2014, FASA Games announced the forthcoming publication of Earthdawn Fourth Edition and launched a successful Kickstarter to support the project. Fourth Edition is described as a reworking of the game mechanics, with redundancies eliminated, and a simpler success level system. The game world is advanced five years, past the end of the Barsaive-Thera War, in order to clear dangling threads in the metaplot and open the game world to new stories. The first Fourth Edition title—the Player&#x27;s Guide—was released in early 2015. In 2014 FASA Corporation also gave permission for Impact Miniatures to return the original Heartbreaker Hobbies &amp; Games Official Earthdawn Miniatures range to production. In order to fund this, Impact Miniatures launched a successful Kickstarter project.

In 2016, Vagrant Workshop released the &quot;Age of Legend&quot; edition using a permutation of the rules-lite mechanics of the &quot;Freeform Universal&quot; RPG system. With its rules-lite mechanics the &quot;Age of Legend&quot; edition is marketed as being &quot;ideal for one-shots, convention games, and introductory games — even for kids!&quot;

==Setting==
In Barsaive, magic, like many things in nature, goes through cycles. As the magic level rises, it allows alien creatures called Horrors to cross from their distant, otherworldly dimension into our own. The Horrors come in an almost infinite variety—from simple eating machines that devour all they encounter, to incredibly intelligent and cunning foes that feed off the negative emotions they inspire in their prey.

In the distant past of &quot;Earthdawn&quot;″s setting, an elf scholar discovered that the time of the Horrors was approaching, and founded the Eternal Library in order to discover a way to defeat them — or at the very least, survive them. The community that grew up around the library developed wards and protections against the Horrors, which they traded to other lands and eventually became the powerful Theran Empire, an extremely magically advanced civilization and the main antagonist of the &quot;Earthdawn&quot; setting.

The peoples of the world built kaers, underground towns and cities, which they sealed with the Theran wards to wait out the time of the Horrors, which was called the Scourge. Theran wizards and politicians warned many of the outlying nations around Thera of the coming of the Horrors, offering the protection of the kaers to those who would pledge their loyalty to the Empire. Most of these nations agreed at first though some became unwilling to fulfill their end of the bargain after the end of the Scourge, wanting to have nothing to do with the bureaucratic nation run on political conflict and powered by slavery. After four hundred years of hiding, the Scourge ended, and the people emerged to a world changed by the Horrors. The player characters explore this new world, discovering lost secrets of the past, and fighting Horrors that remain.

The primary setting of Earthdawn is Barsaive, a former province of the Theran Empire. Barsaive is a region of city-states, independent from the Therans since the dwarven Kingdom of Throal led a rebellion against their former overlords. The Theran presence in Barsaive has been limited to a small part of south-western Barsaive, located around the magical fortress of Sky Point and the city of Vivane.

The setting of Earthdawn is the same world as &quot;Shadowrun&quot; (i.e. a fictionalized version of Earth), but takes place millennia earlier. The map of Barsaive and its neighboring regions established that most of the game takes place where Ukraine and Russia are in our world. However, the topography other than coastlines and major rivers is quite different, and the only apparent reference to the real world besides the map may be the Blood Wood, known as &quot;Wyrm Wood&quot; before the Scourge and similar in location and extent to the Chernobyl (Ukrainian for &quot;wormwood&quot;) zone of alienation. Note should be made that game world links between &quot;Earthdawn&quot; and &quot;Shadowrun&quot; were deliberately broken by the publisher when the &quot;Shadowrun&quot; property was licensed out, in order to avoid the necessity for coordination between publishing companies. FASA has announced since then, that there are no plans to return &quot;Shadowrun&quot; to in-house publication, nor to restore the links between the game worlds.

Three Earthdawn supplements cover territories outside Barsaive. &quot;The Theran Empire&quot; book (First Edition) covers the Theran Empire and its provinces (which roughly correspond to the territories of the Roman Empire, plus colonies in America and India). &quot;Cathay: The Five Kingdoms&quot; (Third Edition) covers the lands of Cathay (Far East).&quot;Vasgothia&quot; (Fourth Edition) covers the Theran Province in more detail than originally presented in First Edition (Germany). 

===Races===
Known as Namegivers, the setting of &quot;Earthdawn&quot; features several fantasy races for characters and NPCs:

# Dwarf: Dwarfs in &quot;Earthdawn&quot; are similar in appearance to the classic &quot;D&amp;D&quot; or Tolkien dwarfs. They are the predominant race in Barsaive, and the dwarf language is considered the common language. Their culture, especially of the dominant Throal Kingdom, can be considered more of a Renaissance-level culture than in most other fantasy settings, and forms the main source of resistance to a return of Thera&#x27;s rule in Barsaive.
# Elf: Elves in &quot;Earthdawn&quot; fit the common fantasy role playing convention; they are tall, lithe, pointy-eared humanoids who prefer living in nature. Elves in &quot;Earthdawn&quot; naturally live a very long time; some are thought to be immortal. Such immortal Elves feature in many cross-pollinated storylines with &quot;Shadowrun&quot;. A subrace of &quot;Earthdawn&quot; elves are called the Blood Elves. The blood elves rejected the Theran protective magic, and attempted their own warding spells. These wards failed, and a last-ditch ritual caused thorns to thrust through the skin of the blood elves. These ever-bleeding wounds caused constant pain, but the self-inflicted suffering was enough to protect the blood elves from the worst of the Horrors.
# Human: Humans in &quot;Earthdawn&quot; are physically similar to humans in our own real world. Human adepts are granted a special Versatility talent to make them more mechanically appealing. Humans in &quot;Earthdawn&quot; are considered to be somewhat warlike in general outlook.
# Obsidiman: Obsidimen are a race of large, rock-based humanoids. They stand over tall and weigh over 900 pounds. Their primary connection is to their Liferock, which is a large formation of stone that they emerge from. Obsidimen are loyal to the community around their Liferock, and eventually return to and re-merge with it. Obsidimen can live around 500 years away from their Liferock, and their ultimate lifespan is unknown, as they generally return to it and remain there. Due to their rocky nature and long lives, Obsidimen are rather slow moving and deliberate in both speech and action, and can have difficulty understanding the smaller races&#x27; need for haste. However, if aroused by a threat to self, friend, or community, obsidimen are fearsome to behold.
# Ork: The ork race in &quot;Earthdawn&quot; is physically similar to other depictions of orcs in fantasy role-playing. They are tribal, nomadic and often barbaric humanoids, with olive, tan, beige or ebony skin. They are relatively short-lived, and as a result many attempt to leave a legacy marked by a memorable death—preferably one that leaves no corpse. Before the Scourge almost all orks were enslaved by other races.
# Troll: The troll race in &quot;Earthdawn&quot; is also similar in appearance to many other fantasy role playing depictions of trolls. They are very tall humanoids, with a hardened skin and horns. Socially, they form clans to which they are fiercely loyal. Troll clans often raid one another, and a significant subset of the troll race are crystal raiders, which command many of the airships of Barsaive. Other trolls, known as lowland trolls, have merged with mixed communities around Barsaive, although most retain the fierce cultural and personal pride of their less-civilized cousins.
# T&#x27;skrang: The t&#x27;skrang are lizard-like amphibious humanoids with long tails and a flair for dramatics. Many of them exhibit the behaviors and characteristics which are stereotypical to a &quot;swashbuckler&quot;. T&#x27;skrang are often sailors, and many t&#x27;skrang families run ships up and down the rivers of Barsaive. A rare subrace of t&#x27;skrang, the &quot;k&#x27;stulaami&quot;, possess a flap of skin much like a flying squirrel&#x27;s patagium, allowing them to glide. While &quot;k&#x27;stulaami&quot; can be born as a random mutation in any t&#x27;skrang line, they tend to congregate into communities filled with their own kind.
# Windling: The windlings are small, winged humanoids; similar to many depictions of fae creatures, they resemble small elves with insect-like wings. They have the ability to see into the astral plane, and are considerably luckier than the other races. Windlings are often somewhat mischievous, hedonistic, and eager for new experiences, and are culturally similar to the Kender of Krynn, but without the same kleptomaniacal tendencies. They have wings similar to those of a dragonfly and are one to two feet in height.
# Leafer: A race native to the Dark Forest of Vasgothia, leafers are sentient plant people.
# Ulkmen: Another race unique to Vasgothia, the ulkmen have been merged with Horrors. In addition to their talents, an ulkman adepts gain a Horror power every four Circles. Despite their origins &amp; horrific appearance, the ulkmen are a largely peaceful people.
# Jubruq: The only &#x27;half-race&#x27; in Earthdawn, jubruq are half human or ork and half elemental spirit. They are native to the Sufik tribes of Marak.
# Jackelmen: Native to Creana, jackalmen have the body of a human and the head of a jackal. They are a warrior people and are thought to practice cannibalism.
# Gar: An Elven like race with considerably shorter lifespan. This is primarily due to their violent lifestyle and high rate of infant mortality. While native to the Cathay region they have mostly been driven out and live around the outskirts of the Five Kingdoms. A Gar&#x27;s primary loyalty is to their tribe with personal glory being a close second.
# Ki Mao: The Ki Mao are another elven race native to the Cathay region that inhabit the Jungle of Endless Wandering. One distinguishing characteristic setting the Ki Mao apart from their elven cousins is their uncanny resemblance to tigers. They have the eyes of a cat as well as distinct patterning along their bodies resembling that of a tiger&#x27;s stripes.
# Po Na: Also found in the Jungle of Endless Wandering, the Po Na are a humanoid race with long, prehensile tails and faces that resemble a cross between a monkey and a human. Po Na tend to be driven heavily by their curiosity while living there daily life and admire quick wit and word play, engaging in verbal jousts as a type of sport.
# Storm Children: At first glance they appear to be abnormally pale humans with solid black hair, their eyes, a solid bluish white without sign of a pupil, are a strikingly none human looking. The Storm Children are born during particularly terrible storms where a lightning bolt will strike the earth leaving behind a naked genderless fully-grown Humanoid. They are born knowing Cathayan, they are driven by a ravenous hunger for knowledge, but for the most part they are subject to the same merits and vices as every other race.

==Game mechanics==
&quot;Earthdawn&quot; stands out from other tabletop RPGs with a unique approach to skill tests. Players wanting to perform an action determine their level or &quot;step&quot; for the skill, talent, or ability to be used. This step can then be looked up in a list of dice to be thrown; it is the next-highest integer of the average roll of the dice(s) in question. For example, two six-sided dice will on average yield a result of 7, thus the step number 8 means that 2d6 will be rolled. The consequence is that each such dice roll has a 50% chance of yielding a result at least as high as the corresponding step number.

The result of each die is added (dice which reach their maximum value are thrown again, adding each maximum to the tally, along with the final result below maximum) and compared to a value decided by the game master/storyteller according to the difficulty of the task. This approach means it&#x27;s always technically possible to succeed with a low step number, yet leaves room for failure on high step numbers. This will sometimes make combat last longer than in other games. As per the above, the difficulty value where the odds of success are perfectly even is identical to the step number.

The dice in steps 3 through 13 form the basis of an 11-Step cycle. To form Steps 14–24, add 1d20. To form Steps 25–35, further add 1d10 + 1d8. For higher cycles, continue alternating between the addition of 1d20 and 1d10 + 1d8. Step 2 is rolled as Step 3, but you subtract 1 from the result. This is notated as &quot;1d4 – 1&quot;. Step 1 is 1d4 – 2.

The 3rd edition changes this by removing d4s and d20s from the system. Steps 6 through 12 (as listed above) form the basis of a 7-Step cycle. To add 7 Steps from then on, simply add 1d12.

The 4th edition changes this by making Steps 8 through 18 form the basis of an 11-Step cycle. To form Steps 19–29, add 1d20. To form Steps 30–41, add 2d20, and so on.

The &quot;Age of Legend&quot; edition departs from the Step System mechanics of previous Earthdawn editions and instead uses a permutation of the rules-lite mechanics of the &quot;Freeform Universal&quot; RPG system by Nathan Russell. In the &quot;Age of Legend&quot; permutation a six-sided die (&quot;d6&quot;) is used with &quot;&quot;but...&quot; and &quot;and...&quot; situational modifiers added to four of the six die faces, and conditionally up to six additional Fudge dice of two differing colors which can alter the initial result of the main d6 die. (Alternatively, the &quot;Age of Legend&quot; edition can be played with just seven standard d6 dice, ideally of three differing colors.) Dice rolls in the &quot;Age of Legend&quot; edition answer closed yes–no questions, with the default question being &quot;Do you get what you want?&quot; subsequent to a character&#x27;s attempt to elicit a desired outcome.

==Reception==
Stewart Wieck reviewed &quot;Earthdawn&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #37 (July/Aug., 1993), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Earthdawn&quot; is a solid game, but the &#x27;innovations&#x27; seem like unnecessary complications. The world is fun, but not fresh. This is not the fantasy game to leave your current campaign for unless you want to bank on the ever-fulfilled FASA promise - an extensive line of support material, much of which will be very good and will undoubtedly add a lot to the game.&quot;

Chris W. McCubbin reviewed &quot;Earthdawn&quot; in &quot;Pyramid&quot; #3 (Sept./Oct., 1993), and stated that &quot;Although it never becomes bogged down in cliches and avoids outmoded concepts, &quot;Earthdawn&quot; is, at heart, a very traditional heroic fantasy RPG.&quot;

In the February 1994 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 202), Rick Swan liked the high production values &quot;highlighted by striking illustrations and FASA’s usual state-of-the-art graphics&quot;, and found that &quot;Thanks to clear writing and sensible organization... it&#x27;s an easy read.&quot; But Swan also found the game setting insubstantial compared to others. &quot;Despite workable rules and a clever setting, &quot;Earthdawn&quot; is more frosting than cake, with little of substance to distinguish it from the competition.&quot; Nevertheless, he found himself drawn to the game. &quot;In a greasy pizza, let’s-not-take-this-too-seriously kind of way, &quot;Earthdawn&quot; holds its own.&quot;

In a 1996 reader poll conducted by &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, &quot;Earthdawn&quot; was ranked 24th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;Very good indeed. &quot;Earthdawn&quot; combined traditional fantasy with &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;-style horror and a detailed background to create an evocative and interesting setting. Combined with a clear, well-designed rules system and an impressive range of supporting supplements and adventures, this is an excellent fantasy game. It&#x27;s also of special interest to fans of &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, because it describes the past of the same gameworld.&quot;

In 1999 &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named &quot;Earthdawn&quot; as one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Underrated Games&quot;. Editor Scott Haring noted (referring to the FASA edition) that &quot;&quot;Earthdawn&quot; had an original, inventive magic system (no mean trick given the hundreds of fantasy RPGs that came before), and a game world that gave you the classic &quot;monsters and dungeons&quot; sort of RPG experience, but made sense doing it.&quot;

In Issue 12 of the Australian game magazine &quot;Australian Realms&quot;, Malcolm Adler thought the rules would satisfy both new and experienced players: &quot;The rules are written in a simple enough form and with plenty of examples so that a new gamer should not get lost. For more experienced gamers there is enough depth in the system to keep the average player happy.&quot; Adler liked the ability of gamemasters to go in new directions, saying, &quot;One of the biggest positives on Earthdawn&#x27;s side is the continual encouragement to do with it what you will.&quot; Adler concluded, &quot;My opinion is that the game is going to be big. I suspect the second biggest RPG in the market is about to arrive. Consequently you owe it to yourself to check it out when it becomes available in August. Give it a good look over and then make your own judgement.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;In a fantasy world, one of the most difficult tasks is conveying that sense of the fantastic. The design of &quot;Earthdawn&quot;, through its careful presentation in both art and text, gives players the necessary details to bring to life a world of wonders as easily as they might conjure a game set in the real world. Once there, players can go forth and forge their own legends.&quot;

<doc id="9790" wikidata="Q690189" url="?curid=9790" title="Electronic data interchange">
<text>Electronic data interchange (EDI) is the concept of businesses electronically communicating information that was traditionally communicated on paper, such as purchase orders, advance ship notices, and invoices. Technical standards for EDI exist to facilitate parties transacting such instruments without having to make special arrangements.

EDI has existed at least since the early 1970s, and there are many EDI standards (including X12, EDIFACT, ODETTE, etc.), some of which address the needs of specific industries or regions. It also refers specifically to a family of standards. In 1996, the National Institute of Standards and Technology defined electronic data interchange as &quot;the computer-to-computer interchange of a standardized format for data exchange. EDI implies a sequence of messages between two parties, either of whom may serve as originator or recipient. The formatted data representing the documents may be transmitted from originator to recipient via telecommunications or physically transported on electronic storage media.&quot; It distinguished mere electronic communication or data exchange, specifying that &quot;in EDI, the usual processing of received messages is by computer only. Human intervention in the processing of a received message is typically intended only for error conditions, for quality review, and for special situations. For example, the transmission of binary or textual data is not EDI as defined here unless the data are treated as one or more data elements of an EDI message and are not normally intended for human interpretation as part of online data processing.&quot; In short, EDI can be defined as the transfer of structured data, by agreed message standards, from one computer system to another without human intervention.

==History==
Like many other early information technologies, EDI was inspired by developments in military logistics. The complexity of the 1948 Berlin airlift required the development of concepts and methods to exchange, sometimes over a 300 baud teletype modem, vast quantities of data and information about transported goods. These initial concepts later shaped the first TDCC (Transportation Data Coordinating Committee) standards in the US. Among the first integrated systems using EDI were Freight Control Systems. One such real-time system was the London Airport Cargo EDP Scheme (LACES) at Heathrow Airport, London, UK, in 1971. Implementing the direct trader input (DTI) method, it allowed forwarding agents to enter information directly into the customs processing system, reducing the time for clearance. The increase of maritime traffic and problems at customs similar to those experienced at Heathrow Airport led to the implementation of DTI systems in individual ports or groups of ports in the 1980s.

==Standards==

EDI provides a technical basis for automated commercial &quot;conversations&quot; between two entities, either internal or external. The term EDI encompasses the entire electronic data interchange process, including the transmission, message flow, document format, and software used to interpret the documents. However, EDI standards describe the rigorous format of electronic documents, and the EDI standards were designed, initially in the automotive industry, to be independent of communication and software technologies.

EDI documents generally contain the same information that would normally be found in a paper document used for the same organizational function. For example, an EDI 940 ship-from-warehouse order is used by a manufacturer to tell a warehouse to ship a product to a retailer. It typically has a &#x27;ship-to&#x27; address, a &#x27;bill-to&#x27; address, and a list of product numbers (usually a UPC) and quantities. Another example is the set of messages between sellers and buyers, such as request for quotation (RFQ), bid in response to RFQ, purchase order, purchase order acknowledgement, shipping notice, receiving advice, invoice, and payment advice. However, EDI is not confined to just business data related to trade but encompasses all fields such as medicine (e.g., patient records and laboratory results), transport (e.g., container and modal information), engineering and construction, etc. In some cases, EDI will be used to create a new business information flow (that was not a paper flow before). This is the case in the Advanced Shipment Notification (ASN) which was designed to inform the receiver of a shipment, the goods to be received and how the goods are packaged. This is further complemented with the shipment&#x27;s use of the shipping labels containing a GS1-128 barcode referencing the shipment&#x27;s tracking number.

Some major sets of EDI standards:
* The UN-recommended UN/EDIFACT is the only international standard and is predominant outside of North America.
* The US standard ANSI ASC X12 (X12) is predominant in North America.
* GS1 EDI set of standards developed the GS1, predominant in global supply chain.
* The TRADACOMS standard developed by the ANA (Article Number Association, now known as GS1 UK) is predominant in the UK retail industry.
* The ODETTE standard used within the European automotive industry.
* The VDA standard used within the European automotive industry, mainly in Germany.
* HL7, a semantic interoperability standard used for healthcare data.
*HIPAA, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability ACT (HIPAA), requires millions of healthcare entities who electronically transmit data to use EDI in a standard HIPAA format.
*IATA Cargo-IMP, IATA Cargo-IMP stands for International Air Transport Association Cargo Interchange Message Procedures. It is an EDI standard based on EDIFACT created to automate and standardize data exchange between airlines and other parties.
*NCPDP Script, SCRIPT is a standard developed and maintained by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP). The standard defines documents for electronic transmission of medical prescriptions in the United States.
* The NCPDP Telecommunications standard includes transactions for eligibility verification, claim and service billing, predetermination of benefits, prior authorization, and information reporting, and is used primarily in the United States.
* Edig@s (EDIGAS) is a standard dealing with commerce, transport (via pipeline or container) and storage of gas.
Many of these standards first appeared in the early to mid-1980s. The standards prescribe the formats, character sets, and data elements used in the exchange of business documents and forms. The complete X12 Document List includes all major business documents, including purchase orders and invoices.

The EDI standard prescribes mandatory and optional information for a particular document and gives the rules for the structure of the document. The standards are like building codes. Just as two kitchens can be built &quot;to code&quot; but look completely different, two EDI documents can follow the same standard and contain different sets of information. For example, a food company may indicate a product&#x27;s expiration date while a clothing manufacturer would choose to send colour and size information.

== Transmission protocols ==
EDI can be transmitted using any methodology agreed to by the sender and recipient, but as more trading partners began using the Internet for transmission, standardized protocols have emerged.

This includes various technologies such as:

* mModem (asynchronous and synchronous)
* FTP, SFTP and FTPS
* Email
* HTTP/HTTPS
* AS1
* AS2
* AS4
* OFTP (and OFTP2)
* Mobile EDI

When some people compared the synchronous protocol 2400 bit/s modems, CLEO devices, and value-added networks used to transmit EDI documents to transmitting via the Internet, they equated the non-Internet technologies with EDI and predicted erroneously that EDI itself would be replaced along with the non-Internet technologies. In most cases, these non-internet transmission methods are simply being replaced by Internet protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, telnet, and e-mail, but the EDI documents themselves still remain.

In 2002, the IETF published RFC 3335, offering a standardized, secure method of transferring EDI data via e-mail. On July 12, 2005, an IETF working group ratified RFC4130 for MIME-based HTTP EDIINT (a.k.a. AS2) transfers, and the IETF has prepared a similar RFC for FTP transfers (a.k.a. AS3). EDI via web services (a.k.a. AS4) has also been standardized by the OASIS standards body. While some EDI transmission has moved to these newer protocols, the providers of value-added networks remain active.

=== Internet ===
As more organizations connected to the Internet, eventually most or all EDI was pushed onto it. Initially, this was through ad hoc conventions, such as unencrypted FTP of ASCII text files to a certain folder on a certain host, permitted only from certain IP addresses. However, the IETF has published several informational documents (the &quot;Applicability Statements&quot;; see below under Protocols) describing ways to use standard internet protocols for EDI.

As of 2002, Walmart has pushed AS2 for EDI. Because of its significant presence in the global supply chain, AS2 has become a commonly adopted approach for EDI.
==Specifications==
Organizations that send or receive documents from each other are referred to as &quot;trading partners&quot; in EDI terminology. The trading partners agree on the specific information to be transmitted and how it should be used. This is done in human-readable specifications (also called Message Implementation Guidelines). While the standards are analogous to building codes, the specifications are analogous to blueprints. (The specification may also be called a &quot;mapping,&quot; but the term mapping is typically reserved for specific machine-readable instructions given to the translation software.) Larger trading &quot;hubs&quot; have existing Message Implementation Guidelines which mirror their business processes for processing EDI and they are usually unwilling to modify their EDI business practices to meet the needs of their trading partners. Often in a large company, these EDI guidelines will be written to be generic enough to be used by different branches or divisions and therefore will contain information not needed for a particular business document exchange. For other large companies, they may create separate EDI guidelines for each branch/division.

==Transmission: Direct EDI and VANs==

Trading partners are free to use any method for the transmission of documents (as described above in the Transmission protocols section). Further, they can either interact directly or through an intermediary.

===Direct EDI: peer-to-peer===

Trading partners can connect directly to each other. For example, an automotive manufacturer might maintain a modem-pool that all of its hundreds of suppliers are required to dial into to perform EDI. However, if a supplier does business with several manufacturers, it may need to acquire a different modem (or VPN device, etc.) and different software for each one.

As EDI and web technology have evolved, new EDI software technologies have emerged to facilitate direct (also known as point-to-point) EDI between trading partners. Modern EDI software can facilitate exchanges using any number of different file transmission protocols and EDI document standards, reducing costs and barriers to entry.

===Value-added networks===

To address the limitations in peer-to-peer adoption of EDI, VANs (value-added networks) were established decades ago. A VAN acts as a regional post office. It receives transactions, examines the &#x27;from&#x27; and the &#x27;to&#x27; information, and routes the transaction to the final recipient. VANs may provide a number of additional services, e.g. retransmitting documents, providing third party audit information, acting as a gateway for different transmission methods, and handling telecommunications support. Because of these and other services VANs provide, businesses frequently use a VAN even when both trading partners are using Internet-based protocols. Healthcare clearinghouses perform many of the same functions as a VAN, but have additional legal restrictions.

VANs may be operated by various entities:
* telecommunication companies;
* industry group consortia;
* a large company interacting with its suppliers/vendors;
*managed services providers.

=== Costs, trade-offs and implementation ===
It is important to note that there are key trade-offs between VANs and Direct EDI, and in many instances, organizations exchanging EDI documents can in fact use both in concert, for different aspects of their EDI implementations. For example, in the U.S., the majority of EDI document exchanges use AS2, so a direct EDI setup for AS2 may make sense for a U.S.-based organization. But adding OFTP2 capabilities to communicate with a European partner may be difficult, so a VAN might make sense to handle those specific transactions, while direct EDI is used for the AS2 transactions.

In many ways, a VAN acts as a service provider, simplifying much of the setup for organizations looking to initiate EDI. Due to the fact that many organizations first starting out with EDI often do so to meet a customer or partner requirement and therefore lack in-house EDI expertise, a VAN can be a valuable asset.

However, VANs may come with high costs. VANs typically charge a per-document or even per-line-item transaction fee to process EDI transactions as a service on behalf of their customers. This is the predominant reason why many organizations also implement an EDI software solution or eventually migrate to one for some or all of their EDI.

On the other hand, implementing EDI software can be a challenging process, depending on the complexity of the use case, technologies involved and availability of EDI expertise. In addition, there are ongoing maintenance requirements and updates to consider. For example, EDI mapping is one of the most challenging EDI management tasks. Companies must develop and maintain EDI maps for each of their trading partners (and sometimes multiple EDI maps for each trading partner based on their order fulfilment requirements).

==Interpreting data==
&quot;EDI translation software&quot; provides the interface between internal systems and the EDI format sent/received. For an &quot;inbound&quot; document, the EDI solution will receive the file (either via a value-added network or directly using protocols such as FTP or AS2), take the received EDI file (commonly referred to as an &quot;envelope&quot;), and validate that the trading partner who is sending the file is a valid trading partner, that the structure of the file meets the EDI standards, and that the individual fields of information conform to the agreed-upon standards. Typically, the translator will either create a file of either fixed length, variable length or XML tagged format or &quot;print&quot; the received EDI document (for non-integrated EDI environments). The next step is to convert/transform the file that the translator creates into a format that can be imported into a company&#x27;s back-end business systems, applications or ERP. This can be accomplished by using a custom program, an integrated proprietary &quot;mapper&quot; or an integrated standards-based graphical &quot;mapper,&quot; using a standard data transformation language such as XSLT. The final step is to import the transformed file (or database) into the company&#x27;s back-end system.

For an &quot;outbound&quot; document, the process for integrated EDI is to export a file (or read a database) from a company&#x27;s information systems and transform the file to the appropriate format for the translator. The translation software will then &quot;validate&quot; the EDI file sent to ensure that it meets the standard agreed upon by the trading partners, convert the file into &quot;EDI&quot; format (adding the appropriate identifiers and control structures) and send the file to the trading partner (using the appropriate communications protocol).

Another critical component of any EDI translation software is a complete &quot;audit&quot; of all the steps to move business documents between trading partners. The audit ensures that any transaction (which in reality is a business document) can be tracked to ensure that they are not lost. In the case of a retailer sending a Purchase Order to a supplier, if the Purchase Order is &quot;lost&quot; anywhere in the business process, the effect is devastating to both businesses. To the supplier, they do not fulfil the order as they have not received it thereby losing business and damaging the business relationship with their retail client. For the retailer, they have a stock outage and the effect is lost sales, reduced customer service and ultimately lower profits.

In EDI terminology, &quot;inbound&quot; and &quot;outbound&quot; refer to the direction of transmission of an EDI document in relation to a particular system, not the direction of merchandise, money or other things represented by the document. For example, an EDI document that tells a warehouse to perform an outbound shipment is an inbound document in relation to the warehouse computer system. It is an outbound document in relation to the manufacturer or dealer that transmitted the document.

==Benefits==
EDI and other similar technologies save costs for businesses by providing an alternative to, or replacement for, information flows which would require a great deal of human interaction and paper documents. Even when paper documents are maintained in parallel with EDI exchange, e.g. printed shipping manifests, electronic exchange and the use of data from that exchange reduces the handling costs of sorting, distributing, organizing, and searching paper documents. EDI and similar technologies allow a company to take advantage of the benefits of storing and manipulating data electronically without the cost of manual entry. Another advantage of EDI is the opportunity to reduce or eliminate manual data entry errors, such as shipping and billing errors, because EDI eliminates the need to re-key documents on the destination side. One very important advantage of EDI over paper documents is the speed at which the trading partner receives and incorporates the information into their system greatly reducing cycle times. For this reason, EDI can be an important component of a just-in-time production system.

A study published in 1996 by Kenneth Kahn and John T. Mentzer observed the use of EDI alliances among companies linked within a supply network, where EDI facilitated more transparent information sharing than had been customary among businesses who only shared information of a &quot;need-to-know&quot; basis. They anticipated the potential for EDI to encompass all the players within a marketing channel with benefits at each stage in the chain. 

According to a 2008 Aberdeen Group report, &quot;A Comparison of Supplier Enablement around the World&quot;, only 34% of purchase orders were then transmitted electronically in North America. In EMEA, 36% of orders were transmitted electronically and in APAC, 41% of orders are transmitted electronically. The report also stated that the average paper requisition to order costs a company in North America, in EMEA and in APAC. With an EDI requisition to order, costs are reduced to in North America, in EMEA and in APAC.

==Barriers to implementation==
There are a few barriers to adopting electronic data interchange. One of the most significant barriers is the accompanying business process change. Existing business processes built around paper handling may not be suited for EDI and would require changes to accommodate automated processing of business documents. For example, a business may receive the bulk of their goods by 1 or 2-day shipping and all of their invoices by mail. The existing process may, therefore, assume that goods are typically received before the invoice. With EDI, the invoice will typically be sent when the goods ship and will, therefore, require a process that handles large numbers of invoices whose corresponding goods have not yet been received.

Another significant barrier is the cost in time and money in the initial setup. The preliminary expenses and time that arise from the implementation, customization and training can be costly. It is important to select the correct level of integration to match the business requirement. For a business with relatively few transactions with EDI-based partners, it may make sense for businesses to implement inexpensive &quot;rip and read&quot; solutions, where the EDI format is printed out in human-readable form, and people — rather than computers — respond to the transaction. Another alternative is outsourced EDI solutions provided by EDI &quot;Service Bureaus&quot;. For other businesses, the implementation of an integrated EDI solution may be necessary as increases in trading volumes brought on by EDI force them to re-implement their order processing business processes.

The key hindrance to a successful implementation of EDI is the perception many businesses have of the nature of EDI. Many view EDI from the technical perspective that EDI is a data format; it would be more accurate to take the business view that EDI is a system for exchanging business documents with external entities, and integrating the data from those documents into the company&#x27;s internal systems. Successful implementations of EDI take into account the effect externally generated information will have on their internal systems and validate the business information received. For example, allowing a supplier to update a retailer&#x27;s accounts payable system without appropriate checks and balances would put the company at significant risk. Businesses new to the implementation of EDI must understand the underlying business process and apply proper judgment.

==Acknowledgement==
There are several mechanisms used in EDI for acknowledgement, i.e. notifying the sender that an incoming transaction was received and handled by the recipient:

* Communication Status – Indicate the transmission completed
* MDN (Message Disposition Notification) – In AS2 only, indicate the message is readable 
* Functional Acknowledgement – typically &quot;997&quot; in ANSI, or &quot;CONTRL&quot; in EDIFACT, which indicate the message content is verified against its template, and tell if the transaction is posted to the receiver&#x27;s electronic system.
* Business Level Acknowledgement – the final indicator shows if the transaction is accepted by the receiver or not.

<text>Extravehicular activity (EVA) is any activity done by an astronaut in outer space outside a spacecraft. In the absence of a breathable Earthlike atmosphere, the astronaut is completely reliant on a space suit for environmental support. EVA includes spacewalks and lunar or planetary surface exploration (commonly known from 1969 to 1972 as moonwalks). In a stand-up EVA (SEVA), an astronaut stands through an open hatch but does not fully leave the spacecraft. EVAs have been conducted by the Soviet Union/Russia, the United States, Canada, the European Space Agency and China.

On March 18, 1965, Alexei Leonov became the first human to perform a spacewalk, exiting the Voskhod 2 capsule for 12 minutes and 9 seconds. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first human to perform a moonwalk, outside his lunar lander on Apollo 11 for 2 hours and 31 minutes. In 1984, Svetlana Savitskaya became the first woman to perform a spacewalk, conducting EVA outside the Salyut 7 space station for 3 hours and 35 minutes. On the last three Moon missions, astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth, to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft. American Astronauts Pete Conrad, Joseph Kerwin, and Paul Weitz also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to Skylab, the United States&#x27; first space station.

EVAs may be either tethered (the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an umbilical cable; no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft), or untethered. Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), and on a flight test in 1994 of the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER), a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs.

==Development history==
NASA planners invented the term &quot;extravehicular activity&quot; (abbreviated with the acronym EVA) in the early 1960s for the Apollo program to land humans on the Moon, because the astronauts would leave the spacecraft to collect lunar material samples and deploy scientific experiments. To support this, and other Apollo objectives, the Gemini program was spun off to develop the capability for astronauts to work outside a two-person Earth orbiting spacecraft. However, the Soviet Union was fiercely competitive in holding the early lead it had gained in crewed spaceflight, so the Soviet Communist Party, led by Nikita Khrushchev, ordered the conversion of its single-pilot Vostok capsule into a two- or three-person craft named Voskhod, in order to compete with Gemini and Apollo. The Soviets were able to launch two Voskhod capsules before U.S. was able to launch its first crewed Gemini.

The Voskhod&#x27;s avionics required cooling by cabin air to prevent any kind of overheating, therefore an airlock was required for the spacewalking cosmonaut to exit and re-enter the cabin while it remained pressurized. Unusually, and by contrast, the Gemini avionics did not require air cooling, allowing the spacewalking astronaut to exit and re-enter the depressurized cabin through an open hatch. Because of this, the American and Soviet space programs developed different definitions for the duration of an EVA. The Soviet (now Russian) definition begins when the outer airlock hatch is open and the cosmonaut is in vacuum. An American EVA began when the astronaut had at least their head outside the spacecraft. The USA has changed its EVA definition since.

===First instance===
The first EVA was performed on March 18, 1965, by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, who spent 12 minutes and 9 seconds outside the Voskhod 2 spacecraft. Carrying a white metal backpack containing 45 minutes&#x27; worth of breathing and pressurization oxygen, Leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his tether. After the flight, he claimed this was easy, but his space suit ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space, stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.

At the end of his space walk, the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem: Leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock, in diameter and long. He improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways. He could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit, risking &quot;the bends&quot;. This added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum, and he was overheated by from the exertion. It would be almost four years before the Soviets tried another EVA. They misrepresented to the press how difficult Leonov found it to work in weightlessness and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the Cold War.

===Project Gemini===
The first American spacewalk was performed on June 3, 1965, by Ed White from the second crewed Gemini flight, Gemini IV, for 21 minutes. White was tethered to the spacecraft, and his oxygen was supplied through a umbilical, which also carried communications and biomedical instrumentation. He was the first to control his motion in space with a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit, which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. White found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around, contrary to Leonov&#x27;s claim. However, a defect in the capsule&#x27;s hatch latching mechanism caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch, which delayed the start of the EVA and put White and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to Earth alive.

No EVAs were planned on the next three Gemini flights. The next EVA was planned to be made by David Scott on Gemini VIII, but that mission had to be aborted due to a critical spacecraft malfunction before the EVA could be conducted. Astronauts on the next three Gemini flights (Eugene Cernan, Michael Collins, and Richard Gordon), performed several EVAs, but none was able to successfully work for long periods outside the spacecraft without tiring and overheating. Cernan attempted but failed to test an Air Force Astronaut Maneuvering Unit which included a self-contained oxygen system.

On November 13, 1966, Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin became the first to successfully work in space without tiring during Gemini XII, the last Gemini mission. Aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6 minutes, in addition to two stand-up EVAs in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes. Aldrin&#x27;s interest in scuba diving inspired the use of underwater EVA training to simulate weightlessness, which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy.

===First crew transfer===
On January 16, 1969, Soviet cosmonauts Aleksei Yeliseyev and Yevgeny Khrunov transferred from Soyuz 5 to Soyuz 4, which were docked together. This was the second Soviet EVA, and it would be almost another nine years before the Soviets performed their third.

===Apollo missions===
American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin performed the first EVA on the lunar surface on July 21, 1969 (UTC), after landing their Apollo 11 Lunar Module spacecraft. This first Moon walk, using self-contained portable life support systems, lasted 2 hours and 36 minutes. A total of fifteen Moon walks were performed among six Apollo crews, including Charles &quot;Pete&quot; Conrad, Alan Bean, Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell, David Scott, James Irwin, John Young, Charles Duke, Eugene Cernan, and Harrison &quot;Jack&quot; Schmitt. Cernan was the last Apollo astronaut to step off the surface of the Moon.

Apollo 15 command module pilot Al Worden made an EVA on August 5, 1971, on the return trip from the Moon, to retrieve a film and data recording canister from the service module. He was assisted by Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin standing up in the Command Module hatch. This procedure was repeated by Ken Mattingly and Charles Duke on Apollo 16, and by Ronald Evans and Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 17.

===Post-Apollo===
The first EVA repairs of a spacecraft were made by Charles &quot;Pete&quot; Conrad, Joseph Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz on May 26, June 7, and June 19, 1973, on the Skylab 2 mission. They rescued the functionality of the launch-damaged Skylab space station by freeing a stuck solar panel, deploying a solar heating shield, and freeing a stuck circuit breaker relay. The Skylab 2 crew made three EVAs, and a total of ten EVAs were made by the three Skylab crews. They found that activities in weightlessness required about 2 times longer than on Earth because many astronauts suffered spacesickness early in their flights.

After Skylab, no more EVAs were made by the United States until the advent of the Space Shuttle program in the early 1980s. In this period, the Soviets resumed EVAs, making four from the Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 space stations between December 20, 1977, and July 30, 1982.

When the United States resumed EVAs on April 7, 1983, astronauts started using an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) for self-contained life support independent of the spacecraft. STS-6 was the first Space Shuttle mission during which a spacewalk was conducted. Also, for the first time, American astronauts used an airlock to enter and exit the spacecraft like the Soviets. Accordingly, the American definition of EVA start time was redefined to when the astronaut switches the EMU to battery power.

Numerous EVAs were conducted during the assembly of the ISS, often using the Quest Joint Airlock, designed to support both US EMUs, and Russian Orlan space suits.

===By China===

China became the third country to independently carry out an EVA on September 27, 2008, during the Shenzhou 7 mission. Chinese taikonaut Zhai Zhigang completed a 22-minute spacewalk wearing the Chinese-developed Feitian space suit, with taikonaut Liu Boming wearing the Russian-derived Orlan space suit assisting him in the process. Zhai completely exited the craft, while Liu stood by at the airlock, straddling the portal.

Since 2021, China has carried out several more EVAs lasting several hours for the construction of the Tiangong space station. In December 2024 China&#x27;s Cai Xuzhe and Song Lingdong set the current record for the longest EVA at 9 hours and six minutes. 

=== By SpaceX ===
American company SpaceX conducted the first private sector-financed EVA on September 12, 2024. Entrepreneur Jared Isaacman and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis briefly ventured outside a Dragon capsule, for a stand-up EVA (SEVA) during the Polaris Dawn mission to conduct spacesuit mobility testing. The other two crew members were exposed to the vacuum of space in the capsule, but did not leave it. SpaceX plans to launch at least two more missions involving an EVA, including one that involves SpaceX&#x27;s still-in-development Starship launch vehicle.

==Milestones==

===Capability milestones===
* The first untethered spacewalk was made by American Bruce McCandless II on February 7, 1984, during the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; mission STS-41-B, using the Manned Maneuvering Unit. He was subsequently joined by Robert L. Stewart during the 5-hour, 55-minute spacewalk. A self-contained spacewalk was first attempted by Eugene Cernan in 1966 on Gemini 9A, but Cernan could not reach the maneuvering unit without tiring.
* The first metalwork in open space, consisting of welding, brazing and metal spraying, was conducted by Soviet cosmonauts Svetlana Savitskaya and Vladimir Dzhanibekov on July 25, 1984. A specially designed multipurpose tool was used to perform these activities during a 3-hour, 30-minute EVA outside the Salyut 7 space station.
* The first three-person EVA was performed on May 13, 1992, as the third EVA of STS-49, the maiden flight of &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Pierre Thuot, Richard Hieb, and Thomas Akers conducted the EVA to hand-capture and repair a non-functional Intelsat VI-F3 satellite. it was the only three-person EVA.
* The first EVA to perform an in-flight repair of the Space Shuttle was by American Steve Robinson on August 3, 2005, during &quot;Return to Flight&quot; mission STS-114. Robinson was sent to remove two protruding gap fillers from &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s heat shield, after engineers determined there was a small chance they could affect the shuttle upon re-entry. Robinson successfully removed the loose material while &quot;Discovery&quot; was docked to the International Space Station.
* The longest spacewalk is 9 hours and six minutes performed by Cai Xuzhe and Song Lingdong on December 17, 2024. The previous record was held by USA astronauts James Voss and Susan Helms, who made eight hours and 56 minutes EVA outside Space Shuttle Discovery on March 11, 2001.

==Commemoration==
The first spacewalk, made by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, was commemorated in 1965 with several Eastern Bloc stamps (see Alexei Leonov#Stamps). Since the Soviet Union did not publish details of the Voskhod spacecraft at the time, the spaceship depiction in the stamps was purely fictional.

The U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp in 1967 commemorating Ed White&#x27;s first American spacewalk. The engraved image has an accurate depiction of the Gemini IV spacecraft and White&#x27;s space suit.

==Designations==
NASA &quot;spacewalkers&quot; during the Space Shuttle program were designated as EV-1, EV-2, EV-3 and EV-4 (assigned to mission specialists for each mission, if applicable).

==Camp-out procedure==
For EVAs from the International Space Station, NASA employed a &quot;camp-out&quot; procedure to reduce the risk of decompression sickness. This was first tested by the Expedition 12 crew. During a camp-out, astronauts sleep overnight in the airlock prior to an EVA, lowering the air pressure to , compared to the normal station pressure of . Spending a night at the lower air pressure helps flush nitrogen from the body, thereby preventing &quot;the bends&quot;. More recently astronauts have been using the In-Suit Light Exercise protocol rather than camp-out to prevent decompression sickness.

<doc id="9799" wikidata="Q232019" url="?curid=9799" title="Erin Brockovich">
<text>Erin Brockovich (née Pattee; born June 22, 1960) is an American paralegal, consumer advocate, and environmental activist who was instrumental in building a case against Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company (PG&amp;E) involving groundwater contamination in Hinkley, California for attorney Ed Masry in 1993. Their successful lawsuit was the subject of the Oscar-nominated film, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000), starring Julia Roberts as Brockovich and Albert Finney as Masry.

Since then, Brockovich has become a media personality, hosting the TV series &quot;Challenge America with Erin Brockovich&quot; on ABC and &quot;Final Justice&quot; on Zone Reality, and became president of Brockovich Research &amp; Consulting. She also works as a consultant for the New York law firm of Weitz &amp; Luxenberg, which has a focus on personal injury claims for asbestos exposure, and Shine Lawyers in Australia. She worked as a consultant for the now-defunct California law firm Girardi &amp; Keese.

==Early life==
Erin Pattee Brockovich was born in Lawrence, Kansas, the daughter of Betty Jo (née O&#x27;Neal; 1923–2008), a journalist, and Frank Pattee, an industrial engineer and football player. She has two brothers, Frank Jr. and Thomas (1954–1992), and a sister, Jodie. She graduated from Lawrence High School, then attended Kansas State University, in Manhattan, Kansas, and graduated with an Associate in Applied Arts Degree from Wade College in Dallas, Texas.

==Pacific Gas &amp; Electric litigation==

In 1993, Brockovich became a whistleblower when she spoke out against PG&amp;E after finding widespread unexplained illness in the town of Hinkley, California. She became instrumental in suing the utility company on behalf of the town.
The case (&quot;Anderson, et al. v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric,&quot; file BCV 00300) alleged contamination of drinking water with hexavalent chromium (also written as &quot;chromium 6&quot;, &quot;chromium VI&quot;, &quot;Cr-VI&quot; or &quot;Cr-6&quot;) in the town. At the center of the case was the Hinkley compressor station, built in 1952 as a part of a natural-gas pipeline connecting to the San Francisco Bay Area. Between 1952 and 1966, PG&amp;E used hexavalent chromium in a cooling tower system to fight corrosion. The waste water was discharged to unlined ponds at the site, and some of the waste water percolated into the groundwater, affecting an area of approximately near the plant. The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) put the PG&amp;E site under its regulations in 1968.

The case was settled in 1996 for $333 million ($666.6 million in 2024), the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in United States history to that date. Masry &amp; Vititoe, the law firm for which Brockovich was a legal clerk, received $133.6 million ($273.4 million in 2024) of that settlement, and Brockovich received $2.5 million as part of her fee.

A study released in 2010 by the California Cancer Registry suggested that cancer rates in Hinkley &quot;remained unremarkable from 1988 to 2008&quot;. John W. Morgan, an epidemiologist involved in the study said that the 196 cases of cancer reported during the most recent survey of 1996 through 2008 were fewer than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer. However, in June 2013, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine featured a critique from the Center for Public Integrity of the author&#x27;s work on the later epidemiological studies, pointing out, for example, that the affected area of Hinkley had been bulldozed by 1996.

, average Cr-6 levels for water from wells in Hinkley were still peaking at 100 times California&#x27;s maximum contaminant level for the compound at over 1,000 parts per billion, even though, by 2021, PG&amp;E claimed they had cleaned up 70% of the contamination. In October 2022, even though the EPA announced Cr-6 was likely carcinogenic if consumed in drinking water, The American Chemistry Council, an industry lobby group, disputed their finding.

==Other litigation==
Working with Edward L. Masry, a lawyer based in Thousand Oaks, California, Brockovich went on to participate in other anti-pollution lawsuits. One suit accused the Whitman Corporation of chromium contamination in Willits, California. Another, which listed 1,200 plaintiffs, alleged contamination near PG&amp;E&#x27;s Kettleman Hills compressor station in Kings County, California, along the same pipeline as the Hinkley site. The Kettleman suit was settled for $335 million in 2006.

In 2003, after experiencing problems with mold contamination in her own home in the Conejo Valley, Brockovich received settlements of $430,000 from two parties, and an undisclosed amount from a third party, to settle her lawsuit alleging toxic mold in her Agoura Hills, California, home. Brockovich then became a prominent activist and educator in the area as well.

Brockovich and Masry filed suit against the Beverly Hills Unified School District in 2003, in which the district was accused of harming the health and safety of its students by allowing a contractor to operate a cluster of oil wells on campus. Brockovich and Masry alleged that 300 cancer cases were linked to the oil wells. Subsequent testing and epidemiological investigation failed to corroborate a substantial link, and Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Wendell Mortimer granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs. In May 2007, the school district announced that it was to be paid $450,000 as reimbursement for legal expenses.

Brockovich assisted in the filing of a lawsuit against Prime Tanning Corp. of St. Joseph, Missouri, in April 2009. The lawsuit claims that waste sludge from the production of leather, containing high levels of hexavalent chromium, was distributed to farmers in northwest Missouri to use as fertilizer on their fields. It is believed to be a potential cause of an abnormally high number of brain tumors around the town of Cameron, Missouri. Prior to the lawsuit, the site was investigated by the EPA and at the time, the agency found &quot;no detections of total chromium&quot;, and added, &quot;we would like to get any specific information from this law firm as soon as we can so we can evaluate it, and we intend to ask for that directly.&quot; The EPA, Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Missouri Department of Health and a state epidemiologist had been investigating what residents believed were a high number of brain tumors in the area — more than 70 since 1996. The epidemiologist had stated the numbers did not seem abnormally high.

In June 2009, Brockovich began investigating a case of contaminated water in Midland, Texas. &quot;Significant amounts&quot; of hexavalent chromium were found in the water of more than 40 homes in the area, some of which have now been fitted with state-monitored filters on their water supply. Brockovich said: &quot;The only difference between here and Hinkley is that I saw higher levels here than I saw in Hinkley.&quot;

In 2012, Brockovich became involved in the mysterious case of 14 students from LeRoy, New York, who began reporting perplexing medical symptoms, including tics and speech difficulties. Brockovich believed environmental pollution from the 1970 Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment was the cause and conducted testing in the area. Brockovich was supposed to return to LeRoy to present her findings, but never did; in the meantime, the students&#x27; doctors determined the cause was mass psychogenic illness, and that the media exposure was exacerbating the symptoms. No environmental causes were found after repeat testing, and the students improved once the media attention died down.

In early 2016, Brockovich became involved in potential litigation against Southern California Gas for the Aliso Canyon gas leak, a large methane leak from its underground storage facility near the community of Porter Ranch, north of Los Angeles.
In early 2023, within hours of the Feb. 3 Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, Brockovich started getting calls for assistance from the community about the toxic chemical fires. She has been interviewed on various news outlets, from independent media to national networks. A few weeks later, Brockovich traveled to East Palestine, where she was interviewed by local media, and appeared at one of several high-profile town hall meetings on Friday night, Feb. 24th. At the meeting, Brockovich and an attorney highlighted decades of toxic chemical train derailments. Among Brockovich&#x27;s many concerns is the potential groundwater contamination after chemicals were, as she describes it, dumped in a big hole in the ground and burned off. A recurring theme of her appearances is that the nation has, for decades, in the name of profits over people, failed to undertake infrastructure improvements, enact tighter regulations, and adequately protect the health, safety and welfare of communities from long-term bodily harm and environmental damage. Brockovich continues to cite the Hinkley case and Flint water crisis, as well as the 2013 Lac-Megantic, Canada oil train catastrophe.

==Movies and television==
Brockovich&#x27;s work in bringing litigation against Pacific Gas &amp; Electric was the focus of the 2000 feature film &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, starring Julia Roberts in the title role. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay. Roberts won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich. Brockovich herself had a cameo role as a waitress named Julia.

Brockovich had a more extensive role in the 2012 documentary &quot;Last Call at the Oasis&quot;, which focused on not only water pollution but also the overall state of water scarcity as it relates to water policy in the United States.

On April 8, 2021, &quot;Rebel&quot;, a television series which creator Krista Vernoff loosely based on Brockovich&#x27;s life, premiered on ABC.

==Books and articles==
Brockovich&#x27;s first book, &quot;Take It from Me: Life&#x27;s a Struggle But You Can Win&quot; (), was published in 2001. A second book, &quot;Superman&#x27;s Not Coming&quot;, was released on August 25, 2020.

In 2021, Brockovich wrote about hormone-disrupting chemicals (such as PFAS) eroding human fertility at an alarming rate.

On February 8, 2022, Brockovich wrote an article talking about the case of Steven Donziger, a lawyer who won an $18 billion judgment against Chevron before being jailed for contempt of court after refusing to turn his phone and computer over to Chevron&#x27;s legal team.

==Personal life==
Brockovich has three children: a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Katie, from her first marriage to Shawn Brown, and a daughter, Elizabeth, from her second marriage to Steven Brockovich. Her third husband was actor and country-musician DJ, Eric L. Ellis. As of 2016, Brockovich resides in Agoura Hills, California, in a house she purchased in 1996 with her US$2.5 million bonus after the Hinkley settlement. Brockovich has been dyslexic since her youth.

<doc id="9804" wikidata="Q1111" url="?curid=9804" title="Electric charge">
<text>Electric charge (symbol &quot;q&quot;, sometimes &quot;Q&quot;) is a physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. Electric charge can be &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot;. Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. An object with no net charge is referred to as electrically neutral. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that do not require consideration of quantum effects.

Electric charge is a conserved property: the net charge of an isolated system, the quantity of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge, cannot change. Electric charge is carried by subatomic particles. In ordinary matter, negative charge is carried by electrons, and positive charge is carried by the protons in the nuclei of atoms. If there are more electrons than protons in a piece of matter, it will have a negative charge, if there are fewer it will have a positive charge, and if there are equal numbers it will be neutral. Charge is &quot;quantized&quot;: it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the elementary charge, &quot;e&quot;, about which is the smallest charge that can exist freely. Particles called quarks have smaller charges, multiples of &quot;e&quot;, but they are found only combined in particles that have a charge that is an integer multiple of &quot;e&quot;. In the Standard Model, charge is an absolutely conserved quantum number. The proton has a charge of +&quot;e&quot;, and the electron has a charge of −&quot;e&quot;.

Today, a negative charge is defined as the charge carried by an electron and a positive charge is that carried by a proton. Before these particles were discovered, a positive charge was defined by Benjamin Franklin as the charge acquired by a glass rod when it is rubbed with a silk cloth.

Electric charges produce electric fields. A moving charge also produces a magnetic field. The interaction of electric charges with an electromagnetic field (a combination of an electric and a magnetic field) is the source of the electromagnetic (or Lorentz) force, which is one of the four fundamental interactions in physics. The study of photon-mediated interactions among charged particles is called quantum electrodynamics.

The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C) named after French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. In electrical engineering it is also common to use the ampere-hour (A⋅h). In physics and chemistry it is common to use the elementary charge (&quot;e&quot;) as a unit. Chemistry also uses the Faraday constant, which is the charge of one mole of elementary charges.

== Overview ==
Charge is the fundamental property of matter that exhibits electrostatic attraction or repulsion in the presence of other matter with charge. Electric charge is a characteristic property of many subatomic particles. The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the elementary charge &quot;e&quot;; we say that electric charge is &quot;quantized&quot;. Michael Faraday, in his electrolysis experiments, was the first to note the discrete nature of electric charge. Robert Millikan&#x27;s oil drop experiment demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge. It has been discovered that one type of particle, quarks, have fractional charges of either − or +, but it is believed they always occur in multiples of integral charge; free-standing quarks have never been observed.

By convention, the charge of an electron is negative, &quot;−e&quot;, while that of a proton is positive, &quot;+e&quot;. Charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one another, and particles whose charges have different signs attract. Coulomb&#x27;s law quantifies the electrostatic force between two particles by asserting that the force is proportional to the product of their charges, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The charge of an antiparticle equals that of the corresponding particle, but with opposite sign.

The electric charge of a macroscopic object is the sum of the electric charges of the particles that it is made up of. This charge is often small, because matter is made of atoms, and atoms typically have equal numbers of protons and electrons, in which case their charges cancel out, yielding a net charge of zero, thus making the atom neutral.

An &quot;ion&quot; is an atom (or group of atoms) that has lost one or more electrons, giving it a net positive charge (cation), or that has gained one or more electrons, giving it a net negative charge (anion). &quot;Monatomic ions&quot; are formed from single atoms, while &quot;polyatomic ions&quot; are formed from two or more atoms that have been bonded together, in each case yielding an ion with a positive or negative net charge.
During the formation of macroscopic objects, constituent atoms and ions usually combine to form structures composed of neutral &quot;ionic compounds&quot; electrically bound to neutral atoms. Thus macroscopic objects tend toward being neutral overall, but macroscopic objects are rarely perfectly net neutral.

Sometimes macroscopic objects contain ions distributed throughout the material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive elements can more or less easily (depending on the element) take on or give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and motionless, the phenomenon is known as static electricity. This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing amber with fur or glass with silk. In this way, non-conductive materials can be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of &quot;conservation of charge&quot; always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge is taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.

Even when an object&#x27;s net charge is zero, the charge can be distributed non-uniformly in the object (e.g., due to an external electromagnetic field, or bound polar molecules). In such cases, the object is said to be polarized. The charge due to polarization is known as bound charge, while the charge on an object produced by electrons gained or lost from outside the object is called &quot;free charge&quot;. The motion of electrons in conductive metals in a specific direction is known as electric current.

== Unit ==

The SI unit of quantity of electric charge is the coulomb (symbol: C). The coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge that passes through the cross section of an electrical conductor carrying one ampere for one second. This unit was proposed in 1946 and ratified in 1948. The lowercase symbol &quot;q&quot; is often used to denote a quantity of electric charge. The quantity of electric charge can be directly measured with an electrometer, or indirectly measured with a ballistic galvanometer.

The elementary charge is defined as a fundamental constant in the SI. The value for elementary charge, when expressed in SI units, is exactly 

After discovering the quantized character of charge, in 1891, George Stoney proposed the unit &#x27;electron&#x27; for this fundamental unit of electrical charge. J. J. Thomson subsequently discovered the particle that we now call the electron in 1897. The unit is today referred to as , , or simply denoted &quot;e&quot;, with the charge of an electron being −&quot;e&quot;. The charge of an isolated system should be a multiple of the elementary charge &quot;e&quot;, even if at large scales charge seems to behave as a continuous quantity. In some contexts it is meaningful to speak of fractions of an elementary charge; for example, in the fractional quantum Hall effect.

The unit faraday is sometimes used in electrochemistry. One faraday is the magnitude of the charge of one mole of elementary charges, i.e. 

== History ==
From ancient times, people were familiar with four types of phenomena that today would all be explained using the concept of electric charge: (a) lightning, (b) the torpedo fish (or electric ray), (c) St Elmo&#x27;s Fire, and (d) that amber rubbed with fur would attract small, light objects. The first account of the is often attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus, who lived from c. 624 to c. 546 BC, but there are doubts about whether Thales left any writings; his account about amber is known from an account from early 200s. This account can be taken as evidence that the phenomenon was known since at least c. 600 BC, but Thales explained this phenomenon as evidence for inanimate objects having a soul. In other words, there was no indication of any conception of electric charge. More generally, the ancient Greeks did not understand the connections among these four kinds of phenomena. The Greeks observed that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair. They also found that if they rubbed the amber for long enough, they could even get an electric spark to jump, but there is also a claim that no mention of electric sparks appeared until late 17th century. This property derives from the triboelectric effect.
In late 1100s, the substance jet, a compacted form of coal, was noted to have an amber effect, and in the middle of the 1500s, Girolamo Fracastoro, discovered that diamond also showed this effect. Some efforts were made by Fracastoro and others, especially Gerolamo Cardano to develop explanations for this phenomenon.

In contrast to astronomy, mechanics, and optics, which had been studied quantitatively since antiquity, the start of ongoing qualitative and quantitative research into electrical phenomena can be marked with the publication of &quot;De Magnete&quot; by the English scientist William Gilbert in 1600. In this book, there was a small section where Gilbert returned to the amber effect (as he called it) in addressing many of the earlier theories, and coined the Neo-Latin word &quot;electrica&quot; (from (ēlektron), the Greek word for &quot;amber&quot;). The Latin word was translated into English as . Gilbert is also credited with the term &quot;electrical&quot;, while the term &quot;electricity&quot; came later, first attributed to Sir Thomas Browne in his Pseudodoxia Epidemica from 1646. (For more linguistic details see Etymology of electricity.) Gilbert hypothesized that this amber effect could be explained by an effluvium (a small stream of particles that flows from the electric object, without diminishing its bulk or weight) that acts on other objects. This idea of a material electrical effluvium was influential in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was a precursor to ideas developed in the 18th century about &quot;electric fluid&quot; (Dufay, Nollet, Franklin) and &quot;electric charge&quot;.

Around 1663 Otto von Guericke invented what was probably the first electrostatic generator, but he did not recognize it primarily as an electrical device and only conducted minimal electrical experiments with it. Other European pioneers were Robert Boyle, who in 1675 published the first book in English that was devoted solely to electrical phenomena. His work was largely a repetition of Gilbert&#x27;s studies, but he also identified several more &quot;electrics&quot;, and noted mutual attraction between two bodies.

In 1729 Stephen Gray was experimenting with static electricity, which he generated using a glass tube. He noticed that a cork, used to protect the tube from dust and moisture, also became electrified (charged). Further experiments (e.g., extending the cork by putting thin sticks into it) showed—for the first time—that electrical effluvia (as Gray called it) could be transmitted (conducted) over a distance. Gray managed to transmit charge with twine (765 feet) and wire (865 feet). Through these experiments, Gray discovered the importance of different materials, which facilitated or hindered the conduction of electrical effluvia. John Theophilus Desaguliers, who repeated many of Gray&#x27;s experiments, is credited with coining the terms conductors and insulators to refer to the effects of different materials in these experiments. Gray also discovered electrical induction (i.e., where charge could be transmitted from one object to another without any direct physical contact). For example, he showed that by bringing a charged glass tube close to, but not touching, a lump of lead that was sustained by a thread, it was possible to make the lead become electrified (e.g., to attract and repel brass filings). He attempted to explain this phenomenon with the idea of electrical effluvia.

Gray&#x27;s discoveries introduced an important shift in the historical development of knowledge about electric charge. The fact that electrical effluvia could be transferred from one object to another, opened the theoretical possibility that this property was not inseparably connected to the bodies that were electrified by rubbing. In 1733 Charles François de Cisternay du Fay, inspired by Gray&#x27;s work, made a series of experiments (reported in &quot;Mémoires de l&#x27;Académie Royale des Sciences&quot;), showing that more or less all substances could be &#x27;electrified&#x27; by rubbing, except for metals and fluids and proposed that electricity comes in two varieties that cancel each other, which he expressed in terms of a two-fluid theory. When glass was rubbed with silk, du Fay said that the glass was charged with &quot;vitreous electricity&quot;, and, when amber was rubbed with fur, the amber was charged with &quot;resinous electricity&quot;. In contemporary understanding, positive charge is now defined as the charge of a glass rod after being rubbed with a silk cloth, but it is arbitrary which type of charge is called positive and which is called negative. Another important two-fluid theory from this time was proposed by Jean-Antoine Nollet (1745).

Up until about 1745, the main explanation for electrical attraction and repulsion was the idea that electrified bodies gave off an effluvium.
Benjamin Franklin started electrical experiments in late 1746, and by 1750 had developed a one-fluid theory of electricity, based on an experiment that showed that a rubbed glass received the same, but opposite, charge strength as the cloth used to rub the glass. Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in all matter and coined the term itself (as well as battery and some others); for example, he believed that it was the glass in a Leyden jar that held the accumulated charge. He posited that rubbing insulating surfaces together caused this fluid to change location, and that a flow of this fluid constitutes an electric current. He also posited that when matter contained an excess of the fluid it was charged and when it had a deficit it was charged. He identified the term with vitreous electricity and with resinous electricity after performing an experiment with a glass tube he had received from his overseas colleague Peter Collinson. The experiment had participant A charge the glass tube and participant B receive a shock to the knuckle from the charged tube. Franklin identified participant B to be positively charged after having been shocked by the tube. There is some ambiguity about whether William Watson independently arrived at the same one-fluid explanation around the same time (1747). Watson, after seeing Franklin&#x27;s letter to Collinson, claims that he had presented the same explanation as Franklin in spring 1747. Franklin had studied some of Watson&#x27;s works prior to making his own experiments and analysis, which was probably significant for Franklin&#x27;s own theorizing. One physicist suggests that Watson first proposed a one-fluid theory, which Franklin then elaborated further and more influentially. A historian of science argues that Watson missed a subtle difference between his ideas and Franklin&#x27;s, so that Watson misinterpreted his ideas as being similar to Franklin&#x27;s. In any case, there was no animosity between Watson and Franklin, and the Franklin model of electrical action, formulated in early 1747, eventually became widely accepted at that time. After Franklin&#x27;s work, effluvia-based explanations were rarely put forward.

It is now known that the Franklin model was fundamentally correct. There is only one kind of electrical charge, and only one variable is required to keep track of the amount of charge.

Until 1800 it was only possible to study conduction of electric charge by using an electrostatic discharge. In 1800 Alessandro Volta was the first to show that charge could be maintained in continuous motion through a closed path.

In 1833, Michael Faraday sought to remove any doubt that electricity is identical, regardless of the source by which it is produced. He discussed a variety of known forms, which he characterized as common electricity (e.g., static electricity, piezoelectricity, magnetic induction), voltaic electricity (e.g., electric current from a voltaic pile), and animal electricity (e.g., bioelectricity).

In 1838, Faraday raised a question about whether electricity was a fluid or fluids or a property of matter, like gravity. He investigated whether matter could be charged with one kind of charge independently of the other. He came to the conclusion that electric charge was a relation between two or more bodies, because he could not charge one body without having an opposite charge in another body.

In 1838, Faraday also put forth a theoretical explanation of electric force, while expressing neutrality about whether it originates from one, two, or no fluids. He focused on the idea that the normal state of particles is to be nonpolarized, and that when polarized, they seek to return to their natural, nonpolarized state.

In developing a field theory approach to electrodynamics (starting in the mid-1850s), James Clerk Maxwell stops considering electric charge as a special substance that accumulates in objects, and starts to understand electric charge as a consequence of the transformation of energy in the field. This pre-quantum understanding considered magnitude of electric charge to be a continuous quantity, even at the microscopic level.

== Role of charge in static electricity ==
Static electricity refers to the electric charge of an object and the related electrostatic discharge when two objects are brought together that are not at equilibrium. An electrostatic discharge creates a change in the charge of each of the two objects.

=== Electrification by sliding ===
When a piece of glass and a piece of resin—neither of which exhibit any electrical properties—are rubbed together and left with the rubbed surfaces in contact, they still exhibit no electrical properties. When separated, they attract each other.

A second piece of glass rubbed with a second piece of resin, then separated and suspended near the former pieces of glass and resin causes these phenomena:
* The two pieces of glass repel each other.
* Each piece of glass attracts each piece of resin.
* The two pieces of resin repel each other.

This attraction and repulsion is an &quot;electrical phenomenon&quot;, and the bodies that exhibit them are said to be &quot;electrified&quot;, or &quot;electrically charged&quot;. Bodies may be electrified in many other ways, as well as by sliding. The electrical properties of the two pieces of glass are similar to each other but opposite to those of the two pieces of resin: The glass attracts what the resin repels and repels what the resin attracts.

If a body electrified in any manner whatsoever behaves as the glass does, that is, if it repels the glass and attracts the resin, the body is said to be &quot;vitreously&quot; electrified, and if it attracts the glass and repels the resin it is said to be &quot;resinously&quot; electrified. All electrified bodies are either vitreously or resinously electrified.

An established convention in the scientific community defines vitreous electrification as positive, and resinous electrification as negative. The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of electrification justify our indicating them by opposite signs, but the application of the positive sign to one rather than to the other kind must be considered as a matter of arbitrary convention—just as it is a matter of convention in mathematical diagram to reckon positive distances towards the right hand.

== Role of charge in electric current ==
Electric current is the flow of electric charge through an object. The most common charge carriers are the positively charged proton and the negatively charged electron. The movement of any of these charged particles constitutes an electric current. In many situations, it suffices to speak of the &quot;conventional current&quot; without regard to whether it is carried by positive charges moving in the direction of the conventional current or by negative charges moving in the opposite direction. This macroscopic viewpoint is an approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and calculations.

At the opposite extreme, if one looks at the microscopic situation, one sees there are many ways of carrying an electric current, including: a flow of electrons; a flow of electron holes that act like positive particles; and both negative and positive particles (ions or other charged particles) flowing in opposite directions in an electrolytic solution or a plasma.

Beware that, in the common and important case of metallic wires, the direction of the conventional current is opposite to the drift velocity of the actual charge carriers; i.e., the electrons. This is a source of confusion for beginners.

== Conservation of electric charge ==
The total electric charge of an isolated system remains constant regardless of changes within the system itself. This law is inherent to all processes known to physics and can be derived in a local form from gauge invariance of the wave function. The conservation of charge results in the charge-current continuity equation. More generally, the rate of change in charge density &quot;ρ&quot; within a volume of integration &quot;V&quot; is equal to the area integral over the current density J through the closed surface &quot;S&quot; = ∂&quot;V&quot;, which is in turn equal to the net current &quot;I&quot;:

Thus, the conservation of electric charge, as expressed by the continuity equation, gives the result:
: formula_1

The charge transferred between times formula_2 and formula_3 is obtained by integrating both sides:
: formula_4
where &quot;I&quot; is the net outward current through a closed surface and &quot;q&quot; is the electric charge contained within the volume defined by the surface.

== Relativistic invariance ==
Aside from the properties described in articles about electromagnetism, electric charge is a relativistic invariant. This means that any particle that has electric charge &quot;q&quot; has the same electric charge regardless of how fast it is travelling. This property has been experimentally verified by showing that the electric charge of one helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons bound together in a nucleus and moving around at high speeds) is the same as that of two deuterium nuclei (one proton and one neutron bound together, but moving much more slowly than they would if they were in a helium nucleus).

<text>Ellis Island is a federally owned island in New York Harbor, situated within the U.S. states of New Jersey and New York. Ellis Island was once the busiest immigrant inspection and processing station in the United States. From 1892 to 1954, nearly 12 million immigrants arriving at the Port of New York and New Jersey were processed there; as many as two-fifths of Americans may be descended from these immigrants. It has been part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument since 1965 and is accessible to the public only by ferry. The north side of the island is a national museum of immigration, while the south side of the island, including the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, is open to the public through guided tours.

The name derives from Samuel Ellis, a Welshman who bought the island in 1774. In the 19th century, Ellis Island was the site of Fort Gibson and later became a naval magazine. The first inspection station opened in 1892 and was destroyed by fire in 1897. The second station opened in 1900 and housed facilities for medical quarantines and processing immigrants. After 1924, Ellis Island was used primarily as a detention center for migrants. During both World War I and World War II, its facilities were also used by the US military to detain prisoners of war. After the immigration station&#x27;s closure, the buildings languished for several years until they were partially reopened in 1976. The main building and adjacent structures were completely renovated into a museum in 1990.

The island was expanded by land reclamation between the late 1890s and the 1930s and, at one point, consisted of three islands numbered 1, 2, and 3. Jurisdictional disputes between the states of New Jersey and New York persisted until the 1998 U.S. Supreme Court ruling &quot;New Jersey v. New York&quot;. The Supreme Court ruled that, while most of the island is in New Jersey, the natural portion of the island (on the northern end) is an exclave of New York. The northern half of Ellis Island comprises the former Island 1 and includes the main building, several ancillary structures, and the Wall of Honor. The hospital structures on the island&#x27;s southern half occupy the former sites of islands 2 and 3, and there is a ferry building between Ellis Island&#x27;s northern and southern halves. Historically, immigrants were subjected to medical and primary inspections, and they could be detained or deported. The island is commemorated through the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, and it has received several federal, state, and municipal landmark designations.

==Geography and access==
Ellis Island is in New York Harbor, east of Liberty State Park and north of Liberty Island. While most of the island is in Jersey City, New Jersey, a small section is an exclave of New York City. The island has a land area of , much of which is from land reclamation. The natural island and contiguous areas comprise within New York, and are located on the northern portion of the present-day island. The artificial land is part of New Jersey. The island has been owned and administered by the federal government of the United States since 1808 and operated by the National Park Service since 1965.

===Land expansion===

Initially, much of the Upper New York Bay&#x27;s western shore consisted of large tidal flats with vast oyster beds, which were a major source of food for the Lenape. Ellis Island was one of three &quot;Oyster Islands,&quot; the other two being Liberty Island and the now-subsumed Black Tom Island. In the late 19th century, the federal government began expanding the island by land reclamation to accommodate its immigration station, and the expansions continued until 1934.

The National Park Service cites the fill as supposedly having been acquired from the ballast of ships, as well as material excavated from the first line of the New York City Subway; however, &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that there is no evidence of subway fill being transported to the island. It also may have come from the railyards of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey. It eventually obliterated the oyster beds, engulfed one of the Oyster Islands, and brought the shoreline much closer to the others.

The current island is shaped like a &quot;C&quot;, with two landmasses of equal size on the northeastern and southwestern sides, separated by what was formerly a ferry pier. It was originally three separate islands. The current north side, formerly called island 1, contains the original island and the fill around it. The current south side was composed of island 2, created in 1899, and island 3, created in 1906. Two eastward-facing ferry docks separated the three numbered landmasses.

The fill was retained with a system of wood piles and cribbing, and later encased with more than 7,700 linear feet of concrete and granite sea wall. It was placed atop either wood piles, cribbing, or submerged bags of concrete. In the 1920s, the second ferry basin between islands 2 and 3 was infilled to create the great lawn, forming the current south side of Ellis Island. As part of the project, a concrete and granite seawall was built to connect the tip of these landmasses.

===State sovereignty dispute===
The circumstances which led to an exclave of New York being located within New Jersey began in the colonial era, after the British takeover of New Netherland in 1664. A clause in the colonial land grant outlined the territory that the proprietors of New Jersey would receive as being &quot;westward of Long Island, and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson&#x27;s river.&quot;

As early as 1804, attempts were made to resolve the status of the state line. The government of New York City claimed the right to regulate trade on all waters. This was contested in &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;, which decided that the regulation of interstate commerce fell under the authority of the federal government, thus influencing competition in the newly developing steam ferry service in New York Harbor. In 1830, New Jersey planned to bring suit to clarify the border, but the case was never heard. The matter was resolved with a compact between the states, ratified by U.S. Congress in 1834. This set the boundary line at the middle of the Hudson River and New York Harbor; however, New York was guaranteed &quot;exclusive jurisdiction of and over all the waters of Hudson River lying west of Manhattan and to the south of the mouth of Spuytenduyvil Creek; and of and over the lands covered by the said waters, to the low-water mark on the New Jersey shore.&quot; This was later confirmed in other cases by the U.S. Supreme Court.

New Jersey contended that the artificial portions of the island were part of New Jersey, since they were outside New York&#x27;s border. In 1956, after the closure of the U.S. immigration station two years prior, the Mayor of Jersey City Bernard J. Berry commandeered a U.S. Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim the island.

Jurisdictional disputes reemerged in the 1980s with the renovation of Ellis Island, and then again in the 1990s with the proposed redevelopment of the south side. New Jersey sued in 1997. The lawsuit was escalated to the Supreme Court, which ruled in &quot;New Jersey v. New York&quot;. The border was redrawn using geographic information science data: It was decided that of the land fill area are territory of New Jersey and that , including the original island, are territory of New York. This caused some initial confusion, as some buildings straddled the interstate border. The ruling had no effect on the status of Liberty Island.

Although the island remained under federal ownership after the lawsuit, New Jersey and New York agreed to share jurisdiction over the land itself. Neither state took any fiscal or physical responsibility for the maintenance, preservation, or improvement of any of the historic properties, and each state has jurisdiction over its respective land areas. Jersey City and New York City then gave separate tax lot numbers to their respective claims.

===Public access===
Two ferry slips are located on the northern side of the basin that bisects Ellis Island. No charge is made for entrance to the Statue of Liberty National Monument, but there is a cost for the ferry service. A concession was granted in 2007 to Statue Cruises to operate the transportation and ticketing facilities, replacing Circle Line, which had operated the service since 1953. The ferries travel from Liberty State Park in Jersey City and the Battery in Lower Manhattan. Save Ellis Isand offers guided public tours of the south side as part of the &quot;Hard Hat Tour&quot;.
A bridge to Liberty State Park was built in 1986 for transporting materials and personnel during the island&#x27;s late-1980s restoration. Originally slated to be torn down in 1992, it remained after construction was complete. It is not open to the public. The city of New York and the island&#x27;s private ferry operator have opposed proposals to use it or replace it with a pedestrian bridge, and a 1995 proposal for a new pedestrian bridge to New Jersey was voted down in the United States House of Representatives. The bridge is not strong enough to be classified as a permanent bridge, and any action to convert it into a pedestrian passageway would require renovations.

==History==

===Precolonial and colonial use===

The present-day Ellis Island was created by retreating glaciers at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation about 15,000 years ago. The island was described as a &quot;hummock along a plain fronting the west side of the Hudson River estuary,&quot; and when the glaciers melted, the water of the Upper New York Bay surrounded the mass. The native Mohegan name for the island was &quot;Kioshk&quot;, meaning &quot;Gull Island&quot;, in reference to Ellis Island&#x27;s former large population of seagulls. Kioshk was composed mostly of marshy, brackish lowlands that disappeared underwater at high tide. The Native American tribes who lived nearby are presumed to have been hunter-gatherers who used the island to hunt for fish and oysters, as well as to build transient hunting and fishing communities there. It is unlikely that the Native Americans established permanent settlements on Kioshk, since the island would have been submerged at high tide.

In 1630, the Dutch bought Kioshk as a gift for Michael Reyniersz Pauw, who had helped found New Netherland. When the Dutch settled the area as part of New Netherland, the three islands in Upper New York Bay—Liberty, Black Tom, and Ellis Islands—were given the name Oyster Islands, alluding to the large oyster population nearby. The present-day Ellis Island was thus called &quot;Little Oyster Island&quot;, a name that persisted through at least the early 1700s. Little Oyster Island was then sold to Captain William Dyre , then to Thomas Lloyd on April 23, 1686. The island was then sold several more times, including to Enoch and Mary Story. During colonial times, Little Oyster Island became a popular spot for hosting oyster roasts, picnics, and clambakes because of its rich oyster beds. Evidence of recreational uses on the island was visible by the mid-18th century with the addition of commercial buildings to the northeast shore.

By the 1760s, Little Oyster Island became a public execution site for pirates, with executions occurring at one tree in particular, the &quot;Gibbet Tree&quot;. However, there is scant evidence that this was common practice. Little Oyster Island was acquired by Samuel Ellis, a colonial New Yorker and merchant from Wrexham, Wales, in 1774; the island was ultimately named for him. He unsuccessfully attempted to sell the island nine years later. Ellis died in 1794, and as per his will, the ownership of Ellis Island passed to his daughter Catherine Westervelt&#x27;s unborn son, who was also named Samuel. When the junior Samuel died shortly after birth, ownership passed to the senior Samuel&#x27;s other two daughters, Elizabeth Ryerson and Rachel Cooder.

===Military use and Fort Gibson===
Ellis Island was also used by the military for almost 80 years. By the mid-1790s, as a result of the United States&#x27; increased military tensions with Britain and France, a U.S. congressional committee drew a map of possible locations for the First System of fortifications to protect major American urban centers such as New York Harbor.A small part of Ellis Island from &quot;the soil from high to low waters mark around Ellis&#x27;s Island&quot; was owned by the city. On April 21, 1794, the city deeded that land to the state for public defense purposes. The following year, the state allotted $100,000 for fortifications on Bedloe&#x27;s, Ellis, and Governors Islands, as well as the construction of Castle Garden (now Castle Clinton) along the Battery on Manhattan island. Batteries and magazines were built on Ellis Island in preparation for a war. A jetty was added to the northwestern extremity of the island, possibly from soil excavated from an inlet at the northeastern corner; the inlet was infilled by 1813. Though the military threat never materialized, further preparations were made in the late 1790s, when the Quasi War sparked fears of war with France; these new preparations were supervised by Ebenezer Stevens. The military conflict also failed to occur, and by 1805, the fort had become rundown.

Stevens, who observed that the Ellis family still owned most of the island, suggested selling off the land to the federal government. Samuel Ryerson, one of Samuel Ellis&#x27;s grandsons, deeded the island to John A. Berry in 1806. The remaining portion of the island was acquired by condemnation the next year, and it was ceded to the United States on June 30, 1808, for $10,000. Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams, placed in charge of New York Harbor defenses in the early 1800s, proposed several new fortifications around the harbor as part of the Second System of fortifications. The new fortifications included increased firepower and improved weaponry. The War Department established a circular stone 14-gun battery, a mortar battery (possibly of six mortars), magazine, and barracks. The fort was initially called Crown Fort, but by the end of the War of 1812 the battery was named Fort Gibson, in honor of Colonel James Gibson of the 4th Regiment of Riflemen, who was killed in the war during the Siege of Fort Erie. The fort was not used in combat during the war, and instead served as a barracks for the 11th Regiment, as well as a jail for British prisoners of war.
Immediately after the end of the War of 1812, Fort Gibson was largely used as a recruiting depot. The fort went into decline due to under-utilization, and it was being jointly administered by the U.S. Army and Navy by the mid-1830s. Around this time, in 1834, the extant portions of Ellis Island was declared to be an exclave of New York within the waters of New Jersey. The era of joint administration was short-lived: the Army took over the fort&#x27;s administration in 1841, demoted the fort to an artillery battery, and stopped garrisoning the fort, leaving a small Navy guard outside the magazine. By 1854, Battery Gibson contained an 11-gun battery, three naval magazines, a short railroad line, and several auxiliary structures such as a cookhouse, gun carriage house, and officers&#x27; quarters. The Army continued to maintain the fort until 1860, when it abandoned the weapons at Battery Gibson. The artillery magazine was expanded in 1861, during the American Civil War, and part of the parapet was removed.

At the end of the Civil War, the fort declined again, this time to an extent that the weaponry was rendered unusable. Through the 1870s, the Navy built additional buildings for its artillery magazine on Ellis Island, eventually constructing 11 buildings in total. Complaints about the island&#x27;s magazines started to form, and by the 1870s, &quot;The New York Sun&quot; was publishing &quot;alarming reports&quot; about the magazines. The guns were ordered removed in 1881, and the island passed under the complete control of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ordnance.

===First immigration station===

The Army had unsuccessfully attempted to use Ellis Island &quot;for the convalescence for immigrants&quot; as early as 1847. Across New York Harbor, Castle Clinton had been used as an immigration station since 1855, processing more than eight million immigrants during that time. The individual states had their own varying immigration laws until 1875, but the federal government regarded Castle Clinton as having &quot;varied charges of mismanagement, abuse of immigrants, and evasion of the laws&quot;, and as such, wanted it to be completely replaced. The federal government assumed control of immigration in early 1890 and commissioned a study to determine the best place for the new immigration station in New York Harbor. Among members of the United States Congress, there were disputes about whether to build the station on Ellis, Governors, or Liberty Islands. Initially, Liberty Island was selected as the site for the immigration station, but due to opposition for immigration stations on both Liberty and Governors Islands, the committee eventually decided to build the station on Ellis Island. Since Castle Clinton&#x27;s lease was about to expire, Congress approved a bill to build an immigration station on Ellis Island.

On April 11, 1890, the federal government ordered the magazine at Ellis Island be torn down to make way for the U.S.&#x27;s first federal immigration station at the site. The Department of the Treasury, which was in charge of constructing federal buildings in the U.S., officially took control of the island that May 24. Congress initially allotted $75,000 () to construct the station and later doubled that appropriation. While the building was under construction, the Barge Office at the Battery was used for immigrant processing. During construction, most of the old Battery Gibson buildings were demolished, and Ellis Island&#x27;s land size was almost doubled to . The main structure was a two-story structure of Georgia Pine, which was described in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; as &quot;a latterday watering place hotel&quot; measuring . Its outbuildings included a hospital, detention building, laundry building, and utility plant that were all made of wood. Some of the former stone magazine structures were reused for utilities and offices. Additionally, a ferry slip with breakwater was built to the south of Ellis Island. Following further expansion, the island measured by the end of 1892.
The station opened on January 1, 1892, and its first immigrant was Annie Moore, a 17-year-old girl from Cork, Ireland, who was traveling with her two brothers to meet their parents in the U.S. On the first day, almost 700 immigrants passed over the docks. Over the next year, over 400,000 immigrants were processed at the station. The processing procedure included a series of medical and mental inspection lines, and through this process, some 1% of potential immigrants were deported. Additional building improvements took place throughout the mid-1890s, and Ellis Island was expanded to by 1896. The last improvements, which entailed the installation of underwater telephone and telegraph cables to Governors Island, were completed in early June 1897. On June 15, 1897, the wooden structures on Ellis Island were razed in a fire of unknown origin. While there were no casualties, the wooden buildings had completely burned down after two hours, and all immigration records from 1855 had been destroyed. Over five years of operation, the station had processed 1.5 million immigrants.

===Second immigration station===

====Design and construction====
Following the fire, passenger arrivals were again processed at the Barge Office, which was soon unable to handle the large volume of immigrants. Within three days of the fire, the federal government made plans to build a new, fireproof immigration station. Legislation to rebuild the station was approved on June 30, 1897, and appropriations were made in mid-July. By September, the Treasury&#x27;s Supervising Architect, James Knox Taylor, opened an architecture competition to rebuild the immigration station. The competition was the second to be conducted under the Tarsney Act of 1893, which had permitted private architects to design federal buildings, rather than government architects in the Supervising Architect&#x27;s office. The contest rules specified that a &quot;main building with annexes&quot; and a &quot;hospital building&quot;, both made of fireproof materials, should be part of each nomination. Furthermore, the buildings had to be able to host a daily average of 1,000 and maximum of 4,000 immigrants.Several prominent architectural firms filed proposals, and by December, it was announced that Edward Lippincott Tilton and William A. Boring had won the competition. Tilton and Boring&#x27;s plan called for four new structures: a main building in the French Renaissance style, as well as the kitchen/laundry building, powerhouse, and the main hospital building. The plan also included the creation of a new island called island 2, upon which the hospital would be built, south of the existing island (now Ellis Island&#x27;s north side). A construction contract was awarded to the R. H. Hood Company in August 1898, with the expectation that construction would be completed within a year, but the project encountered delays because of various obstacles and disagreements between the federal government and the Hood Company. A separate contract to build the island 2 had to be approved by the War Department because it was in New Jersey&#x27;s waters; that contract was completed in December 1898. The construction costs ultimately totaled $1.5 million.

====Early expansions====

The new immigration station opened on December 17, 1900, without ceremony. On that day, 2,251 immigrants were processed. Almost immediately, additional projects commenced to improve the main structure, including an entrance canopy, baggage conveyor, and railroad ticket office. The kitchen/laundry and powerhouse started construction in May 1900 and were completed by the end of 1901. A ferry house was also built between islands 1 and 2 . The hospital, originally slated to be opened in 1899, was not completed until November 1901, mainly due to various funding delays and construction disputes. The facilities proved barely able to handle the flood of immigrants that arrived, and as early as 1903, immigrants had to remain in their transatlantic boats for several days due to inspection backlogs. Several wooden buildings were erected by 1903, including waiting rooms and a 700-bed barracks, and by 1904, over a million dollars&#x27; worth of improvements were proposed. The hospital was expanded from 125 to 250 beds in February 1907, and a new psychopathic ward debuted in November of the same year. Also constructed was an administration building adjacent to the hospital.

Immigration commissioner William Williams made substantial changes to Ellis Island&#x27;s operations, and during his tenure from 1902 to 1905 and 1909–1913, Ellis Island processed its peak number of immigrants. Williams also made changes to the island&#x27;s appearance, adding plants and grading paths upon the once-barren landscape of Ellis Island. Under Williams&#x27;s supervision, a third island was built to accommodate a proposed contagious-diseases ward, separated from existing facilities by of water. Island 3, as it was called, was located to the south of island 2 and separated from that island by a now-infilled ferry basin. The government bought the underwater area for island 3 from New Jersey in 1904, and a contract was awarded in April 1905. The islands were all connected via a cribwalk on their western sides (later covered with wood canopy), giving Ellis Island an overall &quot;E&quot;-shape. Upon the completion of island 3 in 1906, Ellis Island covered . A baggage and dormitory building was completed , and the main hospital was expanded in 1909. Alterations were made to the registry building and dormitories as well, but even this was insufficient to accommodate the high volume of immigrants. In 1911, Williams alleged that Congress had allocated too little for improvements to Ellis Island, even though the improvement budget that year was $868,000.

Additional improvements and routine maintenance work were completed in the early 1910s. A greenhouse was built in 1910, and the contagious-diseases ward on island 3 opened the following June. In addition, the incinerator was replaced in 1911, and a recreation center operated by the American Red Cross was also built on island 2 by 1915. These facilities generally followed the design set by Tilton and Boring. When the Black Tom explosion occurred on Black Tom Island in 1916, the complex suffered moderate damage; though all immigrants were evacuated safely, the main building&#x27;s roof collapsed, and windows were broken. The main building&#x27;s roof was replaced with a Guastavino-tiled arched ceiling by 1918. The immigration station was temporarily closed during World War I in 1917–1919, during which the facilities were used as a jail for suspected enemy combatants, and later as a treatment center for wounded American soldiers. Immigration inspections were conducted aboard ships or at docks. During the war, immigration processing at Ellis Island declined by 97%, from 878,000 immigrants per year in 1914 to 26,000 per year in 1919.

Ellis Island&#x27;s immigration station was reopened in 1920, and processing had rebounded to 560,000 immigrants per year by 1921. There were still ample complaints about the inadequate condition of Ellis Island&#x27;s facilities. However, despite a request for $5.6 million in appropriations in 1921, aid was slow to materialize, and initial improvement work was restricted to smaller projects such as the infilling of the basin between islands 2 and 3. Other improvements included rearranging features such as staircases to improve pedestrian flow. These projects were supported by president Calvin Coolidge, who in 1924 requested that Congress approve $300,000 in appropriations for the island. The allocations were not received until the late 1920s.

====Conversion to detention center====

With the passing of the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, the number of immigrants being allowed into the United States declined greatly, ending the era of mass immigration. Following the Immigration Act of 1924, strict immigration quotas were enacted, and Ellis Island was downgraded from a primary inspection center to an immigrant-detention center, hosting only those that were to be detained or deported (see ). Final inspections were now instead conducted on board ships in New York Harbor. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 further decreased immigration, as people were now discouraged from immigrating to the U.S. Because of the resulting decline in patient counts, the hospital closed in 1930.

Edward Corsi, who himself was an immigrant, became Ellis Island commissioner in 1931 and commenced an improvement program for the island. The initial improvements were utilitarian, focusing on such aspects as sewage, incineration, and power generation. In 1933, a federal committee led by the Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, was established to determine what operations and facilities needed improvement. The committee&#x27;s report, released in 1934, suggested the construction of a new class-segregated immigration building, recreation center, ferry house, verandas, and doctors/nurses&#x27; quarters, as well as the installation of a new seawall around the island. These works were undertaken using Public Works Administration funding and Works Progress Administration labor, and were completed by the late 1930s. As part of the project, the surgeon&#x27;s house and recreation center were demolished, and Edward Laning commissioned some murals for the island&#x27;s buildings. Other improvements included the demolition of the greenhouse, the completion of the infilling of the basin between islands 2 and 3, and various landscaping activities such as the installation of walkways and plants. However, because of the steep decline in immigration, the immigration building went underused for several years, and it started to deteriorate.

With the start of World War II in 1939, Ellis Island was again utilized by the military, this time being used as a United States Coast Guard base. As during World War I, the facilities were used to detain enemy soldiers in addition to immigrants, and the hospital was used for treating injured American soldiers. So many combatants were detained at Ellis Island that administrative offices were moved to mainland Manhattan in 1943, and Ellis Island was used solely for detainment.
By 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, there were proposals to close Ellis Island due to the massive expenses needed for the upkeep of a relatively small detention center. The hospital was closed in 1950–1951 by the United States Public Health Service, and by the early 1950s, there were only 30 to 40 detainees left on the island. The island&#x27;s closure was announced in mid-1954, when the federal government announced that it would construct a replacement facility on Manhattan. Ellis Island closed on November 12, 1954, with the departure of its last detainee, Norwegian merchant seaman Arne Pettersen, who had been arrested for overstaying his shore leave. At the time, it was estimated that the government would save $900,000 a year from closing the island. The ferryboat &quot;Ellis Island&quot;, which had operated since 1904, stopped operating two weeks later.

===Post-closure===
====Initial redevelopment plans====

After the immigration station closed, the buildings fell into disrepair and were abandoned, and the General Services Administration (GSA) took over the island in March 1955. The GSA wanted to sell off the island as &quot;surplus property&quot; and contemplated several options, including selling the island back to the city of New York or auctioning it to a private buyer. In 1959, real estate developer Sol Atlas unsuccessfully bid for the island, with plans to turn it into a $55 million resort with a hotel, marina, music shell, tennis courts, swimming pools, and skating rinks. The same year, Frank Lloyd Wright designed the $100 million &quot;Key Project&quot;, which included housing, hotels, and large domes along the edges. However, Wright died before presenting the project. Other attempts at redeveloping the site, including a college, a retirement home, an alcoholics&#x27; rehabilitation center, and a world trade center were all unsuccessful. In 1963, the Jersey City Council voted to rezone the island&#x27;s area within New Jersey for high-rise residential, monument/museum, or recreational use, though the new zoning ordinance banned &quot;Coney Island&quot;-style amusement parks.

In June 1964, the National Park Service published a report that proposed making Ellis Island part of a national monument. This idea was approved by Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall in October 1964. Ellis Island was added to the Statue of Liberty National Monument on May 11, 1965, and that August, President Lyndon B. Johnson approved the redevelopment of the island as a museum and park.

The initial master plan for the redevelopment of Ellis Island, designed by Philip Johnson, called for the construction of the Wall, a large &quot;stadium&quot;-shaped monument to replace the structures on the island&#x27;s northwest side, while preserving the main building and hospital. However, no appropriations were immediately made, other than a $250,000 allocation for emergency repairs in 1967. By the late 1960s, the abandoned buildings were deteriorating severely. Johnson&#x27;s plan was never implemented due to public opposition and a lack of funds. Another master plan was proposed in 1968, which called for the rehabilitation of the island&#x27;s northern side and the demolition of all buildings, including the hospital, on the southern side. The Jersey City Jobs Corpsmen started rehabilitating part of Ellis Island the same year, in accordance with this plan. This was soon halted indefinitely because of a lack of funding. In 1970, a squatters&#x27; club called the National Economic Growth and Reconstruction Organization (NEGRO) started refurbishing buildings as part of a plan to turn the island into an addiction rehabilitation center, but were evicted after less than two weeks. NEGRO&#x27;s permit to renovate the island were ultimately terminated in 1973.

====Restoration and reopening of north side====

In the 1970s, the NPS started restoring the island by repairing seawalls, eliminating weeds, and building a new ferry dock. Simultaneously, Peter Sammartino launched the Restore Ellis Island Committee to raise awareness and money for repairs. The north side of the island, comprising the main building and surrounding structures, was rehabilitated and partially reopened for public tours in May 1976. The plant was left unrepaired to show the visitors the extent of the deterioration. The NPS limited visits to 130 visitors per boat, or less than 75,000 visitors a year. Initially, only parts of three buildings were open to visitors. Further repairs were stymied by a lack of funding, and by 1982, the NPS was turning to private sources for funds.

In May 1982, President Ronald Reagan announced the formation of the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Centennial Commission, led by Chrysler Corporation chair Lee Iacocca with former President Gerald Ford as honorary chairman, to raise the funds needed to complete the work. The plan for Ellis Island was to cost $128 million, and by the time work commenced in 1984, about $40 million had been raised. Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group eventually raised more than $350 million in donations for the renovations of both the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Initial restoration plans included renovating the main building, baggage and dormitory building, and the hospital, as well as possibly adding a bandshell, restaurant, and exhibits. Two firms, Notter Finegold &amp; Alexander and Beyer Blinder Belle, designed the renovation. In advance of the renovation, public tours ceased in 1984, and work started the following year. As part of the restoration, the powerhouse was renovated, while the incinerator, greenhouse, and water towers were removed. The kitchen/laundry and baggage/dormitory buildings were restored to their original condition while the main building was restored to its 1918–1924 appearance.

The main building opened as a museum on September 10, 1990. Further improvements were made after the north side&#x27;s renovation was completed. The Wall of Honor, a monument to raise money for the restoration, was completed in 1990 and reconstructed starting in 1993. A research facility with online database, the American Family Immigration History Center, was opened in April 2001. Subsequently, the ferry building was restored for $6.4 million and reopened in 2007. The north side was temporarily closed after being damaged in Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, though the island and part of the museum reopened exactly a year later, after major renovations.

In March 2020, the island was closed temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it reopened in August 2020, initially with strict capacity limits. A $100 million renovation of the Ellis Island museum began in early 2024; the changes included a three-story exhibition space and a new &quot;discovery center&quot;. The NPS also announced plans to spend $17.7 million on renovating the museum buildings. Save Ellis Island, a nonprofit organization based in New Jersey, concurrently advocated for the preservation of the hospital buildings on the island&#x27;s southern end. By 2023, Save Ellis Island had raised $70 million toward the buildings&#x27; renovation.

==Structures==

The current complex was designed by Edward Lippincott Tilton and William A. Boring, who performed the commission under the direction of the Supervising Architect for the U.S. Treasury, James Knox Taylor. Boring was responsible for the majority of the buildings. Tilton and Boring&#x27;s plan, submitted in 1898, called for structures to be located on both the northern and southern portions of Ellis Island. The plan stipulated a large main building, a powerhouse, and a new baggage/dormitory and kitchen building on the north side of Ellis Island; a hospital on the south side; and a ferry dock with covered walkways at the head of the ferry basin, on the west side of the island. The plan roughly corresponds to what was ultimately built.

===North side===
The northern half of Ellis Island is composed of the former island 1. Only the areas associated with the original island, including much of the main building, are in New York; the remaining area is in New Jersey.

====Main building====
The present three-story main structure was designed in French Renaissance style. It is made of a steel frame, with a facade of red brick in Flemish bond ornamented with limestone trim. The structure is located above the mean waterline to prevent flooding. The building was initially composed of a three-story center section with two-story east and west wings, though the third stories of each wing were completed in the early 1910s. Atop the corners of the building&#x27;s central section are four towers capped by cupolas of copper cladding. Some 160 rooms were included within the original design to separate the different functions of the building. Namely, the first floor was initially designed to handle baggage, detention, offices, storage and waiting rooms; the second floor, primary inspection; and the third floor, dormitories. However, in practice, these spaces generally served multiple functions throughout the immigration station&#x27;s operating history. At opening, it was estimated that the main building could inspect 5,000 immigrants per day. The main building&#x27;s design was highly acclaimed; at the 1900 Paris Exposition, it received a gold medal, and other architectural publications such as the &quot;Architectural Record&quot; lauded the design.
The first floor contained detention rooms, social service offices, and waiting rooms on its west wing, a use that remained relatively unchanged. The central space was initially a baggage room until 1907, but was subsequently subdivided and later re-combined into a single records room. The first floor&#x27;s east wing also contained a railroad waiting room and medical offices, though much of the wing was later converted to record rooms. A railroad ticket office annex was added to the north side of the first floor in 1905–1906. The south elevation of the first floor contains the current immigration museum&#x27;s main entrance, approached by a slightly sloped passageway covered by a glass canopy. Though the canopy was added in the 1980s, it evokes the design of an earlier glass canopy on the site that existed from 1902 to 1932.

A registry room, with a ceiling, is located on the central section of the second floor. The room was used for primary inspections. Initially, there were handrails within the registry room that separated the primary inspection into several queues, but 1911 these were replaced with benches. A staircase from the first floor formerly rose into the middle of the registry room, but this was also removed around 1911. When the room&#x27;s roof collapsed during the Black Tom explosion of 1916, the current Guastavino-tiled arched ceiling was installed, and the asphalt floor was replaced with red Ludowici tile. There are three large arched openings each on the northern and southern walls, filled-in with grilles of metal-and-glass. The southern elevation retains its original double-height arches, while the lower sections of the arches on the northern elevations were modified to make way for the railroad ticket office. On all four sides of the room, above the level of the third floor, is a clerestory of semicircular windows. The east wing of the second floor was used for administrative offices, while the west wing housed the special inquiry and deportation divisions, as well as dormitories.

On the third floor is a balcony surrounding the entire registry room. There were also dormitories for 600 people on the third floor. Between 1914 and 1918, several rooms were added to the third floor. These rooms included offices as well as an assembly room that were later converted to detention.

The remnants of Fort Gibson still exist outside the main building. Two portions are visible to the public, including the remnants of the lower walls around the fort.

====Kitchen and laundry====

The kitchen and laundry structure is a -story structure located west of the main building. It is made of a steel frame and terracotta blocks, with a granite base and a facade of brick in Flemish bond. Originally designed as two separate structures, it was redesigned in 1899 as a single structure with kitchen-restaurant and laundry-bathhouse components, and was subsequently completed in 1901. A -story ice plant on the northern elevation was built between 1903 and 1908, and was converted into a ticket office in 1935. It has a facade of brick in English and stretcher bond. Today, the kitchen and laundry contains NPS offices as well as the museum&#x27;s &quot;Peopling of America&quot; exhibit.

The building has a central portion with a narrow gable roof, as well as pavilions on the western and eastern sides with hip roofs; the roof tiling was formerly of slate and currently of Ludowici terracotta. The larger eastern pavilion, which contained the laundry-bathhouse, had hipped dormers. The exterior-facing window and door openings contain limestone features on the facade, while the top of the building has a modillioned copper cornice. Formerly, there was also a two-story porch on the southern elevation. Multiple enclosed passageways connect the kitchen and laundry to adjacent structures.

====Bakery and carpentry shop====
The bakery and carpentry shop is a two-story structure located west of the kitchen and laundry building. It is roughly rectangular and oriented north–south. It is made of a steel frame with a granite base, a flat roof, and a facade of brick in Flemish bond. The building was constructed in 1914–1915 to replace the separate wooden bakery and carpentry shop buildings, as well as two sheds and a frame waiting room. There are no exterior entrances, and the only access is via the kitchen and laundry. The first floor generally contained oven rooms, baking areas and storage while the second floor contained the carpentry shop.

====Baggage and dormitory====

The baggage and dormitory structure is a three-story structure located north of the main building. It is made of a steel frame and terracotta blocks, with a limestone base and a facade of brick in Flemish bond. Completed as a two-story structure , the baggage and dormitory building replaced a 700-bed wooden barracks nearby that operated between 1903 and 1911. The baggage and dormitory initially had baggage collection on its first floor, dormitories and detention rooms on its second floor, and a tiled garden on its roof. The building received a third story, and a two-story annex to the north side, in 1913–1914. Initially, the third floor included additional dormitory space while the annex provided detainees with outdoor porch space. A detainee dining room on the first floor was expanded in 1951.

The building is mostly rectangular except for its northern annex and contains an interior courtyard, skylighted at the second floor. On its facade the first story has rectangular windows in arched window openings while the second and third stories have rectangular windows and window openings. There are cornices below the second and third stories. The annex contains wide window openings with narrow brick piers outside them. The roof&#x27;s northwest corner contains a one-story extension. Multiple wings connect the baggage and laundry to its adjacent buildings.

====Powerhouse====
The powerhouse of Ellis Island is a two-story structure located north of the kitchen and laundry building and west of the baggage and dormitory building. It is roughly rectangular and oriented north–south. Like the kitchen and laundry, it was completed in 1901. It is made of a steel frame with a granite base, a facade of brick in Flemish bond, and decorative bluestone and limestone elements. The hip roof contains dormers and is covered with terracotta tiling. A brick smokestack rises from ground level.

Formerly, the powerhouse provided almost all power for Ellis Island. A coal trestle at the northwest end was used to transport coal for power generation from 1901 to 1932, when the powerhouse started using fuel oil. The powerhouse also generated steam for the island. After the immigration station closed, the powerhouse deteriorated and was left unrepaired until the 1980s renovation. The powerhouse is no longer operational; instead, the island receives power from 13,200-volt cables that lead from a Public Service Electric &amp; Gas substation in Liberty State Park. The powerhouse contains sewage pumps that can dispose of up to to the Jersey City Sewage Authority sewage system. A central heating plant was installed during the 1980s renovation.

===South side===
The southern side of Ellis Island, located across the ferry basin from the northern side, is composed of island 2 (created in 1899) and island 3 (created in 1906). The entire southern side of the island is in New Jersey, and the majority of the site is occupied by the hospital buildings. A central corridor runs southward from the ferry building on the west side of the island. Two additional corridors split eastward down the centers of islands 2 and 3.

====Island 2====
Island 2 comprises the northern part of Ellis Island&#x27;s southern portion. The structures share the same design: a brick facade in Flemish bond, quoins, and limestone ornamentation. All structures were internally connected via covered passageways.The laundry-hospital outbuilding is south of the ferry terminal, and was constructed in 1900–1901 along with the now-demolished surgeon&#x27;s house. The structure is one and a half stories tall with a hip roof and skylights facing to the north and south. Repaired repeatedly throughout its history, the laundry-outbuilding was last restored in 2002. It had linen, laundry, and disinfecting rooms; a boiler room; a morgue with autopsy room; and quarters for the laundry staff on the second floor.

To the east is the psychopathic ward, a two-story building erected 1906–1907. The building is the only structure in the hospital complex to have a flat roof, and formerly also had a porch to its south. It housed 25 to 30 beds and was intended for the temporary treatment of immigrants suspected of being insane or having mental disorders, pending their deportation, hospitalization, or commitment to sanatoria. Male and female patients were segregated, and there were also a dayroom, veranda, nurse&#x27;s office, and small pantry on each floor. In 1952 the psychopathic ward was converted into a Coast Guard brig.

The main building is directly east of the psychopathic ward. It is composed of three similarly designed structures: from west to east, they are Hospital Building No. 1 (built 1900–1901), the Administration Building (1905–1907), and Hospital Building No. 2 (1908–1909). The 3.5-story building no. 1 is shaped like an inverted &quot;C&quot; with two 2.5-story rectangular wings facing southward; the wings contain two-story-tall porches. The administration building is smaller but also 3.5 stories. The 3.5-story building no. 2 is similar to building no. 1, but also has a three-story porch at the south elevation of the central pavilion. All three buildings have stone-stoop entrances on their north facades and courtyards on their south.

====Recreation hall====
The recreation hall and one of the island&#x27;s two recreation shelters are located between islands 2 and 3 on the western side of Ellis Island, at the head of the former ferry basin between the two landmasses. Built in 1937 in the Colonial Revival style, the structures replaced an earlier recreation building at the northeast corner of island 2.

The recreation hall is a two-story building with a limestone base, a facade of brick in Flemish bond, a gable roof, and terracotta ornamentation. The first floor contained recreational facilities, while the second floor was used mostly for offices. It contains wings on the north, south, and west. The recreation shelter, a one-story brick pavilion, is located directly to the east. A second shelter of similar design was located adjacent to the power plant on the island&#x27;s north side.

====Island 3====

As part of the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, the contagious disease hospital comprised 17 pavilions, connected with a central connecting corridor. Each pavilion contained separate hospital functions that could be sealed off from each other. Most of the structures were completed in 1911. The pavilions included eight measles wards, three isolation wards, a power house/sterilizer/autopsy theater, mortuary, laboratory, administration building, kitchen, and staff house. All structures were designed by James Knox Taylor in the Italian Renaissance style and are distinguished by red-tiled Ludowici hip roofs, roughcast walls of stucco, and ornamentation of brick and limestone.

The office building and laboratory is a 2.5-story structure located at the west end of island 3. It housed doctors&#x27; offices and a dispensary on the first floor, along with a laboratory and pharmacists&#x27; quarters on the second floor. In 1924, the first floor offices were converted into male nurses&#x27; quarters. A one-story morgue is located east of the office building, and was converted to the &quot;Animal House&quot; circa 1919.

An L-shaped powerhouse and laundry building, built in 1908, is also located on the west side of island 3. It has a square north wing with boiler, coal, and pump rooms, as well as a rectangular south wing with laundry and disinfection rooms, staff kitchen, and staff pantry. The powerhouse and laundry also had a distinctive yellow-brick smokestack. Part of the building was converted into a morgue and autopsy room in the 1930s.

To the east are the eight measles pavilions (also known as wards A-H), built in phases from 1906 to 1909 and located near the center of island 3. There are four pavilions each to the west and east of island 3&#x27;s administration building. All of the pavilions are identical, two-story rectangular structures. Each pavilion floor had a spacious open ward with large windows on three sides and independent ventilation ducts. A hall leading to the connecting corridor was flanked by bathrooms, nurses&#x27; duty room, offices, and a serving kitchen.

The administration building is a 3.5-story structure located on the north side of island 3&#x27;s connecting corridor, in the center of the landmass. It included reception rooms, offices, and a staff kitchen on the first floor; nurses&#x27; quarters and operating rooms on the second floor; and additional staff quarters on the third floor. A one-story kitchen with a smokestack is located opposite the administration building to the south.

The eastern end of island 3 contained three isolation pavilions (wards I-K) and a staff building. The isolation pavilions were intended for patients for more serious diseases, including scarlet fever, diphtheria, and a combination of either of these diseases with measles and whooping cough. Each pavilion is a 1.5-story rectangular structure. Wards I and K are located to the south of the connecting corridor while ward J is located to the north; originally, all three pavilions were freestanding structures, but covered ways were built between wards I and K and the center corridor in 1914. There were also nurses&#x27; quarters in each attic. The staff building. located at the extreme east end of island 3&#x27;s connecting corridor, is a 2.5-story building for high-ranking hospital staff. Living and dining rooms, a kitchen, and a library were located on the first floor while bedrooms were located on the second floor.

===Ferry building===

The ferry building is at the western end of the ferry basin, within New Jersey. The current structure was built in 1936 and is the third ferry landing to occupy the site. It is made of a steel-and-concrete frame with a facade of red brick in Flemish bond, and limestone and terracotta ornamentation, in the Moderne architectural style. The building&#x27;s central pavilion is mostly one story tall, except for a two-story central section that is covered by a hip roof with cupola. Two rectangular wings are located to the north and south and are oriented east–west. The south wing was originally reserved for U.S. Customs while the north wing contained a lunchroom and restrooms. A wooden dock extends east from the ferry building. The ferry building is connected to the kitchen and laundry to the north, and the hospital to the south, via covered walkways. The structure was completely restored in 2007.

==Immigration procedures==
By the time Ellis Island&#x27;s immigration station closed, almost 12 million immigrants had been processed by the U.S. Bureau of Immigration. It is estimated that 10.5 million immigrants departed for points across the United States from the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal nearby. Others would have used one of the other terminals along the North River/Hudson River at that time. At the time of closure, it was estimated that closer to 20 million immigrants had been processed or detained at Ellis Island.

Immigrants did not need a passport, visa, or any other document to enter the country. Transportation companies were in charge of all checks; if the entry was denied, the company was fined $100 per each deported passenger, and covered the costs of their deportation. Initial immigration policy provided for the admission of most immigrants to the United States, other than those with mental or physical disabilities, or a moral, racial, religious, or economic reason for exclusion. At first, the majority of immigrants arriving were Northern and Western Europeans, with the largest numbers coming from the German Empire, the Russian Empire and Finland, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Eventually, these groups of peoples slowed in the rates that they were coming in, and immigrants came in from Southern and Eastern Europe, including Jews. These people immigrated for a variety of reasons including escaping political and economic oppression, as well as persecution, destitution, and violence. Often among these groups were Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Serbs, Slovaks, Greeks, Syrians, Croats,Turks, and Armenians.

Immigration through Ellis Island peaked in the first decade of the 20th century. Between 1905 and 1914, an average of one million immigrants per year arrived in the United States. Immigration officials reviewed about 5,000 immigrants per day during peak times at Ellis Island. Two-thirds of those individuals emigrated from eastern, southern and central Europe. The peak year for immigration at Ellis Island was 1907, with 1,004,756 immigrants processed, and the all-time daily high occurred on April 17 of that year, when 11,747 immigrants arrived. Following the Immigration Act of 1924, which both greatly reduced immigration and allowed processing overseas, Ellis Island was only used by those who had problems with their immigration paperwork, as well as displaced persons and war refugees. This affected both nationwide and regional immigration processing: only 2.34 million immigrants passed through the Port of New York from 1925 to 1954, compared to the 12 million immigrants processed from 1900 to 1924. Average annual immigration through the Port of New York from 1892 to 1924 typically numbered in the hundreds of thousands, though after 1924, annual immigration through the port was usually in the tens of thousands.

According to a 2025 estimate from &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, two out of every five Americans may be descended from someone who passed through Ellis Island. Other estimates posit that as many as 100 million Americans, as of 2019, are descendants of an immigrant who passed through Ellis Island moving to the United States from another country.

===Inspections===

====Medical inspection====

Beginning in the 1890s, initial medical inspections were conducted by steamship companies at the European ports of embarkation; further examinations and vaccinations occurred on board ship during the voyage to New York. On arrival at the port of New York, ships halted at the New York state quarantine station near the Narrows. Those with serious contagious diseases (such as cholera and typhus) were quarantined at Hoffman Island or Swinburne Island, two artificial islands off the shore of Staten Island to the south. The islands ceased to be used for quarantine by the 1920s due to the decline in inspections at Ellis Island. For the vast majority of passengers, since most transatlantic ships could not dock at Ellis Island due to shallow water, the ships unloaded at Manhattan first, and steerage passengers were then taken to Ellis Island for processing. First- and second-class passengers typically bypassed the Ellis Island processing altogether.

To support the activities of the United States Bureau of Immigration, the United States Public Health Service operated an extensive medical service. The medical force at Ellis Island started operating when the first immigration station opened in 1892, and was suspended when the station burned down in 1897. Between 1897 and 1902, medical inspections took place both at other facilities in New York City and on ships in the New York Harbor. A second hospital called U.S. Marine Hospital Number 43 or the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital was built in 1902 and operated through 1930. Uniformed military surgeons staffed the medical division, which was active in the hospital wards, the Battery&#x27;s Barge Office, and Ellis Island&#x27;s Main Building. Immigrants were brought to the island via barge from their transatlantic ships.

A &quot;line inspection&quot; was conducted in the main building. In the line inspection, the immigrants were split into several single-file lines, and inspectors first checked for any visible physical disabilities. Each immigrant was inspected by two inspectors: one to catch any initial physical disabilities, and another to check for any other ailments that the first inspector did not notice. The doctors then observed immigrants as they walked, to determine any irregularities in their gait. Immigrants were asked to drop their baggage and walk up the stairs to the second floor.

The line inspection at Ellis Island was unique because of the volume of people it processed, and as such, used several unconventional methods of medical examination. For example, after an initial check for physical disabilities, inspectors used special forceps or the to examine immigrants for signs of eye diseases such as trachoma. Following each examination, inspectors used chalk to draw symbols on immigrants who were suspected to be sick. Some immigrants supposedly wiped the chalk marks off surreptitiously or inverted their clothes to avoid medical detention. Chalk-marked immigrants and those with suspected mental disabilities were then sent to rooms for further inspection, according to a 1917 account.

The symbols used for chalk markings were:
* B – Back
* C – Conjunctivitis
* TC – Trachoma
* E – Eyes
* F – Face
* FT – Feet
* G – Goiter
* H – Heart
* K – Hernia
* L – Lameness
* N – Neck
* P – Physical and Lungs
* PG – Pregnancy
* S – Senility
* SC – Scalp (favus)
* X – Suspected mental defect
* ⓧ – Definite signs of mental defect
====Primary inspection====
Once immigrants had completed and passed the medical examination, they were sent to the Registry Room to undergo what was called primary inspection. This consisted of interrogations conducted by U.S. Immigrant Inspectors to determine if each newcomer was eligible for admission. In addition, any medical certificates issued by physicians were taken into account. Aside from the U.S. immigrant inspectors, the Bureau of Immigration work force included interpreters, watchmen, matrons, clerks and stenographers. According to a reconstruction of immigration processes in 1907, immigrants who passed the initial inspections spent two to five hours at Ellis Island to do these interviews. Arrivals were asked a couple dozen questions, including name, occupation, and the amount of money they carried. The government wanted to determine whether new arrivals would be self-sufficient upon arrival, and on average, wanted the immigrants to have between $18 and $25 (worth between $ and $ as of ). Some immigrants were also given literacy tests in their native languages, though children under 16 were exempt. The determination of admissibility was relatively arbitrary and determined by the individual inspector.

U.S. Immigrant Inspectors used some other symbols or marks as they interrogated immigrants in the Registry Room to determine whether to admit or detain them, including:

* SI – Special Inquiry
* IV – Immigrant Visa
* LPC – Likely or Liable to become a Public Charge
* Med. Cert. – Medical certificate issued
Those who were cleared were given a medical certificate or an affidavit. According to a 1912 account by physician Alfred C. Reed, immigrants were medically cleared only after three on-duty physicians signed an affidavit. Those with visible illnesses were deported or held in the island&#x27;s hospital. Those who were admitted often met with relatives and friends at the Kissing Post, a wooden column outside the registry room.

Between 1891 and 1930, Ellis Island reviewed over 25 million attempted immigrants, of which 700,000 were given certificates of disability or disease and of these 79,000 were barred from entry. Approximately 4.4% of immigrants between 1909 and 1930 were classified as disabled or diseased, and one percent of immigrants were deported yearly due to medical causes. The proportion of &quot;diseased&quot; increased to 8.0% during the Spanish flu of 1918–1919. More than 3,000 attempted immigrants died in the island&#x27;s hospital. Some unskilled workers were deemed &quot;likely to become a public charge&quot; and so were rejected; about 2% of immigrants were deported. Immigrants could also be excluded if they were disabled and previously rejected; if they were Chinese, regardless of their citizenship status; or if they were contract laborers, stowaways, and workaways. However, immigrants were exempt from deportation if they had close family ties to a U.S. permanent resident or citizen, or if they were seamen. Ellis Island was sometimes known as the &quot;Island of Tears&quot; or &quot;Heartbreak Island&quot; for these deportees. If immigrants were rejected, appeals could be made to a three-member board of inquiry.

===Mass detentions and deportations===

Ellis Island&#x27;s use as a detention center dates from World War I, when it was used to house those who were suspected of being enemy soldiers. During the war, six classes of &quot;enemy aliens&quot; were established, including officers and crewmen from interned ships; three classes of Germans; and suspected spies. After the American entry into World War I, about 1,100 German and Austrian naval officers and crewmen in the Ports of New York and New London were seized and held in Ellis Island&#x27;s baggage and dormitory building. A commodious stockade was built for the seized officers. A 1917 &quot;New York Times&quot; article depicted the conditions of the detention center as being relatively hospitable.

Anti-immigrant sentiments developed in the U.S. during and after World War I, especially toward Southern and Eastern Europeans who were entering the country in large numbers. Following the Immigration Act of 1924, primary inspection was moved to New York Harbor, and Ellis Island only hosted immigrants that were to be detained or deported. After the passage of the 1924 act, the Immigration Service established multiple classes of people who were said to be &quot;deportable&quot;. This included immigrants who entered in violation of previous exclusion acts; Chinese immigrants in violation of the 1924 act; those convicted of felonies or other &quot;crimes of moral turpitude&quot;; and those involved in prostitution.

During and immediately following World War II, Ellis Island was used to hold German merchant mariners and &quot;enemy aliens&quot;—Axis nationals detained for fear of spying, sabotage, and other fifth column activity. When the U.S. entered the war in December 1941, Ellis Island held 279 Japanese, 248 Germans, and 81 Italians removed from the East Coast. Unlike other wartime immigration detention stations, Ellis Island was designated as a permanent holding facility and was used to hold foreign nationals throughout the war. A total of 7,000 Germans, Italians and Japanese were ultimately detained at Ellis Island.

The Internal Security Act of 1950 barred members of communist or fascist organizations from immigrating to the United States. Two notable communists known to have been imprisoned on Ellis Island include Billy Strachan, a pioneer of black civil rights in Britain, and Ferdinand Smith who co-founded the first desegregated union in the history of the United States. Ellis Island saw detention peak at 1,500, but by 1952, after changes to immigration laws and policies, only 30 to 40 detainees remained. One of the last detainees was the Indonesian Aceh separatist Hasan di Tiro who, while a student in New York in 1953, declared himself the &quot;foreign minister&quot; of the rebellious Darul Islam movement and was subsequently stripped of his Indonesian citizenship and held as an &quot;illegal alien&quot;.

===Eugenic influence===
When immigration through Ellis Island peaked, eugenic ideals gained broad popularity and made heavy impact on immigration to the United States by way of exclusion of disabled and &quot;morally defective&quot; people. Eugenicists of the late 19th and early 20th century believed human reproductive selection should be carried out by the state as a collective decision. For many eugenicists, this was considered a patriotic duty as they held an interest in creating a greater national race. Henry Fairfield Osborn&#x27;s opening words to the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; in 1911 were, &quot;As a biologist as well as a patriot...,&quot; on the subject on advocating for tighter inspections of immigrants of the United States.

Eugenic selection occurred on two distinguishable levels:
* State/Local levels which handles institutionalization and sterilization of those considered defective as well as the education of the public; marriage laws; and social pressures such as fitter-family and better-baby contests.
* Immigration control, the screening of immigrants for defects, was notably supported by Harry Laughlin, superintendent of the Eugenics Record Office from 1910 to 1939, who stated that this was where the &quot;federal government must cooperate.&quot;

At the time, it was a broadly popular idea that immigration policies had ought to be based on eugenics principles in order to help create a &quot;superior race&quot; in America. To do this, defective persons needed to be screened by immigration officials and denied entry on the basis of their disability.

During the line inspection process, ailments were marked using chalk. There were three types of illness that were screened for:
* Physical – people who had hereditary or acquired physical disability. These included sickness and disease, deformity, lack of limbs, being abnormally tall or short, feminization, and so forth. This was covered by most of the chalk indications.
* Mental – people who showed signs or history of mental illness and intellectual disability. These included &quot;feeble-mindedness&quot;, &quot;imbecility&quot;, depression, and other illnesses that stemmed from the brain such as epilepsy and cerebral palsy.
* Moral – people who had &quot;moral defects&quot;. These included homosexuals, paraphiliacs, criminals, and the poor or destitute.
The people with moral or mental disability, who were of higher concern to officials and under the law, were required to be excluded from entry to the United States. Persons with physical disability were under higher inspection and could be turned away on the basis of their disability. Much of this came in part of the eugenicist belief that defects are hereditary, especially those of the moral and mental nature those these are often outwardly signified by physical deformity as well. As Chicago surgeon Eugene S. Talbot wrote in 1898, &quot;crime is hereditary, a tendency which is, in most cases, associated with bodily defects.&quot; Likewise, George Lydston, a medicine and criminal anthropology professor, wrote in 1906 that people with &quot;defective physique&quot; were not just criminally associated but that defectiveness was a primary factor &quot;in the causation of crime.&quot;

===Leadership===
Within the U.S. Bureau of Immigration, there were fifteen commissioners assigned to oversee immigration procedures at the Port of New York, and thus, operations at Ellis Island. The twelve commissioners through 1940 were political appointees selected by the U.S. president; the political parties listed are those of the president who appointed each commissioner. One man, William Williams, served twice as commissioner.

# 1890–1893 John B. Weber (Republican)
# 1893–1897 Joseph H. Senner (Democrat)
# 1898–1902 Thomas Fitchie (Republican)
# 1902–1905 William Williams (Republican)
# 1905–1909 Robert Watchorn (Republican)
# 1909–1913 William Williams (Republican)
# 1914–1919 Frederic C. Howe (Democrat)
# 1920–1921 Frederick A. Wallis (Democrat)
# 1921–1923 Robert E. Tod (Republican)
# 1923–1926 Henry H. Curran (Republican)
# 1926–1931 Benjamin M. Day (Republican)
# 1931–1934 Edward Corsi (Republican)
# 1934–1940 Rudolph Reimer (Democrat)

The final three commissioners held a non-partisan position of &quot;district director&quot;. The district directors were:
# 1933–1942 Byron H. Uhl
# 1942–1949 W. Frank Watkins
# 1949–1954 Edward J. Shaughnessy

===Name-change myth===

According to popular legend, immigrants were unwillingly or unknowingly given new names (especially last names or surnames), though this claim is not supported by substantive evidence. Rather, immigration officials simply used the names from the manifests of steamship companies, which served as the only immigration records for those entering the United States. Records show that immigration officials often actually corrected mistakes in immigrants&#x27; names, since inspectors knew three languages on average and each worker was usually assigned to process immigrants who spoke the same languages.

Many immigrant families Americanized their surnames afterward, either immediately following the immigration process or gradually after assimilating into American culture. Because the average family changed their surname five years after immigration, the Naturalization Act of 1906 required documentation of name changes. The myth of name changes at Ellis Island still persists, likely because of the perception of the immigration center as a formidable port of arrival, and because it is used in popular books and movies such as &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;.

==Current use==
The island is administered by the National Park Service, though fire protection and medical services are also provided by the Jersey City Fire Department. In extreme medical emergencies, there is also a helicopter for medical evacuations.

===Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration===

The Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration opened on September 10, 1990, replacing the American Museum of Immigration on Liberty Island, which closed in 1991. The museum contains several exhibits across three floors of the main building, with a first-floor expansion into the kitchen-laundry building. The first floor houses the main lobby within the baggage room, the Family Immigration History Center, &quot;Peopling of America&quot;, and &quot;New Eras of Immigration&quot;. The second floor includes the registry room, the hearing room, &quot;Through America&#x27;s Gate&quot;, and &quot;Peak Immigration Years&quot;. The third floor contains a dormitory room, &quot;Restoring a Landmark&quot;, &quot;Silent Voices&quot;, &quot;Treasures from Home&quot;, and &quot;Ellis Island Chronicles&quot;, as well as rotating exhibits. There are also three theaters used for film and live performances. The third floor contains a library, reading room, and &quot;oral history center&quot;, while the theaters are located on the first and second floors. There are auditoriums on all floors. On the ground floor is a gift shop and bookstore, as well as a booth for audio tours.

In 2008, by act of Congress and despite opposition from the NPS, the museum&#x27;s library was officially renamed the Bob Hope Memorial Library in honor of one of the station&#x27;s most famous immigrants, comedian Bob Hope. On May 20, 2015, the Ellis Island Immigration Museum was officially renamed the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration, coinciding with the opening of the new Peopling of America galleries in the first floor of the kitchen-laundry building. The expansion tells the entire story of American immigration, including before and after the periods that Ellis Island processed immigrants.

====Wall of Honor====

The Wall of Honor outside the main building contains a list of 775,000 names inscribed on 770 panels, including slaves, Native Americans, and immigrants that were not processed on the island. The Wall of Honor originated in the late 1980s as a means to pay for Ellis Island&#x27;s renovation, and initially included 75,000 names. The wall originally opened in 1990 and consisted of copper panels. Shortly afterward it was reconstructed in two phases: a circular portion that started in 1993, and a linear portion that was built between 1998 and 2001. The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation requires potential honorees to pay a fee for inscription. By 2019, the wall was mostly full and only five panels remained to be inscribed.

NPS provides several educational opportunities, including self-guided tours and immersive, role-playing activities. These educational programs and resources cater to over 650,000 students per year and aim to promote discussion while fostering a climate of tolerance and understanding.

===South side===
The south side of the island, home to the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, is abandoned and remains unrenovated. Disagreements over its proposed use have precluded any development on the south side for several decades. The NPS held a competition for proposals to redevelop the south side in 1981 and ultimately selected a plan for a conference center and a 250-to-300-room Sheraton hotel on the site of the hospital. In 1985, while restoration of the north side of Ellis Island was underway, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel convened a long-inactive federal commission to determine how the south side of Ellis Island should be used. Though the hotel proposal was dropped in 1986 for lack of funds, the NPS allowed developer William Hubbard to redevelop the south side as a convention center, though Hubbard was not able to find investors. The south side was proposed for possible future development even through the late 1990s.

Save Ellis Island led preservation efforts of the south side of the island. The ferry building remains only partially accessible to the general public. As part of the National Park Service&#x27;s Centennial Initiative, the south side of the island was to be the target of a project to restore the 28 buildings that have not yet been rehabilitated.

In 2014, Save Ellis Island started offering guided public tours of the south side as part of the &quot;Hard Hat Tour&quot;, which charges an additional fee that is used to support the organization&#x27;s preservation efforts. The south side also includes &quot;Unframed – Ellis Island&quot;, an art installation by the French street artist JR, which includes murals of figures who would have occupied each of the respective hospital buildings.

==Cultural impact==
===Commemorations===

The Ellis Island Medal of Honor is awarded annually to American citizens, both native-born and naturalized. According to the award&#x27;s sponsors, the medal is given to those who &quot;have distinguished themselves within their own ethnic groups while exemplifying the values of the American way of life.&quot; Past medalists include seven U.S. presidents, several world leaders, several Nobel Prize winners, and other leaders and pioneers. The USPS issued an Ellis Island commemorative stamp on February 3, 1998, as part of the Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series.

===Historical designations===
Ellis Island has been part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, which also includes the Statue of Liberty and Liberty Island, since 1965. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1966. Ellis Island has also been on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places since 1971. The main building&#x27;s interior was made a New York City designated landmark in 1993, and the entire island was made a New York City historic district at the same time. In addition, it was placed on UNESCO&#x27;s list of tentative World Heritage Sites in 2017.

<doc id="9808" wikidata="Q48305" url="?curid=9808" title="Euripides">
<text>Euripides () was a Greek tragedian of classical Athens. Along with Aeschylus and Sophocles, he is one of the three ancient Greek tragedians for whom any plays have survived in full. Some ancient scholars attributed ninety-five plays to him, but the &quot;Suda&quot; says it was ninety-two at most. Of these, eighteen or nineteen have survived more or less complete (&quot;Rhesus&quot; is suspect). There are many fragments (some substantial) of most of his other plays. More of his plays have survived intact than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles together, partly because his popularity grew as theirs declinedhe became, in the Hellenistic Age, a cornerstone of ancient literary education, along with Homer, Demosthenes, and Menander.

Euripides is identified with theatrical innovations that have profoundly influenced drama down to modern times, especially in the representation of traditional, mythical heroes as ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. This new approach led him to pioneer developments that later writers adapted to comedy, some of which are characteristic of romance. He also became &quot;the most tragic of poets&quot;, focusing on the inner lives and motives of his characters in a way previously unknown. He was &quot;the creator of ... that cage which is the theatre of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phèdre&quot;, of Ibsen and Strindberg,&quot; in which &quot;imprisoned men and women destroy each other by the intensity of their loves and hates&quot;. But he was also the literary ancestor of comic dramatists as diverse as Menander and George Bernard Shaw.

Known among the writers of classical Athens for his unparalleled sympathy towards all victims of society, including women, slaves or strangers, his contemporaries associated him with Socrates as a leader of a decadent intellectualism. Both were frequently lampooned by comic poets such as Aristophanes. Socrates was eventually put on trial and executed as a corrupting influence. Ancient biographies hold that Euripides chose a voluntary exile in old age, dying in Macedonia, but recent scholarship casts doubt on these sources.

==Life==

Traditional accounts of the author&#x27;s life are found in many commentaries, and include details such as these: He was born on Salamis Island around 480 BC, with parents Cleito (mother) and Mnesarchus (father), a retailer from the deme of Phlya. On receiving an oracle that his son was fated to win &quot;crowns of victory&quot;, Mnesarchus insisted that the boy should train for a career in athletics. But the boy was destined for a career on the stage (where he was to win only five victories, one of these posthumously). He served for a short time as both dancer and torch-bearer at the rites of Apollo Zosterius. His education was not confined to athletics, studying also painting and philosophy under the masters Prodicus and Anaxagoras. He had two disastrous marriages, and both his wivesMelite and Choerine (the latter bearing him three sons)were unfaithful. He became a recluse, making a home for himself in a cave on Salamis (the Cave of Euripides, where a cult of the playwright developed after his death). &quot;There he built an impressive library and pursued daily communion with the sea and sky&quot;. The details of his death are uncertain. It was traditionally held that he retired to the &quot;rustic court&quot; of King Archelaus in Macedonia, where he died in 406 BC. Some modern scholars however claim that in reality Euripides may have never visited Macedonia at all, or if he did, he might have been drawn there by King Archelaus with incentives that were also offered to other artists.

Such biographical details derive almost entirely from three unreliable sources:

* folklore, employed by the ancients to lend colour to the lives of celebrated authors;
* parody, employed by the comic poets to ridicule the tragic poets; and
* &#x27;autobiographical&#x27; clues gleaned from his extant plays (a mere fraction of his total output).

The next three sections expand on the claims of each of these sources, respectively.


===A fabled life===

Euripides was the youngest in a group of three great tragedians, who were almost contemporaries: his first play was staged thirteen years after Sophocles&#x27; debut, and three years after Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Oresteia&quot;. The identity of the trio is neatly underscored by a patriotic account of their roles during Greece&#x27;s great victory over Persia at the Battle of SalamisAeschylus fought there, Sophocles was just old enough to celebrate the victory in a boys&#x27; chorus, and Euripides was born on the very day of the battle. The apocryphal account, that he composed his works in a cave on Salamis island, was a late tradition, probably symbolizing the isolation of an intellectual ahead of his time. Much of his life, and his whole career, coincided with the struggle between Athens and Sparta for hegemony in Greece, but he did not live to see the final defeat of his city. It is said that he died in Macedonia after being attacked by the Molossian hounds of King Archelaus, and that his cenotaph near Piraeus was struck by lightningsigns of his unique powers, whether for good or ill (according to one modern scholar, his death might have been caused instead by the harsh Macedonian winter). In an account by Plutarch, the catastrophic failure of the Sicilian expedition led Athenians to trade renditions of Euripides&#x27; lyrics to their enemies in return for food and drink (&quot;Life of Nicias&quot; 29). Plutarch also provides the story that the victorious Spartan generals, having planned the demolition of Athens and the enslavement of its people, grew merciful after being entertained at a banquet by lyrics from Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Electra&quot;: &quot;they felt that it would be a barbarous act to annihilate a city which produced such men&quot; (&quot;Life of Lysander&quot;).

===A comic life===
Tragic poets were often mocked by comic poets during the dramatic festivals Dionysia and Lenaia, and Euripides was travestied more than most. Aristophanes scripted him as a character in at least three plays: &quot;The Acharnians&quot;, &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot; and &quot;The Frogs&quot;. But Aristophanes also borrowed, rather than merely satirized, some of the tragedian&#x27;s methods; he was himself ridiculed by Cratinus, another comic poet, as: 

According to another comic poet, Teleclides, the plays of Euripides were co-authored by the philosopher Socrates:
Aristophanes alleged that the co-author was a celebrated actor, Cephisophon, who also shared the tragedian&#x27;s house and his wife, while Socrates taught an entire school of quibblers like Euripides:

In &quot;The Frogs&quot;, written when Euripides and Aeschylus were dead, Aristophanes has the god Dionysus venturing down to Hades in search of a good poet to bring back to Athens. After a debate between the shades of Aeschylus and Euripides, the god brings Aeschylus back to life, as more useful to Athens, for his wisdom, rejecting Euripides as merely clever. Such comic &#x27;evidence&#x27; suggests that Athenians admired Euripides even while they mistrusted his intellectualism, at least during the long war with Sparta. Aeschylus had written his own epitaph commemorating his life as a warrior fighting for Athens against Persia, without any mention of his success as a playwright; and Sophocles was celebrated by his contemporaries for his social gifts, and contributions to public life as a state official; but there are no records of Euripides&#x27; public life except as a dramatist—he could well have been &quot;a brooding and bookish recluse&quot;. He is presented as such in &quot;The Acharnians&quot;, where Aristophanes shows him to be living morosely in a precarious house, surrounded by the tattered costumes of his disreputable characters (and yet Agathon, another tragic poet, is discovered in a later play, &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;, to be living in circumstances almost as bizarre). Euripides&#x27; mother was a humble vendor of vegetables, according to the comic tradition, yet his plays indicate that he had a liberal education and hence a privileged background.

===A tragedian&#x27;s life===
Euripides first competed in the City Dionysia, the famous Athenian dramatic festival, in 455 BC, one year after the death of Aeschylus; and did not win first prize until 441 BC. His final competition in Athens was in 408 BC. &quot;The Bacchae&quot; and &quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot; were performed in 405 BC, and first prize was awarded posthumously. He won first prize only five times.

His plays, and those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, indicate a difference in outlook between the threea generation gap probably due to the Sophistic enlightenment in the middle decades of the 5th century: Aeschylus still looked back to the archaic period, Sophocles was in transition between periods, and Euripides was fully imbued with the new spirit of the classical age. When Euripides&#x27; plays are sequenced in time, they also reveal that his outlook might have changed, providing a &quot;spiritual biography&quot;, along these lines:
* an early period of high tragedy (&quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;Hippolytus&quot;)
* a patriotic period at the outset of the Peloponnesian War (&quot;Children of Heracles&quot;, &quot;The Suppliants&quot;)
* a middle period of disillusionment at the senselessness of war (&quot;Hecuba&quot;, &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;)
* an escapist period with a focus on romantic intrigue (&quot;Ion&quot;, &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;, &quot;Helen&quot;)
* a final period of tragic despair (&quot;Orestes&quot;, &quot;Phoenician Women&quot;, &quot;The Bacchae&quot;)
However, about 80% of his plays have been lost, and even the extant plays do not present a fully consistent picture of his &#x27;spiritual&#x27; development (for example, &quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot; is dated with the &#x27;despairing&#x27; &quot;Bacchae&quot;, yet it contains elements that became typical of New Comedy). In the &quot;Bacchae&quot;, he restores the chorus and messenger speech to their traditional role in the tragic plot, and the play appears to be the culmination of a regressive or archaizing tendency in his later works (for which see Chronology below). Believed to have been composed in the wilds of Macedonia, &quot;Bacchae&quot; also dramatizes a primitive side to Greek religion, and some modern scholars have interpreted this particular play biographically, therefore, as:
* a kind of death-bed conversion or renunciation of atheism;
* the poet&#x27;s attempt to ward off the charge of impiety that was later to overtake his friend Socrates;
* evidence of a new belief that religion cannot be analysed rationally.
One of his earliest extant plays, &quot;Medea&quot;, includes a speech that he seems to have written in defence of himself as an intellectual ahead of his time (spoken by Medea):
==Work==
Athenian tragedy in performance during Euripides&#x27; lifetime was a public contest between playwrights. The state funded it and awarded prizes. The language was metrical, spoken and sung. The performance area included a circular floor (called orchestra) where the chorus could dance, a space for actors (three speaking actors in Euripides&#x27; time), a backdrop or skene, and some special effects: an ekkyklema (used to bring the skene&#x27;s &quot;indoors&quot; outdoors) and a mechane (used to lift actors in the air, as in deus ex machina). With the introduction of the third actor (attributed to Aeschylus by Themistius; to Sophocles by Aristotle), acting also began to be regarded as a skill worth prizes, requiring a long apprenticeship in the chorus. Euripides and other playwrights accordingly composed more and more arias for accomplished actors to sing, and this tendency became more marked in his later plays: tragedy was a &quot;living and ever-changing genre&quot; (cf. previous section, and Chronology; a list of his plays is below).

Euripides was distinguished by a series of philosophical and artistic positions that he seems to profess, as well as by the great attention he placed on the concept of freedom, which he articulated in various ways throughout his works. In general, he was interested in the &quot;issues related to the constitutive polarities of Athenian ideology&quot;, that is to say, the oppositions between women and men, slaves and free people, foreigners and Greeks, among others. In this regard, the playwright presented slavery, the foundation of Athenian society, as a product of force and therefore fundamentally unjust. He also sought to place the audience &quot;inside his characters by deep sympathy&quot;. The playwright was engaged in a &quot;constant search for truth and realism&quot;, which drove him to treat women or marital subjects with interest. In this context, Euripides developed detailed female characters with real personalities. This phenomenon is so prevalent that women make up almost all of his characters who think and philosophize.

The comic poet Aristophanes is the earliest known critic to characterize Euripides as a spokesman for destructive, new ideas associated with declining standards in both society and tragedy (see Reception for more). But fifth-century tragedy was a social gathering for &quot;carrying out quite publicly the maintenance and development of mental infrastructure&quot;, and it offered spectators a &quot;platform for an utterly unique form of institutionalized discussion&quot;. The dramatist&#x27;s role was not only to entertain but also educate fellow citizenshe was expected to have a message. Traditional myth provided the subject matter, but the dramatist was meant to be innovative, which led to novel characterizations of heroic figures and use of the mythical past as a tool for discussing present issues. The difference between Euripides and his older colleagues was one of degree: his characters talked about the present more controversially and pointedly than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, sometimes even challenging the democratic order. Thus, for example, Odysseus is represented in &quot;Hecuba&quot; (lines 131–32) as &quot;agile-minded, sweet-talking, demos-pleasing&quot;, i.e. similar to the war-time demagogues that were active in Athens during the Peloponnesian War. Speakers in the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles sometimes distinguish between slaves who are servile by nature and those servile by circumstance, but Euripides&#x27; speakers go further, positing an individual&#x27;s mental, rather than social or physical, state as a true indication of worth. For example, in &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, a love-sick queen rationalizes her position and, reflecting on adultery, arrives at this comment on intrinsic merit:

Euripides&#x27; characters resembled contemporary Athenians rather than heroic figures of myth.

As mouthpieces for contemporary issues, they &quot;all seem to have had at least an elementary course in public speaking&quot;. The dialogue often contrasts so strongly with the mythical and heroic setting that it can seem like Euripides aimed at parody. For example, in &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, the heroine&#x27;s rationalized prayer elicits comment from Menelaus:

Athenian citizens were familiar with rhetoric in the assembly and law courts, and some scholars believe that Euripides was more interested in his characters as speakers with cases to argue than as characters with lifelike personalities. They are self-conscious about speaking formally, and their rhetoric is shown to be flawed, as if Euripides were exploring the problematical nature of language and communication: &quot;For speech points in three different directions at once, to the speaker, to the person addressed, to the features in the world it describes, and each of these directions can be felt as skewed&quot;. For example, in the quotation above, Hecuba presents herself as a sophisticated intellectual describing a rationalized cosmos, but the speech is ill-suited to her audience, the unsophisticated listener Menelaus, and is found to not suit the cosmos either (her grandson is murdered by the Greeks). In &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, speeches appear verbose and ungainly, as if to underscore the limitations of language.

Like Euripides, both Aeschylus and Sophocles created comic effects, contrasting the heroic with the mundane, but they employed minor supporting characters for that purpose. Euripides was more insistent, using major characters as well. His comic touches can be thought to intensify the overall tragic effect, and his realism, which often threatens to make his heroes look ridiculous, marks a world of debased heroism: &quot;The loss of intellectual and moral substance becomes a central tragic statement&quot;. Psychological reversals are common and sometimes happen so suddenly that inconsistency in characterization is an issue for many critics, such as Aristotle, who cited &quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot; as an example (&quot;Poetics&quot; 1454a32). For others, psychological inconsistency is not a stumbling block to good drama: &quot;Euripides is in pursuit of a larger insight: he aims to set forth the two modes, emotional and rational, with which human beings confront their own mortality.&quot; Some think unpredictable behaviour realistic in tragedy: &quot;everywhere in Euripides a preoccupation with individual psychology and its irrational aspects is evident...In his hands tragedy for the first time probed the inner recesses of the human soul and let &quot;passions spin the plot&quot;.&quot; The tension between reason and passion is symbolized by his characters&#x27; relationship with the gods: For example, Hecuba&#x27;s prayer is answered not by Zeus, nor by the law of reason, but by Menelaus, as if speaking for the old gods. And the perhaps most famous example is in &quot;Bacchae&quot; where the god Dionysus savages his own converts. When the gods do appear (in eight of the extant plays), they appear &quot;lifeless and mechanical&quot;. Sometimes condemned by critics as an unimaginative way to end a story, the spectacle of a &quot;god&quot; making a judgement or announcement from a theatrical crane might actually have been intended to provoke scepticism about the religious and heroic dimension of his plays. Similarly, his plays often begin in a banal manner that undermines theatrical illusion. Unlike Sophocles, who established the setting and background of his plays in the introductory dialogue, Euripides used a monologue in which a divinity or human character simply tells the audience all it needs to know to understand what follows.

Aeschylus and Sophocles were innovative, but Euripides had arrived at a position in the &quot;ever-changing genre&quot; where he could easily move between tragic, comic, romantic, and political effects. This versatility appears in individual plays and also over the course of his career. Potential for comedy lay in his use of &#x27;contemporary&#x27; characters, in his sophisticated tone, his relatively informal Greek (see In Greek below), and in his ingenious use of plots centred on motifs that later became standard in Menander&#x27;s New Comedy (for example the &#x27;recognition scene&#x27;). Other tragedians also used recognition scenes, but they were heroic in emphasis, as in Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;, which Euripides parodied in &quot;Electra&quot; (Euripides was unique among the tragedians in incorporating theatrical criticism in his plays). Traditional myth with its exotic settings, heroic adventures, and epic battles offered potential for romantic melodrama as well as for political comments on a war theme, so that his plays are an extraordinary mix of elements. &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, for example, is a powerfully disturbing play on the theme of war&#x27;s horrors, apparently critical of Athenian imperialism (it was composed in the aftermath of the Melian massacre and during the preparations for the Sicilian Expedition), yet it features the comic exchange between Menelaus and Hecuba quoted above, and the chorus considers Athens, the &quot;blessed land of Theus&quot;, to be a desirable refugesuch complexity and ambiguity are typical both of his &quot;patriotic&quot; and &quot;anti-war&quot; plays.

Tragic poets in the fifth century competed against one another at the City Dionysia, each with a tetralogy of three tragedies and a satyr play. The few extant fragments of satyr plays attributed to Aeschylus and Sophocles indicate that these were a loosely structured, simple, and jovial form of entertainment. But in &quot;Cyclops&quot; (the only complete satyr-play that survives), Euripides structured the entertainment more like a tragedy and introduced a note of critical irony typical of his other work. His genre-bending inventiveness is shown above all in &quot;Alcestis&quot;, a blend of tragic and satyric elements. This fourth play in his tetralogy for 438 BC (i.e., it occupied the position conventionally reserved for satyr plays) is a &quot;tragedy&quot;, featuring Heracles as a satyric hero in conventional satyr-play scenes: an arrival, a banquet, a victory over an ogre (in this case, death), a happy ending, a feast, and a departure for new adventures. Most of the big innovations in tragedy were made by Aeschylus and Sophocles, but &quot;Euripides made innovations on a smaller scale that have impressed some critics as cumulatively leading to a radical change of direction&quot;.

Euripides is also known for his use of irony. Many Greek tragedians make use of dramatic irony to bring out the emotion and realism of their characters or plays, but Euripides uses irony to foreshadow events and occasionally amuse his audience. For example, in his play &quot;Heracles&quot;, Heracles comments that all men love their children and wish to see them grow. The irony here is that Heracles will be driven into madness by Hera and will kill his children. Similarly, in &quot;Helen&quot;, Theoclymenus remarks how happy he is that his sister has the gift of prophecy and will warn him of any plots or tricks against him (the audience already knows that she has betrayed him). In this instance, Euripides uses irony not only for foreshadowing but also for comic effect—which few tragedians did. Likewise, in the &quot;Bacchae&quot;, Pentheus&#x27;s first threat to the god Dionysus is that if Pentheus catches him in his city, he will &#x27;chop off his head&#x27;, whereas it is Pentheus who is beheaded at the end of the play.

=== Language===
The spoken language of the Euripidean plays is not fundamentally different in style from that of Aeschylus or Sophoclesit employs poetic meters, a rarefied vocabulary, fullness of expression, complex syntax, and ornamental figures, all aimed at representing an elevated style. But its rhythms are somewhat freer, and more natural, than that of his predecessors, and the vocabulary has been expanded to allow for intellectual and psychological subtleties. Euripides has been hailed as a great lyric poet. In &quot;Medea&quot;, for example, he composed for his city, Athens, &quot;the noblest of her songs of praise&quot;. His lyrical skills are not just confined to individual poems: &quot;A play of Euripides is a musical whole...one song echoes motifs from the preceding song, while introducing new ones.&quot; For some critics, the lyrics often seem dislocated from the action, but the extent and significance of this is &quot;a matter of scholarly debate&quot;. See Chronology for details about his style.

==Reception==

Euripides was so widely read in the antique education that only Homer surpassed him. But the breadth of reception drew mixture. He aroused, and continues to arouse, strong opinions for and against his work:

Aeschylus gained thirteen victories as a dramatist; Sophocles at least twenty; Euripides only four in his lifetime; and this has often been taken as indication of the latter&#x27;s unpopularity. But a first place might not have been the main criterion for success (the system of selecting judges appears to have been flawed), and merely being chosen to compete was a mark of distinction. Moreover, to have been singled out by Aristophanes for so much comic attention is proof of popular interest in his work. Sophocles was appreciative enough of the younger poet to be influenced by him, as is evident in his later plays &quot;Philoctetes&quot; and &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;. According to Plutarch, Euripides had been very well received in Sicily, to the extent that after the failure of the Sicilian Expedition, many Athenian captives were released, simply for being able to teach their captors whatever fragments they could remember of his work. Less than a hundred years later, Aristotle developed an almost &quot;biological&#x27; theory of the development of tragedy in Athens: the art form grew under the influence of Aeschylus, matured in the hands of Sophocles, then began its precipitous decline with Euripides. However, &quot;his plays continued to be applauded even after those of Aeschylus and Sophocles had come to seem remote and irrelevant&quot;; they became school classics in the Hellenistic period (as mentioned in the introduction) and, due to Seneca&#x27;s adaptation of his work for Roman audiences, &quot;it was Euripides, not Aeschylus or Sophocles, whose tragic muse presided over the rebirth of tragedy in Renaissance Europe.&quot;

In the seventeenth century, Racine expressed admiration for Sophocles, but was more influenced by Euripides (&quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot; and &quot;Hippolytus&quot; were the models for his plays &quot;Iphigénie&quot; and &quot;Phèdre&quot;). Euripides&#x27; reputation was to take a beating in the early 19th century, when Friedrich Schlegel and his brother August Wilhelm Schlegel championed Aristotle&#x27;s &#x27;biological&#x27; model of theatre history, identifying Euripides with the moral, political, and artistic degeneration of Athens. August Wilhelm&#x27;s Vienna lectures on dramatic art and literature went through four editions between 1809 and 1846; and, in them, he opined that Euripides &quot;not only destroyed the external order of tragedy but missed its entire meaning&quot;. This view influenced Friedrich Nietzsche, who seems, however, not to have known the Euripidean plays well. But literary figures, such as the poet Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning, could study and admire the Schlegels, while still appreciating Euripides as &quot;our Euripides the human&quot; (&quot;Wine of Cyprus&quot; stanza 12). Classicists such as Arthur Verrall and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff reacted against the views of the Schlegels and Nietzsche, constructing arguments sympathetic to Euripides, which involved Wilamowitz in this restatement of Greek tragedy as a genre: &quot;A [Greek] tragedy does not have to end &#x27;tragically&#x27; or be &#x27;tragic&#x27;. The only requirement is a serious treatment.&quot; In the English-speaking world, the pacifist Gilbert Murray played an important role in popularizing Euripides, influenced perhaps by his anti-war plays. Today, as in the time of Euripides, traditional assumptions are constantly under challenge, and audiences therefore have a natural affinity with the Euripidean outlook, which seems nearer to ours, for example, than the Elizabethan. As stated above, however, opinions continue to diverge, so that modern readers might actually &quot;seem to feel a special affinity with Sophocles&quot;; one recent critic might dismiss the debates in Euripides&#x27; plays as &quot;self-indulgent digression for the sake of rhetorical display&quot;; and one spring to the defence: &quot;His plays are remarkable for their range of tones and the gleeful inventiveness, which morose critics call cynical artificiality, of their construction.&quot;

Unique among writers of ancient Athens, Euripides demonstrated sympathy towards the underrepresented members of society. His male contemporaries were frequently shocked by the heresies he put into the mouths of characters, such as these words of his heroine Medea:
==Texts==

===Transmission===
The textual transmission of the plays, from the 5th century BC, when they were first written, until the era of the printing press, was a largely haphazard process. Much of Euripides&#x27; work was lost or corrupted; but the period also included triumphs by scholars and copyists, thanks to whom much was recovered and preserved. Summaries of the transmission are often found in modern editions of the plays, three of which are used as sources for this summary.

The plays of Euripides, like those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, circulated in written form. But literary conventions that we take for granted today had not been inventedthere was no spacing between words; no consistency in punctuation, nor elisions; no marks for breathings and accents (guides to pronunciation, and word recognition); no convention to denote change of speaker; no stage directions; and verse was written straight across the page, like prose. Possibly, those who bought texts supplied their own interpretative markings. Papyri discoveries have indicated, for example, that a change in speakers was loosely denoted with a variety of signs, such as equivalents of the modern dash, colon, and full-stop. The absence of modern literary conventions (which aid comprehension), was an early and persistent source of errors, affecting transmission. Errors were also introduced when Athens replaced its old Attic alphabet with the Ionian alphabet, a change sanctioned by law in 403–402 BC, adding a new complication to the task of copying. Many more errors came from the tendency of actors to interpolate words and sentences, producing so many corruptions and variations that a law was proposed by Lycurgus of Athens in 330 BC &quot;that the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides should be written down and preserved in a public office; and that the town clerk should read the text over with the actors; and that all performances which did not comply with this regulation should be illegal.&quot; The law was soon disregarded, and actors continued to make changes until about 200 BC, after which the habit ceased. It was about then that Aristophanes of Byzantium compiled an edition of all the extant plays of Euripides, collated from pre-Alexandrian texts, furnished with introductions and accompanied by a commentary that was &quot;published&quot; separately. This became the &quot;standard edition&quot; for the future, and it featured some of the literary conventions that modern readers expect: there was still no spacing between words; little or no punctuation; and no stage directions; but abbreviated names denoted changes of speaker; lyrics were broken into &quot;cola&quot; and &quot;strophai&quot;, or lines and stanzas; and a system of accentuation was introduced.

After this creation of a standard edition, the text was fairly safe from errors, besides slight and gradual corruption introduced with tedious copying. Many of these trivial errors occurred in the Byzantine period, following a change in script (from uncial to minuscule), and many were &quot;homophonic&quot; errorsequivalent, in English, to substituting &quot;right&quot; for &quot;write&quot;; except that there were more opportunities for Byzantine scribes to make these errors, because η, ι, οι and ει, were pronounced similarly in the Byzantine period.

Around 200 AD, ten of the plays of Euripides began to be circulated in a select edition, possibly for use in schools, with some commentaries or scholia recorded in the margins. Similar editions had appeared for Aeschylus and Sophoclesthe only plays of theirs that survive today. Euripides, however, was more fortunate than the other tragedians, with a second edition of his work surviving, compiled in alphabetical order as if from a set of his collect works; but without scholia attached. This &quot;Alphabetical&quot; edition was combined with the &quot;Select&quot; edition by some unknown Byzantine scholar, bringing together all the nineteen plays that survive today. The &quot;Select&quot; plays are found in many medieval manuscripts, but only two manuscripts preserve the &quot;Alphabetical&quot; playsoften denoted L and P, after the Laurentian Library at Florence, and the Bibliotheca Palatina in the Vatican, where they are stored. It is believed that P derived its Alphabet plays and some Select plays from copies of an ancestor of L, but the remainder is derived from elsewhere. P contains all the extant plays of Euripides, L is missing &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; and latter part of &quot;The Bacchae&quot;.

In addition to L, P, and many other medieval manuscripts, there are fragments of plays on papyrus. These papyrus fragments are often recovered only with modern technology. In June 2005, for example, classicists at the University of Oxford worked on a joint project with Brigham Young University, using multi-spectral imaging technology to retrieve previously illegible writing (see References). Some of this work employed infrared technology—previously used for satellite imaging—to detect previously unknown material by Euripides, in fragments of the Oxyrhynchus papyri, a collection of ancient manuscripts held by the university.

It is from such materials that modern scholars try to piece together copies of the original plays. Sometimes the picture is almost lost. Thus, for example, two extant plays, &quot;The Phoenician Women&quot; and &quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot;, are significantly corrupted by interpolations (the latter possibly being completed post mortem by the poet&#x27;s son); and the very authorship of &quot;Rhesus&quot; is a matter of dispute. In fact, the very existence of the Alphabet plays, or rather the absence of an equivalent edition for Sophocles and Aeschylus, could distort our notions of distinctive Euripidean qualitiesmost of his least &quot;tragic&quot; plays are in the Alphabet edition; and, possibly, the other two tragedians would appear just as genre-bending as this &quot;restless experimenter&quot;, if we possessed more than their &quot;select&quot; editions.

&quot;See Extant plays below for listing of &quot;Select&quot; and &quot;Alphabetical&quot; plays.&quot;

===Chronology===
Original production dates for some of Euripides&#x27; plays are known from ancient records, such as lists of prize-winners at the Dionysia; and approximations are obtained for the remainder by various means. Both the playwright and his work were travestied by comic poets such as Aristophanes, the known dates of whose own plays can serve as a terminus ad quem for those of Euripides (though the gap can be considerable: twenty-seven years separate &quot;Telephus&quot;, known to have been produced in 438 BC, from its parody in &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot; in 411 BC.). References in Euripides&#x27; plays to contemporary events provide a terminus a quo, though sometimes the references might even precede a datable event (e.g. lines 1074–89 in &quot;Ion&quot; describe a procession to Eleusis, which was probably written before the Spartans occupied it during the Peloponnesian War). Other indications of dating are obtained by stylometry.

Greek tragedy comprised lyric and dialogue, the latter mostly in iambic trimeter (three pairs of iambic feet per line). Euripides sometimes &#x27;resolved&#x27; the two syllables of the iamb (˘¯) into three syllables (˘˘˘), and this tendency increased so steadily over time that the number of resolved feet in a play can indicate an approximate date of composition (see Extant plays below for one scholar&#x27;s list of resolutions per hundred trimeters). Associated with this increase in resolutions was an increasing vocabulary, often involving prefixes to refine meanings, allowing the language to assume a more natural rhythm, while also becoming ever more capable of psychological and philosophical subtlety.

The trochaic tetrameter catalecticfour pairs of trochees per line, with the final syllable omittedwas identified by Aristotle as the original meter of tragic dialogue (&quot;Poetics&quot; 1449a21). Euripides employs it here and there in his later plays, but seems not to have used it in his early plays at all, with &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; being the earliest appearance of it in an extant play—it is symptomatic of an archaizing tendency in his later works.

The later plays also feature extensive use of stichomythia (i.e. a series of one-liners). The longest such scene comprises one hundred and five lines in &quot;Ion&quot; (lines 264–369). In contrast, Aeschylus never exceeded twenty lines of stichomythia; Sophocles&#x27; longest such scene was fifty lines, and that is interrupted several times by αντιλαβή (&quot;Electra&quot;, lines 1176–1226).

Euripides&#x27; use of lyrics in sung parts shows the influence of Timotheus of Miletus in the later playsthe individual singer gained prominence, and was given additional scope to demonstrate his virtuosity in lyrical duets, as well as replacing some of the chorus&#x27;s functions with monodies. At the same time, choral odes began to take on something of the form of dithyrambs reminiscent of the poetry of Bacchylides, featuring elaborate treatment of myths. Sometimes these later choral odes seem to have only a tenuous connection with the plot, linked to the action only in their mood. The &quot;Bacchae&quot;, however, shows a reversion to old forms, possibly as a deliberate archaic effect, or because there were no virtuoso choristers in Macedonia (where it is said to have been written).

===Lost and fragmentary plays===
The following plays have come down to us in fragmentary form, if at all. They are known through quotations in other works (sometimes as little as a single line); pieces of papyrus; partial copies in manuscript; part of a collection of hypotheses (or summaries); and through being parodied in the works of Aristophanes. Some of the fragments, such as those of &quot;Hypsipyle&quot;, are extensive enough to allow tentative reconstructions to be proposed.

A two-volume selection from the fragments, with facing-page translation, introductions, and notes, was published by Collard, Cropp, Lee, and Gibert; as were two Loeb Classical Library volumes derived from them; and there are critical studies in T. B. L. Webster&#x27;s older &quot;The Tragedies of Euripides&quot;, based on what were then believed to be the most likely reconstructions of the plays.

The following lost and fragmentary plays can be dated, and are arranged in roughly chronological order:

<text>Emily Jane Brontë (, ; 30 July 1818 – 19 December 1848) was an English novelist and poet who is best known for her only novel, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, now considered a classic of English literature. She also published a book of poetry with her sisters Charlotte and Anne titled &quot;Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell&quot; with her own poems finding regard as poetic genius. Emily was the second-youngest of the four surviving Brontë siblings, between the youngest Anne and her brother Branwell. She published under the pen name Ellis Bell.

==Early life==
Emily Brontë was born on 30 July 1818 to Maria Branwell and an Irish father, Patrick Brontë. The family was living on Market Street, in a house now known as the Brontë Birthplace in the village of Thornton on the outskirts of Bradford, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. Emily was the second youngest of six siblings, preceded by Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte and Branwell. In 1820, Emily&#x27;s younger sister Anne, the last Brontë child, was born. Shortly thereafter, the family moved eight miles away to Haworth, where Patrick was employed as perpetual curate. In Haworth, the children would have opportunities to develop their literary talents.

When Emily was only three, and all six children under the age of eight, she and her siblings lost their mother, Maria, to cancer on 15 September 1821. The younger children were to be cared for by Elizabeth Branwell, their aunt and Maria&#x27;s sister.

Emily&#x27;s three elder sisters, Maria, Elizabeth, and Charlotte were sent to the Clergy Daughters&#x27; School at Cowan Bridge. At the age of six, on 25 November 1824, Emily joined her sisters at school for a brief period. At school, however, the children suffered abuse and privations, and when a typhoid epidemic swept the school, Maria and Elizabeth became ill. Maria, who may actually have had tuberculosis, was sent home, where she died. Elizabeth died shortly after.

The four youngest Brontë children, all under ten years of age, had suffered the loss of the three eldest women in their immediate family.

Charlotte maintained that the school&#x27;s poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and that it had hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died in 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. Charlotte would use her experiences and knowledge of the school as the basis for Lowood School in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.

The three remaining sisters and their brother Branwell were thereafter educated at home by their father and aunt Elizabeth Branwell. A shy girl, Emily was very close to her siblings and was known as a great animal lover, especially for befriending stray dogs she found wandering around the countryside. Despite the lack of formal education, Emily and her siblings had access to a wide range of published material; favourites included Sir Walter Scott, Byron, Shelley, and &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

Inspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell had received as a gift, the children began to write stories, which they set in a number of invented imaginary worlds populated by their soldiers as well as their heroes, the Duke of Wellington and his sons, Charles and Arthur Wellesley. Little of Emily&#x27;s work from this period survives, except for poems spoken by characters. Initially, all four children shared in creating stories about a world called Angria.

However, when Emily was 13, she and Anne withdrew from participation in the Angria story and began a new one about Gondal, a fictional island whose myths and legends were to preoccupy the two sisters throughout their lives. With the exception of their Gondal poems and Anne&#x27;s lists of Gondal&#x27;s characters and placenames, Emily and Anne&#x27;s Gondal writings were largely not preserved. Among those that did survive are some &quot;diary papers&quot;, written by Emily in her twenties, which describe current events in Gondal. The heroes of Gondal tended to resemble the popular image of the Scottish Highlander, a sort of British version of the &quot;noble savage&quot;: romantic outlaws capable of more nobility, passion, and bravery than the denizens of &quot;civilization&quot;. Similar themes of romanticism and noble savagery are apparent across the Brontës&#x27; juvenilia, notably in Branwell&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Alexander Percy&quot;, which tells the story of an all-consuming, death-defying, and ultimately self-destructive love and is generally considered an inspiration for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.

At 17, Emily began to attend the Roe Head Girls&#x27; School, where Charlotte was a teacher, but suffered from extreme homesickness, according to Charlotte, and left after only a few months. Charlotte wrote later that &quot;Liberty was the breath of Emily&#x27;s nostrils; without it, she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless, very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what she failed in enduring... I felt in my heart she would die if she did not go home, and with this conviction obtained her recall.&quot; Emily returned home and Anne took her place. At this time, the girls&#x27; objective was to obtain sufficient education to open a small school of their own.

==Adulthood==
Emily became a teacher at Law Hill School in Halifax beginning in September 1838, when she was twenty. Her health soon broke under the stress of the 17-hour workday, and she returned home in April 1839. Thereafter she remained at home, helping the family&#x27;s servant with the cooking, ironing, and cleaning at Haworth. She taught herself German from books and also practiced the piano. Emily was an accomplished pianist.

In 1842, Emily accompanied Charlotte to the Héger Pensionnat in Brussels, Belgium, where they attended the girls&#x27; academy run by Constantin Héger in the hope of perfecting their French and German before opening their own school. Unlike Charlotte, Emily was uncomfortable in Brussels and refused to adopt Belgian fashions, saying &quot;I wish to be as God made me&quot;, which rendered her something of an outcast. Nine of Emily&#x27;s French essays survive from this period. Héger seems to have been impressed with the strength of Emily&#x27;s character, writing that:
She should have been a man – a great navigator. Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.

The two sisters were committed to their studies and by the end of the term had become so competent in French that Madame Héger proposed that they both stay another half-year, even, according to Charlotte, offering to dismiss the English master so that she could take his place. Emily had, by this time, become a competent pianist and teacher, and it was suggested that she might stay on to teach music. However, the illness and death of their aunt, Elizabeth Branwell, necessitated their return to Haworth. In 1844, the sisters attempted to open a school in their house, but their plans were stymied by an inability to attract students to the remote area.

In 1844, Emily began going through all the poems she had written, recopying them neatly into two notebooks. One was labelled &quot;Gondal Poems&quot;; the other was unlabelled. Scholars such as Fannie Ratchford and Derek Roper have attempted to piece together a Gondal storyline and chronology from these poems. 
In the autumn of 1845, Charlotte discovered the notebooks and insisted that the poems be published. Emily, understandably furious at the invasion of her privacy, at first refused but, according to Charlotte, relented when Anne brought out her manuscripts and revealed to Charlotte that she had been writing poems in secret as well. Around this time Emily wrote one of her most famous poems, &quot;No coward soul is mine&quot;. Some literary critics have speculated that it is a poem about Anne Brontë, while others see it as an answer to the violation of her privacy and her own transformation into a published writer. Despite Charlotte&#x27;s later claim that it was Emily&#x27;s final poem, this is factually inaccurate.

In 1846, the sisters&#x27; poems were published in one volume as &quot;Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell&quot;. Charlotte later stated that the Brontë sisters had adopted pseudonyms for publication, preserving their initials: Charlotte was &quot;Currer Bell&quot;, Emily was &quot;Ellis Bell&quot; and Anne was &quot;Acton Bell&quot;. Charlotte wrote in the &#x27;Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell&#x27; that their &quot;ambiguous choice&quot; was &quot;dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because... we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice&quot;. Charlotte contributed 19 poems, and Emily and Anne each contributed 21. Although the sisters were told several months after publication that only two copies had sold, they were not discouraged (of their two readers, one was impressed enough to request their autographs). &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; reviewer praised Ellis Bell&#x27;s work for its music and power, singling out those poems as the best in the book: &quot;Ellis possesses a fine, quaint spirit and an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted&quot;, and &quot;The Critic&quot; reviewer recognised &quot;the presence of more genius than it was supposed this utilitarian age had devoted to the loftier exercises of the intellect.&quot;

==Personality and character==

Emily Brontë&#x27;s solitary nature has made her a mysterious figure and a challenge for biographers to assess. Except for Ellen Nussey and Louise de Bassompierre, Emily&#x27;s fellow student in Brussels, she does not seem to have made any friends outside her family. Her closest friend was her sister Anne. Together they shared their own fantasy world, Gondal, and, according to Ellen Nussey, in childhood they were &quot;like twins&quot;, &quot;inseparable companions&quot; and &quot;in the very closest sympathy which never had any interruption&quot;. In 1845 Anne took Emily to visit some of the places she had come to know and love in the five years she spent as governess. A plan to visit Scarborough fell through and instead the sisters went to York where Anne showed Emily York Minster. During the trip the sisters acted out some of their Gondal characters.

Charlotte Brontë remains the primary source of information about Emily, although as an elder sister, writing publicly about her only shortly after her death, she is considered by certain scholars not to be a neutral witness. Stevie Davies believes that there is what might be called &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s smoke-screen&quot;, and argues that Emily evidently shocked her, to the point that she may even have doubted her sister&#x27;s sanity. After Emily&#x27;s death, Charlotte rewrote her character, history and even poems on a model more acceptable to her and the bourgeois reading public. Biographer Claire O&#x27;Callaghan suggests that the trajectory of Brontë&#x27;s legacy was altered significantly by Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s biography of Charlotte, concerning not only because Gaskell did not visit Haworth until after Emily&#x27;s death, but also because Gaskell admits to disliking what she did know of Emily in her biography of Charlotte. As O&#x27;Callaghan and others have noted, Charlotte was Gaskell&#x27;s primary source of information on Emily&#x27;s life and may have exaggerated or fabricated Emily&#x27;s frailty and shyness to cast herself in the role of maternal saviour.

Charlotte presented Emily as someone whose &quot;natural&quot; love of the beauties of nature had become somewhat exaggerated owing to her shy nature, portraying her as too fond of the Yorkshire moors, and homesick whenever she was away. According to Lucasta Miller, in her analysis of Brontë biographies, &quot;Charlotte took on the role of Emily&#x27;s first mythographer.&quot; In the &quot;Preface&quot; to the Second Edition of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, in 1850, Charlotte wrote:

My sister&#x27;s disposition was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her tendency to seclusion; except to go to church or take a walk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her feeling for the people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.
Emily&#x27;s unsociability and extremely shy nature have subsequently been reported many times. According to Norma Crandall, her &quot;warm, human aspect&quot; was &quot;usually revealed only in her love of nature and of animals&quot;. In a similar description, &quot;The Literary News&quot; (1883) states: &quot;[Emily] loved the solemn moors, she loved all wild, free creatures and things&quot;, and critics attest that her love of the moors is manifest in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Over the years, Emily&#x27;s love of nature has been the subject of many anecdotes. A newspaper dated 31 December 1899, gives the folksy account that &quot;with bird and beast [Emily] had the most intimate relations, and from her walks she often came with fledgling or young rabbit in hand, talking softly to it, quite sure, too, that it understood&quot;.

Elizabeth Gaskell, in her biography of Charlotte, told the story of Emily&#x27;s punishing her pet dog Keeper for lying &quot;on the delicate white counterpane&quot; that covered one of the beds in the Parsonage. According to Gaskell, she struck him with her fists until he was &quot;half-blind&quot; with his eyes &quot;swelled up&quot;. This story has been called into question by many biographers and scholars, including Janet Gezari, Lucasta Miller and Claire O&#x27;Callaghan. It also contradicts the following account of Emily&#x27;s and Keeper&#x27;s relationship:

Poor old Keeper, Emily&#x27;s faithful friend and worshipper, seemed to understand her like a human being. One evening, when the four friends were sitting closely round the fire in the sitting-room, Keeper forced himself in between Charlotte and Emily and mounted himself on Emily&#x27;s lap; finding the space too limited for his comfort he pressed himself forward on to the guest&#x27;s knees, making himself quite comfortable. Emily&#x27;s heart was won by the unresisting endurance of the visitor, little guessing that she herself, being in close contact, was the inspiring cause of submission to Keeper&#x27;s preference. Sometimes Emily would delight in showing off Keeper—make him frantic in action, and roar with the voice of a lion. It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary sitting-room. Keeper was a solemn mourner at Emily&#x27;s funeral and never recovered his cheerfulness.


In &quot;Queens of Literature of the Victorian Era&quot; (1886), Eva Hope summarises Emily&#x27;s character as &quot;a peculiar mixture of timidity and Spartan-like courage&quot;, and goes on to say, &quot;She was painfully shy, but physically she was brave to a surprising degree. She loved few persons, but those few with a passion of self-sacrificing tenderness and devotion. To other people&#x27;s failings she was understanding and forgiving, but over herself she kept a continual and most austere watch, never allowing herself to deviate for one instant from what she considered her duty.&quot;

Emily Brontë has often been characterised as a devout if somewhat unorthodox Christian, a heretic and a visionary &quot;mystic of the moors&quot;.

==&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;==
Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was first published in London in 1847 by Thomas Cautley Newby, appearing as the first two volumes of a three-volume set that included Anne Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;. The authors were printed as being Ellis and Acton Bell; Emily&#x27;s real name did not appear until 1850, when it was printed on the title page of an edited commercial edition. The novel&#x27;s innovative structure somewhat puzzled critics.

&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;″s violence and passion led the Victorian public and many early reviewers to think that it had been written by a man. According to Juliet Gardiner, &quot;the vivid sexual passion and power of its language and imagery impressed, bewildered and appalled reviewers.&quot; Literary critic Thomas Joudrey further contextualizes this reaction: &quot;Expecting in the wake of Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; to be swept up in an earnest Bildungsroman, they were instead shocked and confounded by a tale of unchecked primal passions, replete with savage cruelty and outright barbarism.&quot; Even though the novel received mixed reviews when it first came out, and was often condemned for its portrayal of amoral passion, the book subsequently became an English literary classic. Emily Brontë never knew the extent of fame she achieved with her only novel, as she died a year after its publication, aged 30.

Although a letter from her publisher indicates that Emily had begun to write a second novel, the manuscript has never been found. Perhaps Emily or a member of her family eventually destroyed the manuscript, if it existed, when she was prevented by illness from completing it. It has also been suggested that, though less likely, the letter could have been intended for Anne Brontë, who was already writing &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;, her second novel.

==Death==

Emily&#x27;s health was probably weakened by the harsh local climate and by unsanitary conditions at home, where water was contaminated by run off from the church&#x27;s graveyard. Branwell died suddenly, on Sunday, 24 September 1848. At his funeral service, a week later, Emily caught a severe cold that quickly developed into inflammation of the lungs and led to tuberculosis. Though her condition worsened steadily, she rejected medical help and all offered remedies, saying that she would have &quot;no poisoning doctor&quot; near her. On the morning of 19 December 1848, Charlotte, fearing for her sister, wrote:

She grows daily weaker. The physician&#x27;s opinion was expressed too obscurely to be of use – he sent some medicine which she would not take. Moments so dark as these I have never known – I pray for God&#x27;s support to us all.

At noon, Emily was worse; she could only whisper in gasps. With her last audible words, she said to Charlotte, &quot;If you will send for a doctor, I will see him now&quot;, but it was too late. She died that same day at about two in the afternoon. According to Mary Robinson, an early biographer of Emily, it happened while she was sitting on the sofa. However, Charlotte&#x27;s letter to William Smith Williams, in which she mentions Emily&#x27;s dog, Keeper, lying at the side of her dying-bed, makes this statement seem unlikely.

It was less than three months after Branwell&#x27;s death, which led Martha Brown, a housemaid, to declare that &quot;Miss Emily died of a broken heart for love of her brother&quot;. Emily had grown so thin that her coffin measured only 16 inches (40 centimeters) wide. The carpenter said he had never made a narrower one for an adult. Her remains were interred in the family vault in St Michael and All Angels&#x27; Church, Haworth.

===Legacy===
The 1946 film &quot;Devotion&quot; was a highly fictionalized account of the lives of the Brontë sisters.

Emily&#x27;s novel was the inspiration for the debut single, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, by UK singer-songwriter Kate Bush released in January 1978 as the lead single from Bush&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;. It uses unusual harmonic progressions and irregular phrase lengths, with lyrics inspired by the location and characters of the 1847 novel.

In 2019 the English folk group The Unthanks released &quot;Lines&quot;, three short albums, which include settings of Brontë&#x27;s poems to music. Recording took place at the Brontës&#x27; home, using their own Regency era piano played by Adrian McNally.

In the 2019 film &quot;How to Build a Girl&quot;, Emily and Charlotte Brontë are among the historical figures in Johanna&#x27;s wall collage.

In May 2021, the contents of the Honresfield library, a collection of rare books and manuscripts assembled by Rochdale mill owners Alfred and William Law, was re-discovered after nearly a century. In the collection were handwritten poems by Emily Brontë, as well as the Brontë family edition of Bewick&#x27;s &#x27;History of British Birds.&#x27; The collection was to be auctioned off at Sotheby&#x27;s and was estimated to sell for £1 million.

In the 2022 film &quot;Emily&quot;, written and directed by Frances O&#x27;Connor, Emma Mackey plays Emily before the publication of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. The film mixes known biographical details with imagined situations and relationships.

Norwegian composer Ola Gjeilo set select Emily Brontë poems to music with SATB chorus, string orchestra, and piano, a work commissioned and premiered by the San Francisco Choral Society in a series of concerts in Oakland and San Francisco.

<text>An extinction event (also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp fall in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the background extinction rate and the rate of speciation. Estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from disagreement as to what constitutes a &quot;major&quot; extinction event, and the data chosen to measure past diversity.

==The &quot;Big Five&quot; mass extinctions==
In a landmark paper published in 1982, Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup identified five particular geological intervals with excessive diversity loss. They were originally identified as outliers on a general trend of decreasing extinction rates during the Phanerozoic, but as more stringent statistical tests have been applied to the accumulating data, it has been established that in the current, Phanerozoic Eon, multicellular animal life has experienced at least five major and many minor mass extinctions. The &quot;Big Five&quot; cannot be so clearly defined, but rather appear to represent the largest (or some of the largest) of a relatively smooth continuum of extinction events. All of the five in the Phanerozoic Eon were anciently preceded by the presumed far more extensive mass extinction of microbial life during the Great Oxidation Event (a.k.a. Oxygen Catastrophe) early in the Proterozoic Eon. At the end of the Ediacaran and just before the Cambrian explosion, yet another Proterozoic extinction event (of unknown magnitude) is speculated to have ushered in the Phanerozoic.

Despite the common presentation focusing only on these five events, no measure of extinction shows any definite line separating them from the many other Phanerozoic extinction events that appear only slightly lesser catastrophes; further, using different methods of calculating an extinction&#x27;s impact can lead to other events featuring in the top five.

Fossil records of older events are more difficult to interpret. This is because:
* Older fossils are more difficult to find, as they are usually buried at a considerable depth.
* Dating of older fossils is more difficult.
* Productive fossil beds are researched more than unproductive ones, therefore leaving certain periods unresearched.
* Prehistoric environmental events can disturb the deposition process.
* Marine fossils tend to be better preserved than their more sought-after land-based counterparts, but the deposition and preservation of fossils on land is more erratic.

It has been suggested that the apparent variations in marine biodiversity may actually be an artifact, with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time periods. However, statistical analysis shows that this can only account for 50% of the observed pattern, and other evidence such as fungal spikes (geologically rapid increase in fungal abundance) provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are real. A quantification of the rock exposure of Western Europe indicates that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation has been sought are most readily explained by sampling bias.

== Sixth mass extinction ==

Research completed after the seminal 1982 paper (Sepkoski and Raup) has concluded that a sixth mass extinction event due to human activities is currently under way:

== Extinctions by severity ==
Extinction events can be tracked by several methods, including geological change, ecological impact, extinction vs. origination (speciation) rates, and most commonly diversity loss among taxonomic units. Most early papers used families as the unit of taxonomy, based on compendiums of marine animal families by Sepkoski (1982, 1992). Later papers by Sepkoski and other authors switched to genera, which are more precise than families and less prone to taxonomic bias or incomplete sampling relative to species. These are several major papers estimating loss or ecological impact from fifteen commonly-discussed extinction events. Different methods used by these papers are described in the following section. The &quot;Big Five&quot; mass extinctions are bolded.

== The study of major extinction events ==

=== Breakthrough studies in the 1980s–1990s ===

For much of the 20th century, the study of mass extinctions was hampered by insufficient data. Mass extinctions, though acknowledged, were considered mysterious exceptions to the prevailing gradualistic view of prehistory, where slow evolutionary trends define faunal changes. The first breakthrough was published in 1980 by a team led by Luis Alvarez, who discovered trace metal evidence for an asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous period. The Alvarez hypothesis for the end-Cretaceous extinction gave mass extinctions, and catastrophic explanations, newfound popular and scientific attention.

Another landmark study came in 1982, when a paper written by David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski was published in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. This paper, originating from a compendium of extinct marine animal families developed by Sepkoski, identified five peaks of marine family extinctions which stand out among a backdrop of decreasing extinction rates through time. Four of these peaks were statistically significant: the Ashgillian (end-Ordovician), Late Permian, Norian (end-Triassic), and Maastrichtian (end-Cretaceous). The remaining peak was a broad interval of high extinction smeared over the later half of the Devonian, with its apex in the Frasnian stage.

Through the 1980s, Raup and Sepkoski continued to elaborate and build upon their extinction and origination data, defining a high-resolution biodiversity curve (the &quot;Sepkoski curve&quot;) and successive evolutionary faunas with their own patterns of diversification and extinction. Though these interpretations formed a strong basis for subsequent studies of mass extinctions, Raup and Sepkoski also proposed a more controversial idea in 1984: a 26-million-year periodic pattern to mass extinctions. Two teams of astronomers linked this to a hypothetical brown dwarf in the distant reaches of the solar system, inventing the &quot;Nemesis hypothesis&quot; which has been strongly disputed by other astronomers.

Around the same time, Sepkoski began to devise a compendium of marine animal genera, which would allow researchers to explore extinction at a finer taxonomic resolution. He began to publish preliminary results of this in-progress study as early as 1986, in a paper which identified 29 extinction intervals of note. By 1992, he also updated his 1982 family compendium, finding minimal changes to the diversity curve despite a decade of new data. In 1996, Sepkoski published another paper which tracked marine genera extinction (in terms of net diversity loss) by stage, similar to his previous work on family extinctions. The paper filtered its sample in three ways: all genera (the entire unfiltered sample size), multiple-interval genera (only those found in more than one stage), and &quot;well-preserved&quot; genera (excluding those from groups with poor or understudied fossil records). Diversity trends in marine animal families were also revised based on his 1992 update.

Revived interest in mass extinctions led many other authors to re-evaluate geological events in the context of their effects on life. A 1995 paper by Michael Benton tracked extinction and origination rates among both marine and continental (freshwater &amp; terrestrial) families, identifying 22 extinction intervals and no periodic pattern. Overview books by O.H. Walliser (1996) and A. Hallam and P.B. Wignall (1997) summarized the new extinction research of the previous two decades. One chapter in the former source lists over 60 geological events which could conceivably be considered global extinctions of varying sizes. These texts, and other widely circulated publications in the 1990s, helped to establish the popular image of mass extinctions as a &quot;big five&quot; alongside many smaller extinctions through prehistory.

=== New data on genera: Sepkoski&#x27;s compendium ===

Though Sepkoski died in 1999, his marine genera compendium was formally published in 2002. This prompted a new wave of studies into the dynamics of mass extinctions. These papers utilized the compendium to track origination rates (the rate that new species appear or speciate) parallel to extinction rates in the context of geological stages or substages. A review and re-analysis of Sepkoski&#x27;s data by Bambach (2006) identified 18 distinct mass extinction intervals, including 4 large extinctions in the Cambrian. These fit Sepkoski&#x27;s definition of extinction, as short substages with large diversity loss and overall high extinction rates relative to their surroundings.

Bambach et al. (2004) considered each of the &quot;Big Five&quot; extinction intervals to have a different pattern in the relationship between origination and extinction trends. Moreover, background extinction rates were broadly variable and could be separated into more severe and less severe time intervals. Background extinctions were least severe relative to the origination rate in the middle Ordovician-early Silurian, late Carboniferous-Permian, and Jurassic-recent. This argues that the Late Ordovician, end-Permian, and end-Cretaceous extinctions were statistically significant outliers in biodiversity trends, while the Late Devonian and end-Triassic extinctions occurred in time periods which were already stressed by relatively high extinction and low origination.

Computer models run by Foote (2005) determined that abrupt pulses of extinction fit the pattern of prehistoric biodiversity much better than a gradual and continuous background extinction rate with smooth peaks and troughs. This strongly supports the utility of rapid, frequent mass extinctions as a major driver of diversity changes. Pulsed origination events are also supported, though to a lesser degree which is largely dependent on pulsed extinctions.

Similarly, Stanley (2007) used extinction and origination data to investigate turnover rates and extinction responses among different evolutionary faunas and taxonomic groups. In contrast to previous authors, his diversity simulations show support for an overall exponential rate of biodiversity growth through the entire Phanerozoic.

=== Tackling biases in the fossil record ===

As data continued to accumulate, some authors began to re-evaluate Sepkoski&#x27;s sample using methods meant to account for sampling biases. As early as 1982, a paper by Phillip W. Signor and Jere H. Lipps noted that the true sharpness of extinctions was diluted by the incompleteness of the fossil record. This phenomenon, later called the Signor-Lipps effect, notes that a species&#x27; true extinction must occur after its last fossil, and that origination must occur before its first fossil. Thus, species which appear to die out just prior to an abrupt extinction event may instead be a victim of the event, despite an apparent gradual decline looking at the fossil record alone. A model by Foote (2007) found that many geological stages had artificially inflated extinction rates due to Signor-Lipps &quot;backsmearing&quot; from later stages with extinction events.

Other biases include the difficulty in assessing taxa with high turnover rates or restricted occurrences, which cannot be directly assessed due to a lack of fine-scale temporal resolution. Many paleontologists opt to assess diversity trends by randomized sampling and rarefaction of fossil abundances rather than raw temporal range data, in order to account for all of these biases. But that solution is influenced by biases related to sample size. One major bias in particular is the &quot;Pull of the recent&quot;, the fact that the fossil record (and thus known diversity) generally improves closer to the modern day. This means that biodiversity and abundance for older geological periods may be underestimated from raw data alone.

Alroy (2010) attempted to circumvent sample size-related biases in diversity estimates using a method he called &quot;shareholder quorum subsampling&quot; (SQS). In this method, fossils are sampled from a &quot;collection&quot; (such as a time interval) to assess the relative diversity of that collection. Every time a new species (or other taxon) enters the sample, it brings over all other fossils belonging to that species in the collection (its &quot;share&quot; of the collection). For example, a skewed collection with half its fossils from one species will immediately reach a sample share of 50% if that species is the first to be sampled. This continues, adding up the sample shares until a &quot;coverage&quot; or &quot;quorum&quot; is reached, referring to a pre-set desired sum of share percentages. At that point, the number of species in the sample are counted. A collection with more species is expected to reach a sample quorum with more species, thus accurately comparing the relative diversity change between two collections without relying on the biases inherent to sample size.

Alroy also elaborated on three-timer algorithms, which are meant to counteract biases in estimates of extinction and origination rates. A given taxon is a &quot;three-timer&quot; if it can be found before, after, and within a given time interval, and a &quot;two-timer&quot; if it overlaps with a time interval on one side. Counting &quot;three-timers&quot; and &quot;two-timers&quot; on either end of a time interval, and sampling time intervals in sequence, can together be combined into equations to predict extinction and origination with less bias. In subsequent papers, Alroy continued to refine his equations to improve lingering issues with precision and unusual samples.

McGhee et al. (2013), a paper which primarily focused on ecological effects of mass extinctions, also published new estimates of extinction severity based on Alroy&#x27;s methods. Many extinctions were significantly more impactful under these new estimates, though some were less prominent.

Stanley (2016) was another paper which attempted to remove two common errors in previous estimates of extinction severity. The first error was the unjustified removal of &quot;singletons&quot;, genera unique to only a single time slice. Their removal would mask the influence of groups with high turnover rates or lineages cut short early in their diversification. The second error was the difficulty in distinguishing background extinctions from brief mass extinction events within the same short time interval. To circumvent this issue, background rates of diversity change (extinction/origination) were estimated for stages or substages without mass extinctions, and then assumed to apply to subsequent stages with mass extinctions. For example, the Santonian and Campanian stages were each used to estimate diversity changes in the Maastrichtian prior to the K-Pg mass extinction. Subtracting background extinctions from extinction tallies had the effect of reducing the estimated severity of the six sampled mass extinction events. This effect was stronger for mass extinctions which occurred in periods with high rates of background extinction, like the Devonian.

==Uncertainty in the Proterozoic and earlier eons==
Because most diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial, and thus difficult to measure via fossils, extinction events placed on-record are those that affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life. For this reason, well-documented extinction events are confined to the Phanerozoic eon – with the sole exception of the Oxygen Catastrophe in the Proterozoic – since before the Phanerozoic, all living organisms were either microbial, or if multicellular then soft-bodied. Perhaps due to the absence of a robust microbial fossil record, mass extinctions might only &quot;seem&quot; to be mainly a Phanerozoic phenomenon, with merely the &quot;observable&quot; extinction rates appearing low before large complex organisms with hard body parts arose.

Extinction occurs at an uneven rate. Based on the fossil record, the background rate of extinctions on Earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine animals every million years.

The Oxygen Catastrophe, which occurred around 2.45 billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic, is plausible as the first-ever major extinction event. It was perhaps also the worst-ever, in some sense, but with the Earth&#x27;s ecology just before that time so poorly understood, and the concept of prokaryote genera so different from genera of complex life, that it would be difficult to meaningfully compare it to any of the &quot;Big Five&quot; even if Paleoproterozoic life were better known.

Since the Cambrian explosion, five further major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate. The most recent and best-known, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately  Ma (million years ago), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time. In addition to the five major Phanerozoic mass extinctions, there are numerous lesser ones, and the ongoing mass extinction caused by human activity is sometimes called the sixth mass extinction.

==Evolutionary importance==

Mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on Earth. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the newly dominant group is &quot;superior&quot; to the old but usually because an extinction event eliminates the old, dominant group and makes way for the new one, a process known as adaptive radiation.

For example, mammaliaformes (&quot;almost mammals&quot;) and then mammals existed throughout the reign of the dinosaurs, but could not compete in the large terrestrial vertebrate niches that dinosaurs monopolized. The end-Cretaceous mass extinction removed the non-avian dinosaurs and made it possible for mammals to expand into the large terrestrial vertebrate niches. The dinosaurs themselves had been beneficiaries of a previous mass extinction, the end-Triassic, which eliminated most of their chief rivals, the crurotarsans. Similarly, within Synapsida, the replacement of taxa that originated in the earliest, Pennsylvanian and Cisuralian evolutionary radiation (often still called &quot;pelycosaurs&quot;, though this is a paraphyletic group) by therapsids occurred around the Kungurian/Roadian transition, which is often called Olson&#x27;s extinction (which may be a slow decline over 20 Ma rather than a dramatic, brief event).

Another point of view put forward in the Escalation hypothesis predicts that species in ecological niches with more organism-to-organism conflict will be less likely to survive extinctions. This is because the very traits that keep a species numerous and viable under fairly static conditions become a burden once population levels fall among competing organisms during the dynamics of an extinction event.

Furthermore, many groups that survive mass extinctions do not recover in numbers or diversity, and many of these go into long-term decline, and these are often referred to as &quot;Dead Clades Walking&quot;.
However, clades that survive for a considerable period of time after a mass extinction, and which were reduced to only a few species, are likely to have experienced a rebound effect called the &quot;push of the past&quot;.

Darwin was firmly of the opinion that biotic interactions, such as competition for food and space – the &#x27;struggle for existence&#x27; – were of considerably greater importance in promoting evolution and extinction than changes in the physical environment. He expressed this in &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;:
: &quot;Species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes ... and the most import of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered ... physical conditions, namely the mutual relation of organism to organism – the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or extermination of others&quot;.

==Patterns in frequency==
Various authors have suggested that extinction events occurred periodically, every 26 to 30 million years, or that diversity fluctuates episodically about every 62 million years. Various ideas, mostly regarding astronomical influences, attempt to explain the supposed pattern, including the presence of a hypothetical companion star to the Sun, oscillations in the galactic plane, or passage through the Milky Way&#x27;s spiral arms. However, other authors have concluded that the data on marine mass extinctions do not fit with the idea that mass extinctions are periodic, or that ecosystems gradually build up to a point at which a mass extinction is inevitable. Many of the proposed correlations have been argued to be spurious or lacking statistical significance. Others have argued that there is strong evidence supporting periodicity in a variety of records, and additional evidence in the form of coincident periodic variation in nonbiological geochemical variables such as Strontium isotopes, flood basalts, anoxic events, orogenies, and evaporite deposition. One explanation for this proposed cycle is carbon storage and release by oceanic crust, which exchanges carbon between the atmosphere and mantle.

Mass extinctions are thought to result when a long-term stress is compounded by a short-term shock. Over the course of the Phanerozoic, individual taxa appear to have become less likely to suffer extinction, which may reflect more robust food webs, as well as fewer extinction-prone species, and other factors such as continental distribution. However, even after accounting for sampling bias, there does appear to be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the Phanerozoic. This may represent the fact that groups with higher turnover rates are more likely to become extinct by chance; or it may be an artefact of taxonomy: families tend to become more speciose, therefore less prone to extinction, over time; and larger taxonomic groups (by definition) appear earlier in geological time.

It has also been suggested that the oceans have gradually become more hospitable to life over the last 500 million years, and thus less vulnerable to mass extinctions,
but susceptibility to extinction at a taxonomic level does not appear to make mass extinctions more or less probable.

==Causes==
There is still debate about the causes of all mass extinctions. In general, large extinctions may result when a biosphere under long-term stress undergoes a short-term shock. An underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and origination rates to diversity. High diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate; low diversity to a persistent increase in origination rate. These presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations (asteroid impacts, etc.) to produce the global effects observed.

===Identifying causes of specific mass extinctions===
A good theory for a particular mass extinction should: 
* explain all of the losses, not just focus on a few groups (such as dinosaurs); 
* explain why particular groups of organisms died out and why others survived;
* provide mechanisms that are strong enough to cause a mass extinction but not a total extinction; 
* be based on events or processes that can be shown to have happened, not just inferred from the extinction.

It may be necessary to consider combinations of causes. For example, the marine aspect of the end-Cretaceous extinction appears to have been caused by several processes that partially overlapped in time and may have had different levels of significance in different parts of the world.

Arens and West (2006) proposed a &quot;press / pulse&quot; model in which mass extinctions generally require two types of cause: long-term pressure on the eco-system (&quot;press&quot;) and a sudden catastrophe (&quot;pulse&quot;) towards the end of the period of pressure.
Their statistical analysis of marine extinction rates throughout the Phanerozoic suggested that neither long-term pressure alone nor a catastrophe alone was sufficient to cause a significant increase in the extinction rate.

===Most widely supported explanations===
MacLeod (2001) summarized the relationship between mass extinctions and events that are most often cited as causes of mass extinctions, using data from Courtillot, Jaeger &amp; Yang &quot;et al.&quot; (1996), Hallam (1992) and Grieve &amp; Pesonen (1992):
* Flood basalt events (giant volcanic eruptions): 11 occurrences, all associated with significant extinctions. But Wignall (2001) concluded that only five of the major extinctions coincided with flood basalt eruptions and that the main phase of extinctions started before the eruptions.
* Sea-level falls: 12, of which seven were associated with significant extinctions.
* Asteroid impacts: one large impact is associated with a mass extinction, that is, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event; there have been many smaller impacts but they are not associated with significant extinctions, or cannot be dated precisely enough. The impact that created the Siljan Ring either was just before the Late Devonian Extinction or coincided with it.

The most commonly suggested causes of mass extinctions are listed below.

====Flood basalt events====

The formation of large igneous provinces by flood basalt events could have:
* produced dust and particulate aerosols, which inhibited photosynthesis and thus caused food chains to collapse both on land and at sea
* emitted sulfur oxides that were precipitated as acid rain and poisoned many organisms, contributing further to the collapse of food chains
* emitted carbon dioxide and thus possibly causing sustained global warming once the dust and particulate aerosols dissipated.
Flood basalt events occur as pulses of activity punctuated by dormant periods. As a result, they are likely to cause the climate to oscillate between cooling and warming, but with an overall trend towards warming as the carbon dioxide they emit can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

Flood basalt events have been implicated as the cause of many major extinction events. It is speculated that massive volcanism caused or contributed to the Kellwasser Event, the End-Guadalupian Extinction Event, the End-Permian Extinction Event, the Smithian-Spathian Extinction, the Triassic-Jurassic Extinction Event, the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, the Cenomanian-Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event, the Cretaceous-Palaeogene Extinction Event, and the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. The correlation between gigantic volcanic events expressed in the large igneous provinces and mass extinctions was shown for the last 260 million years. Recently such possible correlation was extended across the whole Phanerozoic Eon.

====Sea-level fall====
These are often clearly marked by worldwide sequences of contemporaneous sediments that show all or part of a transition from sea-bed to tidal zone to beach to dry land – and where there is no evidence that the rocks in the relevant areas were raised by geological processes such as orogeny. Sea-level falls could reduce the continental shelf area (the most productive part of the oceans) sufficiently to cause a marine mass extinction, and could disrupt weather patterns enough to cause extinctions on land. But sea-level falls are very probably the result of other events, such as sustained global cooling or the sinking of the mid-ocean ridges.

Sea-level falls are associated with most of the mass extinctions, including all of the &quot;Big Five&quot;—End-Ordovician, Late Devonian, End-Permian, End-Triassic, and End-Cretaceous, along with the more recently recognised Capitanian mass extinction of comparable severity to the Big Five.

A 2008 study, published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, established a relationship between the speed of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and sediment. The study suggests changes in ocean environments related to sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction, and generally determine the composition of life in the oceans.

====Extraterrestrial threats====

===== Impact events =====

The impact of a sufficiently large asteroid or comet could have caused food chains to collapse both on land and at sea by producing dust and particulate aerosols and thus inhibiting photosynthesis. Impacts on sulfur-rich rocks could have emitted sulfur oxides precipitating as poisonous acid rain, contributing further to the collapse of food chains. Such impacts could also have caused megatsunamis and/or global forest fires.

Most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth about 66 Ma, but there is lingering dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Nonetheless, in October 2019, researchers reported that the Cretaceous Chicxulub asteroid impact that resulted in the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs 66 Ma, also rapidly acidified the oceans, producing ecological collapse and long-lasting effects on the climate, and was a key reason for end-Cretaceous mass extinction.

The Permian-Triassic extinction event has also been hypothesised to have been caused by an asteroid impact that formed the Araguainha crater due to the estimated date of the crater&#x27;s formation overlapping with the end-Permian extinction event. However, this hypothesis has been widely challenged, with the impact hypothesis being rejected by most researchers.

According to the Shiva hypothesis, the Earth is subject to increased asteroid impacts about once every 27 million years because of the Sun&#x27;s passage through the plane of the Milky Way galaxy, thus causing extinction events at 27 million year intervals. Some evidence for this hypothesis has emerged in both marine and non-marine contexts. Alternatively, the Sun&#x27;s passage through the higher density spiral arms of the galaxy could coincide with mass extinction on Earth, perhaps due to increased impact events. However, a reanalysis of the effects of the Sun&#x27;s transit through the spiral structure based on maps of the spiral structure of the Milky Way in CO molecular line emission has failed to find a correlation.

===== A nearby nova, supernova or gamma ray burst =====
A nearby gamma-ray burst (less than 6000 light-years away) would be powerful enough to destroy the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer, leaving organisms vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Gamma ray bursts are fairly rare, occurring only a few times in a given galaxy per million years.
It has been suggested that a gamma ray burst caused the End-Ordovician extinction, while a supernova has been proposed as the cause of the Hangenberg event. A supernova within 25 light-years would strip Earth of its atmosphere. Today there is in the Solar System&#x27;s neighbourhood no critical star capable to produce a supernova dangerous to life on Earth.

====Global cooling====
Sustained and significant global cooling could kill many polar and temperate species and force others to migrate towards the equator; reduce the area available for tropical species; often make the Earth&#x27;s climate more arid on average, mainly by locking up more of the planet&#x27;s water in ice and snow. The glaciation cycles of the current ice age are believed to have had only a very mild impact on biodiversity, so the mere existence of a significant cooling is not sufficient on its own to explain a mass extinction.

It has been suggested that global cooling caused or contributed to the End-Ordovician, Permian–Triassic, Late Devonian extinctions, and possibly others. Sustained global cooling is distinguished from the temporary climatic effects of flood basalt events or impacts.

====Global warming====

This would have the opposite effects: expand the area available for tropical species; kill temperate species or force them to migrate towards the poles; possibly cause severe extinctions of polar species; often make the Earth&#x27;s climate wetter on average, mainly by melting ice and snow and thus increasing the volume of the water cycle. It might also cause anoxic events in the oceans (see below).

Global warming as a cause of mass extinction is supported by several recent studies.

The most dramatic example of sustained warming is the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions. It has also been suggested to have caused the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event, during which 20% of all marine families became extinct. Furthermore, the Permian–Triassic extinction event has been suggested to have been caused by warming.

===== Clathrate gun hypothesis =====

Clathrates are composites in which a lattice of one substance forms a cage around another. Methane clathrates (in which water molecules are the cage) form on continental shelves. These clathrates are likely to break up rapidly and release the methane if the temperature rises quickly or the pressure on them drops quickly – for example in response to sudden global warming or a sudden drop in sea level or even earthquakes. Methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, so a methane eruption (&quot;clathrate gun&quot;) could cause rapid global warming or make it much more severe if the eruption was itself caused by global warming.

The most likely signature of such a methane eruption would be a sudden decrease in the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in sediments, since methane clathrates are low in carbon-13; but the change would have to be very large, as other events can also reduce the percentage of carbon-13.

It has been suggested that &quot;clathrate gun&quot; methane eruptions were involved in the end-Permian extinction (&quot;the Great Dying&quot;) and in the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions.

====Anoxic events====
Anoxic events are situations in which the middle and even the upper layers of the ocean become deficient or totally lacking in oxygen. Their causes are complex and controversial, but all known instances are associated with severe and sustained global warming, mostly caused by sustained massive volcanism.

It has been suggested that anoxic events caused or contributed to the Ordovician–Silurian, late Devonian, Capitanian, Permian–Triassic, and Triassic–Jurassic extinctions, as well as a number of lesser extinctions (such as the Ireviken, Lundgreni, Mulde, Lau, Smithian-Spathian, Toarcian, and Cenomanian–Turonian events). On the other hand, there are widespread black shale beds from the mid-Cretaceous that indicate anoxic events but are not associated with mass extinctions.

The bio-availability of essential trace elements (in particular selenium) to potentially lethal lows has been shown to coincide with, and likely have contributed to, at least three mass extinction events in the oceans, that is, at the end of the Ordovician, during the Middle and Late Devonian, and at the end of the Triassic. During periods of low oxygen concentrations very soluble selenate (Se6+) is converted into much less soluble selenide (Se2-), elemental Se and organo-selenium complexes. Bio-availability of selenium during these extinction events dropped to about 1% of the current oceanic concentration, a level that has been proven lethal to many extant organisms.

British oceanologist and atmospheric scientist, Andrew Watson, explained that, while the Holocene epoch exhibits many processes reminiscent of those that have contributed to past anoxic events, full-scale ocean anoxia would take &quot;thousands of years to develop&quot;.

====Hydrogen sulfide emissions from the seas====
Kump, Pavlov and Arthur (2005) have proposed that during the Permian–Triassic extinction event the warming also upset the oceanic balance between photosynthesising plankton and deep-water sulfate-reducing bacteria, causing massive emissions of hydrogen sulfide, which poisoned life on both land and sea and severely weakened the ozone layer, exposing much of the life that still remained to fatal levels of UV radiation.

====Oceanic overturn====
Oceanic overturn is a disruption of thermo-haline circulation that lets surface water (which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation) sink straight down, bringing anoxic deep water to the surface and therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing organisms that inhabit the surface and middle depths. It may occur either at the beginning or the end of a glaciation, although an overturn at the start of a glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of anoxic water.

Unlike other oceanic catastrophes such as regressions (sea-level falls) and anoxic events, overturns do not leave easily identified &quot;signatures&quot; in rocks and are theoretical consequences of researchers&#x27; conclusions about other climatic and marine events.

It has been suggested that oceanic overturn caused or contributed to the late Devonian and Permian–Triassic extinctions.

====Geomagnetic reversal====
One theory is that periods of increased geomagnetic reversals will weaken Earth&#x27;s magnetic field long enough to expose the atmosphere to the solar winds, causing oxygen ions to escape the atmosphere in a rate increased by 3–4 orders, resulting in a disastrous decrease in oxygen.

====Plate tectonics====
Movement of the continents into some configurations can cause or contribute to extinctions in several ways: by initiating or ending ice ages; by changing ocean and wind currents and thus altering climate; by opening seaways or land bridges that expose previously isolated species to competition for which they are poorly adapted (for example, the extinction of most of South America&#x27;s native ungulates and all of its large metatherians after the creation of a land bridge between North and South America). Occasionally continental drift creates a super-continent that includes the vast majority of Earth&#x27;s land area, which in addition to the effects listed above is likely to reduce the total area of continental shelf (the most species-rich part of the ocean) and produce a vast, arid continental interior that may have extreme seasonal variations.

Another theory is that the creation of the super-continent Pangaea contributed to the End-Permian mass extinction. Pangaea was almost fully formed at the transition from mid-Permian to late-Permian, and the &quot;Marine genus diversity&quot; diagram at the top of this article shows a level of extinction starting at that time, which might have qualified for inclusion in the &quot;Big Five&quot; if it were not overshadowed by the &quot;Great Dying&quot; at the end of the Permian.

====Human activities====

Scientists have been concerned that human activities could cause more plants and animals to become extinct than any point in the past. Along with human-made changes in climate (see above), some of these extinctions could be caused by overhunting, overfishing, invasive species, or habitat loss. A study published in May 2017 in &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; argued that a &quot;biological annihilation&quot; akin to a sixth mass extinction event is underway as a result of anthropogenic causes, such as over-population and over-consumption. The study suggested that as much as 50% of the number of animal individuals that once lived on Earth were already extinct, threatening the basis for human existence too.

====Other hypotheses====

Many other hypotheses have been proposed, such as the spread of a new disease, or simple out-competition following an especially successful biological innovation. But all have been rejected, usually for one of the following reasons: they require events or processes for which there is no evidence; they assume mechanisms that are contrary to the available evidence; they are based on other theories that have been rejected or superseded.

====Future biosphere extinction/sterilization====

The eventual warming and expanding of the Sun, combined with the eventual decline of atmospheric carbon dioxide, could actually cause an even greater mass extinction, having the potential to wipe out even microbes (in other words, the Earth would be completely sterilized): rising global temperatures caused by the expanding Sun would gradually increase the rate of weathering, which would in turn remove more and more CO2 from the atmosphere. When CO2 levels get too low (perhaps at 50 ppm), most plant life will die out, although simpler plants like grasses and mosses can survive much longer, until levels drop to 10 ppm.

With all photosynthetic organisms gone, atmospheric oxygen can no longer be replenished, and it is eventually removed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, perhaps from volcanic eruptions. Eventually the loss of oxygen will cause all remaining aerobic life to die out via asphyxiation, leaving behind only simple anaerobic prokaryotes. When the Sun becomes 10% brighter in about a billion years, Earth will suffer a moist greenhouse effect resulting in its oceans boiling away, while the Earth&#x27;s liquid outer core cools due to the inner core&#x27;s expansion and causes the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to shut down. In the absence of a magnetic field, charged particles from the Sun will deplete the atmosphere and further increase the Earth&#x27;s temperature to an average of around 420 K (147 °C, 296 °F) in 2.8 billion years, causing the last remaining life on Earth to die out. This is the most extreme instance of a climate-caused extinction event. Since this will only happen late in the Sun&#x27;s life, it would represent the final mass extinction in Earth&#x27;s history (albeit a very long extinction event).

==Effects and recovery==
The effects of mass extinction events varied widely. After a major extinction event, usually only weedy species survive due to their ability to live in diverse habitats. Later, species diversify and occupy empty niches. Generally, it takes millions of years for biodiversity to recover after extinction events. In the most severe mass extinctions it may take 15 to 30 million years.

The worst Phanerozoic event, the Permian–Triassic extinction, devastated life on Earth, killing over 90% of species. Life seemed to recover quickly after the P-T extinction, but this was mostly in the form of disaster taxa, such as the hardy &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot;. The most recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems, with high biodiversity, complex food webs and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. It is thought that this long recovery was due to successive waves of extinction that inhibited recovery, as well as prolonged environmental stress that continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, four to six million years after the extinction;
and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30 million years after the P-T extinction, that is, in the late Triassic. Subsequent to the P-T extinction, there was an increase in provincialization, with species occupying smaller ranges – perhaps removing incumbents from niches and setting the stage for an eventual rediversification.

The effects of mass extinctions on plants are somewhat harder to quantify, given the biases inherent in the plant fossil record. Some mass extinctions (such as the end-Permian) were equally catastrophic for plants, whereas others, such as the end-Devonian, did not affect the flora.

==In media==
The term extinction level event (ELE) has been used in media. The 1998 film Deep Impact describes a potential comet strike of earth as an E.L.E.

<text>Edward Elmer Smith (May 2, 1890 – August 31, 1965) was an American food engineer (specializing in doughnut and pastry mixes) and science-fiction author, best known for the &quot;Lensman&quot; and &quot;Skylark&quot; series. He is sometimes called the father of space opera.

==Biography==

===Family and education===
Edward Elmer Smith was born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, on May 2, 1890, to Fred Jay Smith and Caroline Mills Smith, both staunch Presbyterians of British ancestry. His mother was a teacher born in Michigan in February 1855; his father was a sailor, born in Maine in January 1855 to an English father. They moved to Spokane, Washington, the winter after Edward Elmer was born, where Mr. Smith was working as a contractor in 1900. In 1902, the family moved to Seneaquoteen, near the Pend Oreille River, in Kootenai County, Idaho. He had four siblings, Rachel M. born September 1882, Daniel M. born January 1884, Mary Elizabeth born February 1886 (all of whom were born in Michigan), and Walter E. born July 1891 in Washington. In 1910, Fred and Caroline Smith and their son Walter were living in the Markham Precinct of Bonner County, Idaho; Fred is listed in census records as a farmer.

Smith worked mainly as a manual laborer until he injured his wrist while fleeing from a fire at the age of 19. He attended the University of Idaho. (Many years later he would be installed in the 1984 Class of the University of Idaho Alumni Hall of Fame.) He entered its prep school in 1907, and graduated with two degrees in chemical engineering in 1914. He was president of the Chemistry Club, the Chess Club, and the Mandolin and Guitar Club, and captain of the Drill and Rifle Team; he also sang the bass lead in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. His undergraduate thesis was &quot;Some Clays of Idaho&quot;, co-written with classmate Chester Fowler Smith, who died in California of tuberculosis the following year, after taking a teaching fellowship at Berkeley. Whether the two were related is not known.

On October 5, 1915, in Boise, Idaho he married Jeanne Craig MacDougall, the sister of his college roommate, Allen Scott (Scotty) MacDougall. (Her sister was named Clarissa MacLean MacDougall; the heroine of the &quot;Lensman&quot; novels would later be named Clarrissa MacDougall.) Jeanne MacDougall was born in Glasgow, Scotland; her parents were Donald Scott MacDougall, a violinist, and Jessica Craig MacLean. Her father had moved to Boise when the children were young, and later sent for his family; he died while they were en route in 1905. Jeanne&#x27;s mother, who remarried businessman and retired politician John F. Kessler in 1914 worked at, and later owned, a boarding house on Ridenbaugh Street.

The Smiths had three children:
* Roderick N., born June 3, 1918, in the District of Columbia, was employed as a design engineer at Lockheed Aircraft.
* Verna Jean (later Verna Smith Trestrail), born August 25, 1920, in Michigan, was his literary executor until her death in 1994. (Her son Kim Trestrail is now the executor.) Robert A. Heinlein in part dedicated his 1982 novel &quot;Friday&quot; to Verna.
* Clarissa M. (later Clarissa Wilcox), was born December 13, 1921, in Michigan.

===Early chemical career and the beginning of &quot;Skylark&quot;===

After college, Smith was a junior chemist for the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., developing standards for butter and for oysters, while studying food chemistry at George Washington University. During World War I, he &quot;wanted to fly a Jenny biplane, but chemists were too scarce. (Or were Jennies too valuable?)&quot; He ended up being sent to the Commission for Relief in Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover. His draft card, partly illegible, seems to show that Smith requested exemption from military service, based on his wife&#x27;s dependence and on his contribution to the war effort as a civilian chemist.

One evening in 1915, the Smiths were visiting a former classmate from the University of Idaho, Dr. Carl Garby (1890–1928) who had also moved to Washington, D.C. He lived nearby in the Seaton Place Apartments with his wife, Lee Hawkins Garby. A long discussion about journeys into outer space ensued, and it was suggested that Smith should write down his ideas and speculations as a story about interstellar travel. Although he was interested, Smith believed after some thought that some romantic elements would be required and he was uncomfortable with that.

Lee Garby offered to take care of the love interest and the romantic dialogue, and Smith decided to give it a try. The sources of inspirations for the main characters in the novel were themselves; the &quot;Seatons&quot; and &quot;Cranes&quot; were based on the Smiths and Garbys, respectively. About one third of &quot;The Skylark of Space&quot; was completed by the end of 1916, when Smith and Garby gradually abandoned work on it.

Smith earned his master&#x27;s degree in chemistry from the George Washington University in 1917, studying under Dr. Charles E. Munroe, whom Smith called &quot;probably the greatest high-explosives man yet to live&quot;. Smith completed his PhD in chemical engineering in 1918, with a food engineering focus. His dissertation, &quot;The effect of bleaching with oxides of nitrogen upon the baking quality and commercial value of wheat flour&quot;, was published in 1919.


===Writing &quot;Skylark&quot;===
In 1919, Smith was hired as chief chemist for F. W. Stock &amp; Sons of Hillsdale, Michigan, at one time the largest family-owned mill east of the Mississippi, working on doughnut mixes.

One evening late in 1919, after moving to Michigan, Smith was looking after his child (presumably Roderick) while his wife attended a movie. He resumed work on &quot;The Skylark of Space&quot;, finishing it in the spring of 1920. He submitted it to many book publishers and magazines, spending more in postage than he would eventually receive for its publication. Bob Davis, editor of &quot;Argosy&quot;, sent an encouraging rejection letter in 1922, saying that he liked the novel personally, but that it was too far out for his readers. Finally, upon seeing the April 1927 issue of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, he submitted it to that magazine. It was accepted, initially for $75, later raised to $125. It was published as a three-part serial in the August to October 1928 issues and it was such a success that associate editor Sloane requested a sequel before the second installment had been published. (According to Warner, but no other source, Smith began work on the sequel, &quot;Skylark Three&quot;, before the first book was accepted.)

Garby, whose husband died in 1928, was not interested in further collaboration, so Smith began work on &quot;Skylark Three&quot; alone. It was published as another three-part serial, in the August to October 1930 issues of &quot;Amazing&quot;, introduced as the cover story for August. This was as far as he had planned to take the &quot;Skylark&quot; series. It was praised in &quot;Amazing&quot;″s letter column, and he was paid ¾¢ per word, surpassing &quot;Amazing&quot;″s previous record of half a cent.

===Names Used for Publications===
The original magazine stories mostly have his name as &quot;Edward E. Smith, Ph.D.&quot;. But more recent editions usually give his name as either &quot;E. E. Doc Smith&quot; or &quot;E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith&quot;.

===The early 1930s: between &quot;Skylark&quot; and &quot;Lensman&quot;===
Smith then began work on what he intended as a new series, starting with &quot;Spacehounds of IPC,&quot; which he finished in the autumn of 1930. In this novel, he took pains to avoid the scientific impossibilities which had bothered some readers of the &quot;Skylark&quot; novels. Even in 1938, after he had written &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot;, Smith considered it his finest work. He later said of it, &quot;This was really scientific fiction; not, like the Skylarks, pseudo-science&quot;. Even at the end of his career, he considered it his only work of true science fiction. It was published in the July through September 1931 issues of &quot;Amazing,&quot; with Sloane making unauthorized changes. Fan letters in the magazine complained about the novel&#x27;s containment within the Solar System, and Sloane sided with the readers. So when Harry Bates, editor of &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, offered Smith 2¢/word—payable on publication—for his next story, he agreed. This meant that it could not be a sequel to &quot;Spacehounds.&quot;

This book would be &quot;Triplanetary&quot;, &quot;in which scientific detail would not be bothered about, and in which his imagination would run riot.&quot; Indeed, characters within the story point out its psychological and scientific implausibilities, and sometimes even seem to suggest self-parody. At other times, they are conspicuously silent about obvious implausibilities. The January 1933 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot; announced that &quot;Triplanetary&quot; would appear in the March issue, and that issue&#x27;s cover illustrated a scene from the story, but &quot;Astounding&quot;″s financial difficulties prevented the story from appearing. Smith then submitted the manuscript to &quot;Wonder Stories&quot;, whose new editor, 17-year-old Charles D. Hornig, rejected it, later boasting about the rejection in a fanzine. He finally submitted it to &quot;Amazing&quot;, which published it beginning in January 1934, but for only half a cent a word. Shortly after it was accepted, F. Orlin Tremaine, the new editor of the revived &quot;Astounding&quot;, offered one cent a word for &quot;Triplanetary&quot;. When he learned that he was too late, he suggested a third &quot;Skylark&quot; novel instead.

In the winter of 1933–34, Smith worked on &quot;The Skylark of Valeron&quot;, but he felt that the story was getting out of control. He sent his first draft to Tremaine, with a distraught note asking for suggestions. Tremaine accepted the rough draft for $850, and announced it in the June 1934 issue, with a full-page editorial and a three-quarter-page advertisement. The novel was published in the August 1934 through February 1935 issues. &quot;Astounding&quot;&#x27;s circulation rose by 10,000 for the first issue, and its two main competitors, &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Wonder Stories&quot;, fell into financial difficulties, both skipping issues within a year.

===The &quot;Lensman&quot; series===

In January 1936, a time period where he was already an established science-fiction writer, he took a job for salary plus profit-sharing, as production manager at Dawn Donut Co. of Jackson, Michigan. This initially entailed almost a year&#x27;s worth of 18-hour days and seven-day workweeks. Individuals who knew Smith confirmed that he had a role in developing mixes for doughnuts and other pastries, but the contention that he developed the first process for making powdered sugar adhere to doughnuts cannot be substantiated. Smith was reportedly dislocated from his job at Dawn Donuts by prewar rationing in early 1940.

Smith had been contemplating writing a &quot;space-police novel&quot; since early 1927; once he had &quot;the Lensmen&#x27;s universe fairly well set up&quot;, he reviewed his science-fiction collection for &quot;cops-and-robbers&quot; stories. He cites Clinton Constantinescue&#x27;s &quot;War of the Universe&quot; as a negative example, and Starzl and Williamson as positive ones. Tremaine responded extremely positively to a brief description of the idea.

Once Dawn Donuts became profitable in late 1936, Smith wrote an 85-page outline for what became the four core &quot;Lensman&quot; novels. In early 1937, Tremaine committed to buying them. Segmenting the story into four novels required considerable effort to avoid dangling loose ends. Smith cited Edgar Rice Burroughs as a negative example. After the outline was complete, he wrote a more detailed outline of &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot;, plus a detailed graph of its structure, with &quot;peaks of emotional intensity and the valleys of characterization and background material.&quot; He notes, however, that he was never able to follow any of his outlines at all closely, as the &quot;characters get away from me and do exactly as they damn please.&quot; After completing the rough draft of &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot;, he wrote the concluding chapter of the last book in the series, &quot;Children of the Lens.&quot; &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot; was published in the September 1937 through February 1938 issues of &quot;Astounding&quot;. Unlike the revised book edition, it was not set in the same universe as &quot;Triplanetary&quot;.

&quot;Gray Lensman&quot;, the fourth book in the series, appeared in &quot;Astounding&quot;″s October 1939 through January 1940 issues. &quot;Gray Lensman&quot; was extremely well received, as was its cover illustration. Campbell&#x27;s editorial in the December issue suggested that the October issue was the best issue of &quot;Astounding&quot; ever, and &quot;Gray Lensman&quot; was first place in the Analytical Laboratory statistics &quot;by a lightyear&quot;, with three runners-up in a distant tie for second place. The cover was also praised by readers in &quot;Brass Tacks&quot;, and Campbell noted, &quot;We got a letter from E. E. Smith saying he and [cover artist] Hubert Rogers agreed on how Kinnison looked.&quot;

Smith was the guest of honor at Chicon I, the second World Science Fiction Convention, held in Chicago over Labor Day weekend 1940, giving a speech on the importance of science fiction fandom entitled &quot;What Does This Convention Mean?&quot; He attended the convention&#x27;s masquerade as C. L. Moore&#x27;s Northwest Smith, and met fans living near him in Michigan, who would later form the Galactic Roamers, which previewed and advised him on his future work.

After Pearl Harbor, Smith discovered he &quot;was one year over age for reinstatement&quot; into the US Army. Instead he worked on high explosives at the Kingsbury Ordnance Plant in La Port, Indiana, at first as a chemical engineer, but gradually worked his way up to chief. In late 1943 he became head of the Inspection Division, and was fired in early 1944.

Smith spent the next few years working on &quot;light farm machinery and heavy tanks for Allis-Chalmers,&quot; after which he was hired as manager of the Cereal Mix Division of J. W. Allen &amp; Co., where he worked until his professional retirement in 1957.

===Retirement and late writing===

After Smith retired, he and his wife lived in Clearwater, Florida in the fall and winter, driving the smaller of their two trailers to Seaside, Oregon, each April, often stopping at science fiction conventions on the way. (Smith did not like to fly.) In 1963, he was presented the inaugural First Fandom Hall of Fame award at the 21st World Science Fiction Convention in Washington, D.C. Some of his biography is captured in an essay by Robert A. Heinlein, which was reprinted in the collection &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; in 1980. A more detailed, although allegedly error-ridden biography is in Sam Moskowitz&#x27;s &quot;Seekers of Tomorrow.&quot;

Robert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein dedicated his 1958 novel &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; &quot;To Edward E. Smith, PhD&quot;.) Heinlein reported that E. E. Smith perhaps took his &quot;unrealistic&quot; heroes from life, citing as an example the extreme competence of the hero of &quot;Spacehounds of IPC&quot;. He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of &#x27;Kimball Kinnison&#x27; and &#x27;Clarissa MacDougal&#x27;). In Heinlein&#x27;s essay, he reports that he began to suspect Smith might be a sort of &quot;superman&quot; when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it on a back road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the roof columns to listen for chassis squeaks by bone conduction—a process apparently improvised on the spot.

In his nonseries novels written after his professional retirement, &quot;Galaxy Primes&quot;, &quot;Subspace Explorers&quot;, and &quot;Subspace Encounter&quot;, E. E. Smith explores themes of telepathy and other mental abilities collectively called &quot;psionics&quot;, and of the conflict between libertarian and socialistic/communistic influences in the colonization of other planets. &quot;Galaxy Primes&quot; was written after critics such as Groff Conklin and P. Schuyler Miller in the early &#x27;50s accused his fiction of being passé, and he made an attempt to do something more in line with the concepts about which &quot;Astounding&quot; editor John W. Campbell encouraged his writers to make stories. Despite this, it was rejected by Campbell, and it was eventually published by &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1959. His late story &quot;The Imperial Stars&quot; (1964), featuring a troupe of circus performers involved in sabotage in a galactic empire, recaptured some of the atmosphere from his earlier works and was intended as the first in a new series, with outlines of later parts rumored to still exist. In fact, the Imperial Stars characters and concepts were continued by author Stephen Goldin as the &quot;Family D&#x27;Alembert series&quot;. While the book covers indicate the series was written by Smith and Goldin together, Goldin only ever had Smith&#x27;s original novella to expand upon.

The fourth &quot;Skylark&quot; novel, &quot;Skylark DuQuesne&quot;, ran in the June to October 1965 issues of &quot;If&quot;, beginning once again as the cover story. Editor Frederik Pohl introduced it with a one-page summary of the previous stories, which were all at least 30 years old.

===Lord Tedric===

Smith published two novelettes entitled &quot;Tedric&quot; in &quot;Other Worlds Science Fiction Stories&quot; (1953) and &quot;Lord Tedric&quot; in &quot;Universe Science Fiction&quot; (1954). These were almost completely forgotten until after Smith&#x27;s death. In 1975, a compendium of Smith&#x27;s works was published, entitled &quot;The Best of E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith&quot;, containing these two short stories, excerpts from several of his major works, and another short story first published in &quot;Worlds of If&quot; in 1964 entitled &quot;The Imperial Stars&quot;.

In Smith&#x27;s original short stories, Tedric was a smith (both blacksmith and whitesmith) residing in a small town near a castle in a situation roughly equivalent to England of the 1200s. He received instruction in advanced metallurgy from a time-traveler who wanted to change the situation in his own time by modifying certain events of the past. From this instruction, he was able to build better suits of armor and help defeat the villains of the piece. Unlike Eklund&#x27;s later novels based on these short stories, the original Tedric never left his own time or planet, and fought purely local enemies of his own time period.

A few years later and 13 years after Smith&#x27;s death, Verna Smith arranged with Gordon Eklund to publish another novel of the same name about the same fictional character, introducing it as &quot;a new series conceived by E. E. &#x27;Doc&#x27; Smith&quot;. Eklund later went on to publish the other novels in the series, one or two under the pseudonym &quot;E. E. &#x27;Doc&#x27; Smith&quot; or &quot;E. E. Smith&quot;. The protagonist possesses heroic qualities similar to those of the heroes in Smith&#x27;s original novels and can communicate with an extra-dimensional race of beings known as the Scientists, whose archenemy is Fra Villion, a mysterious character described as a dark knight, skilled in whip-sword combat, and evil genius behind the creation of a planetoid-sized &quot;iron sphere&quot; armed with a weapon capable of destroying planets. As a result, Smith is believed by many to be the unacknowledged progenitor of themes that would appear in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In fact, however, these appear in the sequels written by others after Smith&#x27;s death.

==Critical opinion==

Smith&#x27;s novels are generally considered to be classic space operas, and he is sometimes called the first of the three &quot;novas&quot; of 20th-century science fiction (with Stanley G. Weinbaum and Robert A. Heinlein as the second and third novas).

Heinlein credited him for being his main influence:

I have learned from many writers—from Verne and Wells and Campbell and Sinclair Lewis, et al.—but I have learned more from you than from any of the others and perhaps more than for all the others put together...

Smith expressed a preference for inventing fictional technologies that were not strictly impossible (so far as the science of the day was aware) but highly unlikely: &quot;the more highly improbable a concept is—short of being contrary to mathematics whose fundamental operations involve no neglect of infinitesimals—the better I like it&quot; was his phrase.

&quot;Lensman&quot; was one of five finalists when the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention judged Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; the Best All-Time Series.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Smith in 2004.

==Extending the &quot;Lensman&quot; universe==

&quot;Vortex Blasters&quot; (also known as &quot;Masters of the Vortex&quot;) is set in the same universe as the &quot;Lensman&quot; novels. It is an extension to the main storyline which takes place between &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot; and &quot;Children of the Lens&quot;, and introduces a different type of psionics from that used by the Lensmen. &quot;Spacehounds of IPC&quot; is not a part of the series, despite occasional erroneous statements to the contrary. (It is listed as a novel in the series in some paperback editions of the 1970s.)

==Influence on science and the military==

Smith was widely read by scientists and engineers from the 1930s into the 1970s. Literary precursors of ideas which arguably entered the military-scientific complex include SDI (&quot;Triplanetary&quot;), stealth (&quot;Gray Lensman&quot;), the OODA loop, C3-based warfare, and the AWACS (&quot;Gray Lensman&quot;).

An inarguable influence was described in a June 11, 1947, letter to Smith from John W. Campbell (the editor of &quot;Astounding&quot;, where much of the &quot;Lensman&quot; series was originally published). In it, Campbell relayed Captain Cal Laning&#x27;s acknowledgment that he had used Smith&#x27;s ideas for displaying the battlespace situation (called the &quot;tank&quot; in the stories) in the design of the United States Navy&#x27;s ships&#x27; Combat Information Centers. &quot;The entire set-up was taken specifically, directly, and consciously from the &quot;Directrix&quot;. In your story, you reached the situation the Navy was in—more communication channels than integration techniques to handle it. You proposed such an integrating technique and proved how advantageous it could be. You, sir, were 100% right. As the Japanese Navy—not the hypothetical Boskonian fleet—learned at an appalling cost.&quot;

One underlying theme of the later &quot;Lensman&quot; novels was the difficulty in maintaining military secrecy—as advanced capabilities are revealed, the opposing side can often duplicate them. This point was also discussed extensively by John Campbell in his letter to Smith. Also in the later &quot;Lensman&quot; novels, and particular after the &quot;Battle of Klovia&quot; broke the Boskonian&#x27;s power base at the end of &quot;Second Stage Lensmen&quot;, the Boskonian forces and particularly Kandron of Onlo reverted to terroristic tactics to attempt to demoralize Civilization, thus providing an early literary glimpse into this modern problem of both law enforcement and military response. The use of &quot;Vee-two&quot; gas by the pirates attacking the &quot;Hyperion&quot; in &quot;Triplanetary&quot; (in both magazine and book appearances) also suggests anticipation of the terrorist uses of poison gases. However, Smith lived through WWI, when the use of poison gas on troops was well known to the populace; extending the assumption that pirates might use it if they could obtain it was no great extension of the present-day knowledge.

The beginning of the story &quot;Skylark of Space&quot; describes in relative detail the protagonist&#x27;s research into separation of platinum group residues, subsequent experiments involving electrolysis, and the discovery of a process evocative of cold fusion (over 50 years before Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann). He describes a nuclear process yielding large amounts of energy and producing only negligible radioactive waste—which then goes on to form the basis of the adventures in the Skylark books. Smith&#x27;s general description of the process of discovery is highly evocative of Röntgen&#x27;s descriptions of his discovery of the X-ray.

Another theme of the &quot;Skylark&quot; novels involves precursors of modern information technology. The humanoid aliens encountered in the first novel have developed a primitive technology called the &quot;mechanical educator&quot;, which allows direct conversion of brain waves into intelligible thought for transmission to others or for electrical storage. By the third novel in the series, &quot;Skylark of Valeron&quot;, this technology has grown into an &quot;Electronic Brain&quot; which is capable of computation on all &quot;bands&quot; of energy—electromagnetism, gravity, and &quot;tachyonic&quot; energy and radiation bands included. This is itself derived from a discussion of reductionist atomic theory in the second novel, &quot;Skylark Three&quot;, which brings to mind modern quark and sub-quark theories of elementary particle physics.

==Literary influences==

In his 1947 essay &quot;The Epic of Space&quot;, Smith listed (by last name only) authors he enjoyed reading: John W. Campbell, L. Sprague de Camp, Robert A. Heinlein, Murray Leinster, H. P. Lovecraft, and A. Merritt (specifically &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot;, &quot;The Moon Pool&quot;, &quot;The Snake Mother&quot;, and &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot;, as well as the character John Kenton), C. L. Moore (specifically &quot;Jirel of Joiry&quot;), Roman Frederick Starzl, John Taine, A. E. van Vogt, Stanley G. Weinbaum (specifically &quot;Tweerl&quot;), and Jack Williamson. In a passage on his preparation for writing the &quot;Lensman&quot; novels, he notes that Clinton Constantinescu&#x27;s &quot;War of the Universe&quot; was not a masterpiece, but says that Starzl and Williamson were masters; this suggests that Starzl&#x27;s Interplanetary Flying Patrol may have been an influence on Smith&#x27;s Triplanetary Patrol, later the &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot;. The feeding of the Overlords of Delgon upon the life-force of their victims at the end of chapter five of &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot; seems a clear allusion to chapter 29 of &quot;The Moon Pool&quot;, Merritt&#x27;s account of the Taithu and the power of love in chapters 29 and 34 also bear some resemblance to the end of &quot;Children of the Lens.&quot; Smith also mentions Edgar Rice Burroughs, complaining about loose ends at the end of one of his novels.

Smith acknowledges the help of the Galactic Roamers writers&#x27; workshop, plus E. Everett Evans, Ed Counts, an unnamed aeronautical engineer, Dr. James Enright, and Dr. Richard W. Dodson. Smith&#x27;s daughter, Verna, lists the following authors as visitors to the Smith household in her youth: Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, Heinlein, Dave Kyle, Bob Tucker, Williamson, Pohl, Merritt, and the Galactic Roamers. Smith cites Bigelow&#x27;s &quot;Theoretical Chemistry–Fundamentals&quot; as a justification for the possibility of the inertialess drive. Also, an extended reference is made to Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Ballad of Boh Da Thone&quot; in &quot;Gray Lensman&quot; (chapter 22, &quot;Regeneration&quot;, in a conversation between Kinnison and MacDougall). Again in &quot;Gray Lensman&quot;, Smith quotes from Merritt&#x27;s &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot;, even name-checking the author:

Sam Moskowitz&#x27;s biographical essay on Smith in &quot;Seekers of Tomorrow&quot; states that he regularly read &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine, and everything by H. G. Wells, Jules Verne, H. Rider Haggard, Edgar Allan Poe, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Moskowitz also notes that Smith&#x27;s &quot;reading enthusiasms included poetry, philosophy, ancient and medieval history, and all of English literature&quot;. (Smith&#x27;s grandson notes that he spoke, and sang, German.) The influence of these is not readily apparent, except in the Roman section of &quot;Triplanetary&quot;, and in the impeccable but convoluted grammar of Smith&#x27;s narration. Some influence of 19th-century philosophy of language may be detectable in the account in &quot;Galactic Patrol&quot; of the Lens of Arisia as a universal translator, which is reminiscent of Frege&#x27;s strong realism about &quot;Sinn&quot;, that is, thought or sense.

Both Moskowitz and Smith&#x27;s daughter Verna Smith Trestrail report that Smith had a troubled relationship with John Campbell, the editor of &quot;Astounding&quot;. Smith&#x27;s most successful works were published under Campbell, but the degree of influence is uncertain. The original outline for the &quot;Lensman&quot; series had been accepted by F. Orlin Tremaine, and Smith angered Campbell by showing loyalty to Tremaine at his new magazine, &quot;Comet&quot;, when he sold him &quot;The Vortex Blaster&quot; in 1941. Campbell&#x27;s announcement of &quot;Children of the Lens&quot;, in 1947, was less than enthusiastic. Campbell later said that he published it only reluctantly, though he praised it privately, and bought little from Smith thereafter.

==Derivative works and influence on popular culture==

* Randall Garrett wrote a parody entitled &quot;Backstage Lensman&quot; which Smith reportedly enjoyed. Harry Harrison also parodied Smith&#x27;s work in the novel &quot;Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers&quot; and the short story &quot;Space Rats of the CCC&quot;.
* Sir Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s space battle in &quot;Earthlight&quot; was based on the attack on the Mardonalian fortress in chapter seven of &quot;Skylark Three&quot;.
* Steve &#x27;Slug&#x27; Russell wrote one of the first computer games, &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, with inspiration from the space battles from the Lensman series.
* The Japanese &quot;Lensman&quot; anime is more an imitation of &quot;Star Wars&quot; than a translation of the &quot;Lensman&quot; novels. Efforts to print translations of the associated manga in the United States in the early 1990s without payment of royalties to the Smith family were successfully blocked in court by Verna Smith Trestrail with the help of several California science-fiction authors and fans.
* In his biography, George Lucas reveals that the &quot;Lensman&quot; novels were a major influence on his youth. J. Michael Straczynski, creator of the science-fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, also has acknowledged the influence of the &quot;Lensman&quot; books.
* Superman creator Jerry Siegel was impressed, at an early age, with the optimistic vision of the future presented in &quot;Skylark of Space&quot;.
* An attempt to create a feature film based on the &quot;Lensman&quot; series by Ron Howard&#x27;s Imagine Entertainment and Universal Studios began in 2008 with J. Michael Straczynski, the creator of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, as writer, but in 2014 the project was scrapped because of budget limitations.
* In her short &quot;Pliocene Companion&quot; book, author Julian May explained that a major character in her Exile series written in the early 1980s, Marc Remillard, was strongly influenced by Smith&#x27;s villain character from Skylark DuQuesne, Marc DuQuesne. This was somewhat of a tribute to Smith. May had written an early science fiction short story called &quot;Dune Roller&quot; in 1950, and had attended several science fiction conventions in the early &#x27;50s, where she met and came to know Smith personally.
* The 2019 album &quot;All Aboard the Skylark&quot; by Hawkwind is named after the stories.

==Fictional appearances==

Smith himself appears as a character in the 2006 novel &quot;The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril&quot; by Paul Malmont. The novel describes friendship and rivalry among pulp writers of the 1930s. He also appears as &quot;Lensman Ted Smith&quot; in the 1980 novel &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; and as &quot;Commander Ted Smith&quot; in the 1985 novel &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;, both by Robert A. Heinlein. It is also suggested that he was one of the inspirations for Heinlein&#x27;s character Lazarus Long. Christopher Nuttall incorporates a fictional quote from “Edward E. Smith, Professor of Sociology” in his military science fiction book, “No Worse Enemy”.

<text>Évariste Galois (; ; 25 October 1811 – 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician and political activist. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem that had been open for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra.

Galois was a staunch republican and was heavily involved in the political turmoil that surrounded the French Revolution of 1830. As a result of his political activism, he was arrested repeatedly, serving one jail sentence of several months. For reasons that remain obscure, shortly after his release from prison, Galois fought in a duel and died of the wounds he suffered.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
Galois was born on 25 October 1811 to Nicolas-Gabriel Galois and Adélaïde-Marie (née Demante). His father was a Republican and was head of Bourg-la-Reine&#x27;s liberal party. His father became mayor of the village after Louis XVIII returned to the throne in 1814. His mother, the daughter of a jurist, was a fluent reader of Latin and classical literature and was responsible for her son&#x27;s education for his first twelve years.
In October 1823, he entered the Lycée Louis-le-Grand where his teacher Louis Paul Émile Richard recognized his brilliance. At the age of 14, he began to take a serious interest in mathematics.

Galois found a copy of Adrien-Marie Legendre&#x27;s &quot;Éléments de Géométrie&quot;, which, it is said, he read &quot;like a novel&quot; and mastered at the first reading. At 15, he was reading the original papers of Joseph-Louis Lagrange, such as the &quot;Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations&quot; which likely motivated his later work on equation theory, and &quot;Leçons sur le calcul des fonctions&quot;, work intended for professional mathematicians, yet his classwork remained uninspired and his teachers accused him of putting on the airs of a genius.

=== Budding mathematician ===
In 1828, Galois attempted the entrance examination for the École Polytechnique, the most prestigious institution for mathematics in France at the time, without the usual preparation in mathematics, and failed for lack of explanations on the oral examination. In that same year, he entered the École Normale (then known as l&#x27;École préparatoire), a far inferior institution for mathematical studies at that time, where he found some professors sympathetic to him.
In the following year Galois&#x27;s first paper, on simple continued fractions, 
was published. It was at around the same time that he began making fundamental discoveries in the theory of polynomial equations. He submitted two papers on this topic to the Academy of Sciences. Augustin-Louis Cauchy refereed these papers, but refused to accept them for publication for reasons that still remain unclear. However, in spite of many claims to the contrary, it is widely held that Cauchy recognized the importance of Galois&#x27;s work, and that he merely suggested combining the two papers into one in order to enter it in the competition for the academy&#x27;s Grand Prize in Mathematics. Cauchy, an eminent mathematician of the time though with political views that were diametrically opposed to those of Galois, considered Galois&#x27;s work to be a likely winner.

On 28 July 1829, Galois&#x27;s father died by suicide after a bitter political dispute with the village priest. A couple of days later, Galois made his second and last attempt to enter the Polytechnique and failed yet again. It is undisputed that Galois was more than qualified; accounts differ on why he failed. More plausible accounts state that Galois made too many logical leaps and baffled the incompetent examiner, which enraged Galois. The recent death of his father may have also influenced his behavior.

Having been denied admission to the École polytechnique, Galois took the Baccalaureate examinations in order to enter the École normale. He passed, receiving his degree on 29 December 1829. His examiner in mathematics reported, &quot;This pupil is sometimes obscure in expressing his ideas, but he is intelligent and shows a remarkable spirit of research.&quot;

Galois submitted his memoir on equation theory several times, but it was never published in his lifetime. Though his first attempt was refused by Cauchy, in February 1830 following Cauchy&#x27;s suggestion he submitted it to the academy&#x27;s secretary Joseph Fourier, to be considered for the Grand Prix of the academy. Unfortunately, Fourier died soon after, and the memoir was lost. The prize would be awarded that year to Niels Henrik Abel posthumously and also to Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Despite the lost memoir, Galois published three papers that year. One laid the foundations for Galois theory. The second was about the numerical resolution of equations (root finding in modern terminology). The third was an important one in number theory, in which the concept of a finite field was first articulated.

=== Political firebrand ===
Galois lived during a time of political turmoil in France. Charles X had succeeded Louis XVIII in 1824, but in 1827 his party suffered a major electoral setback and by 1830 the opposition liberal party became the majority. Charles, faced with political opposition from the chambers, staged a coup d&#x27;état, and issued his notorious July Ordinances, touching off the July Revolution which ended with Louis Philippe becoming king. While their counterparts at the Polytechnique were making history in the streets, Galois, at the École Normale, was locked in by the school&#x27;s director. Galois was incensed and wrote a blistering letter criticizing the director, which he submitted to the &quot;Gazette des Écoles&quot;, signing the letter with his full name. Although the &quot;Gazette&quot;″s editor omitted the signature for publication, Galois was expelled.

Although his expulsion would have formally taken effect on 4 January 1831, Galois quit school immediately and joined the staunchly Republican artillery unit of the National Guard. He divided his time between his mathematical work and his political affiliations. Due to controversy surrounding the unit, soon after Galois became a member, on 31 December 1830, the artillery of the National Guard was disbanded out of fear that they might destabilize the government. At around the same time, nineteen officers of Galois&#x27;s former unit were arrested and charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government.

In April 1831, the officers were acquitted of all charges, and on 9 May 1831, a banquet was held in their honor, with many illustrious people present, such as Alexandre Dumas. The proceedings grew riotous. At some point, Galois stood and proposed a toast in which he said, &quot;To Louis Philippe,&quot; with a dagger above his cup. The republicans at the banquet interpreted Galois&#x27;s toast as a threat against the king&#x27;s life and cheered. He was arrested the following day at his mother&#x27;s house and held in detention at Sainte-Pélagie prison until 15 June 1831, when he had his trial. Galois&#x27;s defense lawyer cleverly claimed that Galois actually said, &quot;To Louis-Philippe, &quot;if he betrays&quot;,&quot; but that the qualifier was drowned out in the cheers. The prosecutor asked a few more questions, and perhaps influenced by Galois&#x27;s youth, the jury acquitted him that same day.

On the following Bastille Day (14 July 1831), Galois was at the head of a protest, wearing the uniform of the disbanded artillery, and came heavily armed with several pistols, a loaded rifle, and a dagger. He was again arrested. During his stay in prison, Galois at one point drank alcohol for the first time at the goading of his fellow inmates. One of these inmates, François-Vincent Raspail, recorded what Galois said while drunk in a letter from 25 July. Excerpted from the letter:

Raspail continues that Galois, still in a delirium, attempted suicide, and that he would have succeeded if his fellow inmates had not forcibly stopped him. Months later, when Galois&#x27;s trial occurred on 23 October, he was sentenced to six months in prison for illegally wearing a uniform. While in prison, he continued to develop his mathematical ideas. He was released on 29 April 1832.

=== Final days ===

Galois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the École Normale, although he continued to spend time in political activities. After his expulsion became official in January 1831, he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest, but this waned, as it seemed that his political activism had priority. Siméon Denis Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations, which he did on 17 January 1831. Around 4 July 1831, Poisson declared Galois&#x27;s work &quot;incomprehensible&quot;, declaring that &quot;[Galois&#x27;s] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor&quot;; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: &quot;We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.&quot; 
While Poisson&#x27;s report was made before Galois&#x27;s 14 July arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter, and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Apparently, however, Galois did not ignore Poisson&#x27;s advice, as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832, after which he was somehow talked into a duel.

Galois&#x27;s fatal duel took place on 30 May. The true motives behind the duel are obscure. There has been much speculation about them. What is known is that, five days before his death, he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair.

Some archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was Stéphanie-Félicie Poterin du Motel, the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life. Fragments of letters from her, copied by Galois himself (with many portions, such as her name, either obliterated or deliberately omitted), are available. The letters hint that Poterin du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois, and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf. This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died. Galois&#x27;s cousin, Gabriel Demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that Galois &quot;found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé, each of whom provoked the duel.&quot; Galois himself exclaimed: &quot;I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes.&quot; 

As to his opponent in the duel, Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d&#x27;Herbinville, who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois&#x27;s first arrest. However, Dumas is alone in this assertion, and if he were correct it is unclear why d&#x27;Herbinville would have been involved. It has been speculated that he was Poterin du Motel&#x27;s &quot;supposed fiancé&quot; at the time (she ultimately married someone else), but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture. On the other hand, extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent (identified by the initials &quot;L.D.&quot;) that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois&#x27;s Republican friends, most probably Ernest Duchatelet, who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges. Given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history.

Whatever the reasons behind the duel, Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts. Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament, &quot;This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind.&quot; However, the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated. In these final papers, he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the academy and other papers.
Early in the morning of 30 May 1832, he was shot in the abdomen, was abandoned by his opponents and his own seconds, and was found by a passing farmer. He died the following morning at ten o&#x27;clock in the Hôpital Cochin (probably of peritonitis), after refusing the offices of a priest. His funeral ended in riots. There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral, but during the same time the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque&#x27;s death and the rising was postponed without any uprising occurring until 5 June. Only Galois&#x27;s younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois&#x27;s death. Galois was 20 years old. His last words to his younger brother Alfred were:
On 2 June, Évariste Galois was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse Cemetery whose exact location is unknown. In the cemetery of his native town – Bourg-la-Reine – a cenotaph in his honour was erected beside the graves of his relatives.

Évariste Galois died in 1832. Joseph Liouville began studying Galois&#x27;s unpublished papers in 1842 and acknowledged their value in 1843. It is not clear what happened in the 10 years between 1832 and 1842 nor what eventually inspired Joseph Liouville to begin reading Galois&#x27;s papers. Jesper Lützen explores this subject at some length in Chapter XIV &quot;Galois Theory&quot; of his book about Joseph Liouville without reaching any definitive conclusions.

It is certainly possible that mathematicians (including Liouville) did not want to publicize Galois&#x27;s papers because Galois was a republican political activist who died 5 days before the June Rebellion, an unsuccessful anti-monarchist insurrection of Parisian republicans. In Galois&#x27;s obituary, his friend Auguste Chevalier almost accused academicians at the École Polytechnique of having killed Galois since, if they had not rejected his work, he would have become a mathematician and would not have devoted himself to the republican political activism for which some believed he was killed. Given that France was still living in the shadow of the Reign of Terror and the Napoleonic era, Liouville might have waited until the political turmoil subsided (from the failed June Rebellion and its aftermath) before turning his attention to Galois&#x27;s papers.

Liouville finally published Galois&#x27;s manuscripts in the October–November 1846 issue of the &quot;Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées&quot;. Galois&#x27;s most famous contribution was a novel proof that there is no quintic formula – that is, that fifth and higher degree equations are not generally solvable by radicals. Although Niels Henrik Abel had already proved the impossibility of a &quot;quintic formula&quot; by radicals in 1824 and Paolo Ruffini had published a solution in 1799 that turned out to be flawed, Galois&#x27;s methods led to deeper research into what is now called Galois Theory, which can be used to determine, for &quot;any&quot; polynomial equation, whether it has a solution by radicals.

== Contributions to mathematics ==
From the closing lines of a letter from Galois to his friend Auguste Chevalier, dated 29 May 1832, two days before Galois&#x27;s death:

Within the 60 or so pages of Galois&#x27;s collected works are many important ideas that have had far-reaching consequences for nearly all branches of mathematics. 
His work has been compared to that of Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829), a contemporary mathematician who also died at a very young age, and much of their work had significant overlap.

=== Algebra ===
While many mathematicians before Galois gave consideration to what are now known as groups, it was Galois who was the first to use the word &quot;group&quot; (in French &quot;groupe&quot;) in a sense close to the technical sense that is understood today, making him among the founders of the branch of algebra known as group theory. He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right cosets a &quot;proper decomposition&quot; if the left and right cosets coincide, which leads to the notion of what today are known as normal subgroups. He also introduced the concept of a finite field (also known as a Galois field in his honor) in essentially the same form as it is understood today.

In his last letter to Chevalier and attached manuscripts, the second of three, he made basic studies of linear groups over finite fields:
*He constructed the general linear group over a prime field, GL(&quot;ν&quot;, &quot;p&quot;) and computed its order, in studying the Galois group of the general equation of degree &quot;pν&quot;.
*He constructed the projective special linear group PSL(2,&quot;p&quot;). Galois constructed them as fractional linear transforms, and observed that they were simple except if &quot;p&quot; was 2 or 3. These were the second family of finite simple groups, after the alternating groups.
*He noted the exceptional fact that PSL(2,&quot;p&quot;) is simple and acts on &quot;p&quot; points if and only if &quot;p&quot; is 5, 7, or 11.

=== Galois theory ===

Galois&#x27;s most significant contribution to mathematics is his development of Galois theory. He realized that the algebraic solution to a polynomial equation is related to the structure of a group of permutations associated with the roots of the polynomial, the Galois group of the polynomial. He found that an equation could be solved in radicals if one can find a series of subgroups of its Galois group, each one normal in its successor with abelian quotient, that is, its Galois group is solvable. This proved to be a fertile approach, which later mathematicians adapted to many other fields of mathematics besides the theory of equations to which Galois originally applied it.

=== Analysis ===
Galois also made some contributions to the theory of Abelian integrals and continued fractions.

As written in his last letter, Galois passed from the study of elliptic functions to consideration of the integrals of the most general algebraic differentials, today called Abelian integrals. He classified these integrals into three categories.

=== Continued fractions ===
In his first paper in 1828, Galois proved that the regular continued fraction which represents a quadratic surd &quot;ζ&quot; is purely periodic if and only if &quot;ζ&quot; is a reduced surd, that is, formula_1 and its conjugate formula_2
satisfies formula_3.

In fact, Galois showed more than this. He also proved that if &quot;ζ&quot; is a reduced quadratic surd and &quot;η&quot; is its conjugate, then the continued fractions for &quot;ζ&quot; and for (−1/&quot;η&quot;) are both purely periodic, and the repeating block in one of those continued fractions is the mirror image of the repeating block in the other. In symbols we have

:formula_4

where &quot;ζ&quot; is any reduced quadratic surd, and &quot;η&quot; is its conjugate.

From these two theorems of Galois a result already known to Lagrange can be deduced. If &quot;r&quot; &gt; 1 is a rational number that is not a perfect square, then

:formula_5

In particular, if &quot;n&quot; is any non-square positive integer, the regular continued fraction expansion of √&quot;n&quot; contains a repeating block of length &quot;m&quot;, in which the first &quot;m&quot; − 1 partial denominators form a palindromic string.

<text>Quintus Ennius (; ) was a writer and poet who lived during the Roman Republic. He is often considered the father of Roman poetry. He was born in the small town of Rudiae, located near modern Lecce (ancient &quot;Calabria&quot;, today Salento), a town founded by the Messapians, and could speak Greek as well as Latin and Oscan (his native language). Although only fragments of his works survive, his influence in Latin literature was significant, particularly in his use of Greek literary models.

==Biography==

Very little is reliably known about the life of Ennius. His contemporaries hardly mentioned him and much that is related about him could have been embroidered from references to himself in his now fragmentary writings. Some lines of the &quot;Annales&quot;, as well as ancient testimonies, for example, suggest that Ennius opened his epic with a recollection of a dream in which the ancient epic-writer Homer informed him that his spirit had been reborn into Ennius. It is true that the doctrine of the transmigration of souls once flourished in the areas of Italy settled by Greeks, but the statement might have been no more than a literary flourish. Ennius seems to have been given to making large claims, as in the report by Maurus Servius Honoratus that he claimed descent from Messapus, the legendary king of his native district. The partially Hellenised city of Rudiae (in modern Apulia), his place of birth, was certainly in the area settled by the Messapians. And this, he used to say, according to Aulus Gellius, had endowed him with a triple linguistic and cultural heritage, fancifully described as &quot;three hearts… Greek, Oscan and Latin&quot;.

The public career of Ennius first really emerges in middle life, when he was serving in the army with the rank of centurion during the Second Punic War. While in Sardinia in the year 204 BCE, he is said to have attracted the attention of Cato the Elder and was taken by him to Rome. There he taught Greek and adapted Greek plays for a livelihood, and by his poetical compositions gained the friendship of some of the greatest men in Rome whose achievements he praised. Amongst these were Scipio Africanus and Fulvius Nobilior, whom he accompanied on his Aetolian campaign (189). Afterwards he made the capture of Ambracia, at which he was present, the subject of a play and of an episode in the &quot;Annales&quot;. It was through the influence of Nobilior&#x27;s son Quintus that Ennius subsequently obtained Roman citizenship. But he himself lived plainly and simply in the literary quarter on the Aventine Hill with the poet Caecilius Statius, a fellow adapter of Greek plays.

At about the age of 70 Ennius died, immediately after producing his tragedy &quot;Thyestes&quot;. In the last book of his epic poem, in which he seems to have given various details of his personal history, he mentioned that he was in his 67th year at the date of its composition. He compared himself, in contemplation of the close of the great work of his life, to a gallant horse which, after having often won the prize at the Olympic Games, obtained his rest when weary with age. A similar feeling of pride at the completion of a great career is expressed in the memorial lines which he composed to be placed under his bust after death: &quot;Let no one weep for me, or celebrate my funeral with mourning; for I still live, as I pass to and fro through the mouths of men.&quot;

==Literature==

Ennius continued the nascent literary tradition by writing plays in Greek and Roman style (praetextae and palliatae), as well as his most famous work, a historical epic in hexameters called the &quot;Annales&quot;. Other minor works include the &quot;Epicharmus&quot;, &quot;Epigrammata&quot;, the &quot;Euhemerus&quot;, the &quot;Hedyphagetica&quot;, &quot;Praecepta&quot;/&quot;Protrepticus&quot;, &quot;Saturae&quot; (or &quot;Satires&quot;), &quot;Scipio&quot;, and &quot;Sota&quot;.

===The &quot;Annales&quot;===
The &quot;Annales&quot; was an epic poem in fifteen books, later expanded to eighteen, covering Roman history from the fall of Troy in 1184 BCE down to the censorship of Cato the Elder in 184 BCE. It was the first Latin poem to adopt the dactylic hexameter metre used in Greek epic and didactic poetry, leading it to become the standard metre for these genres in Latin poetry. The &quot;Annals&quot; became a school text for Roman schoolchildren, eventually supplanted by Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. About 600 lines survive.

===Minor works===
The &quot;Epicharmus&quot; was inspired by the philosophical hypotheses developed by the Sicilian poet and philosopher Epicharmus of Kos, after which Ennius&#x27;s work took its name. In the &quot;Epicharmus&quot;, the poet describes a dream he had in which he died and was transported to some place of heavenly enlightenment. Here, he met Epicharmus, who explained the nature of the gods and taught Ennius the physics of the universe.

The &quot;Euhemerus&quot; presented a theological doctrine based on the ideas of Euhemerus of Messene, who argued that the gods of Olympus were not supernatural powers that interfere in the lives of humans, but rather heroes of old who after death were eventually regarded as deities due to their valor, bravery, or cultural impact (this belief is now known as euhemerism). Both Cicero and Lactantius write that the &quot;Euhemerus&quot; was a &quot;translat[ion] and a recount[ing]&quot; of Euhemerus&#x27;s original work the &quot;Sacred History&quot;, but it is unclear if this means Ennius simply translated the original from Greek into Latin, or added in his own elements. Most of what is preserved of this work comes to us from Lactantius, and these snippets suggest that the &quot;Euhemerus&quot; was a prose text.

The &quot;Hedyphagetica&quot; took much of its substance from the gastronomical epic of Archestratus of Gela. The extant portions of Ennius&#x27;s poem discuss where a reader might find the best type of fish. Most of the fragments, replete with unique terms for fish and numerous place names, are corrupt or damaged. The &quot;Hedyphagetica&quot; is written in hexameters, but differs from the &quot;Annales&quot; in regards to &quot;metrical practices&quot;; this difference is largely due to each works&#x27; distinct subject matter.

The titles &quot;Praecepta&quot; and &quot;Protrepticus&quot; were likely used to refer to the same (possibly exhortatory) work. However, given this work&#x27;s almost non-existent nature (only the word &quot;pannibus&quot;an &quot;unusual&quot; form of the word &quot;pannis&quot;, meaning &quot;rags&quot;is preserved in the work of the Latin grammarian Charisius), this position is extremely difficult to verify.

The &quot;Saturae&quot; is a collection of about thirty lines from satirical poemsmaking it the first extant instance of Roman satire. These lines are written in a variety of poetic metres. The poems in this collection &quot;were mostly concerned with practical wisdom, often driving home a lesson with the help of a fable.&quot;

Ennius&#x27;s &quot;Scipio&quot; was a work (possibly a panegyric poem) that apparently celebrated the life and deeds of Scipio Africanus. Hardly anything remains of this work, and what is preserved is embedded in the works of others. Unfortunately, &quot;no quotation of [&quot;Scipio&quot;] supplies a context&quot;. Some have proposed that the work was written before the &quot;Annales&quot;, and others have said that the work was written after Scipio&#x27;s 201 BCE triumph that followed the Battle of Zama (202 BCE).

The &quot;Sota&quot; was a poem, potentially of some length, named after the Greek poet Sotades. The work, which followed a metre established by Sotades known as the &quot;Sotadeus&quot;, concerned itself with a number of disparate topics and ideas.

<doc id="9823" wikidata="Q140001" url="?curid=9823" title="Eris (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Eris () is the goddess and personification of strife and discord, particularly in war, and in the &quot;Iliad&quot; (where she is the &quot;sister&quot; of Ares the god of war). According to Hesiod she was the daughter of primordial Nyx (Night), and the mother of a long list of undesirable personified abstractions, such as Ponos (Toil), Limos (Famine), Algae (Pains) and Ate (Delusion). Eris initiated a quarrel between Hera, Athena and Aphrodite, which led to the Judgement of Paris and ultimately the Trojan War. Eris&#x27;s Roman equivalent is Discordia. According to Hesiod, there was another Eris, separate and distinct from Eris the daughter of Nyx, who was beneficial to men.

==Etymology==
The name derives from the noun &quot;eris&quot;, with stem &quot;erid-&quot;, which means &quot;strife, discord&quot; and is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb &quot;to raise, stir, excite&quot; and the proper name have been suggested. R. S. P. Beekes sees no strong evidence for this relation and excludes the derivation from &quot;to prop, to support&quot; due to the name&#x27;s original ι- stem. Watkins suggested origin from a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;ere&quot;- meaning &quot;to separate, to adjoin&quot;. The name gave several derivatives in Ancient Greek, including &quot;to fight&quot; and &quot;object of a quarrel&quot;.

==Family==
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Eris is called (allegorically?) the &quot;sister&quot; of Ares.
However, according to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Eris is the daughter of Nyx (Night), being among the many children Nyx produced without a partner. These siblings of Eris include personifications—like Eris—of several &quot;loathsome&quot; (&quot;στυγερός&quot;) things, such as Moros (&quot;Doom&quot;), Thanatos (&quot;Death&quot;), the Moirai (&quot;Fates&quot;), Nemesis (&quot;Indignation&quot;), Apate (&quot;Deceit&quot;), and Geras (&quot;Old Age&quot;).

Like her mother Nyx, Hesiod has Eris as the mother—with no father mentioned—of many children (the only child of Nyx with offspring) who are also personifications representing various misfortunes and harmful things which, in Eris&#x27; case, might be thought to result from discord and strife All of Eris&#x27; children are little more than allegorizations of the meanings of their names, with virtually no other identity. The following table lists the children of Eris, as given by Hesiod:

==Judgement of Paris==
Eris plays a crucial role in one important myth. She was the initiator of the quarrel between the three Greek goddesses, Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, resolved by the Judgement of Paris, which led to Paris&#x27; abduction of Helen of Troy and the outbreak of the Trojan War. As the story came to be told, all the gods were invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis except Eris. She came anyway but was refused admission. In anger, she threw a golden apple among the wedding guests inscribed with &quot;For the fairest&quot;, which the three goddesses each claimed.

Homer alludes to the Judgement of Paris, but with no mention of Eris. An account of the story, was told in the &quot;Cypria&quot;, one of the poems in the Epic Cycle, which told the entire story of the Trojan War. The &quot;Cypria&quot; which is the first poem in the Cycle, describes events preceding those that occur in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the second poem in the Cycle. According to a prose summary of the now lost &quot;Cypria&quot;, Eris, acting according to the plans of Zeus and Themis to bring about the Trojan War, instigates a &quot;nekios&quot; (&#x27;feud&#x27;) between the three goddesses over &quot;beauty&quot; (presumably over who of the three was the most beautiful), while they were attending the wedding feast of Peleus and Thetis (who would become the parents of Achilles). To settle the dispute, Zeus orders the three goddesses to go to Mount Ida to be judged by Paris. Paris, having been offered Helen by Aphrodite in return for Paris choosing her, does so.

The fifth-century BC playwright Euripides, describes the Judgement of Paris several times with no mention of either Eris, or an apple. Later accounts include details, such as the golden Apple of Discord, which may or may not have come from the &quot;Cypria&quot;. According to the &quot;Fabulae&quot; of Hyginus, composed somewhere between the first century BC and the late second century AD, all the gods had been invited to the wedding except Eris. Nevertheless, she came to the wedding feast, and when refused entrance, she threw an apple through the doorway, saying that it was for the &quot;fairest&quot;, which started the quarrel. The satirist Lucian (fl. 2nd century AD) tells us that Eris&#x27;s apple was &quot;solid gold&quot; and that it was inscribed: &quot;For the queen of Beauty&quot; ().

==Strife in war==
Eris personifies strife, particularly the strife associated with war. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Eris is described as being depicted on both Athena&#x27;s battle aegis, and Achilles&#x27; shield, where she appears alongside other war-related personifications: Phobos (&quot;Rout&quot;), Alke (&quot;Valor&quot;), and Ioke (&quot;Assault&quot;), on the aegis, and Kydoimos (&quot;Tumult&quot;), and Ker (&quot;Fate&quot;), on the shield. Similarly, the Hesiodic &quot;Shield of Heracles&quot; has Eris depicted on Heracles&#x27; shield, also with Phobos, Kydoimos and Ker, as well as other war-related personifications: Proioxis (&quot;Pursuit&quot;), Palioxis (&quot;Rally&quot;), Homados (&quot;Tumult &quot;), Phonos (&quot;Murder&quot;), and Androktasia (&quot;Slaughter&quot;). Here Eris is described as flying over the head of Phobos (&quot;Fear&quot;):
Eris also appears in several battle scenes in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. However, unlike Apollo, Athena and several other of the Olympians, Eris does not participate in active combat, nor take sides in the war. Her role in the &quot;Iliad&quot; is that of &quot;the rouser of armies&quot;, urging both armies to fight each other. In Book 4, she is one of the divinities (along with Ares, Athena, Deimos (&quot;Terror&quot;), and Phobos (&quot;Rout&quot;) urging the armies to battle, with head lowered at first, but soon raised up to the heavens:
She also appears in this &quot;rouser of armies&quot; role in Book 5, and again in Book 11, where Zeus sends Eris to rouse the Greek army by shouting: 
Her lust for bloodshed is insatiable. Later in Book 11, she is the last of the gods to leave the battlefield, rejoicing as she watches the fighting she has roused. While in Book 5, she is described as raging unceasingly.

Hesiod also associates Eris with war. In his &quot;Works and Days&quot;, he says that she &quot;fosters evil war and conflict&quot;. And in his &quot;Theogony&quot;, has the Hysminai (Battles) and the Machai (Wars) as her children.

==Another Eris==
In addition to the Eris who was the daughter of Nyx (Night), Hesiod, in his &quot;Works and Days&quot;, mentions another Eris. He contrasts the two: the former being &quot;blameworthy&quot; who &quot;fosters evil war and conflict&quot;, the latter worthy of &quot;praise&quot;, have been created by Zeus to foster beneficial competition:

==Other mentions==
Antoninus Liberalis, in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, involves Eris in the story of Polytechnus and Aedon, who claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to wreak discord upon them. Eris is mentioned many times in Quintus Smyrnaeus&#x27; &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, which covers the period between the end of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the beginning of his &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Just as in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Posthomerica&quot; Eris is the instigator of conflict, does not take sides, shouts, and delights in the carnage of battle. Eris is also mentioned in the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; of Nonnus. At the start of the epic confrontation between Zeus and Typhon, Nonnus has Nike (Victory) lead Zeus into battle, and Eris lead Typhon, and in another passage has Eris, with the war-goddess Enyo, bring &quot;Tumult&quot; to both sides of a battle.

==Iconography==
There are few certain representations of Eris in art. Her earliest appearances (mid-sixth-century BC) are found on the Chest of Cypselus and in the tondo of a black-figure cup (Berlin F1775). The geographer Pausanias describes seeing Eris depicted on the Chest, as a &quot;most repulsive&quot; [&quot;aischistê&quot;] woman standing between Ajax and Hector fighting. On the cup she is depicted as a normal woman in appearance apart from having wings and winged-sandals.

From the later part of fifth-century BC, the upper section of a red-figure calyx krater depicts Eris with Themis facing each other, apparently in animated discussion, while the lower section depicts the Judgement of Paris, confirming Eris&#x27; role in the events as told in the &quot;Cypria&quot;.

==Cultural influences==
The classic fairy tale &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; references what appears to be Eris&#x27;s role in the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. Like Eris, a malevolent fairy curses a princess after not being invited to the princess&#x27;s christening.

Eris is the principal figure of worship in the modern Discordian religion invented as an &quot;absurdist joke&quot; in 1957 by two school friends Gregory Hill and Kerry Wendell Thornley. As mythologized in the religion&#x27;s satirical text &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, written by Hill with Thornely and others, Eris (apparently) spoke to Hill and Thornley in an all-night bowling alley, in the form of a chimpanzee.

Eris, the &quot;Goddess of Discord and Chaos&quot;, is a recurring antagonist in the animated television series The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy, wherein she is depicted as a spoiled and wealthy woman that wields the &quot;Apple of Discord&quot;.

Similarly, Eris, the malevolent &quot;Goddess of Discord and Chaos&quot;, is the main antagonist in the DreamWorks 2003 animated movie &quot;&quot; against Sinbad and his allies.

The dwarf planet Eris was named after this Greek goddess in 2006.

In 2019, the New Zealand moth species &quot;Ichneutica eris&quot; was named in honour of Eris.
