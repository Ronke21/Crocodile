<text>The electromagnetic spectrum is the full range of electromagnetic radiation, organized by frequency or wavelength. The spectrum is divided into separate bands, with different names for the electromagnetic waves within each band. From low to high frequency these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. The electromagnetic waves in each of these bands have different characteristics, such as how they are produced, how they interact with matter, and their practical applications.

Radio waves, at the low-frequency end of the spectrum, have the lowest photon energy and the longest wavelengths—thousands of kilometers, or more. They can be emitted and received by antennas, and pass through the atmosphere, foliage, and most building materials.

Gamma rays, at the high-frequency end of the spectrum, have the highest photon energies and the shortest wavelengths—much smaller than an atomic nucleus. Gamma rays, X-rays, and extreme ultraviolet rays are called ionizing radiation because their high photon energy is able to ionize atoms, causing chemical reactions. Longer-wavelength radiation such as visible light is nonionizing; the photons do not have sufficient energy to ionize atoms.

Throughout most of the electromagnetic spectrum, spectroscopy can be used to separate waves of different frequencies, so that the intensity of the radiation can be measured as a function of frequency or wavelength. Spectroscopy is used to study the interactions of electromagnetic waves with matter.

== History and discovery ==

Humans have always been aware of visible light and radiant heat but for most of history it was not known that these phenomena were connected or were representatives of a more extensive principle. The ancient Greeks recognized that light traveled in straight lines and studied some of its properties, including reflection and refraction. Light was intensively studied from the beginning of the 17th century leading to the invention of important instruments like the telescope and microscope. Isaac Newton was the first to use the term &quot;spectrum&quot; for the range of colours that white light could be split into with a prism. Starting in 1666, Newton showed that these colours were intrinsic to light and could be recombined into white light. A debate arose over whether light had a wave nature or a particle nature with René Descartes, Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens favouring a wave description and Newton favouring a particle description. Huygens in particular had a well developed theory from which he was able to derive the laws of reflection and refraction. Around 1801, Thomas Young measured the wavelength of a light beam with his two-slit experiment thus conclusively demonstrating that light was a wave.

In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation. He was studying the temperature of different colours by moving a thermometer through light split by a prism. He noticed that the highest temperature was beyond red. He theorized that this temperature change was due to &quot;calorific rays&quot;, a type of light ray that could not be seen. The next year, Johann Ritter, working at the other end of the spectrum, noticed what he called &quot;chemical rays&quot; (invisible light rays that induced certain chemical reactions). These behaved similarly to visible violet light rays, but were beyond them in the spectrum. They were later renamed ultraviolet radiation.

The study of electromagnetism began in 1820 when Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that electric currents produce magnetic fields (Oersted&#x27;s law). Light was first linked to electromagnetism in 1845, when Michael Faraday noticed that the polarization of light traveling through a transparent material responded to a magnetic field (see Faraday effect). During the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell developed four partial differential equations (Maxwell&#x27;s equations) for the electromagnetic field. Two of these equations predicted the possibility and behavior of waves in the field. Analyzing the speed of these theoretical waves, Maxwell realized that they must travel at a speed that was about the known speed of light. This startling coincidence in value led Maxwell to make the inference that light itself is a type of electromagnetic wave. Maxwell&#x27;s equations predicted an infinite range of frequencies of electromagnetic waves, all traveling at the speed of light. This was the first indication of the existence of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

Maxwell&#x27;s predicted waves included waves at very low frequencies compared to infrared, which in theory might be created by oscillating charges in an ordinary electrical circuit of a certain type. Attempting to prove Maxwell&#x27;s equations and detect such low frequency electromagnetic radiation, in 1886, the physicist Heinrich Hertz built an apparatus to generate and detect what are now called radio waves. Hertz found the waves and was able to infer (by measuring their wavelength and multiplying it by their frequency) that they traveled at the speed of light. Hertz also demonstrated that the new radiation could be both reflected and refracted by various dielectric media, in the same manner as light. For example, Hertz was able to focus the waves using a lens made of tree resin. In a later experiment, Hertz similarly produced and measured the properties of microwaves. These new types of waves paved the way for inventions such as the wireless telegraph and the radio.

In 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen noticed a new type of radiation emitted during an experiment with an evacuated tube subjected to a high voltage. He called this radiation &quot;x-rays&quot; and found that they were able to travel through parts of the human body but were reflected or stopped by denser matter such as bones. Before long, many uses were found for this radiography.

The last portion of the electromagnetic spectrum was filled in with the discovery of gamma rays. In 1900, Paul Villard was studying the radioactive emissions of radium when he identified a new type of radiation that he at first thought consisted of particles similar to known alpha and beta particles, but with the power of being far more penetrating than either. However, in 1910, British physicist William Henry Bragg demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, not particles, and in 1914, Ernest Rutherford (who had named them gamma rays in 1903 when he realized that they were fundamentally different from charged alpha and beta particles) and Edward Andrade measured their wavelengths, and found that gamma rays were similar to X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths.

The wave-particle debate was rekindled in 1901 when Max Planck discovered that light is absorbed only in discrete &quot;quanta&quot;, now called photons, implying that light has a particle nature. This idea was made explicit by Albert Einstein in 1905, but never accepted by Planck and many other contemporaries. The modern position of science is that electromagnetic radiation has both a wave and a particle nature, the wave-particle duality. The contradictions arising from this position are still being debated by scientists and philosophers.

== Range ==
Electromagnetic waves are typically described by any of the following three physical properties: the frequency &quot;f&quot;, wavelength λ, or photon energy &quot;E&quot;. Frequencies observed in astronomy range from (1 GeV gamma rays) down to the local plasma frequency of the ionized interstellar medium (~1 kHz). Wavelength is inversely proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma rays have very short wavelengths that are fractions of the size of atoms, whereas wavelengths on the opposite end of the spectrum can be indefinitely long. Photon energy is directly proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma ray photons have the highest energy (around a billion electron volts), while radio wave photons have very low energy (around a femtoelectronvolt). These relations are illustrated by the following equations:
: formula_1
where:
* &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum
* &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant.

Whenever electromagnetic waves travel in a medium with matter, their wavelength is decreased. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, whatever medium they are traveling through, are usually quoted in terms of the &quot;vacuum wavelength&quot;, although this is not always explicitly stated.

Generally, electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength into radio wave, microwave, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. The behavior of EM radiation depends on its wavelength. When EM radiation interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior also depends on the amount of energy per quantum (photon) it carries.

Spectroscopy can detect a much wider region of the EM spectrum than the visible wavelength range of 400 nm to 700 nm in a vacuum. A common laboratory spectroscope can detect wavelengths from 2 nm to 2500 nm. Detailed information about the physical properties of objects, gases, or even stars can be obtained from this type of device. Spectroscopes are widely used in astrophysics. For example, many hydrogen atoms emit a radio wave photon that has a wavelength of 21.12 cm. Also, frequencies of 30 Hz and below can be produced by and are important in the study of certain stellar nebulae and frequencies as high as have been detected from astrophysical sources.

== Regions ==

The types of electromagnetic radiation are broadly classified into the following classes (regions, bands or types):
# Gamma radiation
# X-ray radiation
# Ultraviolet radiation
# Visible light (light that humans can see)
# Infrared radiation
# Microwave radiation
# Radio waves
This classification goes in the increasing order of wavelength, which is characteristic of the type of radiation.

There are no precisely defined boundaries between the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum; rather they fade into each other like the bands in a rainbow. Radiation of each frequency and wavelength (or in each band) has a mix of properties of the two regions of the spectrum that bound it. For example, red light resembles infrared radiation, in that it can excite and add energy to some chemical bonds and indeed must do so to power the chemical mechanisms responsible for photosynthesis and the working of the visual system.

In atomic and nuclear physics, the distinction between X-rays and gamma rays is based on sources: the photons generated from nuclear decay or other nuclear and subnuclear/particle process are termed gamma rays, whereas X-rays are generated by electronic transitions involving energetically deep inner atomic electrons. Electronic transitions in muonic atoms transitions are also said to produce X-rays. In astrophysics, energies below 100keV are called X-rays and higher energies are gamma rays.

The region of the spectrum where electromagnetic radiation is observed may differ from the region it was emitted in due to relative velocity of the source and observer, (the Doppler shift), relative gravitational potential (gravitational redshift), or expansion of the universe (cosmological redshift). For example, the cosmic microwave background, relic blackbody radiation from the era of recombination, started out at energies around 1eV, but as has undergone enough cosmological red shift to put it into the microwave region of the spectrum for observers on Earth.
=== Rationale for names ===
Electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter in different ways across the spectrum. These types of interaction are so different that historically different names have been applied to different parts of the spectrum, as though these were different types of radiation. Thus, although these &quot;different kinds&quot; of electromagnetic radiation form a quantitatively continuous spectrum of frequencies and wavelengths, the spectrum remains divided for practical reasons arising from these qualitative interaction differences.

== Types of radiation ==

=== Radio waves ===

Radio waves are emitted and received by antennas, which consist of conductors such as metal rod resonators. In artificial generation of radio waves, an electronic device called a transmitter generates an alternating electric current which is applied to an antenna. The oscillating electrons in the antenna generate oscillating electric and magnetic fields that radiate away from the antenna as radio waves. In reception of radio waves, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of a radio wave couple to the electrons in an antenna, pushing them back and forth, creating oscillating currents which are applied to a radio receiver. Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is mainly transparent to radio waves, except for layers of charged particles in the ionosphere which can reflect certain frequencies.

Radio waves are extremely widely used to transmit information across distances in radio communication systems such as radio broadcasting, television, two way radios, mobile phones, communication satellites, and wireless networking. In a radio communication system, a radio frequency current is modulated with an information-bearing signal in a transmitter by varying either the amplitude, frequency or phase, and applied to an antenna. The radio waves carry the information across space to a receiver, where they are received by an antenna and the information extracted by demodulation in the receiver. Radio waves are also used for navigation in systems like Global Positioning System (GPS) and navigational beacons, and locating distant objects in radiolocation and radar. They are also used for remote control, and for industrial heating.

The use of the radio spectrum is strictly regulated by governments, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) which allocates frequencies to different users for different uses.

==== Microwaves ====


Microwaves are radio waves of short wavelength, from about 10 centimeters to one millimeter, in the SHF and EHF frequency bands. Microwave energy is produced with klystron and magnetron tubes, and with solid state devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes. Although they are emitted and absorbed by short antennas, they are also absorbed by polar molecules, coupling to vibrational and rotational modes, resulting in bulk heating. Unlike higher frequency waves such as infrared and visible light which are absorbed mainly at surfaces, microwaves can penetrate into materials and deposit their energy below the surface. This effect is used to heat food in microwave ovens, and for industrial heating and medical diathermy. Microwaves are the main wavelengths used in radar, and are used for satellite communication, and wireless networking technologies such as Wi-Fi. The copper cables (transmission lines) which are used to carry lower-frequency radio waves to antennas have excessive power losses at microwave frequencies, and metal pipes called waveguides are used to carry them. Although at the low end of the band the atmosphere is mainly transparent, at the upper end of the band absorption of microwaves by atmospheric gases limits practical propagation distances to a few kilometers.

Terahertz radiation or sub-millimeter radiation is a region of the spectrum from about 100 GHz to 30 terahertz (THz) between microwaves and far infrared which can be regarded as belonging to either band. Until recently, the range was rarely studied and few sources existed for microwave energy in the so-called &quot;terahertz gap&quot;, but applications such as imaging and communications are now appearing. Scientists are also looking to apply terahertz technology in the armed forces, where high-frequency waves might be directed at enemy troops to incapacitate their electronic equipment. Terahertz radiation is strongly absorbed by atmospheric gases, making this frequency range useless for long-distance communication.

=== Infrared radiation ===

The infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum covers the range from roughly 300 GHz to 400 THz (1 mm – 750 nm). It can be divided into three parts:
* Far-infrared, from 300 GHz to 30 THz (1 mm – 10 μm). The lower part of this range may also be called microwaves or terahertz waves. This radiation is typically absorbed by so-called rotational modes in gas-phase molecules, by molecular motions in liquids, and by phonons in solids. The water in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere absorbs so strongly in this range that it renders the atmosphere in effect opaque. However, there are certain wavelength ranges (&quot;windows&quot;) within the opaque range that allow partial transmission, and can be used for astronomy. The wavelength range from approximately 200 μm up to a few mm is often referred to as Submillimetre astronomy, reserving far infrared for wavelengths below 200 μm.
* Mid-infrared, from 30 THz to 120 THz (10–2.5 μm). Hot objects (black-body radiators) can radiate strongly in this range, and human skin at normal body temperature radiates strongly at the lower end of this region. This radiation is absorbed by molecular vibrations, where the different atoms in a molecule vibrate around their equilibrium positions. This range is sometimes called the &quot;fingerprint region&quot;, since the mid-infrared absorption spectrum of a compound is very specific for that compound.
* Near-infrared, from 120 THz to 400 THz (2,500–750 nm). Physical processes that are relevant for this range are similar to those for visible light. The highest frequencies in this region can be detected directly by some types of photographic film, and by many types of solid state image sensors for infrared photography and videography.

=== Visible light ===

Above infrared in frequency comes visible light. The Sun emits its peak power in the visible region, although integrating the entire emission power spectrum through all wavelengths shows that the Sun emits slightly more infrared than visible light. By definition, visible light is the part of the EM spectrum the human eye is the most sensitive to. Visible light (and near-infrared light) is typically absorbed and emitted by electrons in molecules and atoms that move from one energy level to another. This action allows the chemical mechanisms that underlie human vision and plant photosynthesis. The light that excites the human visual system is a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. A rainbow shows the optical (visible) part of the electromagnetic spectrum; infrared (if it could be seen) would be located just beyond the red side of the rainbow whilst ultraviolet would appear just beyond the opposite violet end.

Electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380 nm and 760 nm (400–790 terahertz) is detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, especially near infrared (longer than 760 nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 380 nm) are also sometimes referred to as light, especially when the visibility to humans is not relevant. White light is a combination of lights of different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Passing white light through a prism splits it up into the several colours of light observed in the visible spectrum between 400 nm and 780 nm.

If radiation having a frequency in the visible region of the EM spectrum reflects off an object, say, a bowl of fruit, and then strikes the eyes, this results in visual perception of the scene. The brain&#x27;s visual system processes the multitude of reflected frequencies into different shades and hues, and through this insufficiently understood psychophysical phenomenon, most people perceive a bowl of fruit.

At most wavelengths, however, the information carried by electromagnetic radiation is not directly detected by human senses. Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum, and technology can also manipulate a broad range of wavelengths. Optical fiber transmits light that, although not necessarily in the visible part of the spectrum (it is usually infrared), can carry information. The modulation is similar to that used with radio waves.

=== Ultraviolet radiation ===
Next in frequency comes ultraviolet (UV). In frequency (and thus energy), UV rays sit between the violet end of the visible spectrum and the X-ray range. The UV wavelength spectrum ranges from 399 nm to 10 nm and is divided into 3 sections: UVA, UVB, and UVC.

UV is the lowest energy range energetic enough to ionize atoms, separating electrons from them, and thus causing chemical reactions. UV, X-rays, and gamma rays are thus collectively called &quot;ionizing radiation&quot;; exposure to them can damage living tissue. UV can also cause substances to glow with visible light; this is called &quot;fluorescence&quot;. UV fluorescence is used by forensics to detect any evidence like blood and urine, that is produced by a crime scene. Also UV fluorescence is used to detect counterfeit money and IDs, as they are laced with material that can glow under UV.

At the middle range of UV, UV rays cannot ionize but can break chemical bonds, making molecules unusually reactive. Sunburn, for example, is caused by the disruptive effects of middle range UV radiation on skin cells, which is the main cause of skin cancer. UV rays in the middle range can irreparably damage the complex DNA molecules in the cells producing thymine dimers making it a very potent mutagen. Due to skin cancer caused by UV, the sunscreen industry was invented to combat UV damage. Mid UV wavelengths are called UVB and UVB lights such as germicidal lamps are used to kill germs and also to sterilize water.

The Sun emits UV radiation (about 10% of its total power), including extremely short wavelength UV that could potentially destroy most life on land (ocean water would provide some protection for life there). However, most of the Sun&#x27;s damaging UV wavelengths are absorbed by the atmosphere before they reach the surface. The higher energy (shortest wavelength) ranges of UV (called &quot;vacuum UV&quot;) are absorbed by nitrogen and, at longer wavelengths, by simple diatomic oxygen in the air. Most of the UV in the mid-range of energy is blocked by the ozone layer, which absorbs strongly in the important 200–315 nm range, the lower energy part of which is too long for ordinary dioxygen in air to absorb. This leaves less than 3% of sunlight at sea level in UV, with all of this remainder at the lower energies. The remainder is UV-A, along with some UV-B. The very lowest energy range of UV between 315 nm and visible light (called UV-A) is not blocked well by the atmosphere, but does not cause sunburn and does less biological damage. However, it is not harmless and does create oxygen radicals, mutations and skin damage.
=== X-rays ===

After UV come X-rays, which, like the upper ranges of UV are also ionizing. However, due to their higher energies, X-rays can also interact with matter by means of the Compton effect. Hard X-rays have shorter wavelengths than soft X-rays and as they can pass through many substances with little absorption, they can be used to &#x27;see through&#x27; objects with &#x27;thicknesses&#x27; less than that equivalent to a few meters of water. One notable use is diagnostic X-ray imaging in medicine (a process known as radiography). X-rays are useful as probes in high-energy physics. In astronomy, the accretion disks around neutron stars and black holes emit X-rays, enabling studies of these phenomena. X-rays are also emitted by stellar corona and are strongly emitted by some types of nebulae. However, X-ray telescopes must be placed outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to see astronomical X-rays, since the great depth of the atmosphere of Earth is opaque to X-rays (with areal density of 1000 g/cm2), equivalent to 10 meters thickness of water. This is an amount sufficient to block almost all astronomical X-rays (and also astronomical gamma rays—see below).

=== Gamma rays ===

After hard X-rays come gamma rays, which were discovered by Paul Ulrich Villard in 1900. These are the most energetic photons, having no defined lower limit to their wavelength. In astronomy they are valuable for studying high-energy objects or regions, however as with X-rays this can only be done with telescopes outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Gamma rays are used experimentally by physicists for their penetrating ability and are produced by a number of radioisotopes. They are used for irradiation of foods and seeds for sterilization, and in medicine they are occasionally used in radiation cancer therapy. More commonly, gamma rays are used for diagnostic imaging in nuclear medicine, an example being PET scans. The wavelength of gamma rays can be measured with high accuracy through the effects of Compton scattering.

<text>In artificial intelligence (AI), an expert system is a computer system emulating the decision-making ability of a human expert.
Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as if–then rules rather than through conventional procedural programming code. Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of AI software. They were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s, being then widely regarded as the future of AI — before the advent of successful artificial neural networks.
An expert system is divided into two subsystems: 1) a &quot;knowledge base&quot;, which represents facts and rules; and 2) an &quot;inference engine&quot;, which applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts, and can include explaining and debugging abilities.

== History ==
=== Early development ===
Soon after the dawn of modern computers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, researchers started realizing the immense potential these machines had for modern society. One of the first challenges was to make such machines able to “think” like humans – in particular, making these machines able to make important decisions the way humans do. The medical–healthcare field presented the tantalizing challenge of enabling these machines to make medical diagnostic decisions.

Thus, in the late 1950s, right after the information age had fully arrived, researchers started experimenting with the prospect of using computer technology to emulate human decision making. For example, biomedical researchers started creating computer-aided systems for diagnostic applications in medicine and biology. These early diagnostic systems used patients’ symptoms and laboratory test results as inputs to generate a diagnostic outcome.
These systems were often described as the early forms of expert systems. However, researchers realized that there were significant limits when using traditional methods such as flow charts,
 statistical pattern matching, or probability theory.

=== Formal introduction and later developments ===

This previous situation gradually led to the development of expert systems, which used knowledge-based approaches. These expert systems in medicine were the MYCIN expert system, the Internist-I expert system and later, in the middle of the 1980s, the CADUCEUS.

Expert systems were formally introduced around 1965 by the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led by Edward Feigenbaum, who is sometimes termed the &quot;father of expert systems&quot;; other key early contributors were Bruce Buchanan and Randall Davis. The Stanford researchers tried to identify domains where expertise was highly valued and complex, such as diagnosing infectious diseases (Mycin) and identifying unknown organic molecules (Dendral). The idea that &quot;intelligent systems derive their power from the knowledge they possess rather than from the specific formalisms and inference schemes they use&quot; – as Feigenbaum said – was at the time a significant step forward, since the past research had been focused on heuristic computational methods, culminating in attempts to develop very general-purpose problem solvers (foremostly the conjunct work of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon). Expert systems became some of the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.

Research on expert systems was also active in Europe. In the US, the focus tended to be on the use of production rule systems, first on systems hard coded on top of Lisp programming environments and then on expert system shells developed by vendors such as Intellicorp. In Europe, research focused more on systems and expert systems shells developed in Prolog. The advantage of Prolog systems was that they employed a form of rule-based programming that was based on formal logic.

One such early expert system shell based on Prolog was APES.
One of the first use cases of Prolog and APES was in the legal area namely, the encoding of a large portion of the British Nationality Act. Lance Elliot wrote: &quot;The British Nationality Act was passed in 1981 and shortly thereafter was used as a means of showcasing the efficacy of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and technologies, doing so to explore how the at-the-time newly enacted statutory law might be encoded into a computerized logic-based formalization. A now oft-cited research paper entitled “The British Nationality Act as a Logic Program” was published in 1986 and subsequently became a hallmark for subsequent work in AI and the law.&quot;

In the 1980s, expert systems proliferated. Universities offered expert system courses and two-thirds of the Fortune 500 companies applied the technology in daily business activities. Interest was international with the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project in Japan and increased research funding in Europe.

In 1981, the first IBM PC, with the PC DOS operating system, was introduced. The imbalance between the high affordability of the relatively powerful chips in the PC, compared to the much more expensive cost of processing power in the mainframes that dominated the corporate IT world at the time, created a new type of architecture for corporate computing, termed the client–server model. Calculations and reasoning could be performed at a fraction of the price of a mainframe using a PC. This model also enabled business units to bypass corporate IT departments and directly build their own applications. As a result, client-server had a tremendous impact on the expert systems market. Expert systems were already outliers in much of the business world, requiring new skills that many IT departments did not have and were not eager to develop. They were a natural fit for new PC-based shells that promised to put application development into the hands of end users and experts. Until then, the main development environment for expert systems had been high end Lisp machines from Xerox, Symbolics, and Texas Instruments. With the rise of the PC and client-server computing, vendors such as Intellicorp and Inference Corporation shifted their priorities to developing PC-based tools. Also, new vendors, often financed by venture capital (such as Aion Corporation, Neuron Data, Exsys, VP-Expert, and many others), started appearing regularly.

The first expert system to be used in a design capacity for a large-scale product was the Synthesis of Integral Design (SID) software program, developed in 1982. Written in Lisp, SID generated 93% of the VAX 9000 CPU logic gates. Input to the software was a set of rules created by several expert logic designers. SID expanded the rules and generated software logic synthesis routines many times the size of the rules themselves. Surprisingly, the combination of these rules resulted in an overall design that exceeded the capabilities of the experts themselves, and in many cases out-performed the human counterparts. While some rules contradicted others, top-level control parameters for speed and area provided the tie-breaker. The program was highly controversial but used nevertheless due to project budget constraints. It was terminated by logic designers after the VAX 9000 project completion.

During the years before the middle of the 1970s, the expectations of what expert systems can accomplish in many fields tended to be extremely optimistic. At the start of these early studies, researchers were hoping to develop entirely automatic (i.e., completely computerized) expert systems. The expectations of people of what computers can do were frequently too idealistic. This situation radically changed after Richard M. Karp published his breakthrough paper: “Reducibility among Combinatorial Problems” in the early 1970s. Thanks to Karp&#x27;s work, together with other scholars, like Hubert L. Dreyfus, it became clear that there are certain limits and possibilities when one designs computer algorithms. His findings describe what computers can do and what they cannot do. Many of the computational problems related to this type of expert systems have certain pragmatic limits. These findings laid down the groundwork that led to the next developments in the field.

In the 1990s and beyond, the term &quot;expert system&quot; and the idea of a standalone AI system mostly dropped from the IT lexicon. There are two interpretations of this. One is that &quot;expert systems failed&quot;: the IT world moved on because expert systems did not deliver on their over hyped promise. The other is the mirror opposite, that expert systems were simply victims of their success: as IT professionals grasped concepts such as rule engines, such tools migrated from being standalone tools for developing special purpose &quot;expert&quot; systems, to being one of many standard tools. Other researchers suggest that Expert Systems caused inter-company power struggles when the IT organization lost its exclusivity in software modifications to users or Knowledge Engineers.

In the first decade of the 2000s, there was a &quot;resurrection&quot; for the technology, while using the term &quot;rule-based systems&quot;, with significant success stories and adoption. Many of the leading major business application suite vendors (such as SAP, Siebel, and Oracle) integrated expert system abilities into their suite of products as a way to specify business logic. Rule engines are no longer simply for defining the rules an expert would use but for any type of complex, volatile, and critical business logic; they often go hand in hand with business process automation and integration environments.

=== Current approaches to expert systems ===
The limits of prior type of expert systems prompted researchers to develop new types of approaches. They have developed more efficient, flexible, and powerful methods to simulate the human decision-making process. Some of the approaches that researchers have developed are based on new methods of artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular in machine learning and data mining approaches with a feedback mechanism. Recurrent neural networks often take advantage of such mechanisms. Related is the discussion on the disadvantages section.

Modern systems can incorporate new knowledge more easily and thus update themselves easily. Such systems can generalize from existing knowledge better and deal with vast amounts of complex data. Related is the subject of big data here. Sometimes these type of expert systems are called &quot;intelligent systems.&quot;

More recently, it can be argued that expert systems have moved into the area of business rules and business rules management systems.

== Software architecture ==

An expert system is an example of a knowledge-based system. Expert systems were the first commercial systems to use a knowledge-based architecture. In general view, an expert system includes the following components: a knowledge base, an inference engine, an explanation facility, a knowledge acquisition facility, and a user interface.

The knowledge base represents facts about the world. In early expert systems such as Mycin and Dendral, these facts were represented mainly as flat assertions about variables. In later expert systems developed with commercial shells, the knowledge base took on more structure and used concepts from object-oriented programming. The world was represented as classes, subclasses, and instances and assertions were replaced by values of object instances. The rules worked by querying and asserting values of the objects.

The inference engine is an automated reasoning system that evaluates the current state of the knowledge-base, applies relevant rules, and then asserts new knowledge into the knowledge base. The inference engine may also include abilities for explanation, so that it can explain to a user the chain of reasoning used to arrive at a particular conclusion by tracing back over the firing of rules that resulted in the assertion.

There are mainly two modes for an inference engine: forward chaining and backward chaining. The different approaches are dictated by whether the inference engine is being driven by the antecedent (left hand side) or the consequent (right hand side) of the rule. In forward chaining an antecedent fires and asserts the consequent. For example, consider the following rule:

formula_1

A simple example of forward chaining would be to assert Man(Socrates) to the system and then trigger the inference engine. It would match R1 and assert Mortal(Socrates) into the knowledge base.

Backward chaining is a bit less straight forward. In backward chaining the system looks at possible conclusions and works backward to see if they might be true. So if the system was trying to determine if Mortal(Socrates) is true it would find R1 and query the knowledge base to see if Man(Socrates) is true. One of the early innovations of expert systems shells was to integrate inference engines with a user interface. This could be especially powerful with backward chaining. If the system needs to know a particular fact but does not, then it can simply generate an input screen and ask the user if the information is known. So in this example, it could use R1 to ask the user if Socrates was a Man and then use that new information accordingly.

The use of rules to explicitly represent knowledge also enabled explanation abilities. In the simple example above if the system had used R1 to assert that Socrates was Mortal and a user wished to understand why Socrates was mortal they could query the system and the system would look back at the rules which fired to cause the assertion and present those rules to the user as an explanation. In English, if the user asked &quot;Why is Socrates Mortal?&quot; the system would reply &quot;Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man&quot;. A significant area for research was the generation of explanations from the knowledge base in natural English rather than simply by showing the more formal but less intuitive rules.

As expert systems evolved, many new techniques were incorporated into various types of inference engines. Some of the most important of these were:
* Truth maintenance. These systems record the dependencies in a knowledge-base so that when facts are altered, dependent knowledge can be altered accordingly. For example, if the system learns that Socrates is no longer known to be a man it will revoke the assertion that Socrates is mortal.
* Hypothetical reasoning. In this, the knowledge base can be divided up into many possible views, a.k.a. worlds. This allows the inference engine to explore multiple possibilities in parallel. For example, the system may want to explore the consequences of both assertions, what will be true if Socrates is a Man and what will be true if he is not?
* Uncertainty systems. One of the first extensions of simply using rules to represent knowledge was also to associate a probability with each rule. So, not to assert that Socrates is mortal, but to assert Socrates &quot;may&quot; be mortal with some probability value. Simple probabilities were extended in some systems with sophisticated mechanisms for uncertain reasoning, such as fuzzy logic, and combination of probabilities.
* Ontology classification. With the addition of object classes to the knowledge base, a new type of reasoning was possible. Along with reasoning simply about object values, the system could also reason about object structures. In this simple example, Man can represent an object class and R1 can be redefined as a rule that defines the class of all men. These types of special purpose inference engines are termed classifiers. Although they were not highly used in expert systems, classifiers are very powerful for unstructured volatile domains, and are a key technology for the Internet and the emerging Semantic Web.

== Advantages ==
The goal of knowledge-based systems is to make the critical information required for the system to work explicit rather than implicit. In a traditional computer program, the logic is embedded in code that can typically only be reviewed by an IT specialist. With an expert system, the goal was to specify the rules in a format that was intuitive and easily understood, reviewed, and even edited by domain experts rather than IT experts. The benefits of this explicit knowledge representation were rapid development and ease of maintenance.

Ease of maintenance is the most obvious benefit. This was achieved in two ways. First, by removing the need to write conventional code, many of the normal problems that can be caused by even small changes to a system could be avoided with expert systems. Essentially, the logical flow of the program (at least at the highest level) was simply a given for the system, simply invoke the inference engine. This also was a reason for the second benefit: rapid prototyping. With an expert system shell it was possible to enter a few rules and have a prototype developed in days rather than the months or year typically associated with complex IT projects.

A claim for expert system shells that was often made was that they removed the need for trained programmers and that experts could develop systems themselves. In reality, this was seldom if ever true. While the rules for an expert system were more comprehensible than typical computer code, they still had a formal syntax where a misplaced comma or other character could cause havoc as with any other computer language. Also, as expert systems moved from prototypes in the lab to deployment in the business world, issues of integration and maintenance became far more critical. Inevitably demands to integrate with, and take advantage of, large legacy databases and systems arose. To accomplish this, integration required the same skills as any other type of system.

Summing up the benefits of using expert systems, the following can be highlighted:
# Increased availability and reliability: Expertise can be accessed on any computer hardware and the system always completes responses on time. 
# Multiple expertise: Several expert systems can be run simultaneously to solve a problem. and gain a higher level of expertise than a human expert. 
# Explanation: Expert systems always describe of how the problem was solved. 
# Fast response: The expert systems are fast and able to solve a problem in real-time. 
# Reduced cost: The cost of expertise for each user is significantly reduced.

== Disadvantages ==
The most common disadvantage cited for expert systems in the academic literature is the knowledge acquisition problem. Obtaining the time of domain experts for any software application is always difficult, but for expert systems it was especially difficult because the experts were by definition highly valued and in constant demand by the organization. As a result of this problem, a great deal of research in the later years of expert systems was focused on tools for knowledge acquisition, to help automate the process of designing, debugging, and maintaining rules defined by experts. However, when looking at the life-cycle of expert systems in actual use, other problems – essentially the same problems as those of any other large system – seem at least as critical as knowledge acquisition: integration, access to large databases, and performance.

Performance could be especially problematic because early expert systems were built using tools (such as earlier Lisp versions) that interpreted code expressions without first compiling them. This provided a powerful development environment, but with the drawback that it was virtually impossible to match the efficiency of the fastest compiled languages (such as C). System and database integration were difficult for early expert systems because the tools were mostly in languages and platforms that were neither familiar to nor welcome in most corporate IT environments – programming languages such as Lisp and Prolog, and hardware platforms such as Lisp machines and personal computers. As a result, much effort in the later stages of expert system tool development was focused on integrating with legacy environments such as COBOL and large database systems, and on porting to more standard platforms. These issues were resolved mainly by the client–server paradigm shift, as PCs were gradually accepted in the IT environment as a legitimate platform for serious business system development and as affordable minicomputer servers provided the processing power needed for AI applications.

Another major challenge of expert systems emerges when the size of the knowledge base increases. This causes the processing complexity to increase. For instance, when an expert system with 100 million rules was envisioned as the ultimate expert system, it became obvious that such system would be too complex and it would face too many computational problems. An inference engine would have to be able to process huge numbers of rules to reach a decision.

How to verify that decision rules are consistent with each other is also a challenge when there are too many rules. Usually such problem leads to a satisfiability (SAT) formulation. This is a well-known NP-complete problem Boolean satisfiability problem. If we assume only binary variables, say n of them, and then the corresponding search space is of size 2formula_2. Thus, the search space can grow exponentially.

There are also questions on how to prioritize the use of the rules to operate more efficiently, or how to resolve ambiguities (for instance, if there are too many else-if sub-structures within one rule) and so on.

Other problems are related to the overfitting and overgeneralization effects when using known facts and trying to generalize to other cases not described explicitly in the knowledge base. Such problems exist with methods that employ machine learning approaches too.

Another problem related to the knowledge base is how to make updates of its knowledge quickly and effectively. Also how to add a new piece of knowledge (i.e., where to add it among many rules) is challenging. Modern approaches that rely on machine learning methods are easier in this regard.

Because of the above challenges, it became clear that new approaches to AI were required instead of rule-based technologies. These new approaches are based on the use of machine learning techniques, along with the use of feedback mechanisms.

The key challenges that expert systems in medicine (if one considers computer-aided diagnostic systems as modern expert systems), and perhaps in other application domains, include issues related to aspects such as: big data, existing regulations, healthcare practice, various algorithmic issues, and system assessment.

Finally, the following disadvantages of using expert systems can be summarized:
# Expert systems have superficial knowledge, and a simple task can potentially become computationally expensive. 
# Expert systems require knowledge engineers to input the data, data acquisition is very hard. 
# The expert system may choose the most inappropriate method for solving a particular problem. 
# Problems of ethics in the use of any form of AI are very relevant at present. 
# It is a closed world with specific knowledge, in which there is no deep perception of concepts and their interrelationships until an expert provides them.

== Applications ==
Hayes-Roth divides expert systems applications into 10 categories illustrated in the following table. The example applications were not in the original Hayes-Roth table, and some of them arose well afterward. Any application that is not footnoted is described in the Hayes-Roth book. Also, while these categories provide an intuitive framework to describe the space of expert systems applications, they are not rigid categories, and in some cases an application may show traits of more than one category.

Hearsay was an early attempt at solving voice recognition through an expert systems approach. For the most part this category of expert systems was not all that successful. Hearsay and all interpretation systems are essentially pattern recognition systems—looking for patterns in noisy data. In the case of Hearsay recognizing phonemes in an audio stream. Other early examples were analyzing sonar data to detect Russian submarines. These kinds of systems proved much more amenable to a neural network AI solution than a rule-based approach.

CADUCEUS and MYCIN were medical diagnosis systems. The user describes their symptoms to the computer as they would to a doctor and the computer returns a medical diagnosis.

Dendral was a tool to study hypothesis formation in the identification of organic molecules. The general problem it solved—designing a solution given a set of constraints—was one of the most successful areas for early expert systems applied to business domains such as salespeople configuring Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX computers and mortgage loan application development.

SMH.PAL is an expert system for the assessment of students with multiple disabilities.

GARVAN-ES1 was a medical expert system, developed at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, that provided automated clinical diagnostic comments on endocrine reports from a pathology laboratory. It was one of the first medical expert systems to go into routine clinical use internationally and the first expert system to be used for diagnosis daily in Australia. The system was written in &quot;C&quot; and ran on a PDP-11 in 64K of memory. It had 661 rules that were compiled; not interpreted.

Mistral is an expert system to monitor dam safety, developed in the 1990s by Ismes (Italy). It gets data from an automatic monitoring system and performs a diagnosis of the state of the dam. Its first copy, installed in 1992 on the Ridracoli Dam (Italy), is still operational 24/7/365. It has been installed on several dams in Italy and abroad (e.g., Itaipu Dam in Brazil), and on landslide sites under the name of Eydenet, and on monuments under the name of Kaleidos. Mistral is a registered trade mark of CESI.

<doc id="10139" wikidata="Q374210" url="?curid=10139" title="Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford">
<text>Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (; 12 April 155024 June 1604), was an English peer and courtier of the Elizabethan era. Oxford was heir to the second oldest earldom in the kingdom, a court favourite for a time, a sought-after patron of the arts, and noted by his contemporaries as a lyric poet and court playwright, but his volatile temperament precluded him from attaining any courtly or governmental responsibility and contributed to the dissipation of his estate.

Edward de Vere was the only son of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and Margery Golding. After the death of his father in 1562, he became a ward of Queen Elizabeth I and was sent to live in the household of her principal advisor, Sir William Cecil. He married Cecil&#x27;s daughter, Anne, with whom he had five children. Oxford was estranged from her for five years and refused to acknowledge he was the father of their first child.

A champion jouster, Oxford travelled widely throughout France and the many states of Italy. He was among the first to compose love poetry at the Elizabethan court and was praised as a playwright, though none of the plays known as his survive. A stream of dedications praised Oxford for his generous patronage of literary, religious, musical, and medical works, and he patronised both adult and boy acting companies, as well as musicians, tumblers, acrobats and performing animals.

He fell out of favour with the Queen in the early 1580s and was exiled from court and briefly imprisoned in the Tower of London when his mistress, Anne Vavasour, one of Elizabeth&#x27;s maids of honour, gave birth to his son in the palace. Vavasour was also incarcerated and the affair instigated violent street brawls between Oxford and her kinsmen. He was reconciled to the Queen in May 1583 at Theobalds, but all opportunities for advancement had been lost. In 1586, the Queen granted Oxford £1,000 annually (£274,359 in 2024) to relieve the financial distress caused by his extravagance and the sale of his income-producing lands for ready money. After the death of his first wife, Anne Cecil, Oxford married Elizabeth Trentham, one of the Queen&#x27;s maids of honour, with whom he had an heir, Henry de Vere, Viscount Bulbeck (later 18th Earl of Oxford). Oxford died in 1604, having spent the entirety of his inherited estates.

Since the 1920s, Oxford has been among the most prominent alternative candidates proposed for the authorship of Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

==Family and childhood==

Edward de Vere was born heir to the second-oldest extant earldom in England at the de Vere ancestral home, Hedingham Castle, in Essex, northeast of London. He was the only son of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and his second wife, Margery Golding and was probably named to honour Edward VI, from whom he received a gilded christening cup. He had an older half-sister, Katherine, the child of his father&#x27;s first marriage to Dorothy Neville, and a younger sister, Mary de Vere. Both his parents had established court connections: the 16th Earl accompanying Princess Elizabeth from her house arrest at Hatfield to the throne, and the countess being appointed a maid of honour in 1559.

Before his father&#x27;s death, Edward de Vere was styled &quot;Viscount Bulbeck&quot;, or &quot;Bolebec&quot;, and was raised in the English reformed faith. Like many children of the nobility, he was raised by surrogate parents, in his case in the household of Sir Thomas Smith. At eight he entered Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, as an &quot;impubes&quot;, or immature fellow-commoner, later transferring to St John&#x27;s. Thomas Fowle, a former fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, was paid £10 annually as de Vere&#x27;s tutor.

His father died on 3 August 1562, shortly after making his will. Because he held lands from the Crown by knight service, his son became a royal ward of the Queen and was placed in the household of Sir William Cecil, her secretary of state and chief advisor. At 12, de Vere had become the 17th Earl of Oxford, Lord Great Chamberlain of England, and heir to an estate whose annual income, though assessed at approximately £2,500, may have run as high as £3,500 (£ as of 2025).

==Wardship==

While living at the Cecil House, Oxford&#x27;s daily studies consisted of dancing instruction, French, Latin, cosmography, writing exercises, drawing, and common prayers. During his first year at Cecil House, he was briefly tutored by Laurence Nowell, the antiquarian and Anglo-Saxon scholar. In a letter to Cecil, Nowell explains: &quot;I clearly see that my work for the Earl of Oxford cannot be much longer required&quot;, and his departure after eight months has been interpreted as either a sign of the thirteen-year-old Oxford&#x27;s intractability as a pupil, or an indication that his precocity surpassed Nowell&#x27;s ability to instruct him. In May 1564 Arthur Golding, in his dedication to his &quot;Th&#x27; Abridgement of the Histories of Trogus Pompeius&quot;, attributed to his young nephew an interest in ancient history and contemporary events.

In 1563, Oxford&#x27;s older half-sister, Katherine, then Lady Windsor, challenged the legitimacy of the marriage of de Vere&#x27;s parents in the Ecclesiastical court. His uncle Golding argued that the Archbishop of Canterbury should halt the proceedings since a proceeding against a ward of the Queen could not be brought without prior licence from the Court of Wards and Liveries.

Some time before October 1563, Oxford&#x27;s mother married secondly Charles Tyrrell, a Gentleman Pensioner. In May 1565 she wrote to Cecil, urging that the money from family properties set aside by Oxford&#x27;s father&#x27;s will for his use during his minority should be entrusted to herself and other family friends, to protect it and to ensure that Oxford would be able to meet the expenses of furnishing his household and suing his livery when he reached his majority; this last would end his wardship, through cancelling his debt with the Court of Wards, and convey to him the powers attached to his titles. There is no evidence that Cecil ever replied to her request. She died three years later, and was buried beside her first husband at Earls Colne. Oxford&#x27;s stepfather, Charles Tyrrell, died in March 1570.

In August 1564 Oxford was among 17 noblemen, knights, and esquires in the Queen&#x27;s entourage who were awarded the honorary degree of Master of Arts by the University of Cambridge, and he was awarded another by the University of Oxford on a Royal progress in 1566. His future father-in-law, William Cecil, also received honorary degrees of Master of Arts on the same progresses. There is no evidence that Oxford ever received a Bachelor of Arts degree. In February 1567 he was admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn to study law.

On 23 July 1567, while practising fencing in the backyard of Cecil House in the Strand, the seventeen-year-old Oxford killed Thomas Brincknell, an under-cook in the Cecil household. At the coroner&#x27;s inquest the next day, the jury, which included Oxford&#x27;s servant, and Cecil&#x27;s protégé, the future historian Raphael Holinshed, found that Brincknell, drunk, had deliberately committed suicide by running onto Oxford&#x27;s blade. As a suicide, he was not buried in consecrated ground, and all his worldly possessions were confiscated, leaving his pregnant wife destitute. She delivered a stillborn child shortly after Brinknell&#x27;s death. Cecil later wrote that he attempted to have the jury find that Oxford had acted in self-defence.

Records of books purchased for Oxford in 1569 attest to his continued interest in history, as well as literature and philosophy. Among them were editions of a gilt Geneva Bible, Chaucer, Plutarch, two books in Italian, and folio editions of Cicero and Plato. In the same year Thomas Underdown dedicated his translation of the &quot;Æthiopian History&quot; of Heliodorus to Oxford, praising his &#x27;haughty courage&#x27;, &#x27;great skill&#x27; and &#x27;sufficiency of learning&#x27;. In the winter of 1570, Oxford made the acquaintance of the mathematician and astrologer John Dee and became interested in occultism, studying magic and conjuring.

In 1569, Oxford received his first vote for membership in the Order of the Garter, but never attained the honour in spite of his high rank and office. In November of that year, Oxford petitioned Cecil for a foreign military posting. Although the Roman Catholic Revolt of the Northern Earls had broken out that year, Elizabeth refused to grant the request. Cecil eventually obtained a position for Oxford under the Earl of Sussex in a Scottish campaign the following spring. He and Sussex became staunch mutual supporters at court.

==Coming of age==
On 12 April 1571, Oxford attained his majority and took his seat in the House of Lords. Great expectations attended his coming of age; Sir George Buck recalled predictions that &#x27;he was much more like ... to acquire a new erldome then to wast &amp; lose an old erldom&#x27;, a prophecy that was never fulfilled.

Although formal certification of his freedom from Burghley&#x27;s control was deferred until May 1572, Oxford was finally granted the income of £666 which his father had intended him to have earlier, but properties set aside to pay his father&#x27;s debts would not come his way for another decade. During his minority as the Queen&#x27;s ward, one-third of his estate had already reverted to the Crown, much of which Elizabeth had long since settled on Robert Dudley. Elizabeth demanded a further payment of £3,000 for overseeing the wardship and a further £4,000 for suing his livery. Oxford pledged double the amount if he failed to pay when it fell due, effectively risking a total obligation of £21,000.

By 1571, Oxford was a court favourite of Elizabeth&#x27;s. In May, he participated in the three-day tilt, tourney and barrier at which, although he did not win, he was given chief honours in celebration of the attainment of his majority, his prowess winning admiring comments from spectators. In August, Oxford attended Paul de Foix, who had come to England to negotiate a marriage between the Protestant Queen Elizabeth and the Catholic Prince François de France, duc d&#x27;Anjou, the youngest brother of King Henry III of France of the House of Valois-Angoulême. The marriage had been proposed in 1572 as part of the negotiations between England and France to break the power of Spain. In November 1579 the husband of Oxford&#x27;s first cousin Anne Vere, John Stubbs, and William Page had their right hand publicly cut off for the pamphlet critical of the Queen&#x27;s proposed marriage to Prince François and therefore judged seditious.

Oxford&#x27;s published poetry dates from this period and, along with Edward Dyer he was one of the first courtiers to introduce vernacular verse to the court.

==Marriage==

In 1562, the 16th Earl of Oxford had contracted with Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, for his son Edward to marry one of Huntingdon&#x27;s sisters; when he reached the age of eighteen, he was to choose either Elizabeth or Mary Hastings. However, after the death of the 16th Earl, the indenture was allowed to lapse. Elizabeth Hastings later married Edward Somerset, while Mary Hastings died unmarried.

In the summer of 1571, Oxford declared an interest in Cecil&#x27;s 14 year-old daughter, Anne, and received the queen&#x27;s consent to the marriage. Anne had been pledged to Philip Sidney two years earlier, but after a year of negotiations Sidney&#x27;s father, Sir Henry, was declining in the Queen&#x27;s favour and Cecil suspected financial difficulties. In addition, Cecil had been elevated to the peerage as Lord Burghley in February 1571, thus elevating his daughter&#x27;s rank, so the negotiations were cancelled. Cecil was displeased with the arrangement, given his daughter&#x27;s age compared to Oxford&#x27;s, and had entertained the idea of marrying her to the Earl of Rutland instead. The marriage was deferred until Anne was fifteen and finally took place at the Palace of Whitehall on 16 December 1571, in a triple wedding with that of Lady Elizabeth Hastings and Edward Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley and bride, Mary Howard, with the Queen in attendance. 

The tying of two young English noblemen of great fortune into Protestant families was not lost on Elizabeth&#x27;s Catholic enemies. Burghley gave Oxford for his daughter&#x27;s dowry land worth £800, and a cash settlement of £3,000. This amount was equal to Oxford&#x27;s livery fees and was probably intended to be used as such, but the money vanished without a trace.

Oxford assigned Anne a jointure of some £669, but even though he was of age and a married man, he was still not in possession of his inheritance. After finally paying the Crown the £4,000 it demanded for his livery, he was finally licensed to enter on his lands in May 1572. He was entitled to yearly revenues from his estates and the office of Lord Great Chamberlain of approximately £2,250, but he was not entitled to the income from his mother&#x27;s jointure until after her death, nor to the income from certain estates set aside until 1583 to pay his father&#x27;s debts. In addition, the fines assessed against Oxford in the Court of Wards for his wardship, marriage, and livery already totalled some £3,306. To guarantee payment, he entered into bonds to the Court totalling £11,000, and two further private bonds for £6,000 apiece.

In 1572, Oxford&#x27;s first cousin and closest relative, the Duke of Norfolk, was found guilty of a Catholic conspiracy against Elizabeth and was executed for treason. Oxford had earlier petitioned both the Queen and Burghley on the condemned Norfolk&#x27;s behalf, to no avail, and it was claimed in a &quot;murky petition from an unidentified woman&quot; that he had plotted to provide a ship to assist his cousin&#x27;s escape attempt to Spain.

The following summer, Oxford planned to travel to Ireland; at this point, his debts were estimated at a minimum of £6,000.

In the summer of 1574, Elizabeth admonished Oxford &quot;for his unthriftyness&quot;, and on 1 July he bolted to the continent without permission, travelling to Calais with Lord Edward Seymour, and then to Flanders, &quot;carrying a great sum of money with him&quot;. Coming as it did during a time of expected hostilities with Spain, Mary, Queen of Scots, interpreted his flight as an indication of his Catholic sympathies, as did the Catholic rebels then living on the continent. Burghley, however, assured the queen that Oxford was loyal, and she sent two Gentlemen Pensioners to summon him back, under threat of heavy penalties. Oxford returned to England by the end of the month and was in London on the 28th. His request for a place on the Privy Council was rejected, but the queen&#x27;s anger was abated and she promised him a licence to travel to Paris, Germany, and Italy on his pledge of good behaviour.

==Foreign travel==
In January 1575 Elizabeth issued a licence to Oxford to travel, and provided him with letters of introduction to foreign monarchs. Prior to his departure, he entered into two indentures. In the first contract, he sold his manors in Cornwall, Staffordshire and Wiltshire to three trustees for £6,000. 
In the second, to prevent his estates passing by default to his sister Mary in the event of his dying abroad without heirs, he entailed the lands of the earldom on his first cousin, Hugh Vere. The indenture also provided for payment of debts amounting to £9,096, £3,457 of which was still owed to the Queen as expenses for his wardship.

Oxford left England in the first week of February 1575, and a month later was presented to the King and Queen of France. News that his new wife, Anne, was pregnant had reached him in Paris, and he sent her many extravagant presents in the coming months. But somewhere along the way, his mind was poisoned against Anne and the Cecils, and he became convinced that the expected child was not his. The elder Cecils loudly voiced their outrage at the rumours, which probably worsened the situation. In mid-March he travelled to Strasbourg, and then made his way to Venice, via Milan. Although his daughter, Elizabeth, was born at the beginning of July, for unexplained reasons Oxford did not learn of her birth until late September.

Oxford remained in Italy for a year, during which he was evidently captivated by Italian fashions in clothing, jewellery and cosmetics. He is recorded by John Stow as having introduced various Italian luxury items to the English court which immediately became fashionable, such as embroidered or trimmed scented gloves. Elizabeth had a pair of decorated gloves scented with perfume that for many years was known as the &quot;Earl of Oxford&#x27;s perfume&quot;. Lacking evidence, his interest in higher Italian culture, its literature, music and visual art, is less sure. His only recorded judgement about the country itself was unenthusiastic. In a letter to Burghley he wrote, &quot;.&quot;

In January 1576 Oxford wrote to Lord Burghley from Siena about complaints that had reached him about his creditors&#x27; demands, which included the Queen and his sister, and directing that more of his land be sold to pay them. He left Venice in March, intending to return home by way of Lyons and Paris; although one later report has him as far south as Palermo in Sicily. At this point the Italian financier Benedict Spinola had lent Oxford over £4,000 for his 15-month-long continental tour, while in England over a hundred tradesmen were seeking settlement of debts totalling thousands of pounds.

On Oxford&#x27;s return across the Channel in April 1576, his ship was seized by pirates from Flushing, who took his possessions, stripped him to his shirt, and might have murdered him had not one of them recognized him.

==Quarrels, plots and scandals==
Oxford had sold his inherited lands in Cornwall, Staffordshire, and Wiltshire prior to his continental tour. On his return to England in 1576 he sold his manors in Devonshire; by the end of 1578 he had sold at least seven more.

Also upon his return, Oxford refused to live with his wife and took rooms at Charing Cross. Aside from the unspoken suspicion that Elizabeth was not his child, Burghley&#x27;s papers reveal a flood of bitter complaints by Oxford against the Cecil family. Upon the Queen&#x27;s request, he allowed his wife to attend the Queen at court, but only when he was not present, and he insisted that she not attempt to speak to him. He also stipulated that Burghley must make no further appeals to him on Anne&#x27;s behalf. He was estranged from Anne for five years.
In February 1577 it was rumoured that Oxford&#x27;s sister Mary would marry Lord Gerald Fitzgerald (1559–1580), but by 2 July her name was linked with that of Peregrine Bertie, later Lord Willoughby d&#x27;Eresby. Bertie&#x27;s mother, the Duchess of Suffolk, wrote to Lord Burghley that &quot;my wise son has gone very far with my Lady Mary Vere, I fear too far to turn&quot;. Both the Duchess and her husband Richard Bertie first opposed the marriage, and the Queen initially withheld her consent. Oxford&#x27;s own opposition to the match was so vehement that for some time Mary&#x27;s prospective husband feared for his life. On 15 December the Duchess of Suffolk wrote to Burghley describing a plan she and Mary had devised to arrange a meeting between Oxford and his daughter. Whether the scheme came to fruition is unknown. Mary and Bertie were married sometime before March of the following year.

In 1577 Oxford invested £25 in the second of Martin Frobisher&#x27;s expeditions in search of the Northwest Passage. In July 1577, he asked the Crown for the grant of Castle Rising, which had been forfeited to the Crown due to his cousin Norfolk&#x27;s attainder in 1572. As soon as it was granted to him, he sold it, along with two other manors, and sank some £3,000 into Frobisher&#x27;s third expedition. The &#x27;gold&#x27; ore brought back turned out to be worthless, and Oxford lost the entire investment.

In the summer of 1578, Oxford attended the Queen&#x27;s progress through East Anglia. The royal party stayed at Lord Henry Howard&#x27;s residence at Audley End. A contretemps occurred during the progress in mid-August when the Queen twice asked Oxford to dance before the French ambassadors, who were in England to negotiate a marriage between the 46-year-old English queen and the younger brother of Henri III of France, the 24 year-old Duke of Anjou. Oxford refused, on the grounds that he &quot;would not give pleasure to Frenchmen&quot;.

In April 1578, the Spanish ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza, had written to King Philip II of Spain that it had been proposed that if Anjou were to travel to England to negotiate his marriage to the Queen, Oxford, Surrey, and Windsor should be hostages for his safe return. Anjou himself did not arrive in England until the end of August, but his ambassadors were already in England. Oxford was sympathetic to the proposed marriage; Leicester and his nephew Philip Sidney were adamantly opposed to it. This antagonism may have triggered the famous quarrel between Oxford and Sidney on the tennis court at Whitehall. It is not entirely clear who was playing on the court when the fight erupted; what is undisputed is that Oxford called Sidney a &#x27;puppy&#x27;, while Sidney responded that &quot;all the world knows puppies are gotten by dogs, and children by men&quot;. The French ambassadors, whose private galleries overlooked the tennis court, were witness to the display. Whether it was Sidney who next challenged Oxford to a duel or the other way around, the matter was not taken further, and the Queen personally took Sidney to task for not recognizing the difference between his status and Oxford&#x27;s. Christopher Hatton and Sidney&#x27;s friend Hubert Languet also tried to dissuade Sidney from pursuing the matter, and it was eventually dropped. The specific cause is not known, but in January 1580 Oxford wrote and challenged Sidney; by the end of the month Oxford was confined by the Queen to his chambers, and was not released until early February.

Oxford openly quarrelled with the Earl of Leicester at about this time; he was confined to his chamber at Greenwich for some time &#x27;about the libelling between him and my Lord of Leicester&#x27;. In the summer of 1580, Gabriel Harvey, apparently motivated by a desire to ingratiate himself with Leicester, satirized Oxford&#x27;s love for things Italian in verses entitled &quot;Speculum Tuscanismi&quot; and in &quot;Three Proper and Witty Familiar Letters&quot;.

Although details are unclear, there is evidence that in 1577 Oxford attempted to leave England to see service in the French Wars of Religion on the side of King Henry III. Like many members of older established aristocratic families in England, he inclined to Roman Catholicism; and after his return from Italy, he was reported to have embraced the religion, perhaps after a distant kinsman, Charles Arundell, introduced him to a seminary priest named Richard Stephens. But just as quickly, by late in 1580 he had denounced a group of Catholics, among them Arundell, Francis Southwell, and Henry Howard, for treasonous activities and asking the Queen&#x27;s mercy for his own, now repudiated, Catholicism. Elizabeth characteristically delayed in acting on the matter and Oxford was detained under house arrest for a short time.
Leicester is credited by author Alan H. Nelson with having &quot;dislodged Oxford from the pro-French group&quot;, i.e., the group at court which favoured Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage to the Duke of Anjou. The Spanish ambassador, Mendoza, was also of the view that Leicester was behind Oxford&#x27;s informing on his fellow Catholics in an attempt to prevent the French marriage. Peck concurs, stating that Leicester was &quot;intent upon rendering Sussex&#x27;s allies politically useless&quot;.

The Privy Council ordered the arrest of both Howard and Arundel; Oxford immediately met secretly with Arundell to convince him to support his allegations against Howard and Southwell, offering him money and a pardon from the Queen. Arundell refused this offer, and he and Howard initially sought asylum with Mendoza. Only after being assured that they would be placed under house arrest in the home of a Privy Councillor, did the pair give themselves up. During the first weeks after their arrest they pursued a threefold strategy: they would admit to minor crimes, attempt to prove Oxford a liar by his offers of money to testify to his accusations, and try to demonstrate that their accuser posed the real danger to the Crown. Their allegations against Oxford included atheism, lying, heresy, disobedience to the crown, treason, murder for hire, sexual perversion, habitual drunkenness, vowing to murder various courtiers, and criticizing the Queen for doing &quot;everything with the worst grace that ever woman did.&quot;

Most seriously, Howard and Arundell charged Oxford with serial child rape, claiming he&#x27;d abused &quot;so many boyes it must nedes come out.&quot; Detailed testimony from nearly a dozen victims and witnesses substantiated the charge and included names, dates, and places. Two of the six boys named had sought help from adults after Oxford raped them violently and denied them medical care. A young cook named Powers reported being subjected to multiple assaults at Hampton Court in the winter of 1577–78, at Whitehall, and in Oxford&#x27;s Broad Street home. Orazio Coquo&#x27;s account is well documented outside the Howard-Arundel report. In testimony to the Venetian Inquisition dated 27 August 1577, Coquo explained that he was singing in the choir at Venice&#x27;s Santa Maria Formosa on 1 March 1576 when Oxford invited him to work in England as his page. Then 15, the boy sought his parents&#x27; advice and departed Venice just 4 days later. Coquo arrived with Oxford in Dover on 20 April 1576 and fled 11 months later on 20 March 1577, aided by a Milanese merchant who gave him 25 ducats for the journey: He &quot;told me that I would be corrupted if I remained,&quot; Orazio testified, &quot;and he didn&#x27;t want me to stay there any longer.&quot; When asked whether he sought Oxford&#x27;s permission before leaving, the boy replied, &quot;Sirs, no, because he would not have allowed me to leave.&quot;

Arundell and Howard cleared themselves of Oxford&#x27;s accusations, although Howard remained under house arrest into August, while Arundell was not freed until October or November. None of the three was ever indicted or tried. Neither Arundell nor Howard ever returned to court favour, and after the Throckmorton Plot of 1583 in support of Mary, Queen of Scots, Arundell fled to Paris with Thomas, Lord Paget, the elder brother of the conspirator Charles Paget. In the meantime, Oxford won a tournament at Westminster on 22 January. His page&#x27;s speech at the tournament, describing Oxford&#x27;s appearance as the Knight of the Tree of the Sun, was published in 1592 in a pamphlet entitled &quot;Plato, Axiochus&quot;.

On 14 April 1589 Oxford was among the peers who found Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, the eldest son and heir of Oxford&#x27;s cousin, Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, guilty of treason; Arundel later died in prison. Oxford later insisted that &quot;the Howards were the most treacherous race under heaven&quot; and that &quot;my Lord Howard [was] the worst villain that lived in this earth.&quot;

During the early 1580s, it is likely that the Earl of Oxford lived mainly at one of his Essex country houses, Wivenhoe, which was sold in 1584. In June 1580 he purchased a tenement and seven acres of land near Aldgate in London from the Italian merchant Benedict Spinola for £2,500. The property, located in the parish of St Botolphs, was known as the Great Garden of Christchurch and had formerly belonged to Magdalene College, Cambridge. He also purchased a London residence, a mansion in Bishopsgate known as Fisher&#x27;s Folly. According to Henry Howard, Oxford paid a large sum for the property and renovations to it.
On 23 March 1581 Sir Francis Walsingham advised the Earl of Huntingdon that two days earlier Anne Vavasour, one of the Queen&#x27;s maids of honour, had given birth to a son, and that &quot;the Earl of Oxford is avowed to be the father, who hath withdrawn himself with intent, as it is thought, to pass the seas&quot;. Oxford was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London, as was Anne and her infant, who would later be known as Sir Edward Vere. Burghley interceded for Oxford, and he was released from the Tower on 8 June, but he remained under house arrest until some time in July.

While Oxford was under house arrest in May, Thomas Stocker dedicated to him his &quot;Divers Sermons of Master John Calvin&quot;, stating in the dedication that he had been &quot;brought up in your Lordship&#x27;s father&#x27;s house&quot;.

Oxford was still under house arrest in mid-July, but took part in an Accession Day tournament at Whitehall on 17 November 1581. He was then banished from court until June 1583. He appealed to Burghley to intervene with the Queen on his behalf, but his father-in-law repeatedly put the matter in the hands of Sir Christopher Hatton.

At Christmas 1581, Oxford was reconciled with his wife, Anne, but his affair with Anne Vavasour continued to have repercussions. In March 1582 there was a skirmish in the streets of London between Oxford and Anne&#x27;s uncle, Sir Thomas Knyvet. Oxford was wounded, and his servant killed; reports conflict as to whether Knyvet was also injured. There was another fray between Knyvet&#x27;s and Oxford&#x27;s retinues on 18 June, and a third six days later, when it was reported that Knyvet had &quot;slain a man of the Earl of Oxford&#x27;s in fight&quot;. In a letter to Burghley three years later Oxford offered to attend his father-in-law at his house &quot;as well as a lame man might&quot;; it is possible his lameness was a result of injuries from that encounter. On 19 January 1585 Anne Vavasour&#x27;s brother Thomas sent Oxford a written challenge; it appears to have been ignored.

Meanwhile, the street brawling between factions continued. Another of Oxford&#x27;s men was killed in January, and in March Burghley wrote to Sir Christopher Hatton about the death of one of Knyvet&#x27;s men, thanking Hatton for his efforts &quot;to bring some good end to these troublesome matters betwixt my Lord Oxford and Mr Thomas Knyvet&quot;.

On 6 May 1583, eighteen months after their reconciliation, Edward and Anne&#x27;s only son was born, but died the same day. The infant was buried at Castle Hedingham three days later.

After intervention by Burghley and Sir Walter Raleigh, Oxford was reconciled to the Queen, and his two-year exile from court ended at the end of May on condition of his guarantee of good behaviour. However, he never regained his position as a courtier of the first magnitude.

==Theatrical enterprises==
The previous Earl of Oxford had maintained a company of players known as Oxford&#x27;s Men, which was discontinued by the 17th Earl two years after his father&#x27;s death. Beginning in 1580, Oxford patronised both adult and boy companies and a company of musicians, and also sponsored performances by tumblers, acrobats, and performing animals. The new Oxford&#x27;s Men toured the provinces between 1580 and 1587. Sometime after November 1583, Oxford bought a sublease of the premises used by the boy companies in the Blackfriars, and then gave it to his secretary, the writer John Lyly. Lyly installed Henry Evans, a Welsh scrivener and theatrical affectionado, as the manager of the new company of Oxford&#x27;s Boys, composed of the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul&#x27;s, and turned his talents to playwriting until the end of June 1584, when the original playhouse lease was voided by its owner. In 1584–1585, &quot;the Earl of Oxford&#x27;s musicians&quot; received payments for performances in the cities of Oxford and Barnstaple. Oxford&#x27;s Men (also known as Oxford&#x27;s Players) stayed active until 1602.

==Royal annuity==
On 6 April 1584, Oxford&#x27;s daughter Bridget was born, and two works were dedicated to him, Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Gwydonius; The Card of Fancy&quot;, and John Southern&#x27;s &quot;Pandora&quot;. Verses in the latter work mention Oxford&#x27;s knowledge of astronomy, history, languages, and music.

Oxford&#x27;s financial situation was steadily deteriorating. At this point, he had sold almost all his inherited lands, which cut him off from what had been his principal source of income. Moreover, because the properties were security for his unpaid debt to the Queen in the Court of Wards, he had had to enter into a bond with the purchaser, guaranteeing that he would indemnify them if the Queen were to make a claim against the lands to collect on the debt. To avoid this eventuality, the purchasers of his estates agreed to pay Oxford&#x27;s debt to the Court of Wards in instalments.

In 1585 negotiations were underway for King James VI of Scotland to come to England to discuss the release of his mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, and in March Oxford was to be sent to Scotland as one of the hostages for James&#x27;s safety.

In 1586, Oxford petitioned the Queen for an annuity to relieve his distressed financial situation. His father-in-law made him several large loans, and Elizabeth granted him a £1,000 annuity, to be continued at her pleasure or until he could be provided for otherwise. This annuity was later continued by James I. De Vere&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth, petitioned James I for an annuity of £250 on behalf of her 11-year-old son, Henry, to continue the £1,000 annuity granted to de Vere. Henry was ultimately awarded a £200 annuity for life. James I would continue the grant after her death.

Another daughter, Susan, was born on 26 May 1587. On 12 September, another daughter, Frances, is recorded as buried at Edmonton. Her birthdate is unknown; presumably, she was between one and three years of age.

In July Elizabeth granted the Earl property which had been seized from Edward Jones, who had been executed for his role in the Babington Plot. In order to protect the land from Oxford&#x27;s creditors, the grant was made in the name of two trustees. At the end of November it was agreed that the purchasers of Oxford&#x27;s lands would pay his entire debt of some £3,306 due to the Court of Wards over a five-year period, finishing in 1592.

In July and August 1588 England was threatened by the Spanish Armada. On 28 July Leicester, who was in overall command of the English land troops, asked for instructions regarding Oxford, stating that &quot;he seems most willing to hazard his life in this quarrel&quot;. The Earl was offered the governorship of the port of Harwich, but he thought it was unworthy and declined the post; Leicester was glad to be rid of him.

In December 1588 Oxford had secretly sold his London mansion &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Folly&quot; to Sir William Cornwallis; by January 1591 the author Thomas Churchyard was dealing with rent owing for rooms he had taken in a house on behalf of his patron. Oxford wrote to Burghley outlining a plan to purchase the manorial lands of Denbigh, in Wales, if the Queen would consent, offering to pay for them by commuting his £1,000 annuity and agreeing to abandon his suit to regain the Forest of Essex (Waltham Forest), and to deed over his interests in Hedingham and Brets for the use of his children, who were living with Burghley under his guardianship.

In the spring of 1591, the plan for the purchasers of his land to discharge his debt to the Court of Wards was disrupted by the Queen&#x27;s taking extents, or writs allowing a creditor to temporarily seize a debtor&#x27;s property. Oxford complained that his servant Thomas Hampton had taken advantage of these writs by taking money from the tenants for his own use, and had also conspired with another of his servants to pass a fraudulent document under the Great Seal of England. The Lord Mayor, Thomas Skinner, was also involved. In June, Oxford wrote to Burghley reminding him that he had made an agreement with Elizabeth to relinquish his claim to the Forest of Essex for three reasons, one of which was the Queen&#x27;s reluctance to punish Skinner&#x27;s felony, which had caused Oxford to forfeit £20,000 in bonds and statutes.

In 1586 Angel Day dedicated &quot;The English Secretary&quot;, the first epistolary manual for writing model letters in English, to Oxford, and William Webbe praised him as &quot;most excellent among the rest&quot; of our poets in his &quot;Discourse of English Poetry&quot;. In 1588 Anthony Munday dedicated to Oxford the two parts of his &quot;Palmerin d&#x27;Oliva&quot;. The following year &quot;The Arte of English Poesie&quot;, attributed to George Puttenham, placed Oxford among a &quot;crew&quot; of courtier poets; Puttenham also considered him among the best comic playwrights of the day. In 1590 Edmund Spenser addressed to Oxford the third of seventeen dedicatory sonnets which preface &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, celebrating his patronage of poets. The composer John Farmer, who was in Oxford&#x27;s service at the time, dedicated &quot;The First Set of Divers &amp; Sundry Ways of Two Parts in One&quot; to him in 1591, noting in the dedication his patron&#x27;s love of music.

==Remarriage and later life==

On 5 June 1588 Oxford&#x27;s wife Anne Cecil died at court of a fever; she was 31.

On 4 July 1591 Oxford sold the Great Garden property at Aldgate to John Wolley and Francis Trentham. The arrangement was stated to be for the benefit of Francis&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth Trentham, one of the Queen&#x27;s Maids of Honour, whom Oxford married later that year. On 24 February 1593, at Stoke Newington, she gave birth to his only surviving son, Henry de Vere, Viscount Bulbeck, who was his heir.

Between 1591 and 1592 Oxford disposed of the last of his large estates; Castle Hedingham, the seat of his earldom, went to Lord Burghley; it was held in trust for Oxford&#x27;s three daughters by his first marriage. He commissioned his servant, Roger Harlakenden, to sell Colne Priory. Harlekenden contrived to undervalue the land, then purchase it (as well as other parcels that were not meant to be sold) under his son&#x27;s name; the suits Oxford brought against Harlakenden for fraud dragged out for decades and were never settled in his lifetime.

Protracted negotiations to arrange a match between his daughter Elizabeth and Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, did not result in marriage; on 19 November 1594, six weeks after Southampton turned 21, &#x27;the young Earl of Southampton, refusing the Lady Vere, payeth £5000 of present money&#x27;. In January Elizabeth married William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby. Derby had promised Oxford his new bride would have £1,000 a year, but the financial provision for her was slow in materializing.

His father-in-law, Lord Burghley, died on 4 August 1598 at the age of 78, leaving substantial bequests to Oxford&#x27;s two unmarried daughters, Bridget and Susan. The bequests were structured to prevent Oxford from gaining control of his daughters&#x27; inheritances by assuming custody of them.

Earlier negotiations for a marriage to William Herbert having fallen through, in May or June 1599 Oxford&#x27;s 15 year-old daughter Bridget married Francis Norris. Susan married Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery.

From March to August 1595 Oxford actively importuned the Queen, in competition with Lord Buckhurst, to operate the tin mines in Cornwall. He wrote to Burghley, enumerating years of fruitless attempts to amend his financial situation and complained: &#x27;This last year past I have been a suitor to her Majesty that I might farm her tins, giving £3000 a year more than she had made.&#x27; Oxford&#x27;s letters and memoranda indicate that he pursued his suit into 1596, and renewed it again three years later, but was ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining the tin monopoly.

In October 1595, Oxford wrote to his brother-in-law, Sir Robert Cecil, of friction between himself and the ill-fated Earl of Essex, partly over his claim to property, terming him &#x27;the only person that I dare rely upon in the court&#x27;. Cecil seems to have done little to further Oxford&#x27;s interests in the suit.

In March he was unable to go to court due to illness, in August he wrote to Burghley from Byfleet, where he had gone for his health: &#x27;I find comfort in this air, but no fortune in the court.&#x27; In September, he again wrote of ill health, regretting he had not been able to pay attendance to the Queen. Two months later Rowland Whyte wrote to Sir Robert Sidney that &#x27;Some say my Lord of Oxford is dead&#x27;. Whether the rumour of his death was related to the illness mentioned in his letters earlier in the year is unknown. Oxford attended his last Parliament in December, perhaps another indication of his failing health.

On 28 April 1599 Oxford was sued by the widow of his tailor for a debt of £500 for services rendered some two decades earlier. He claimed that not only had he paid the debt, but that the tailor had absconded with &#x27;cloth of gold and silver and other stuff&#x27; belonging to him, worth £800. The outcome of the suit is unknown.

In July 1600 Oxford wrote requesting Sir Robert Cecil&#x27;s help in securing an appointment as Governor of the Isle of Jersey, once again citing the Queen&#x27;s unfulfilled promises to him. In February he again wrote for his support, this time for the office of President of Wales. As with his former suits, Oxford was again unsuccessful; during this time he was listed on the Pipe rolls as owing £20 for the subsidy.

After the abortive Essex rebellion in February 1601, Oxford was &#x27;the senior of the twenty-five noblemen&#x27; who rendered verdicts at the trials of Essex and Southampton for treason. After Essex&#x27;s co-conspirator Sir Charles Danvers was executed in March, Oxford became a party to a complicated suit regarding lands which had reverted to the Crown by escheat at Danvers&#x27;s attainder, a suit opposed by Danvers&#x27;s kinsmen. De Vere continued to suffer from ill health, which kept him from court. On 4 December, Oxford was shocked that Cecil, who had encouraged him to undertake the Danvers suit on the Crown&#x27;s behalf, had now withdrawn his support for it. As with all his other suits aimed at improving his financial situation, this last of Oxford&#x27;s suits to the Queen ended in disappointment.

==Last years==
In the early morning of 24 March 1603, Queen Elizabeth died without naming a successor. A few days beforehand, at his house at Hackney, Oxford had entertained the Earl of Lincoln, a nobleman known for erratic and violent behaviour similar to his host&#x27;s. Lincoln reported that after dinner Oxford spoke of the Queen&#x27;s impending death, claiming that the peers of England should decide the succession, and suggested that since Lincoln had &#x27;a nephew of the blood royal ... Lord Hastings&#x27;, he should be sent to France to find allies to support this claim. Lincoln relayed this conversation to Sir John Peyton, Lieutenant of the Tower, who, knowing how physically and financially infirm Oxford was, refused to take Lincoln&#x27;s report as a serious threat to King James&#x27;s accession.

Oxford expressed his grief at the late Queen&#x27;s death, and his apprehension for the future. These fears were unfounded; in letters to Cecil in May and June 1603 he again pressed his decades-long claim to have Waltham Forest (Forest of Essex) and the house and park of Havering restored to him, and on 18 July the new King granted his suit. On 25 July, Oxford was among those who officiated at the King&#x27;s coronation, and a month later James confirmed his annuity of £1,000.

Long weakened by poor health, Oxford passed custody of the Forest of Essex to his son-in-law Francis Norris and his cousin Sir Francis Vere on 18 June 1604. He died on 24 June of unknown causes at King&#x27;s Place, Hackney, and was buried on 6 July in the Hackney churchyard of St Augustine&#x27;s (now the parish of St. John-at-Hackney). Oxford&#x27;s death passed without public or private notice. His grave was still unmarked on 25 November 1612 when his widow Elizabeth Trentham signed her will. She asked &quot;to be buried in the Church of Hackney within the Countie of Middlesex, as neare vnto [unto] the bodie of my said late deare and noble lorde and husband as may bee,&quot; and she requested that &quot;there bee in the said Church erected for vs [us] a tombe fittinge our degree.&quot; The 18th Earl of Oxford failed to fulfil his mother&#x27;s request, and the location of his parents&#x27; graves has been lost.

==Literary reputation==

Oxford&#x27;s manuscript verses circulated widely in courtly circles. Three of his poems, , , and , are among the texts that repeatedly appear in the surviving 16th-century manuscript miscellanies and poetical anthologies. His earliest published poem was in Thomas Bedingfield&#x27;s translation of Cardano&#x27;s &quot;Comforte&quot; (1573). Bedingfield&#x27;s dedication to Oxford is dated 1 January 1572. In addition to his poem, Oxford also contributed a commendatory letter setting forth the reasons why Bedingfield should publish the work. 

In 1576 eight of his poems were published in the poetry miscellany &quot;The Paradise of Dainty Devises&quot;. According to the introduction, all the poems in the collection were meant to be sung, but Oxford&#x27;s were almost the only genuine love songs in the collection. Oxford&#x27;s was published in &quot;The Phoenix Nest&quot; (1593) and republished in &quot;England&#x27;s Helicon&quot; (1600). appeared in &quot;The Teares of Fancie&quot; (1593). &quot;Brittons Bowre of Delight&quot; (1597) published under Oxford&#x27;s name, but the attribution today is not considered certain.

Contemporary critics praised Oxford as a poet and a playwright. William Webbe names him as &quot;the most excellent&quot; of Elizabeth&#x27;s courtier poets. Puttenham&#x27;s &quot;The Arte of English Poesie&quot; (1589), places him first on a list of courtier poets and includes an excerpt from &quot;When wert thou born desire&quot; as an example of &quot;his excellance and wit&quot;. Puttenham also says that &quot;highest praise&quot; should be given to Oxford and Richard Edwardes for &quot;Comedy and Enterlude&quot;. Francis Meres&#x27; &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; (1598) names Oxford first by social rank of 17 playwrights listed who are &quot;the best for comedy amongst us&quot;, and he also appears first on a list of seven Elizabethan courtly poets &quot;who honoured Poesie with their pens and practice&quot; in Henry Peacham&#x27;s 1622 &quot;The Compleat Gentleman&quot;.

Steven W. May writes that the Earl of Oxford was Elizabeth&#x27;s &quot;first truly prestigious courtier poet ... [whose] precedent did at least confer genuine respectability upon the later efforts of such poets as Sidney, Greville, and Raleigh.&quot; He describes de Vere as a &quot;competent, fairly experimental poet working in the established modes of mid-century lyric verse&quot; and his poetry as &quot;examples of the standard varieties of mid-Elizabethan amorous lyric&quot;. May says that Oxford&#x27;s youthful love lyrics, which have been described as experimental and innovative, &quot;create a dramatic break with everything known to have been written at the Elizabethan court up to that time&quot; by virtue of being lighter in tone and metre and more imaginative and free from the moralizing tone of the courtier poetry of the &quot;drab&quot; age, which tended to be occasional and instructive. and describes one poem, in which the author cries out against &quot;this loss of my good name&quot;, as a &quot;defiant lyric without precedent in English Renaissance verse&quot;.
 May says that Oxford&#x27;s poetry was &quot;one man&#x27;s contribution to the rhetorical mainstream of an evolving Elizabethan poetic&quot; indistinguishable from &quot;the output of his mediocre mid-century contemporaries&quot;. However, C. S. Lewis wrote that his poetry shows &quot;a faint talent&quot;, but is &quot;for the most part undistinguished and verbose.&quot; Nelson says that &quot;contemporary observers such as Harvey, Webbe, Puttenham, and Meres clearly exaggerated de Vere&#x27;s talent in deference to his rank. By any measure, his poems pale in comparison with those of Sidney, Lyly, Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, and Jonson.&quot; He says that his known poems are &quot;astonishingly uneven&quot; in quality, ranging from the &quot;fine&quot; to the &quot;execrable&quot;.

Oxford was sought after for his literary and theatrical patronage; between 1564 and 1599, twenty-eight works were dedicated to him by authors, including Arthur Golding, John Lyly, Robert Greene, and Anthony Munday. Of his 33 dedications, 13 appeared in original or translated works of literature, a higher percentage of literary works than other patrons of similar means. His lifelong patronage of writers, musicians, and actors prompted May to term Oxford &quot;a nobleman with extraordinary intellectual interests and commitments&quot;, whose biography exhibits a &quot;lifelong devotion to learning&quot;. He goes on to say that &quot;Oxford&#x27;s genuine commitment to learning throughout his career lends a necessary qualification to Stone&#x27;s conclusion that de Vere simply squandered the more than 70,000 pounds he derived from selling off his patrimony ... for which some part of this amount de Vere acquired a splendid reputation for nurture of the arts and sciences&quot;.

== Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship ==
The Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship proposes that the Earl of Oxford wrote the plays and poems traditionally attributed to William Shakespeare. It was introduced by J. Thomas Looney, an English schoolmaster, in a book published in 1920. Though rejected by nearly all academic Shakespeareans, it has been among the most popular alternative Shakespeare authorship theories since the 1920s.
The Oxfordian theory was the central theme of the 2011 drama film &quot;Anonymous&quot;.

<doc id="10141" wikidata="Q180262" url="?curid=10141" title="Erinyes">
<text>The Erinyes ( ; , ), also known as the Eumenides (, the &quot;Gracious ones&quot;) and commonly known in English as the Furies, are chthonic goddesses of vengeance in ancient Greek religion and mythology. A formulaic oath in the &quot;Iliad&quot; invokes them as &quot;the Erinyes, that under earth take vengeance on men, whosoever hath sworn a false oath&quot;. Walter Burkert suggests that they are &quot;an embodiment of the act of self-cursing contained in the oath&quot;. They correspond to the Dirae in Roman mythology. The Roman writer Maurus Servius Honoratus ( AD) wrote that they are called &quot;Eumenides&quot; in hell, &quot;Furiae&quot; on Earth, and &quot;Dirae&quot; in heaven. Erinyes are akin to some other Greek deities, called Poenai.

According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, when the Titan Cronus castrated his father, Uranus, and threw his genitalia into the sea, the Erinyes (along with the Giants and the Meliae) emerged from the drops of blood which fell on the Earth (Gaia), while Aphrodite was born from the crests of sea foam. Pseudo-Apollodorus also reports this lineage. According to variant accounts they are the daughters of Nyx (&quot;Night&quot;), while in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, they are daughters of Pluto (Hades) and Nox (Nyx). In some accounts, they were the daughters of Eurynome (a name for Earth) and Cronus, or of Earth and Phorcys (i.e. the sea). In Orphic literature, they are the daughters of Hades and Persephone.

Their number is usually left indeterminate. Virgil, probably working from an Alexandrian source, recognized three: Alecto or Alekto (&quot;endless anger&quot;), Megaera (&quot;jealous rage&quot;), and Tisiphone or Tilphousia (&quot;vengeful destruction&quot;), all of whom appear in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Dante Alighieri followed Virgil in depicting the same three-character triptych of Erinyes; in Canto IX of the &quot;Inferno,&quot; they confront the poets at the gates of the city of Dis. Whilst the Erinyes were usually described as three maiden goddesses, the Erinys Telphousia was usually a byname for the wrathful goddess Demeter, who was worshipped under the title of Erinys in the Arkadian town of Thelpousa.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Erinyes&quot; is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb ὀρίνειν &quot;orinein&quot;, &quot;to raise, stir, excite&quot;, and the noun ἔρις &quot;eris&quot;, &quot;strife&quot; have been suggested; Robert Beekes suggests that the word probably has a Pre-Greek origin. The word &quot;Erinys&quot; in the singular and as a theonym is first attested in Mycenaean Greek, written in Linear B, in the following forms: , &quot;e-ri-nu&quot;, and , &quot;e-ri-nu-we&quot;.

The Erinyes live in Erebus and are more ancient than any of the Olympian deities. Their task is to hear complaints brought by mortals against the insolence of the young to the aged, of children to parents, of hosts to guests, and of householders or city councils to suppliants—and to punish such crimes by hounding culprits relentlessly. The appearance of the Erinyes differs between sources, though they are frequently described as wearing black. In Aesychlus&#x27; &quot;Eumenides,&quot; the Priestess of Pythian Apollo compares their monstrosity to that of the gorgon and harpies, but adds that they are wingless, with hatred dripping from their eyes. Euripides, on the other hand, gives them wings, as does Virgil. They are often envisaged as having snakes in their hair.

The Erinyes are commonly associated with night and darkness. With varying accounts claiming that they are the daughters of Nyx, the goddess of night, they&#x27;re also associated with darkness in the works of Aeschylus and Euripides in both their physical appearance and the time of day that they manifest.

Description of Tisiphone in Statius&#x27; Thebaid:

So prayed he, and the cruel goddess turned her grim visage to hearken. By chance she sat beside dismal Cocytus, and had loosed the snakes from her head and suffered them to lap the sulphurous waters. Straightway, faster than fire of Jove or falling stars she leapt up from the gloomy bank: the crowd of phantoms gives way before her, fearing to meet their queen; then, journeying through the shadows and the fields dark with trooping ghosts, she hastens to the gate of Taenarus, whose threshold none may cross and again return. Day felt her presence, Night interposed her pitchy cloud and startled his shining steeds; far off towering Atlas shuddered and shifted the weight of heaven upon his trembling shoulders. Forthwith rising aloft from Malea’s vale she hies her on the well-known way to Thebes: for on no errand is she swifter to go and to return, not kindred Tartarus itself pleases her so well. A hundred horned snakes erect shaded her face, the thronging terror of her awful head; deep within her sunken eyes there glows a light of iron hue, as when Atracian spells make travailing Phoebe redden through the clouds; suffused with venom, her skin distends and swells with corruption; a fiery vapour issues from her evil mouth, bringing upon mankind thirst unquenchable and sickness and famine and universal death. From her shoulders falls a stark and grisly robe, whose dark fastenings meet upon her breast: Atropos and Proserpine herself fashion her this garb anew. Then both her hands are shaken in wrath, the one gleaming with a funeral torch, the other lashing the air with a live water-snake.


==Cult==

Pausanias describes a sanctuary in Athens dedicated to the Erinyes under the name Semnai:Hard by [the Areopagos the murder court of Athens] is a sanctuary of the goddesses which the Athenians call the August, but Hesiod in the Theogony calls them Erinyes (Furies). It was Aeschylus who first represented them with snakes in their hair. But on the images neither of these nor of any of the under-world deities is there anything terrible. There are images of Pluto, Hermes, and Earth, by which sacrifice those who have received an acquittal on the Hill of Ares; sacrifices are also offered on other occasions by both citizens and aliens. The &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;, a collection of 87 religious poems as translated by Thomas Taylor, contains two stanzas regarding the Erinyes. Hymn 68 refers to them as the Erinyes, while hymn 69 refers to them as the Eumenides.

Hymn 68, to the Erinyes:
Vociferous Bacchanalian Furies [Erinyes], hear! Ye, I invoke, dread pow&#x27;rs, whom all revere; Nightly, profound, in secret who retire, Tisiphone, Alecto, and Megara dire: Deep in a cavern merg&#x27;d, involv&#x27;d in night, near where Styx flows impervious to the sight; Ever attendant on mysterious rites, furious and fierce, whom Fate&#x27;s dread law delights; Revenge and sorrows dire to you belong, hid in a savage veil, severe and strong, Terrific virgins, who forever dwell endu&#x27;d with various forms, in deepest hell; Aerial, and unseen by human kind, and swiftly coursing, rapid as the mind. In vain the Sun with wing&#x27;d refulgence bright, in vain the Moon, far darting milder light, Wisdom and Virtue may attempt in vain; and pleasing, Art, our transport to obtain Unless with these you readily conspire, and far avert your all-destructive ire. The boundless tribes of mortals you descry, and justly rule with Right&#x27;s [Dike&#x27;s] impartial eye. Come, snaky-hair&#x27;d, Fates [Moirai] many-form&#x27;d, divine, suppress your rage, and to our rites incline.Hymn 69, to the Eumenides:Hear me, illustrious Furies [Eumenides], mighty nam&#x27;d, terrific pow&#x27;rs, for prudent counsel fam&#x27;d; Holy and pure, from Jove terrestrial [Zeus Khthonios](Hades) born and Proserpine [Phersephone], whom lovely locks adorn: Whose piercing sight, with vision unconfin&#x27;d, surveys the deeds of all the impious kind: On Fate attendant, punishing the race (with wrath severe) of deeds unjust and base. Dark-colour&#x27;d queens, whose glittering eyes, are bright with dreadful, radiant, life-destroying, light: Eternal rulers, terrible and strong, to whom revenge, and tortures dire belong; Fatal and horrid to the human sight, with snaky tresses wand&#x27;ring in the night; Either approach, and in these rites rejoice, for ye, I call, with holy, suppliant voice.

==In ancient Greek literature==
Myth fragments dealing with the Erinyes are found among the earliest extant records of ancient Greek culture. The Erinyes are featured prominently in the myth of Orestes, which recurs frequently throughout many works of ancient Greek literature.

===Aeschylus===
Featured in ancient Greek literature, from poems to plays, the Erinyes form the Chorus and play a major role in the conclusion of Aeschylus&#x27;s dramatic trilogy the &quot;Oresteia&quot;. In the first play, &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, King Agamemnon returns home from the Trojan War, where he is slain by his wife, Clytemnestra, who wants vengeance for her daughter Iphigenia, whom Agamemnon had sacrificed to obtain favorable winds to sail to Troy. In the second play, &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;, their son Orestes has reached manhood and has been commanded by Apollo&#x27;s oracle to avenge his father&#x27;s murder at his mother&#x27;s hand. Returning home and revealing himself to his sister Electra, Orestes pretends to be a messenger bringing the news of his own death to Clytemnestra. He then slays his mother and her lover Aegisthus. Although Orestes&#x27; actions were what Apollo had commanded him to do, Orestes has still committed matricide, a grave sacrilege. Because of this, he is pursued and tormented by the terrible Erinyes, who demand yet further blood vengeance.

In &quot;The Eumenides&quot;, Orestes is told by Apollo at Delphi that he should go to Athens to seek the aid of the goddess Athena. In Athens, Athena arranges for Orestes to be tried by a jury of Athenian citizens, with her presiding. The Erinyes appear as Orestes&#x27; accusers, while Apollo speaks in his defense. The trial becomes a debate about the necessity of blood vengeance, the honor that is due to a mother compared to that due to a father, and the respect that must be paid to ancient deities such as the Erinyes compared to the newer generation of Apollo and Athena. The jury vote is evenly split. Athena participates in the vote and chooses for acquittal. Athena declares Orestes acquitted because of the rules she established for the trial. Despite the verdict, the Erinyes threaten to torment all inhabitants of Athens and to poison the surrounding countryside. Athena, however, offers the ancient goddesses a new role, as protectors of justice, rather than vengeance, and of the city. She persuades them to break the cycle of blood for blood (except in the case of war, which is fought for glory, not vengeance). While promising that the goddesses will receive due honor from the Athenians and Athena, she also reminds them that she possesses the key to the storehouse where Zeus keeps the thunderbolts that defeated the other older deities. This mixture of bribes and veiled threats satisfies the Erinyes, who are then led by Athena in a procession to their new abode. In the play, the &quot;Furies&quot; are thereafter addressed as &quot;Semnai&quot; (Venerable Ones), as they will now be honored by the citizens of Athens and ensure the city&#x27;s prosperity.

===Euripides===
In Euripides&#x27; &quot;Orestes&quot; the Erinyes are for the first time &quot;equated&quot; with the &#x27;Eumenides&#x27; (Εὐμενίδες, pl. of Εὐμενίς; literally &quot;the gracious ones&quot;, but also translated as &quot;Kindly Ones&quot;). This is because it was considered unwise to mention them by name (for fear of attracting their attention); the ironic name is similar to how Hades, god of the dead is styled Pluton, or Pluto, &quot;the Rich One&quot;. Using euphemisms for the names of deities serves many religious purposes.

<doc id="10142" wikidata="Q1590731" url="?curid=10142" title="Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair">
<text>Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair, in the County of Aberdeen, in the County of Meath and in the County of Argyll, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 4 January 1916 for John Hamilton-Gordon, 7th Earl of Aberdeen.

==Family history==

===Baronetcy of Haddo===
The Gordon family descends from John Gordon, who fought as a Royalist against the Covenanters in the Civil War. In 1642 he was created a baronet, of Haddo in the County of Aberdeen, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. In 1644 he was found guilty of treason and beheaded, with the baronetcy forfeited. The title was restored after the Restoration for his son John, the second Baronet.

===Earldom of Aberdeen===
The second Baronet died without male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baronet. He was a noted advocate and served as Lord President of the Court of Session and as Lord Chancellor of Scotland. On 30 November 1682 he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Haddo, Methlick, Tarves and Kellie, Viscount of Formartine and Earl of Aberdeen. He was succeeded by his only surviving son, the second Earl. He sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1721 to 1727. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son from his second marriage, the third Earl. He was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1747 to 1761 and from 1774 to 1790.

===Lord Aberdeen, Prime Minister===

The third earl was succeeded by his grandson, the fourth Earl, who was the eldest son of George Gordon, Lord Haddo. On 1 June 1814 he was created Viscount Gordon, of Aberdeen in the County of Aberdeen, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Lord Aberdeen was a distinguished diplomat and statesman and served as Foreign Secretary from 1828 to 1830 and from 1841 to 1846 and as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1852 to 1855. Aberdeen married firstly Lady Catherine Elizabeth (1784–1812), daughter of John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn, and assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Hamilton in 1818.

When Lord Aberdeen died, the titles passed to his eldest son from his second marriage to Harriet Douglas, the fifth Earl. He sat as Liberal member of parliament (MP) for Aberdeenshire. His eldest son, the sixth Earl, was a sailor and adventurer. He was accidentally drowned off the coast of America in 1870, without marrying or having children.

===Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair===
The sixth earl of Aberdeen was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Earl. John Hamilton-Gordon, was a Liberal politician and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1886 and from 1905 to 1915 and as Governor General of Canada from 1893 to 1898. On 4 January 1916 he was created Earl of Haddo, in the County of Aberdeen, and Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair, in the County of Aberdeen, in the County of Meath and in the County of Argyll.

Upon his death in 2002, the seventh Marquess, who was a Deputy Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire, inherited the titles. , the Marquessate is held by George Gordon, who is the eighth Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair, having succeeded in that year.

===Other family members===
Numerous other members of the Gordon family have also gained distinction. The Hon. William Gordon (died 1816), eldest son from the third marriage of the second Earl, was a general in the Army. The Hon. Cosmo Gordon, second son from the third marriage of the second Earl, was a colonel in the Army. The Hon. Alexander Gordon (1739–1792), third son from the third marriage of the second Earl, was a Lord of Session from 1788 to 1792 under the judicial title of Lord Rockville. His son William Duff-Gordon was member of parliament for Worcester. In 1815 he succeeded his uncle as second Baron of Halkin according to a special remainder and assumed the additional surname of Duff (see Duff-Gordon baronets for further history of this branch of the family). The Hon. William Gordon, younger brother of the fourth Earl, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and sat as member of parliament for Aberdeenshire. The Hon. Alexander Gordon (1786–1815), younger brother of the fourth Earl, was a soldier and was killed at the Battle of Waterloo.

The Hon. Sir Robert Gordon, younger brother of the fourth Earl, was a diplomat and served as British Ambassador to Austria. The Hon. John Gordon (1792–1869), younger brother of the fourth Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. The Hon. Sir Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (1817–1890), eldest son of the second marriage of the fourth Earl, was a general in the Army and sat as member of parliament for Aberdeenshire East. His eldest son, Sir Alexander Hamilton-Gordon was also a general in the Army. Reverend the Hon. Douglas Hamilton-Gordon (1824–1901), third son of the second marriage of the fourth Earl, was Chaplain-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria and Canon of Salisbury. The Hon. Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, fourth son of the second marriage of the fourth Earl, was a Liberal politician and was created Baron Stanmore in 1893 (see this title for more information on him and this branch of the family). Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, daughter of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth, and wife of the first Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair, was an author, philanthropist and an advocate of woman&#x27;s interests.

The family seat is Haddo House, Aberdeenshire. The title Earl of Haddo is the courtesy title for the Marquess&#x27;s eldest son and heir, the eldest son of whom uses the courtesy title Viscount of Formartine. The Marquesses of Aberdeen and Temair are related to the Marquesses of Huntly. Sir John Gordon (died c. 1395) of Strathbogie, ancestor of Sir John Gordon, 1st Baronet, was the brother of Elizabeth Gordon. She married Sir Alexander Seton (died 1438) and was the mother of Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly (ancestor of the Marquesses of Huntly).

<doc id="10147" wikidata="Q3009578" url="?curid=10147" title="East Coast Swing">
<text>East Coast Swing (ECS) is a form of social partner dance. It belongs to the group of swing dances. It is danced under fast swing music, including: big band, rock and roll, rockabilly, and boogie-woogie.

Yerrington and Outland equated East Coast Swing to the New Yorker in 1961. Originally known as &quot;Eastern Swing&quot; by Arthur Murray Studios, the name East Coast Swing became more common between 1975 and 1980.

==History==
The dance was created by dance studios including the Arthur Murray dance studios in the 1940s, based on the Lindy Hop. Lindy Hop was felt by dance studios to be both too difficult and too unstructured to teach to beginning dancers, but there was market demand for training in swing dance. The dance studios had initially dismissed Lindy Hop in particular as a fad. East Coast Swing can be referred to by many different names in different regions of the United States and the World. It has alternatively been called Eastern Swing, Jitterbug, American Swing, East Coast Lindy, Lindy (not to be confused with Lindy Hop), and Triple Swing (or Triple-step swing). Other variants of East Coast Swing that use altered footwork forms are known as Single Swing or &quot;Single-step Swing&quot; (where the triple step is replaced by a single step forming a slow, slow, quick, quick rhythm common to Foxtrot), and Double Swing (using a tap-step footwork pattern).

East Coast Swing is a rhythm dance that has both 6 and 8 beat patterns.
The name &quot;East Coast Swing&quot; was coined initially to distinguish the dance from the street form and the new variant used in the competitive ballroom arena (as well as separating the dance from West Coast Swing, which was developed in California). While based on Lindy Hop, it does have clear distinctions. East Coast Swing is a standardized form of dance developed first for instructional purposes in the Arthur Murray studios, and then later codified to allow for a medium of comparison for competitive ballroom dancers. It can be said that there is no right or wrong way to dance it; however, certain styles of the dance are considered correct &quot;form&quot; within the technical elements documented and governed by the National Dance Council of America. The N.D.C.A. oversees all the standards of American Style Ballroom and Latin dances. Lindy Hop was never standardized and later became the inspiration for several other dance forms such as: (European) Boogie Woogie, Jive, West Coast Swing and Rock and Roll.

In practice on the social dance floor, the six count steps of the East Coast Swing are sometimes mixed with the eight count steps of Lindy Hop, Charleston, and less frequently, Balboa.

== Basic Positions/Moves ==
The 5 basic positions/moves are:

# Semi-closed Position (normal starter position)
# Open Position (most common position used between moves)
# Crossovers (most common move)
# Wraps (waist wraps or neck wraps)
# Hammerlocks

== Basic technique ==
Single-step Swing

East Coast Swing has a 6 count basic step. This is in contrast to the meter of most swing music, which has a 4 count basic rhythm. In practice, however, the 6-count moves of the east coast swing are sometimes combined with 8-count moves from the Lindy hop, Charleston, and Balboa.

Depending on the region and instructor, the basic step of single-step East Coast Swing is either &quot;rock step, step, step&quot; or &quot;step, step, rock step&quot;. In both cases, the rock step always starts on the downbeat.

For &quot;rock step, step, step&quot; the beats, or counts, are the following:

Steps for the &quot;lead&quot; (traditionally, the man&#x27;s part)

Steps for the &quot;follow&quot; (traditionally, the woman&#x27;s part which mirrors the lead&#x27;s part)

For &quot;step, step, rock step,&quot; the rock step occurs on beats 5 and 6, but the overall progression remains the same.

The normal steps can be substituted with a triple step or double step &quot;step-tap&quot; or &quot;kick-step&quot; instead of a single step. This is commonly used during songs when a slower tempo makes the single step difficult (an example progression would be &quot;rock step, triple step, triple step&quot;).

==Timing==

Because East Coast uses a six step pattern with music employing 4 beats per measure, three measures of music are required to complete two sets of steps, as shown in the following table.
The rock step starts on 1, 2 the first triple step starts 3a4 and the second on 5a6.

In single time style (used with faster music) the triple steps are replaced by single steps, so two beats of music are used for each single step while each step in the rock (R) step (S) is still completed in one beat, finishing the cycle in six musical beats. Some instructors will teach vocalizing the single time style as&quot; &quot;Quick. Quick. Slow. Slow. &quot; or &quot;Back Step. Slow. Slow.&quot;

There is the choice to start with triples or with a rock step, however if you check the above chart where a triple step starts on a 1, 2 you can see that the pattern progresses and wraps back around. The choice of starting with a triple or a rock step does have musical consequences as music has phrasing with hits that often happen on 12, or 24 or 36... This means that dancers who choose to start with a rock step will probably find themselves on a rock step on every new phrase. Those who start with a triple will start with a triple on each new phrase. An advantage of starting with the triple step is that dancers can more easily change their foot work right at the start of the musical phrase.

<text>Ernst Kaltenbrunner (4 October 1903 – 16 October 1946) was a high-ranking Austrian SS official during the Nazi era and a major perpetrator of the Holocaust. After the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in 1942, and a brief period under Heinrich Himmler, Kaltenbrunner was the third Chief of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), which included the offices of Gestapo, Kripo and SD, from January 1943 until the end of World War II in Europe.

Kaltenbrunner joined the Nazi Party in 1930 and the SS in 1931, and by 1935 he was considered a leader of the Austrian SS. In 1938, he assisted in the &quot;Anschluss&quot; and was given command of the SS and police force in Austria. In January 1943, Kaltenbrunner was appointed chief of the RSHA, succeeding Reinhard Heydrich, who was assassinated in May 1942.

A committed antisemite, Kaltenbrunner played a pivotal role in orchestrating the Holocaust and Nazi genocide intensified under his leadership. He oversaw the coordination of security and law enforcement agencies involved in widespread extermination, the suppression of resistance movements in occupied territories, extensive arrests, deportations, and executions. He was the highest-ranking member of the SS to face trial (Himmler having died of suicide in May 1945) at the Nuremberg trials, where he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Kaltenbrunner was sentenced to death, and was executed by hanging on 16 October 1946.

== Personal life ==
Kaltenbrunner was born in Ried im Innkreis, Austria, the son of a lawyer, spent his early years and primary education in Raab and later attended the Realgymnasium in Linz. Raised in a nationalist family, he was childhood friends with Adolf Eichmann, the infamous SS officer who played a key role in implementing the Nazis&#x27; &quot;Final Solution&quot; against Europe&#x27;s Jews. After Gymnasium, Kaltenbrunner went on to obtain his PhD in law at Graz University in 1926.

Kaltenbrunner worked at a law firm in Salzburg for a year before opening his own law office in Linz. He had deep scars on his face reportedly from duelling in his student days, although some sources attribute them to a car accident.

On 14 January 1934, Kaltenbrunner married Elisabeth Eder (20 October 1908 – 20 May 2002), who was also a Nazi Party member; the couple had three children. In addition to the children from his marriage, Kaltenbrunner had twins, Ursula and Wolfgang (b. 1945) with his long-time mistress, Gisela Gräfin von Westarp (27 June 1920 – 2 June 1983). All the children survived the war.

== SS career ==
On 18 October 1930, Kaltenbrunner joined the Nazi Party as member number 300,179. In 1931, he was the &quot;Bezirksredner&quot; (district speaker) for the Nazi Party in Upper Austria. Kaltenbrunner joined the SS on 31 August 1931; his SS number was 13,039. He first became a &quot;Rechtsberater&quot; (legal consultant) for the Nazi Party in 1929 and later held this same position for SS Abschnitt (Section) VIII, beginning in 1932. That same year he began working at his father&#x27;s law practice, and by 1933 he had become head of the National-Socialist Lawyers&#x27; League in Linz.

In January 1934, Kaltenbrunner was briefly jailed at the Kaisersteinbruch detention camp with other Nazis for conspiracy by the Engelbert Dollfuss government. While there he led a hunger strike which forced the government to release 490 of the party members. In 1935, he was jailed again on suspicion of high treason. This charge was dropped, but he was sentenced to six months imprisonment for conspiracy and he lost his license to practice law.

From mid-1935 Kaltenbrunner was head of the illegal SS Abschnitt VIII in Linz and was considered a leader of the Austrian SS. To provide Heinrich Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich and Heinz Jost with new information, Kaltenbrunner repeatedly made trips to Bavaria. He would hide on a train and on a ship that travelled to Passau, then return with money and orders for Austrian comrades. In 1937 Kaltenbrunner was arrested again by Austrian authorities on charges of heading the illegal Nazi Party organization in Oberösterreich. He was released in September.

Acting on orders from Hermann Göring, Kaltenbrunner assisted in bringing about the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Germany (13 March 1938); he was awarded the role of State Secretary for Public Security in the Seyss-Inquart cabinet of 11 to 13 March 1938. Controlled from behind the scenes by Himmler, Kaltenbrunner still led, albeit clandestinely, the Austrian SS as part of his duty to &quot;coordinate&quot; and manage the Austrian population – this entailed the Nazification of all aspects of Austrian society. Then on 21 March 1938, he was promoted to SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot;. He was a member of the German &quot;Reichstag&quot; from 10 April 1938 until 8 May 1945. Amid this activity, he helped establish the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp near Linz. Mauthausen was the first Nazi concentration camp opened in Austria following the &quot;Anschluss&quot;. On 11 September 1938, Kaltenbrunner was promoted to the rank of SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; (equivalent to a lieutenant general in the German Army) while holding the position of Führer of SS-Oberabschnitt Österreich (re-designated SS-Oberabschnitt Donau in November 1938). Also in 1938, he was appointed Higher SS and Police Leader (&quot;Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer&quot;; HSSPF) for &quot;Oberabschnitt Donau&quot;, which was the primary SS command in Austria (he held that post until 30 January 1943).

=== World War II ===

In June 1940, Kaltenbrunner was appointed Vienna&#x27;s chief of police and held that additional post for a year. In July 1940, he was commissioned as an SS-&quot;Untersturmführer&quot; into the Waffen-SS Reserve. Alongside his many official duties, Kaltenbrunner also developed an intelligence network across Austria, moving southeastwards, which eventually brought him to Himmler&#x27;s attention for appointment as chief of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in January 1943. The RSHA was composed of the SiPo (&quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot;; the combined forces of the Gestapo and Kripo) along with the SD (&quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot;, Security Service). Kaltenbrunner replaced Heydrich, who had been assassinated in June 1942. Kaltenbrunner held this position until the end of World War II. Hardly anyone knew Kaltenbrunner, and upon his appointment, Himmler transferred responsibility both for SS personnel and for economics from the RSHA to the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office. Nonetheless, Kaltenbrunner was promoted to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei&quot; on 21 June 1943. He also replaced Heydrich as president (serving from 1943 to 1945) of the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC), the organization today known as Interpol.

Fearing a collapsing home-front due to the Allied bombing campaigns, and worried that another &quot;stab-in-the-back&quot; at home could arise as a result, Kaltenbrunner immediately tightened the Nazi grip within Germany. From what historian Anthony Read relates, Kaltenbrunner&#x27;s appointment as RSHA chief came as a surprise given the other possible candidates like the head of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller, or even the SD foreign-intelligence chief, Walter Schellenberg. Historian Richard Grunberger also added the name of Wilhelm Stuckart, the future minister of the German Interior, as another potential candidate for head of the RSHA; however, he suggests that Kaltenbrunner was most likely selected since he was a comparative &quot;newcomer&quot;, expected to be more &quot;pliable&quot; in Himmler&#x27;s hands.

Like many of the ideological fanatics in the regime, Kaltenbrunner was a committed antisemite. According to former SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Hans Georg Mayer, Kaltenbrunner was present at a December 1940 meeting among Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler, and Heydrich where it was decided to gas all Jews incapable of heavy physical work. Under Kaltenbrunner&#x27;s command, the genocide of Jews picked up pace as &quot;the process of extermination was to be expedited and the concentration of the Jews in the Reich itself and the occupied countries were to be liquidated as soon as possible.&quot; Kaltenbrunner stayed constantly informed over the status of concentration-camp activities, receiving periodic reports at his office in the RSHA.

To combat homosexuality across the greater Reich, Kaltenbrunner pushed the Ministry of Justice in July 1943 for an edict mandating compulsory castration for anyone found guilty of this offence. While this was rejected, he still took steps to get the army to review some 6,000 cases to prosecute homosexuals.

During the summer of 1943, Kaltenbrunner conducted his second inspection of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. While he was there, 15 prisoners were selected to demonstrate for Kaltenbrunner three methods of killing: by a gunshot to the neck, hanging, and gassing. After the killings were performed, Kaltenbrunner inspected the crematorium and later the quarry. In October 1943, he told Herbert Kappler, the head of German police and security services in Rome, that the &quot;eradication of the Jews in Italy&quot; was of &quot;special interest&quot; for &quot;general security&quot;. Four days later, Kappler&#x27;s SS and police units began rounding up and deporting Jews by train to Auschwitz concentration camp.

In 1944, during an arranged meeting in Klessheim Castle near Salzburg, when Hitler was in the process of strong-arming Admiral Horthy into a closer integration between Hungary and Nazi Germany, Kaltenbrunner was present for the negotiations and escorted Horthy out once they were over. Accompanying Horthy and Kaltenbrunner on the journey back to Hungary, Adolf Eichmann brought with him a special &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; unit to begin the process of rounding up and deporting Hungary&#x27;s 750,000 Jews.

It was said that even Himmler feared him, as Kaltenbrunner was an intimidating figure with 1.94m (6&#x27;4½&quot;) in height, facial scars, and volatile temper. Kaltenbrunner was also a longtime friend of Otto Skorzeny and recommended him for many secret missions, allowing Skorzeny to become one of Hitler&#x27;s favourite agents. Kaltenbrunner also allegedly headed Operation Long Jump, an alleged plan to assassinate Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt in Tehran in 1943.

Immediately in the wake of the 20 July Plot on Hitler&#x27;s life in 1944, Kaltenbrunner was summoned to Hitler&#x27;s wartime headquarters at the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; (Wolf&#x27;s Lair) in East Prussia to begin the investigation into who had planned the assassination attempt. Once it was revealed that an attempted military coup against Hitler had been launched, Himmler and Kaltenbrunner had to tread carefully, as the military was not under the jurisdiction of the Gestapo or the SD. When the attempt failed, the conspirators were soon identified. An estimated 5,000 people were eventually executed, with many more sent to concentration camps.

Historian Heinz Höhne counted Kaltenbrunner among the fanatical Hitler loyalists and described him as being committed &quot;to the bitter end&quot;. Field reports from the SD in October 1944 about deteriorating morale in the military prompted Kaltenbrunner to urge the involvement of the RSHA in military court-martial proceedings, but this was rejected by Himmler, who thought it unwise to interfere in &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (military) affairs. In December 1944, Kaltenbrunner was granted the additional rank of General of the Waffen-SS. On 15 November 1944, he was awarded the Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross with Swords. In addition, he was awarded the NSDAP Golden Party Badge and the &quot;Blutorden&quot; (Blood Order). Using his authority as Chief of the RSHA, Kaltenbrunner issued a decree on 6 February 1945 that allowed policemen to shoot &quot;disloyal&quot; people at their discretion, without judicial review.

On 12 March 1945, a meeting took place in Vorarlberg between Kaltenbrunner and Carl Jacob Burckhardt, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (1945–48). Just over a month later, Himmler was informed that SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; (general) Karl Wolff had been negotiating with the Allies for the capitulation of Italy. When questioned by Himmler, Wolff explained that he was operating under Hitler&#x27;s orders and attempting to play separate Allies against one another. Himmler believed him, but Kaltenbrunner did not, and told Himmler that an informant claimed that Wolff had also negotiated with Cardinal Schuster of Milan and was about to surrender occupied Italy to the Allies. Himmler angrily repeated the allegations; Wolff, feigning offence, challenged Himmler to present these statements to Hitler. Unnerved by Wolff&#x27;s demands, Himmler backed down, and Hitler sent Wolff back to Italy to continue his purported disruption of the Allies.

On 18 April 1945, three weeks before the war ended, Himmler named Kaltenbrunner commander-in-chief of the remaining German forces in southern Europe. Kaltenbrunner attempted to organize cells for post-war sabotage in the region and Germany but accomplished little. Hitler made one of his last appearances on 20 April 1945 outside the subterranean in Berlin, where he pinned medals on boys from the Hitler Youth for their bravery. Kaltenbrunner was among those present, but realizing the end was near, he then fled from Berlin.

=== Arrest ===
On 12 May 1945 Kaltenbrunner was apprehended along with his adjutant, Arthur Scheidler, and two SS guards in a remote cabin at the top of the Totes Gebirge mountains near Altaussee, Austria, by a search party initiated by the 80th Infantry Division, Third U.S. Army. Information had been gained from Johann Brandauer, the assistant burgermeister of Altaussee, that the party was hiding out with false papers in the cabin. This was supported by an eyewitness sighting by the Altaussee mountain ranger five days earlier. Special Agent Robert E. Matteson from the U.S. Army&#x27;s Counterintelligence Corps Detachment organized and led a patrol consisting of Brandauer, four ex-&quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldiers, and a squad of U.S. soldiers to effect the arrest. The party climbed over mountainous and glacial terrain for six hours in darkness before arriving at the cabin. After a short standoff, all four men exited the cabin and surrendered without a shot fired. Kaltenbrunner claimed to be a doctor and offered a false name. However, upon their arrival back to town his last mistress, Countess Gisela von Westarp, and the wife (Iris) of his adjutant Arthur Scheidler chanced to spot the men being led away; the ladies called out to both men and embraced them. This action resulted in their identification and arrest by U.S. troops.

In 2001, Ernst Kaltenbrunner&#x27;s personal Nazi security seal was found in an Alpine lake in Styria, Austria, 56 years after he had thrown it away to hide his identity. The seal was recovered by a Dutch citizen on holiday. The seal has the words &quot;Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD&quot; (Chief of the Security Police and SD) engraved on it. Experts have examined the seal and believe it was discarded in the final days of the European war in May 1945.

=== Nuremberg trials ===
At the Nuremberg trials, Kaltenbrunner was charged with conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Due to the areas over which he exercised responsibility as an SS general and as chief of the RSHA, he was acquitted of crimes against peace, but held responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
During the initial stages of the Nuremberg trials, Kaltenbrunner was absent because of two episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage, which required several weeks of recovery time. After his health improved, the tribunal denied his request for pardon. When he was released from a military hospital he pleaded not guilty to the charges of the indictment against him. Kaltenbrunner said all decrees and legal documents that bore his signature were &quot;rubber-stamped&quot; and filed by his adjutant(s). He also said Gestapo Chief Heinrich Müller had illegally affixed his signature to numerous documents in question.

Kaltenbrunner argued in his defence that his position as RSHA chief existed only theoretically and said he was only active in matters of espionage and intelligence. He maintained that Himmler, as his superior, was the person culpable for the atrocities committed during his tenure as chief of the RSHA. Kaltenbrunner also asserted that he had no knowledge of the Final Solution before 1943 and went on to claim that he protested against the ill-treatment of the Jews to Himmler and Hitler. Further denials from Kaltenbrunner included statements that he knew nothing of the Commissar Order and that he never visited Mauthausen concentration camp, despite documentation of his visit. At one point, Kaltenbrunner went so far as to avow that &quot;he&quot; was responsible for bringing the Final Solution to an end. In response to his denials, people in the courtroom laughed.

==== Conviction and execution ====
On 30 September 1946, the International Military Tribunal (IMT) found Kaltenbrunner not guilty of crimes against peace, but guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity (counts three and four). On 1 October 1946, the IMT sentenced him to death by hanging.

Kaltenbrunner was executed on 16 October 1946, around 1:15 am, in Nuremberg. His body, like those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann Göring (who committed suicide the previous day), was cremated at the Eastern Cemetery in Munich and the ashes were scattered in a tributary of the River Isar.

<text>Engelbert Dollfuss (alternatively Dollfuß; 4 October 1892 – 25 July 1934) was an Austrian fascist politician who served as Chancellor and Dictator of Austria between 1932 and 1934. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. This crisis culminated in the self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament, a coup sparked by the resignation of the presiding officers of the National Council. Suppressing the Socialist movement in the Austrian Civil War and later banning the Austrian Nazi Party, he cemented the rule of Austrofascism through the &quot;First of May Constitution&quot; in 1934. Later that year, Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Anschluss in 1938.

== Early life ==

Dollfuss was born to a poor, peasant family in the hamlet of Great Maierhof in the commune of St. Gotthard near Texingtal in Lower Austria. Young Dollfuss spent his childhood in his step-father&#x27;s house in the nearby commune of Kirnberg, where he also went to elementary school. The local parish priests helped to finance Dollfuss&#x27;s education, as his parents were unable to do so by themselves alone. He attended high school in Hollabrunn. After graduating from high school, Dollfuss intended to become a priest, and thus he enrolled at the University of Vienna to study theology, but after a few months changed course and started studying law in 1912. As a student, he earned a livelihood by giving lessons. He became a member of the Students&#x27; Social Movement, a student organisation dedicated to social and charitable work among the workers.

As World War I broke out, Dollfuss was reported to be recruited in Vienna but was rejected because he was two centimetres shorter than the minimum. Fully grown, he was less than in height, and later was nicknamed &quot;Millimetternich&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;Millimeter&quot; (German for millimetre) and Klemens von Metternich. The same day he was rejected in Vienna, Dollfuss went to St. Pölten where the recruiting commission for his district was located and insisted on being recruited, and, even though he did not meet the minimum height standards, he was accepted. As a volunteer, he had a right to choose a regiment in which he would serve, and Dollfuss opted for the Tyrolese militia also known as the &quot;Kaiserschützen&quot;. He was soon promoted to the rank of corporal. He served for 37 months at the Italian Front, south of Tyrol. By 1916 he was promoted to lieutenant.

After the war, he was still a student and was employed by the Lower Austrian Peasants&#x27; Union, which helped him to secure his material existence, and it was here where Dollfuss gained his first political experience. There, he organised peasants to help them recover from the war, as well as shield them from the influences of Marxism. Being recognised for the abilities he showed at the Union, he was sent for further studies to Berlin. In Berlin, he began to garner dislike for some of his professors, as academia there was substantially influenced by liberalism and socialism. In his studies, he devoted himself to the Christian principles of economics. In Germany, he became a member of the Federation of German Peasants&#x27; Union and of the Preussenkasse – essentially, a central bank for member cooperatives, where he gained practical experience. In Germany, he met his future wife Alwine Glienke, a descendant of a Pomeranian family. Dollfuss often met with Carl Sonnenschein, leader of social activities of students and the pioneer of the Catholic movement in Berlin.

After returning to Vienna, he was a secretary of the Lower Austrian Peasants&#x27; Union. He devoted his efforts to consolidating that industry. Dollfuss was instrumental in the founding of the regional Chamber of Agriculture of Lower Austria, becoming its secretary and a director; the Federation of Agriculture and the Agricultural Labourers&#x27; Insurance Institute; in organising the new Agrarian policy of Lower Austria and in laying the foundations for the corporative organisation of agriculture. A few years later, he was a representative of Austria at the International Agrarian Congress, where his proposals made him internationally known in that sphere. He was seen as an unofficial leader of the Austrian peasantry.

On 1 October 1930 Dollfuss was appointed the president of the Federal Railways, the largest industrial corporation in Austria. There, Dollfuss came into contact with all branches of the industry. In March 1931, he was appointed Federal Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.

On 10 May 1932, Dollfuss, age 39 and with only one year&#x27;s experience in the Federal Government, was offered the office of Chancellor by President Wilhelm Miklas, also a member of the Christian-Social Party. Dollfuss refused to reply, instead spending the night in his favourite church praying, returning in the morning for a bath and a spartan meal before replying to the President that he would accept the offer. Dollfuss was sworn in on 20 May 1932 as head of a coalition government between the Christian-Social Party, the Landbund – a right-wing agrarian party – and Heimatblock, the parliamentary wing of the &quot;Heimwehr&quot;, a paramilitary ultra-nationalist group. The coalition assumed the pressing task of tackling the problems of the Great Depression. Much of the Austro-Hungarian Empire&#x27;s industry had been situated in the areas that became part of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia after World War I as a result of the Treaty of Saint-Germain. Postwar Austria was therefore economically disadvantaged.

Dollfuss&#x27;s support in Parliament was marginal; his coalition had only a one-vote majority.

== Dollfuss as dictator of Austria ==
=== Ascent to power ===

In March 1933, a constitutional impasse arose over irregularities in the voting procedure in the Austrian parliament. The Social Democratic president of the National Council (the lower house of parliament), Karl Renner, resigned to be able to cast a vote as a parliament member. As a consequence, the two vice presidents, belonging to other parties, resigned as well in order to be able to vote. Without a president, the parliament could not conclude the session. Dollfuss took the three resignations as a pretext to declare that the National Council had become unworkable and advised President Wilhelm Miklas to issue a decree adjourning it indefinitely. 

On March 7, Dolfuss announced his government had assumed emergency powers based on the &quot;Wartime Economy Authority Law,&quot; which had been passed in 1917. From that point onwards, he governed by emergency decree, effectively seizing dictatorial powers. When the National Council wanted to reconvene on 15 March, days after the resignation of the three presidents, Dollfuss had the police bar entrance to the chamber, effectively eliminating democracy in Austria.

Dollfuss was concerned that with German National Socialist leader Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany from January 1933, the Austrian National Socialists (DNSAP) could gain a significant minority in future elections (according to fascism scholar Stanley G. Payne, should elections have been held in 1933, the DNSAP could have mustered about 25% of the votes – contemporary &quot;Time&quot; magazine analysts suggest higher support of 50%, with a 75% approval rate in the Tyrol region bordering Nazi Germany). In addition, the Soviet Union&#x27;s influence in Europe had increased throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. Dollfuss banned the Communist Party of Austria on 26 May 1933 and the DNSAP on 19 June 1933. Under the banner of the Fatherland Front, he later established a one-party dictatorship rule largely modelled after fascism in Italy, banning all other Austrian parties – including the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDAPÖ). Social Democrats however continued to exist as an independent organization, nevertheless, though without its paramilitary &quot;Republikanischer Schutzbund&quot;, which until banned on 31 March 1933 could have mustered tens of thousands against Dollfuss&#x27;s government.

=== Austrofascism ===

Dollfuss modelled Austrofascism according to Catholic corporatist ideals with anti-secularist tones and in a similar way to Italian fascism, dropping Austrian pretenses of unification with Germany as long as the Nazi Party remained in power there. In August 1933, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s regime issued a guarantee of Austrian independence. Dollfuss also exchanged &quot;Secret Letters&quot; with Mussolini about ways to guarantee Austrian independence. Mussolini had an interest in Austria forming a buffer zone against Nazi Germany. Dollfuss always stressed the similarity of the régimes of Hitler in Germany and Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union and was convinced that Austrofascism and Italian fascism could counter totalitarian national-socialism and communism in Europe.

In September 1933 Dollfuss merged his Christian Social Party with elements of other nationalist and conservative groups, including the Heimwehr (which encompassed many workers who were unhappy with the radical leadership of the socialist party) to form the &quot;Vaterländische Front&quot;, though the Heimwehr continued to exist as an independent organization until 1936, when Dollfuss&#x27;s successor Kurt von Schuschnigg forcibly merged it into the Front, instead creating the unabidingly loyal &quot;Frontmiliz&quot; as a paramilitary task-force. Dollfuss was shot and wounded in an assassination attempt in October 1933 by Rudolf Dertill, a 22-year-old who had been ejected from the military for his pro-Nazi views and had joined the Nazi Party in 1932. Dertill was sentenced to five years in prison for attempted murder. In the aftermath of the attempted assassination, Dollfuss declared martial law, which allowed for the resumption of capital punishment in Austria.

=== Austrian Civil War ===
In its drive to eliminate the Social Democrats&#x27; &quot;Schutzbund&quot;, the Dollfuss government searched the homes and meeting places of its members for weapons. On 12 February 1934, the Austrian Civil War was sparked by the armed resistance of the Linz branch of the Social Democrats to the search of their party headquarters. Word of the fighting in Linz spread quickly, and additional armed conflicts broke out, primarily in Austria&#x27;s industrial regions and Vienna. The &quot;Schutzbund&quot; was greatly outnumbered by the police and army, which used artillery against the insurgents. In addition, the general strike which had been called to support the uprising failed to materialize. The result was the collapse of the rebellion by 15 February, with the deaths of about 350 persons, roughly equally divided between civilians, insurgents, and government forces. The Social Democrats were outlawed by the Federal government on 12 February 1934, and their leaders were imprisoned or fled abroad.

=== New constitution ===

Dollfuss staged a rump parliamentary session with just Fatherland Front members present in April 1934 to have a new constitution approved, effectively the second constitution in the world espousing corporatist ideas (after that of the Portuguese &quot;Estado Novo&quot;). The session retrospectively made all the decrees already passed since March 1933 legal. The new constitution became effective on 1 May 1934 and swept away the last remnants of democracy and the system of the First Austrian Republic, establishing the Federal State of Austria. Based on Italian Fascism, Austria officially became a one-party authoritarian state. Opposing the Anschluss, Dollfuss and the Fatherland Front made heavy use of the Austrians&#x27; Catholic religion in an attempt to cultivate a sense of nationalism and prevent it from being absorbed by Nazi Germany.

== Assassination ==

As a result of his consistent opposition to Nazi demands, Dollfuss was assassinated on 25 July 1934 by a group of Austrian Nazis, including Otto Planetta, Franz Holzweber, Ernst Feike, Franz Leeb, Josef Hackl, Ludwig Maitzen, Erich Wohlraab, and Paul Hudl, who entered the Chancellery building and shot him in an attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. During mass trials which took place after the coup, Hudl was sentenced to life in prison, while the others were sentenced to death for their involvement. Planetta and Holzweber were hanged on 31 July 1934, Feike was hanged on 7 August 1934, and Leeb, Hackl, Maitzen, and Wohlraab were hanged on 13 August 1934. Hudl was released under an amnesty in 1938.

In his dying moments, Dollfuss asked for Viaticum, the Eucharist administered to a dying person, but his assassins refused to give it to him. Mussolini had no hesitation in attributing the attack to the German dictator: the news reached him at Cesena, where he was examining the plans for a psychiatric hospital. Mussolini personally gave the announcement to Dollfuss&#x27;s widow, who was a guest at his villa in Riccione with her children. He also put at the disposal of Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, who spent a holiday in Venice, a plane that allowed the prince to rush back to Vienna and to face the assailants with his militia, with the permission of President Wilhelm Miklas.

Mussolini also mobilised a part of the Italian army on the Austrian border and threatened Hitler with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria to thwart the putsch. Then he announced to the world: &quot;The independence of Austria, for which he has fallen, is a principle that has been defended and will be defended by Italy even more strenuously&quot;, and then replaced in the main square of Bolzano the statue of Walther von der Vogelweide, a Germanic troubadour, with that of Drusus, a Roman general who conquered part of Germany. This was the greatest moment of friction between Italian Fascism and National Socialism and Mussolini himself came down several times to reaffirm the differences in the field.

The assassination of Dollfuss was accompanied by uprisings in many regions in Austria, resulting in further deaths. In Carinthia, a large contingent of northern German Nazis tried to seize power but were subdued by the Italian units nearby. At first, Hitler was jubilant, but the Italian reaction surprised him. Hitler became convinced that he could not face a conflict with the Western European powers, and he officially denied liability, stating his regret for the murder of the Austrian Chancellor. He replaced the ambassador to Vienna with Franz von Papen and prevented the conspirators from entering Germany, also expelling them from the Austrian Nazi Party. The Nazi assassins in Vienna, after declaring the formation of a new government under Austrian Nazi Anton Rintelen, previously exiled by Dollfuss as Austrian Ambassador to Rome, surrendered after threats from the Austrian military of blowing up the Chancellery using dynamite, and were subsequently tried and executed by hanging. Kurt Schuschnigg, previously Minister of Education, was appointed new chancellor of Austria after a few days, assuming the office from Dollfuss&#x27;s deputy Starhemberg.

Out of a population of 6.5 million, approximately 500,000 Austrians were present at Dollfuss&#x27;s burial in Vienna. He is interred in the Hietzing cemetery in Vienna. His wife, Alwine Dollfuss (who died in 1973) was later buried beside him. Two of his children, Rudolf and Eva, were in Italy as guests of Rachele Mussolini at the time of his death, an event which saw Mussolini himself shed tears over his slain ally.

== In literature ==

In Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s 1941 play &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot;, Dollfuss is represented by the character &quot;Dullfeet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times - 9 May 1991- Review/Theater; Brecht&#x27;s Cauliflower King In Another Resistible Rise&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon Brook Shepard wrote a book in 1961 detailing Dolfuss and his rise to power.

<text>Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (born Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann; 24 January 1776 – 25 June 1822) was a German Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror, a jurist, composer, music critic and artist. He is the author of the novella &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot;, on which Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; is based. In addition, his stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s opera &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero. The ballet &quot;Coppélia&quot; is based on two other stories that Hoffmann wrote, while Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Kreisleriana&quot; is based on Hoffmann&#x27;s character Johannes Kreisler.

Hoffmann&#x27;s stories highly influenced 19th-century literature, and he is one of the major authors of the Romantic movement.

==Life==

===Youth===
Hoffmann&#x27;s ancestors, both maternal and paternal, were jurists. His father, Christoph Ludwig Hoffmann (1736–97), was a barrister in Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), as well as a poet and amateur musician who played the viola da gamba. In 1767 he married his cousin, Lovisa Albertina Doerffer (1748–96). Ernst Theodor Wilhelm, born on 24 January 1776, was the youngest of three children, of whom the second died in infancy.

When his parents separated in 1778, his father went to Insterburg (now Chernyakhovsk) with his elder son, Johann Ludwig Hoffmann (1768–1822), while Hoffmann&#x27;s mother stayed in Königsberg with her relatives: two aunts, Johanna Sophie Doerffer (1745–1803) and Charlotte Wilhelmine Doerffer (c. 1754–79) and their brother, Otto Wilhelm Doerffer (1741–1811), who were all unmarried. The trio raised the youngster.

The household, dominated by the uncle (whom Ernst nicknamed &quot;O Weh&quot;—&quot;Oh dear!&quot;—in a play on his initials &quot;O.W.&quot;), was pietistic and uncongenial. Hoffmann was to regret his estrangement from his father. Nevertheless, he remembered his aunts with great affection, especially the younger, Charlotte, whom he nicknamed &quot;Tante Füßchen&quot; (&quot;Aunt Littlefeet&quot;). Although she died when he was only three years old, he treasured her memory (a character in Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;Lebensansichten des Katers Murr&quot; is named after her) and embroidered stories about her to such an extent that later biographers sometimes assumed her to be imaginary, until proof of her existence was found after World War II.

Between 1781 and 1792 he attended the Lutheran school or &quot;Burgschule&quot;, where he made good progress in classics. Ernst showed great talent for piano-playing, and busied himself with writing and drawing. The provincial setting was not, however, conducive to technical progress, and despite his many-sided talents he remained rather ignorant of both classical forms and of the new artistic ideas that were developing in Germany. He had, however, read Schiller, Goethe, Swift, Sterne, Rousseau and Jean Paul, and wrote part of a novel titled &quot;Der Geheimnisvolle&quot;.

Around 1787 he became friends with Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Younger (1775–1843), the son of a pastor, and nephew of Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder, the well-known writer friend of Immanuel Kant. During the year 1792, both attended some of Kant&#x27;s lectures at the University of Königsberg. Their friendship, although often tested by an increasing social difference, was to be lifelong.

In 1794, Hoffmann became enamored of Dora Hatt, a married woman to whom he had given music lessons. She was ten years older, and gave birth to her sixth child in 1795. In February 1796, her family protested against his attentions and, with his hesitant consent, asked another of his uncles to arrange employment for him in Glogau (Głogów), Prussian Silesia.

===The provinces===
From 1796, Hoffmann obtained employment as a clerk for his uncle, Johann Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After passing further examinations he visited Dresden, where he was amazed by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of Correggio and Raphael. During the summer of 1798, his uncle was promoted to a court in Berlin, and the three of them moved there in August—Hoffmann&#x27;s first residence in a large city. It was there that Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an operetta called &quot;Die Maske&quot; and sending a copy to Queen Luise of Prussia. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of the Royal Theatre, a man named Iffland. By the time the latter responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of examinations and had already left for Posen (Poznań) in South Prussia in the company of his old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to show him the gallery.

From June 1800 to 1803, he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of Greater Poland and Masovia. This was the first time he had lived without supervision by members of his family, and he started to become &quot;what school principals, parsons, uncles, and aunts call dissolute.&quot;

His first job, at Posen, was endangered after Carnival on Shrove Tuesday 1802, when caricatures of military officers were distributed at a ball. It was immediately deduced who had drawn them, and complaints were made to authorities in Berlin, who were reluctant to punish the promising young official. The problem was solved by &quot;promoting&quot; Hoffmann to Płock in New East Prussia, the former capital of Poland (1079–1138), where administrative offices were relocated from Thorn (Toruń). He visited the place to arrange lodging, before returning to Posen where he married Mischa (Maria or Marianna Thekla Michalina Rorer, whose Polish surname was Trzcińska). They moved to Płock in August 1802.

Hoffmann despaired because of his exile, and drew caricatures of himself drowning in mud alongside ragged villagers. He did make use, however, of his isolation, by writing and composing. He started a diary on 1 October 1803. An essay on the theatre was published in Kotzebue&#x27;s periodical, &quot;Die Freimüthige&quot;, and he entered a competition in the same magazine to write a play. Hoffmann&#x27;s was called &quot;Der Preis&quot; (&quot;The Prize&quot;), and was itself about a competition to write a play. There were fourteen entries, but none was judged worthy of the award: 100 Friedrichs d&#x27;or. Nevertheless, his entry was singled out for praise. This was one of the few good times of a sad period of his life, which saw the deaths of his uncle J. L. Hoffmann in Berlin, his Aunt Sophie, and Dora Hatt in Königsberg.

At the beginning of 1804, he obtained a post at Warsaw. On his way there, he passed through his hometown and met one of Dora Hatt&#x27;s daughters. He was never to return to Königsberg.

===Warsaw===
Hoffmann assimilated well with Polish society; the years spent in Prussian Poland he recognized as the happiest of his life. In Warsaw he found the same atmosphere he had enjoyed in Berlin, renewing his friendship with Zacharias Werner, and meeting his future biographer, a neighbour and fellow jurist called Julius Eduard Itzig (who changed his name to Hitzig after his baptism). Itzig had been a member of the Berlin literary group called the &quot;Nordstern,&quot; or &quot;North Star&quot;, and he gave Hoffmann the works of Novalis, Ludwig Tieck, Achim von Arnim, Clemens Brentano, Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert, Carlo Gozzi and Calderón. These relatively late introductions marked his work profoundly.

He moved in the circles of August Wilhelm Schlegel, Adelbert von Chamisso, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, Rahel Levin and David Ferdinand Koreff.

But Hoffmann&#x27;s fortunate position was not to last: on 28 November 1806, during the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s troops captured Warsaw, and the Prussian bureaucrats lost their jobs. They divided the contents of the treasury between them and fled. In January 1807, Hoffmann&#x27;s wife and two-year-old daughter Cäcilia returned to Posen, while he pondered whether to move to Vienna or go back to Berlin. A delay of six months was caused by severe illness. Eventually the French authorities demanded that all former officials swear allegiance or leave the country. As they refused to grant Hoffmann a passport to Vienna, he was forced to return to Berlin.
He visited his family in Posen before arriving in Berlin on 18 June 1807, hoping to further his career there as an artist and writer.

===Berlin and Bamberg===
The next fifteen months were some of the worst in Hoffmann&#x27;s life.
The city of Berlin was also occupied by Napoleon&#x27;s troops. Obtaining only meagre allowances, he had frequent recourse to his friends, constantly borrowing money and still going hungry for days at a time; he learned that his daughter had died. Nevertheless, he managed to compose his Six Canticles for &quot;a cappella&quot; choir: one of his best compositions, which he would later attribute to Kreisler in &quot;Lebensansichten des Katers Murr&quot;.

On 1 September 1808 he arrived with his wife in Bamberg, where he began a job as theatre manager. The director, Count Soden, left almost immediately for Würzburg, leaving a man named Heinrich Cuno in charge. Hoffmann was unable to improve standards of performance, and his efforts caused intrigues against him which resulted in him losing his job to Cuno. He began work as music critic for the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot;, a newspaper in Leipzig, and his articles on Beethoven were especially well received, and highly regarded by the composer himself. It was in its pages that the &quot;Kapellmeister Johannes Kreisler&quot; character made his first appearance.

Hoffmann&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1809, with the publication of &quot;Ritter Gluck&quot;, a story about a man who meets, or believes he has met, the composer Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714–87) more than twenty years after the latter&#x27;s death. The theme alludes to the work of Jean Paul, who invented the term Doppelgänger the previous decade, and continued to exact a powerful influence over Hoffmann, becoming one of his earliest admirers. With this publication, Hoffmann began to use the pseudonym E. T. A. Hoffmann, telling people that the &quot;A&quot; stood for &quot;Amadeus&quot;, in homage to the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–91). However, he continued to use Wilhelm in official documents throughout his life, and the initials E. T. W. also appear on his gravestone.

The next year, he was employed at the Bamberg Theatre as stagehand, decorator, and playwright, while also giving private music lessons.
He became so enamored of a young singing student, Julia Marc, that his feelings were obvious whenever they were together, and Julia&#x27;s mother quickly found her a more suitable match. When Joseph Seconda offered Hoffmann a position as musical director for his opera company (then performing in Dresden), he accepted, leaving on 21 April 1813.

===Dresden and Leipzig===
Prussia had declared war against France on 16 March during the War of the Sixth Coalition, and their journey was fraught with difficulties. They arrived on the 25th, only to find that Seconda was in Leipzig; on the 26th, they sent a letter pleading for temporary funds. That same day Hoffmann was surprised to meet Hippel, whom he had not seen for nine years.

The situation deteriorated, and in early May Hoffmann tried in vain to find transport to Leipzig. On 8 May, the bridges were destroyed, and his family were marooned in the city. During the day, Hoffmann would roam, watching the fighting with curiosity. Finally, on 20 May, they left for Leipzig, only to be involved in an accident which killed one of the passengers in their coach and injured his wife.

They arrived on 23 May, and Hoffmann started work with Seconda&#x27;s orchestra, which he found to be of the best quality. On 4 June an armistice began, which allowed the company to return to Dresden. But on 22 August, after the end of the armistice, the family was forced to relocate from their pleasant house in the suburbs into the town, and during the next few days the Battle of Dresden raged. The city was bombarded; many people were killed by bombs directly in front of him. After the main battle was over, he visited the gory battlefield. His account can be found in &quot;Vision auf dem Schlachtfeld bei Dresden&quot;. After a long period of continued disturbance, the town surrendered on 11 November, and on 9 December the company travelled to Leipzig.

On 25 February, Hoffmann quarrelled with Seconda, and the next day he was given notice of twelve weeks. When asked to accompany them on their journey to Dresden in April, he refused, and they left without him. But during July his friend Hippel visited, and soon he found himself being guided back into his old career as a jurist.

===Berlin===

At the end of September 1814, in the wake of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, Hoffmann returned to Berlin and succeeded in regaining a job at the &quot;Kammergericht&quot;, the chamber court. His opera &quot;Undine&quot; was performed by the Berlin Theatre. Its successful run came to an end only after a fire on the night of the 25th performance. Magazines clamoured for his contributions, and after a while his standards started to decline. Nevertheless, many masterpieces date from this time.

During the period from 1819, Hoffmann was involved with legal disputes, while fighting ill health. Alcohol abuse and syphilis eventually caused weakening of his limbs during 1821, and paralysis from the beginning of 1822. His last works were dictated to his wife or to a secretary.

Prince Metternich&#x27;s anti-liberal programs began to put Hoffmann in situations that tested his conscience. Thousands of people were accused of treason for having certain political opinions, and university professors were monitored during their lectures.

King Frederick William III of Prussia appointed an Immediate Commission for the investigation of political dissidence; when he found its observance of the rule of law too frustrating, he established a Ministerial Commission to interfere with its processes. The latter was greatly influenced by Commissioner Kamptz. During the trial of &quot;Turnvater&quot; Jahn, the founder of the gymnastics association movement, Hoffmann found himself annoying Kamptz, and became a political target. When Hoffmann caricatured Kamptz in a story (&quot;Meister Floh&quot;), Kamptz began legal proceedings. These ended when Hoffmann&#x27;s illness was found to be life-threatening. The King asked for a reprimand only, but no action was ever taken. Eventually &quot;Meister Floh&quot; was published with the offending passages removed.

===Death===
Hoffmann died of syphilis in Berlin on 25 June 1822 at the age of 46. His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor at the underground station Mehringdamm.

==Assessment==
Hoffmann is one of the best-known representatives of German Romanticism, and a pioneer of the fantasy genre, with a taste for the macabre combined with realism that influenced such authors as Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849), Nikolai Gogol (1809–1852), Charles Dickens (1812–1870), Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867), George MacDonald (1824–1905), Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–1881), Vernon Lee (1856–1935), Franz Kafka (1883–1924) and Alfred Hitchcock (1899–1980). Hoffmann&#x27;s story &quot;Das Fräulein von Scuderi&quot; is sometimes cited as the first detective story and a direct influence on Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;; Characters from it also appear in the opera &quot;Cardillac&quot; by Paul Hindemith.

The twentieth-century Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin characterised Hoffmann&#x27;s works as Menippean Satire, essentially satirical and self-parodying in form, thus including him in a tradition that includes Cervantes, Diderot and Voltaire.

Robert Schumann&#x27;s piano suite Kreisleriana (1838) takes its title from one of Hoffmann&#x27;s books (and according to Charles Rosen&#x27;s &quot;The Romantic Generation&quot;, is possibly rather inspired by &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tomcat Murr&quot;, in which Kreisler appears). Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s masterwork, the opera &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot; (&quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, 1881), is based on the stories, principally &quot;Der Sandmann&quot; (&quot;The Sandman&quot;, 1816), &quot;Rat Krespel&quot; (&quot;Councillor Krespel&quot;, 1818), and &quot;Das verlorene Spiegelbild&quot; (&quot;The Lost Reflection&quot;) from &quot;Die Abenteuer der Silvester-Nacht&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;, 1814). &quot;Klein Zaches genannt Zinnober&quot; (&quot;Little Zaches called Cinnabar&quot;, 1819) inspired an aria as well as the operetta &quot;Le Roi Carotte&quot; (1872). Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; (1892) is based on &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot;, and the ballet &quot;Coppélia&quot;, with music by Delibes, is based on two eerie Hoffmann stories.

Hoffmann also influenced 19th-century musical opinion directly through his music criticism. His reviews of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67 (1808) and other important works set new literary standards for writing about music, and encouraged later writers to consider music as &quot;the most Romantic of all the arts.&quot; Hoffmann&#x27;s reviews were first collected for modern readers by Friedrich Schnapp, ed., in &quot;E.T.A. Hoffmann: Schriften zur Musik; Nachlese&quot; (1963) and have been made available in an English translation in &quot;E.T.A. Hoffmann&#x27;s Writings on Music, Collected in a Single Volume&quot; (2004).

Hoffmann strove for artistic polymathy. He created far more in his works than mere political commentary achieved through satire. His masterpiece novel &quot;Lebensansichten des Katers Murr&quot; (&quot;The Life and Opinions of Tomcat Murr&quot;, 1819–1821) deals with such issues as the aesthetic status of true artistry and the modes of self-transcendence that accompany any genuine endeavour to create. Hoffmann&#x27;s portrayal of the character Kreisler (a genius musician) is wittily counterpointed with the character of the tomcat Murr – a virtuoso illustration of artistic pretentiousness that many of Hoffmann&#x27;s contemporaries found offensive and subversive of Romantic ideals.

Hoffmann&#x27;s literature indicates the failings of many artists to differentiate between the superficial and the authentic aspects of such Romantic ideals. The &quot;self-conscious&quot; effort to impress must, according to Hoffmann, be divorced from the &quot;self-aware&quot; effort to create. This essential duality in &quot;Kater Murr&quot; is conveyed structurally through a discursive &quot;splicing together&quot; of two biographical narratives.

===Science fiction===
While disagreeing with E. F. Bleiler&#x27;s claim that Hoffmann was &quot;one of the two or three greatest writers of fantasy&quot;, Algis Budrys of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; said that he &quot;did lay down the groundwork for some of our most enduring themes&quot;.

Historian Martin Willis argues that Hoffmann&#x27;s impact on science fiction has been overlooked, saying &quot;his work reveals a writer dynamically involved in the important scientific debates of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.&quot; Willis points out that Hoffmann&#x27;s work is contemporary with &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818) and with &quot;the heated debates and the relationship between the new empirical science and the older forms of natural philosophy that held sway throughout the eighteenth century.&quot; His &quot;interest in the machine culture of his time is well represented in his short stories, of which the critically renowned &quot;The Sandman&quot; (1816) and &quot;Automata&quot; (1814) are the best examples. ...Hoffmann&#x27;s work makes a considerable contribution to our understanding of the emergence of scientific knowledge in the early years of the nineteenth century and to the conflict between science and magic, centred mainly on the &#x27;truths&#x27; available to the advocates of either practice. ...Hoffmann&#x27;s balancing of mesmerism, mechanics, and magic reflects the difficulty in categorizing scientific knowledge in the early nineteenth century.&quot;

==In popular culture==
*Robertson Davies invokes Hoffmann as a character (with the pet name of &#x27;ETAH&#x27;) trapped in Limbo, in his novel &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; (1988).
*Alexandre Dumas, père translated &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; into French, which aided in making the tale popular and widespread.
*The exotic and supernatural elements in the storyline of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; derive largely from the stories of Hoffmann.
* Freud gives an extensive psychoanalytic analysis of Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; in his 1919 essay &quot;Das Unheimliche&quot;.
* Coppelius is a German classical metal band whose name is taken from a character in Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot;. The band&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Zinnober&quot; includes a track titled &quot;Klein Zaches&quot;.
* The Russian show &quot;Puppets&quot; was cancelled by government officials after an episode in which Vladimir Putin was portrayed as Hoffmann&#x27;s Klein Zaches.

<text>Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus ( ; ; 28 October c. 1466 – 12 July 1536), commonly known in English as Erasmus of Rotterdam or simply Erasmus, was a Dutch Christian humanist, Catholic priest and theologian, educationalist, satirist, and philosopher. Through his vast number of translations, books, essays, prayers and letters, he is considered one of the most influential thinkers of the Northern Renaissance and one of the major figures of Dutch and Western culture.

Erasmus was an important figure in classical scholarship who wrote in a spontaneous, copious and natural Latin style. As a Catholic priest developing humanist techniques for working on texts, he prepared pioneering new Latin and Greek scholarly editions of the New Testament and of the Church Fathers, with annotations and commentary that were immediately and vitally influential in both the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Reformation. He also wrote &quot;On Free Will&quot;, &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot;, &quot;The Complaint of Peace&quot;, &quot;Handbook of a Christian Knight&quot;, &quot;On Civility in Children&quot;, &quot;&quot; and many other popular and pedagogical works.

Erasmus lived against the backdrop of the growing European religious reformations. He developed a biblical humanistic theology in which he advocated the religious and civil necessity both of peaceable concord and of pastoral tolerance on &quot;matters of indifference&quot;. He remained a member of the Catholic Church all his life, remaining committed to reforming the church from within. He promoted what he understood as the traditional doctrine of synergism, which some prominent reformers such as Martin Luther and John Calvin rejected in favor of the doctrine of monergism. His influential middle-road approach disappointed, and even angered, partisans in both camps.

==Life and career==
Erasmus&#x27;s almost 70 years may be divided into quarters.

* First was his medieval Dutch childhood, ending with his being orphaned and impoverished; 
* Second, his struggling years as a canon (a kind of semi-monk), a clerk, a priest, a failing and sickly university student, a would-be poet, and a tutor; 
* Third, his flourishing but peripatetic High Renaissance years of increasing focus and literary productivity following his 1499 contact with a reformist English circle notably John Colet and Thomas More, then with radical French Franciscan Jean Vitrier (or Voirier), and later with the Greek-speaking Aldine New Academy in Venice; and 
* Fourth, his financially more secure Reformation years near the Black Forest: as a prime influencer of European thought through his New Testament and increasing public opposition to aspects of Lutheranism, first in Basel and then as a Catholic religious refugee in Freiburg.

===Early life===
Desiderius Erasmus is reported to have been born in Rotterdam on 27 or 28 October (&quot;the vigil of Simon and Jude&quot;) in the late 1460s. 
He was named after Erasmus of Formiae, whom Erasmus&#x27; father Gerard (Gerardus Helye) personally favored. Although associated closely with Rotterdam, he lived there for only four years, never to return afterwards.
The year of Erasmus&#x27; birth is unclear: in later life he calculated his age as if born in 1466, but frequently his remembered age at major events actually implies 1469. (This article currently gives 1466 as the birth year. To handle this disagreement, ages are given first based on 1469, then in parentheses based on 1466: e.g., &quot;20 (or 23)&quot;.) Furthermore, many details of his early life must be gleaned from a fictionalized third-person account he wrote in 1516 (published in 1529) in a letter to a fictitious Papal secretary, Lambertus Grunnius (&quot;Mr. Grunt&quot;).

His parents could not be legally married: his father, Gerard, was a Catholic priest who may have spent up to six years in the 1450s or 60s in Italy as a scribe and scholar. His mother was Margaretha Rogerius (Latinized form of Dutch surname Rutgers), the daughter of a doctor from Zevenbergen. She may have been Gerard&#x27;s housekeeper. 
Although he was born out of wedlock, Erasmus was cared for by his parents, with a loving household and the best education, until their early deaths from the bubonic plague in 1483. His only sibling Peter might have been born in 1463, and some writers suggest Margaret was a widow and Peter was the half-brother of Erasmus; Erasmus on the other hand called him his brother. There were legal and social restrictions on the careers and opportunities open to the children of unwed parents.

Erasmus&#x27; own story, in the possibly forged 1524 &quot;&quot; was along the lines that his parents were engaged, with the formal marriage blocked by his relatives (presumably a young widow or unmarried mother with a child was not an advantageous match); his father went to Italy to study Latin and Greek, and the relatives misled Gerard that Margaretha had died, on which news grieving Gerard romantically took Holy Orders, only to find on his return that Margaretha was alive; many scholars dispute this account.

In 1471 his father became the vice-curate of the small town of Woerden (where young Erasmus may have attended the local vernacular school to learn to read and write) and in 1476 was promoted to vice-curate of Gouda.

Erasmus was given the highest education available to a young man of his day, in a series of monastic or semi-monastic schools. In 1476, at the age of 6 (or 9), his family moved to Gouda and he started at the school of Pieter Winckel, who later became his guardian (and, perhaps, squandered Erasmus and Peter&#x27;s inheritance.) Historians who date his birth in 1466 have Erasmus in Utrecht at the choir school at this period.

In 1478, at the age of 9 (or 12), he and his older brother Peter were sent to one of the best Latin schools in the Netherlands, located at Deventer and owned by the chapter clergy of the Lebuïnuskerk (St. Lebuin&#x27;s Church). A notable previous student was Thomas à Kempis. Towards the end of his stay there the curriculum was renewed by the new principal of the school, Alexander Hegius, a correspondent of pioneering rhetorician Rudolphus Agricola. For the first time in Europe north of the Alps, Greek was taught at a lower level than a university and this is where he began learning it. His education there ended when plague struck the city about 1483, and his mother, who had moved to provide a home for her sons, died from the infection; then his father. Following the death of his parents, as well as 20 fellow students at his school, he moved back to his &quot;&quot; (Rotterdam?) where he was supported by Berthe de Heyden, a compassionate widow. 

In 1484, around the age 14 (or 17), he and his brother went to a cheaper grammar school or seminary at &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch run by the Brethren of the Common Life: Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Epistle to Grunnius&quot; satirizes them as the &quot;Collationary Brethren&quot; who select and sort boys for monkhood. He was exposed there to the Devotio moderna movement and the Brethren&#x27;s famous book &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; but resented the harsh rules and strict methods of the religious brothers and educators. The two brothers made an agreement that they would resist the clergy but attend the university; Erasmus longed to study in Italy, the birthplace of Latin, and have a degree from an Italian university. Instead, Peter left for the Augustinian canonry in Stein, which left Erasmus feeling betrayed. Around this time he wrote forlornly to his friend Elizabeth de Heyden &quot;Shipwrecked am I, and lost, &#x27;mid waters chill&#x27;.&quot; He suffered Quartan fever for over a year. Eventually Erasmus moved to the same abbey as a postulant in or before 1487, around the age of 16 (or 19.)

===Vows, ordination and canonry experience===

Poverty had forced the sickly, bookish, teenaged orphan Erasmus into the consecrated life, entering the novitiate in 1487 at the canonry at rural Stein, very near Gouda, South Holland: the &quot;Chapter of Sion&quot; community largely borrowed its rule from the larger monkish Congregation of Windesheim who had historical associations with the Brethren of the Common Life, but also with the notable pastoral, mystical and anti-speculative post-scholastic theologians Jean Gerson and Gabriel Biel: positions associated also with Erasmus. In 1488–1490, the surrounding region was plundered badly by armies fighting the Squire Francis War of succession and then suffered a famine. Erasmus professed his vows as a Canon regular of St. Augustine there in late 1488 at age 19 (or 22). Historian Fr. Aiden Gasquet later wrote: &quot;One thing, however, would seem to be quite clear; he could never have had any vocation for the religious life. His whole subsequent history shows this unmistakably.&quot; But according to one Catholic biographer, Erasmus had a spiritual awakening at the monastery.

Certain abuses in religious orders were among the chief objects of his later calls to reform the Western Church from within, particularly coerced or tricked recruitment of immature boys (the fictionalized account in the &quot;Letter to Grunnius&quot; calls them &quot;victims of Dominic and Francis and Benedict&quot;): Erasmus felt he had belonged to this class, joining &quot;voluntarily but not freely&quot; and so considered himself, if not morally bound by his vows, certainly legally, socially and honour- bound to keep them, yet to look for his true vocation.

While at Stein, 18-(or 21-)year-old Erasmus fell in unrequited love, forming what he called a &quot;passionate attachment&quot; (), with a fellow canon, Servatius Rogerus, and wrote a series of love letters in which he called Rogerus &quot;half my soul&quot;, writing that &quot;it was not for the sake of reward or out of a desire for any favour that I have wooed you both unhappily and relentlessly. What is it then? Why, that you love him who loves you.&quot; This correspondence contrasts with the generally detached and much more restrained attitude he usually showed in his later life, though he had a capacity to form and maintain deep male friendships, such as with More, Colet, and Ammonio. No mentions or sexual accusations were ever made of Erasmus during his lifetime. His works notably praise moderate sexual desire in marriage between men and women.

In 1493, his prior arranged for him to leave the Stein house and take up the post of Latin Secretary to the ambitious Bishop of Cambrai, Henry of Bergen, on account of his great skill in Latin and his reputation as a man of letters.

He was ordained to the Catholic priesthood either on 25 April 1492, or 25 April 1495, at age 25 (or 28.) Either way, he did not actively work as a choir priest for very long, though his many works on confession and penance suggests experience of dispensing them.

From 1500, he avoided returning to the canonry at Stein even insisting the diet and hours would kill him, though he did stay with other Augustinian communities and at monasteries of other orders in his travels. Rogerus, who became prior at Stein in 1504, and Erasmus corresponded over the years, with Rogerus demanding Erasmus return after his studies were complete. Nevertheless, the library of the canonry ended up with by far the largest collection of Erasmus&#x27; publications in the Gouda region.

In 1505, Pope Julius II granted a dispensation from the vow of poverty to the extent of allowing Erasmus to hold certain benefices, and from the control and habit of his order, though he remained a priest and, formally, an Augustinian canon regular the rest his life. In 1517, Pope Leo X granted legal dispensations for Erasmus&#x27; &quot;defects of natality&quot; and confirmed the previous dispensation, allowing the 48-(or 51-)year-old his independence but still, as a canon, capable of holding office as a prior or abbot. In 1525, Pope Clement VII granted, for health reasons, a dispensation to eat meat and dairy in Lent and on fast days.

===Travels===

Erasmus traveled widely and regularly, for reasons of poverty, &quot;escape&quot; from his Stein canonry (to Cambrai), education (to Paris, Turin), escape from the sweating sickness plague (to Orléans), employment (to England), searching libraries for manuscripts, writing (Brabant), royal counsel (Cologne), patronage, tutoring and chaperoning (North Italy), networking (Rome), seeing books through printing in person (Paris, Venice, Louvain, Basel), and avoiding the persecution of religious fanatics (to Freiburg). He enjoyed horseback riding.

====Paris====
In 1495 with Bishop Henry&#x27;s consent and a stipend, Erasmus went on to study at the University of Paris in the Collège de Montaigu, a centre of reforming zeal, under the direction of the ascetic Jan Standonck, of whose rigors he complained. The university was then the chief seat of Scholastic learning but already coming under the influence of Renaissance humanism. For instance, Erasmus became an intimate friend of an Italian humanist Publio Fausto Andrelini, poet and &quot;professor of humanity&quot; in Paris.

During this time, Erasmus developed a deep aversion to exclusive or excessive Aristotelianism and Scholasticism and started finding work as a tutor/chaperone to visiting English and Scottish aristocrats. There is no record of him graduating.

====First visit to England (1499–1500)====

Erasmus stayed in England at least three times. In between he had periods studying in Paris, Orléans, Leuven and other cities.

In 1499 he was invited to England by William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy, who offered to accompany him on his trip to England. His time in England was fruitful in the making of lifelong friendships with the leaders of English thought in the days of King Henry VIII.

During his first visit to England in 1499, he studied or taught at the University of Oxford. There is no record of him gaining any degree. Erasmus was particularly impressed by the Bible teaching of John Colet, who pursued a style more akin to the church fathers than the Scholastics. Through the influence of the humanist John Colet, his interests turned towards theology. Other distinctive features of Colet&#x27;s thought that may have influenced Erasmus are his pacifism, reform-mindedness, anti-Scholasticism and pastoral esteem for the sacrament of Confession.

This prompted him, upon his return from England to Paris, to intensively study the Greek language, which would enable him to study theology on a more profound level.

Erasmus also became fast friends with Thomas More, a young law student considering becoming a monk, whose thought (e.g., on conscience and equity) had been influenced by 14th century French theologian Jean Gerson, and whose intellect had been developed by his powerful patron Cardinal John Morton (d. 1500) who had famously attempted reforms of English monasteries.

Erasmus left London with a full purse from his generous friends, to allow him to complete his studies. However, he had been provided with bad legal advice by his friends: the English Customs officials confiscated all the gold and silver, leaving him with nothing except a night fever that lasted several months.

====France and Brabant====
Following his first trip to England, Erasmus returned first to poverty in Paris, where he started to compile the &quot;Adagio&quot; for his students, then to Orléans to escape the plague, and then to semi-monastic life, scholarly studies and writing in France, notably at the Benedictine Abbey of Saint Bertin at St Omer (1501,1502) where he wrote the initial version of the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; (Handbook of the Christian Knight.) A particular influence was his encounter in 1501 with Jean (Jehan) Vitrier, a radical Franciscan who consolidated Erasmus&#x27; thoughts against excessive valorization of monasticism, ceremonialism and fasting in a kind of conversion experience, and introduced him to Origen.

In 1502, Erasmus went to Brabant, ultimately to the university at Louvain. In 1504 he was hired by the leaders of the Brabantian &quot;Provincial States&quot; to deliver one of his few public speeches, a very long formal panegyric for the Philip &quot;the Fair&quot;, Duke of Burgundy and later King of Castille: the first half being the conventional extravagant praise, but the second half being a strong treatment of the miseries of war, the need for neutrality and conciliation (with the neighbours France and England), and the excellence of peaceful rulers: that real courage in a leader was not to wage war but to put a bridle on greed, etc. This was later published as &quot;Panegyricus&quot;. Erasmus then returned to Paris in 1504.

====Second visit to England (1505–1506)====

For Erasmus&#x27; second visit, he spent over a year staying at recently married Thomas More&#x27;s house, now a lawyer and Member of Parliament, honing his translation skills.

Erasmus preferred to live the life of an independent scholar and made a conscious effort to avoid any actions or formal ties that might inhibit his individual freedom. In England Erasmus was approached with prominent offices but he declined them all, until the King himself offered his support. He was inclined, but eventually did not accept and longed for a stay in Italy.

====Italy====
In 1506 he was able to accompany and tutor the sons of the personal physician of the English King through Italy to Bologna.

His discovery &quot;en route&quot; of Lorenzo Valla&#x27;s &quot;New Testament Notes&quot; was a major event in his career and prompted Erasmus to study the New Testament using philology.

In 1506 they passed through Turin and he arranged to be awarded the degree of Doctor of Sacred Theology (&quot;Sacra Theologia&quot;) from the University of Turin at age 37 (or 40.) Erasmus stayed tutoring in Bologna for a year; in the winter, Erasmus was present when Pope Julius II entered victorious into the conquered Bologna which he had besieged before.

Erasmus travelled on to Venice, working on an expanded version of his Adagia at the Aldine Press of the famous printer Aldus Manutius, advised him which manuscripts to publish, and was an honorary member of the graecophone Aldine &quot;New Academy&quot; (). From Aldus he learned the in-person workflow that made him productive at Froben: making last-minute changes, and immediately checking and correcting printed page proofs as soon as the ink had dried. Aldus wrote that Erasmus could do twice as much work in a given time as any other man he had ever met.

In 1507, according to his letters, he studied advanced Greek in Padua with the Venetian natural philosopher, Giulio Camillo. He found employment tutoring and escorting Scottish nobleman Alexander Stewart, the 24-year old Archbishop of St Andrews, through Padua, Florence, and Siena Erasmus made it to Rome in 1509, visiting some notable libraries and cardinals, but having a less active association with Italian scholars than might have been expected.

In 1509, William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lord Mountjoy lured him back to England, now ruled by what was hoped would be a wise and benevolent king (Henry VIII) educated by humanists. Warham and Mountjoy sent Erasmus £10 to cover his expenses on the journey. On his trip over the Alps via Splügen Pass, and down the Rhine toward England, Erasmus began to compose &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot;.

====Third visit to England (1510–1515)====
In 1510, Erasmus arrived at More&#x27;s bustling house, was confined to bed to recover from his recurrent illness, and wrote &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot;, which was to be a best-seller. More was at that time the undersheriff of the City of London.
After his glorious reception in Italy, Erasmus had returned broke and jobless, with strained relations with former friends and benefactors on the continent, and he regretted leaving Italy, despite being horrified by papal warfare. There is a gap in his usually voluminous correspondence: his so-called &quot;two lost years&quot;, perhaps due to self-censorship of dangerous or disgruntled opinions; he shared lodgings with his friend Andrea Ammonio (Latin secretary to Mountjoy, and the next year, to Henry VIII) provided at the London Austin Friars&#x27; compound, skipping out after a disagreement with the friars over rent that caused bad blood.

He assisted his friend John Colet by authoring Greek textbooks and securing members of staff for the newly established St Paul&#x27;s School and was in contact when Colet gave his notorious 1512 Convocation sermon which called for a reformation of ecclesiastical affairs. At Colet&#x27;s instigation, Erasmus started work on &quot;De copia&quot;.

In 1511, the University of Cambridge&#x27;s chancellor, John Fisher, arranged for Erasmus to be (or to study to prepare to be) the Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity, though whether he actually was accepted for it or took it up is contested by historians. He studied and taught Greek and researched and lectured on Jerome.

Erasmus mainly stayed at Queens&#x27; College while lecturing at the university, between 1511 and 1515. Erasmus&#x27; rooms were located in the &quot;&quot; staircase of Old Court. Despite a chronic shortage of money, he succeeded in mastering Greek by an intensive, day-and-night study of three years, taught by Thomas Linacre, continuously begging in letters that his friends send him books and money for teachers.

Erasmus suffered from poor health and was especially concerned with heating, clean air, ventilation, draughts, fresh food and unspoiled wine: he complained about the draughtiness of English buildings. He complained that Queens&#x27; College could not supply him with enough decent wine (wine was the Renaissance medicine for gallstones, from which Erasmus suffered). As Queens&#x27; was an unusually humanist-leaning institution in the 16th century, Queens&#x27; College Old Library still houses many first editions of Erasmus&#x27;s publications, many of which were acquired during that period by bequest or purchase, including Erasmus&#x27;s New Testament translation, which is signed by friend and Polish religious reformer Jan Łaski.

By this time More was a judge on the poorman&#x27;s equity court (Master of Requests) and a Privy Counsellor.

====Flanders and Brabant====
His residence at Leuven, where he lectured at the University, exposed Erasmus to much criticism from those ascetics, academics and clerics hostile to the principles of literary and religious reform to which he was devoting his life. In 1514, &quot;en route&quot; to Basel, he made the acquaintance of Hermannus Buschius, Ulrich von Hutten and Johann Reuchlin who introduced him to the Hebrew language in Mainz. In 1514, he suffered a fall from his horse and injured his back.

Erasmus may have made several other short visits to England or English territory while living in Brabant. Happily for Erasmus, More and Tunstall were posted in Brussels or Antwerp on government missions around 1516, More for six months, Tunstall for longer. Their circle include Pieter Gillis of Antwerp, in whose house Thomas More&#x27;s wrote Utopia (pub. 1516) with Erasmus&#x27; encouragement, Erasmus editing and perhaps even contributing fragments. His old Cambridge friend Richard Sampson was vicar general running the nearby diocese of Tournai.

In 1516, Erasmus accepted an honorary position as a Councillor to Charles V with an annuity of 200 guilders (over US$100,000), rarely paid, and tutored Charles&#x27; brother, the teenage future Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand of Hapsburg.

In 1516, Erasmus published the first edition of his scholarly Latin-Greek New Testament with annotations, his complete works of Jerome, and &quot;The Education of a Christian Prince&quot; (&quot;Institutio principis Christiani&quot;) for Charles and Ferdinand.

In 1517, he supported the foundation at the university of the Collegium Trilingue for the study of Hebrew, Latin, and Greek—after the model of Cisneros&#x27; College of the Three Languages at the University of Alcalá—financed by his late friend Hieronymus van Busleyden&#x27;s will. On being asked by Jean Le Sauvage, former Chancellor of Brabant and now Chancellor of Burgundy, Erasmus wrote &quot;The Complaint of Peace&quot;. 

In 1517, his great friend Ammonio died in England of the Sweating Sickness. In 1518, Erasmus was diagnosed with the plague; despite the danger, he was taken in and cared for in the home of his Flemish friend and publisher Dirk Martens in Antwerp for a month and recovered.

By 1518, he reported to Paulus Bombasius that his income was over 300 ducats per year (over US$150,000) without including patronage. By 1522 he reported his annual income as 400 gold florins (over US$200,000.)
In 1520 he was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold with Guillaume Budé, probably his last meetings with Thomas More and William Warham. His friends and former students and old correspondents were the incoming political elite, and he had risen with them.

He stayed in various locations including Anderlecht (near Brussels) in the summer of 1521.

====Basel (1521–1529)====
From 1514, Erasmus regularly traveled to Basel to coordinate the printing of his books with Froben. He developed a lasting association with the great Basel publisher Johann Froben and later his son Hieronymus Froben (Erasmus&#x27; godson) who together published over 200 works with Erasmus, working with expert scholar-correctors who went on to illustrious careers.

His initial interest in Froben&#x27;s operation was aroused by his discovery of the printer&#x27;s folio edition of the &quot;Adagiorum Chiliades tres&quot; (Adagia) (1513). Froben&#x27;s work was notable for using the new Roman type (rather than blackletter) and Aldine-like Italic and Greek fonts, as well as elegant layouts using borders and fancy capitals; Hans Holbein (the Younger) cut several woodblock capitals for Erasmus&#x27; editions. The printing of many his books was supervised by his Alsatian friend, the Greek scholar Beatus Rhenanus.

In 1521 he settled in Basel. He was weary of the controversies and hostility at Louvain, and feared being dragged further into the Lutheran controversy. He agreed to be the Froben press&#x27; literary superintendent writing dedications and prefaces for an annuity and profit share. Apart from Froben&#x27;s production team, he had his own householdwith a formidable housekeeper, stable of horses, and up to eight boarders or paid servants: who acted as assistants, correctors, amanuenses, dining companions, international couriers, and carers. It was his habit to sit at times by a ground-floor window, to make it easier to see and be seen by strolling humanists for chatting.

In collaboration with Froben and his team, the scope and ambition of Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Annotations&quot;, Erasmus&#x27; long-researched project of philological notes of the New Testament along the lines of Valla&#x27;s &quot;Adnotations&quot;, had grown to also include a lightly revised Latin Vulgate, then the Greek text, then several edifying essays on methodology, then a highly revised Vulgate—all bundled as his &quot;Novum testamentum omne&quot; and pirated individually throughout Europe— then finally his amplified &quot;Paraphrases&quot;.

In 1522, Erasmus&#x27; compatriot, former teacher (c. 1502) and friend from University of Louvain unexpectedly became Pope Adrian VI, after having served as Regent (and/or Grand Inquisitor) of Spain for six years. Like Erasmus and Luther, he had been influenced by the Brethren of the Common Life. He tried to entice Erasmus to Rome. His reforms of the Roman Curia which he hoped would meet the objections of many Lutherans were stymied (party because the Holy See was broke), though re-worked at the Council of Trent, and he died in 1523.
As the popular and nationalist responses to Luther gathered momentum, the social disorders, which Erasmus dreaded and Luther disassociated himself from, began to appear, including the German Peasants&#x27; War (1524–1525), the Anabaptist insurrections in Germany and in the Low Countries, iconoclasm, and the radicalisation of peasants across Europe. If these were the outcomes of reform, Erasmus was thankful that he had kept out of it. Yet he was ever more bitterly accused of having started the whole &quot;tragedy&quot; (as Erasmus dubbed the matter).

In 1523, he provided financial support to the impoverished and disgraced former Latin Secretary of Antwerp Cornelius Grapheus, on his release from the newly introduced Inquisition. In 1525, a former student of Erasmus who had served at Erasmus&#x27; father&#x27;s former church at Woerden, Jan de Bakker (Pistorius) was the first priest to be executed as a heretic in the Netherlands. In 1529, his French translator and friend Louis de Berquin was burnt in Paris, following his condemnation as an anti-Rome heretic by the Sorbonne theologians.

====Freiburg (1529–1535)====
Following sudden, violent, iconoclastic rioting in early 1529 led by Œcolampadius his former assistant, in which elected Catholic councilmen were deposed, the city of Basel definitely adopted the Reformation—finally banning the Catholic Mass on April 1, 1529. 
Erasmus, in company with other Basel Catholic priests including Bishop Augustinus Marius, left Basel on the 13 April 1529 and departed by ship to the Catholic university town of Freiburg im Breisgau to be under the protection of his former student, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria. Erasmus wrote somewhat dramatically to Thomas More of his frail condition at the time: &quot;I preferred to risk my life rather than appear to approve a programme like theirs. There was some hope of a return to moderation.&quot; 
In Spring early 1530 Erasmus was bedridden for three months with an intensely painful infection, likely &quot;carbunculosis&quot;, that, unusually for him, left him too ill to work. He declined to attend the Diet of Augsburg to which both the Bishop of Augsburg and the Papal legate Campeggio had invited him, and he expressed doubt on non-theological grounds, to Campeggio and Melanchthon, that reconciliation was then possible: he wrote to Campeggio &quot;I can discern no way out of this enormous tragedy unless God suddenly appears like a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; and changes the hearts of men&quot; and later &quot;What upsets me is not so much their teaching, especially Luther&#x27;s, as the fact that, under the pre-text of the gospel, I see a class of men emerging whom I find repugnant from every point of view.&quot;

He stayed for two years on the top floor of the Whale House, then following another rent dispute bought and refurbished a house of his own, where he took in scholar/assistants as table-boarders such as Cornelius Grapheus&#x27; friend Damião de Góis, some of them fleeing persecution.

Despite increasing frailty Erasmus continued to work productively, notably on a new &quot;magnum opus&quot;, his manual on preaching &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot;, and his small book on preparing for death. His boarder for five months, the Portuguese scholar/diplomat Damião de Góis, worked on his lobbying on the plight of the Sámi in Sweden and the Ethiopian church, and stimulated Erasmus&#x27; increasing awareness of foreign missions.

There are no extant letters between More and Erasmus from the start of More&#x27;s period as Chancellor until his resignation (1529–1533), almost to the day. Erasmus wrote several important non-political works under the surprising patronage of Thomas Bolyn: his &quot;Ennaratio triplex in Psalmum XXII&quot; or &quot;Triple Commentary on Psalm 23&quot; (1529); his catechism to counter Luther &quot;Explanatio Symboli&quot; or &quot;A Playne and Godly Exposition or Declaration of the Commune Crede&quot; (1533) which sold out in three hours at the Frankfurt Book Fair, and &quot;Praeparatio ad mortem&quot; or &quot;Preparation for Death&quot; (1534) which would be one of Erasmus&#x27; most popular and most hijacked works.

===Fates of friends===
In the 1530s, life became more dangerous for Spanish Erasmians when Erasmus&#x27; protector, the Inquisitor General Alonso Manrique de Lara fell out of favour with the royal court and lost power within his own organization to friar-theologians. In 1532 Erasmus&#x27; friend, &quot;converso&quot; Juan de Vergara (Cisneros&#x27; Latin secretary who had worked on the Complutensian Polyglot and published Stunica&#x27;s criticism of Erasmus) was arrested by the Spanish Inquisition and had to be ransomed from them by the humanist Archbishop of Toledo Alonso III Fonseca, also a correspondent of Erasmus&#x27;, who had previously rescued Ignatius of Loyola from them.

There was a generational change in the Catholic hierarchy. In 1530, the reforming French bishop Guillaume Briçonnet died. In 1532 his beloved long-time mentor English Primate Warham died of old age, as did reforming cardinal Giles of Viterbo and Swiss bishop Hugo von Hohenlandenberg. In 1534 his distrusted protector Clement VII (the &quot;inclement Clement&quot;) died, his recent Italian ally Cardinal Cajetan (widely tipped as the next pope) died, and his old ally Cardinal Campeggio retired.

As more friends died (in 1533, his friend Pieter Gillis; in 1534, William Blount; in early 1536, Catherine of Aragon;) and as Luther and some Lutherans and some powerful Catholic theologians renewed their personal attacks on Erasmus, his letters are increasingly focused on concerns on the status of friendships and safety as he considered moving from bland Freiburg despite his health.

In 1535, Erasmus&#x27; friends Thomas More, Bishop John Fisher and the Brigittine monk Richard Reynolds were executed as pro-Rome traitors by Henry VIII, who Erasmus and More had first met as a boy. Despite illness Erasmus wrote the first biography of More (and Fisher), the short, anonymous &quot;Expositio Fidelis&quot;, which Froben published, at the instigation of de Góis.

After Erasmus&#x27; time, numerous of Erasmus&#x27; translators later met similar fates at the hands of Anglican, Catholic and Reformed sectarians and autocrats: including Margaret Pole, William Tyndale, Michael Servetus. Others, such as Charles V&#x27;s Latin secretary Juan de Valdés, fled and died in self-exile.

Erasmus&#x27; friend and collaborator Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall eventually died in prison under Elizabeth I for refusing the Oath of Supremacy. Erasmus&#x27; correspondent Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who he had known as a teenaged student in Paris and Cambridge, was later imprisoned in the Tower of London for five years under Edward VI for impeding Protestantism. Damião de Góis was tried before the Portuguese Inquisition at age 72, detained almost &quot;incommunicado&quot;, finally exiled to a monastery, and on release perhaps murdered. His amanuensis Gilbert Cousin died in prison at age 66, shortly after being arrested on the personal order of Pope Pius V.

===Death in Basel===

When his strength began to fail, he finally decided to accept an invitation by Queen Mary of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands (sister of his former student Archduke Ferdinand I and Emperor Charles V), to move from Freiburg to Brabant. In 1535, he moved back to the Froben compound in Basel in preparation (Œcolampadius having died, and private practice of his religion now possible) and saw his last major works such as Ecclesiastes through publication, though he grew more frail.

On July 12, 1536, he died from an attack of dysentery. &quot;The most famous scholar of his day died in peaceful prosperity and in the company of celebrated and responsible friends.&quot; His last words, as recorded by his friend and biographer Beatus Rhenanus, were apparently &quot;Lord, put an end to it&quot; (, the same last words as Melanchthon) then &quot;Dear God&quot; ().

He had remained loyal to Roman Catholicism, but biographers have disagreed whether to treat him as an insider or an outsider. He may not have received or had the opportunity to receive the last rites of the Catholic Church; the contemporary reports of his death do not mention whether he asked for a Catholic priest or not, if any were secretly or privately in Basel.

He was buried with great ceremony in the Basel Minster (the former cathedral). The Protestant city authorities remarkably allowed his funeral to be an ecumenical Catholic requiem Mass.

Erasmus had received dispensations (from Ferdinand Archduke of Austria, and from Emperor Charles V in 1530) to make a will rather than have his wealth revert to his order (the Chapter of Sion), or to the state, and had long pre-sold most of his personal library of almost 500 books to Polish humanist Jan Łaski. 
As his heir or executor he instated Bonifacius Amerbach to give seed money to students and the needy. One of the eventual recipients was the impoverished Protestant humanist Sebastian Castellio, who had fled from Geneva to Basel, who subsequently translated the Bible into Latin and French, and who worked for the repair of the breach and divide of Western Christianity in its Catholic, Anabaptist, and Protestant branches.

==Thought and views==
Biographers, such as Johan Huizinga, frequently draw connections between many of Erasmus&#x27; convictions and his early biography: esteem for the married state and appropriate marriages, support for priestly marriage, concern for improving marriage prospects for women, opposition to inconsiderate rules (notably, institutional dietary rules), a desire to make education engaging for the participants, interest in classical languages, horror of poverty and spiritual hopelessness, distaste for friars begging when they could study or work, unwillingness to be under the direct control of authorities, laicism, the need for those in authority to act in the best interest of their charges, a prizing of mercy and peace, an anger over unnecessary war, especially between avaricious princes, an awareness of mortality, etc.

===Manner of thinking===
Erasmus had a distinctive manner of thinking, a Catholic historian suggests: one that is capacious in its perception, agile in its judgments, and unsettling in its irony with &quot;a deep and abiding commitment to human flourishing&quot;. &quot;In all spheres, his outlook was essentially pastoral.&quot;

Erasmus has been called a seminal rather than a consistent or systematic thinker, notably averse to over-extending from the specific to the general; who nevertheless should be taken very seriously as a pastoral and rhetorical theologian, with a philological and historical approach—rather than a metaphysical approach—to interpreting Scripture and interested in the literal and tropological senses. French theologian Louis Bouyer commented, &quot;Erasmus was to be one of those who can get no edification from exegesis where they suspect some misinterpretation.&quot;

A theologian has written of &quot;Erasmus&#x27; preparedness completely to satisfy no-one but himself.&quot; He has been called moderate, judicious and constructive even when being critical or when mocking extremes; but thin-skinned against slanders of heterodoxy.

===Manner of expression===
====Irony====
Erasmus often wrote in a highly ironical idiom, especially in his letters, which makes them prone to different interpretations when taken literally rather than ironically.

* Ulrich von Hutten claimed that Erasmus was secretly a Lutheran; Erasmus chided him saying that von Hutten had not detected the irony in his public letters enough. 
* Antagonistic scholar J.W. Williams denies that Erasmus&#x27; letter to Ammonius, &quot;let your own interests be your standard in all things,&quot; was in apparent jest, as claimed by those more sympathetic to Erasmus. 
* Erasmus&#x27; aphoristic quote on the persecution of Reuchlin, &quot;If it is Christian to hate Jews, we are all abundantly Christians here,&quot; is taken literally by Theodor Dunkelgrün and Harry S. May as being approving of such hatred; the alternative view would be that it was sardonic and challenging.

He frequently wrote about controversial subjects using the dialogue to avoid direct statements clearly attributable to himself. For Martin Luther, he was an eel, slippery, evasive and impossible to capture. 

====Copiousness====
Erasmus&#x27; literary theory of &quot;copiousness&quot; endorses a large stockpile of rich adages, analogies, tropes and symbolic figures, which leads to compressed communication of complex ideas (between those educated in the stockpile) but some of which, to modern sensibilities, may promote as well as play off stereotypes. 
* Erasmus&#x27; lengthy collections of proverbs, the &quot;Adagia&quot;, established a vocabulary he and his contemporaries then used extensively and habitually: according to philosopher Heinz Kimmerle, it is necessary to know the explanations of various proverbs given by Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Adages&quot; to adequately understand many passages in Erasmus&#x27; and Luther&#x27;s written debate on free will (see below). 
*When Erasmus wrote of &#x27;Judaism,&#x27; he most frequently (though not always) was not referring to Jews: instead he referred to those Catholic Christians of his time, especially in the monastic lifestyle, who mistakenly promoted excessive external ritualism over interior piety, by analogy with Second Temple Judaism. 
** &quot;Judaism I call not Jewish impiety, but prescriptions about external things, such as food, fasting, clothes, which to a certain degree resemble the rituals of the Jews.&quot;
** Erasmus&#x27; counter-accusation to Spanish friars of &quot;Judaizing&quot; may have been particularly sharp and bold, given the prominent role that some friars with the Spanish Inquisition were playing in the lethal persecution of some &quot;conversos&quot;.

Terence J. Martin identifies an &quot;Erasmian pattern&quot; that the supposed (by the reader) otherness (of Turks, Lapplanders, Indians, Amerindians, Jews, and even women and heretics) &quot;provides a foil against which the failures of Christian culture can be exposed and criticized.&quot; 
* In a 1518 letter to John Fisher, Erasmus wrote: &quot;The cunning of princes and the effrontery of the Roman curia can go no further; and it looks as though the state of the common people would soon be such that the tyranny of the Grand Turk would be more bearable.&quot;
* In &quot;de bello Turcico&quot;, Erasmus personifies that we should &quot;kill the Turk, not the man.[...]If we really want to heave the Turks from our necks, we must first expel from our hearts a more loathsome race of Turks: avarice, ambition, the craving for power, self-satisfaction, impiety, extravagance, the love of pleasure, deceitfulness, anger, hatred, envy.&quot;

===Pacifism===
Peace, peaceableness, and peacemaking, in all spheres from the domestic to the religious to the political, were central distinctives of Erasmus&#x27; writing on Christian living and his mystical theology: &quot;the sum and summary of our religion is peace and unanimity&quot; At the Nativity of Jesus &quot;&quot;the angels sang not the glories of war, nor a song of triumph, but a hymn of peace.&quot;:&quot;

Erasmus was not an absolute pacifist but promoted political pacificism and religious Irenicism. Notable writings on irenicism include &quot;De Concordia&quot;, &quot;On the War with the Turks&quot;, &quot;The Education of a Christian Prince&quot;, &quot;On Restoring the Concord of the Church&quot;, and &quot;The Complaint of Peace&quot;. Erasmus&#x27; ecclesiology of peacemaking held that the church authorities had a divine mandate to settle religious disputes, in an as non-excluding way as possible, including by the preferably-minimal development of doctrine.

In the latter, Lady Peace insists on peace as the crux of Christian life and for understanding Christ:

A historian has called him &quot;The 16th Century&#x27;s Pioneer of Peace Education and a Culture of Peace&quot;.

Erasmus&#x27; emphasis on peacemaking reflects a typical pre-occupation of medieval lay spirituality as historian John Bossy (as summarized by Eamon Duffy) puts it: &quot;medieval Christianity had been fundamentally concerned with the creation and maintenance of peace in a violent world. &quot;Christianity&quot; in medieval Europe denoted neither an ideology nor an institution, but a community of believers whose religious ideal—constantly aspired to if seldom attained—was peace and mutual love.&quot; 

====War====

Historians have written that &quot;references to conflict run like a red thread through the writings of Erasmus.&quot; Erasmus had experienced war as a child and was particularly concerned about wars between Christian kings, who should be brothers and not start wars; a theme in his book &quot;The Education of a Christian Prince.&quot; His &quot;Adages&quot; included &quot;War is sweet to those who have never tasted it&quot; (&quot;&quot; from Pindar&#x27;s Greek.)

He promoted and was present at the Field of Cloth of Gold, and his wide-ranging correspondence frequently related to issues of peacemaking. He saw a key role of the Church in peacemaking by arbitration and mediation, and the office of the Pope was necessary to rein in tyrannical princes and bishops.

He questioned the practical usefulness and abuses of Just War theory, further limiting it to feasible defensive actions with popular support and that &quot;war should never be undertaken unless, as a last resort, it cannot be avoided.&quot; Defeat should be endured rather than fighting to the end. In his &quot;Adages&quot; he discusses (common translation) &quot;&quot;A disadvantageous peace is better than a just war&quot;&quot;, which owes to Cicero and John Colet&#x27;s &quot;Better an unjust peace than the justest war.&quot; Expansionism could not be justified. Taxes to pay for war should cause the least possible hardship on the poor. He hated sedition as, often, a cause of oppression.

Erasmus was highly critical of the warlike way of important European princes of his era, including some princes of the church. He described these princes as corrupt and greedy. Erasmus believed that these princes &quot;collude in a game, of which the outcome is to exhaust and oppress the commonwealth&quot;. He spoke more freely about this matter in letters sent to his friends like Thomas More, Beatus Rhenanus and Adrianus Barlandus: a particular target of his criticisms was the Emperor Maximilian I, whom Erasmus blamed for allegedly preventing the Netherlands from signing a peace treaty with Guelders and other schemes to cause wars in order to extract money from his subjects.

One of his approaches was to send and publish congratulatory and lionizing letters to princes who, though in a position of strength, negotiated peace with neighbours, such as King Sigismund I the Old of Poland in 1527.

Erasmus &quot;constantly and consistently&quot; opposed the mooted idea of a Christian &quot;universal monarch&quot; with an over-extended empire who could supposedly defeat the Ottoman forces: such universalism did not &quot;hold any promise of generating less conflict than the existing political plurality;&quot; instead, advocating concord between princes, both temporal and spiritual. The spiritual princes, by their arbitration and mediation do not &quot;threaten political plurality, but acts as its defender.&quot;
====Intra-Christian religious toleration====
He referred to his irenical disposition in the Preface to On Free Will as a &quot;secret inclination of nature&quot; that would make him even prefer the views of the Sceptics over intolerant assertions, though he sharply distinguished &quot;adiaphora&quot; from what was uncontentiously explicit in the New Testament or absolutely mandated by Church teaching. Concord demanded unity and assent: Erasmus was anti-sectarian as well as non-sectarian. To follow the law of love, our intellects must be humble and friendly when making any assertions: he called contention &quot;earthly, beastly, demonic&quot; and a good-enough reason to reject a teacher or their followers. In Melanchthon&#x27;s view, Erasmus taught charity, not faith. The centrality of Christian concord to Erasmus&#x27; theology contrasted with the insistence of Martin Luther and, for example, later English Puritans, that (Protestant) truth naturally would create discord and opposition.
Certain works of Erasmus laid a foundation for religious toleration of private opinions and ecumenism. For example, in &quot;De libero arbitrio&quot;, opposing particular views of Martin Luther, Erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language &quot;because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived.&quot; Gary Remer writes, &quot;Like Cicero, Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors.&quot;

In a letter to Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio, Erasmus lobbied diplomatically for toleration: &quot;If the sects could be tolerated under certain conditions (as the Bohemians pretend), it would, I admit, be a grievous misfortune, but one more endurable than war.&quot; But the same dedication to avoiding conflict and bloodshed should be shown by those tempted to join (anti-popist) sects:

====Heresy and sedition====
Erasmus had been involved in early attempts to protect Luther and his sympathisers from charges of heresy. Erasmus wrote &quot;Inquisitio de fide&quot; to say that the Lutherans (of 1523) were not formally heretics: he pushed back against the willingness of some theologians to cry heresy fast in order to enforce their views in universities and at inquisitions.

For Erasmus, punishable heresy had to involve fractiously, dangerously, and publicly agitating against essential doctrines relating to Christ (i.e., blasphemy), with malice, depravity, obstinacy. As with St Theodore the Studite, Erasmus was against the death penalty merely for private or peaceable heresy or for dissent on non-essentials: &quot;It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him.&quot; The Church has the duty to protect believers and convert or heal heretics; he invoked Jesus&#x27; parable of the wheat and tares.

Erasmus&#x27; pacificism included a particular dislike for sedition, which caused warfare:

Erasmus allowed the death penalty against violent seditionists to prevent bloodshed and war: he allowed that the state has the right to execute those who are a necessary danger to public order—whether heretic or orthodox—but noted (e.g., to :fr:Noël Béda) that Augustine had been against the execution of even violent Donatists: Johannes Trapman states that Erasmus&#x27; endorsement of suppression of the Anabaptists springs from their refusal to heed magistrates and the criminal violence of the Münster rebellion not because of their heretical views on baptism. Despite these concessions to state power, Erasmus suggested that religious persecution could still be challenged as inexpedient (ineffective). 

====Outsiders====
Most of his political writing focused on peace within Christendom with almost a sole focus on Europe. In 1516, Erasmus wrote, &quot;It is the part of a Christian prince to regard no one as an outsider unless he is a nonbeliever, and even on them he should inflict no harm&quot;, which entails not attacking outsiders, not taking their riches, not subjecting them to political rule, no forced conversions, and keeping promises made to them.

In common with his times, Erasmus regarded the Jewish and Islamic religions as Christian heresies (and therefore competitors to orthodox Christianity) rather than separate religions, using the inclusive term &quot;half-Christian&quot; for the latter.

However, there is a wide range of scholarly opinion on the extent and nature of antisemitic and anti-Moslem prejudice in his writings: historian Nathan Ron has found his writing to be harsh and racial in its implications, with contempt and hostility to Islam.

=====Turks=====
In his last decade, he involved himself in the public policy debate on war with the Ottoman Empire, which was then invading Western Europe, notably in his book &quot;On the war against the Turks&quot; (1530), as the &quot;reckless and extravagant&quot; Pope Leo X had in previous decades promoted going on the offensive with a new crusade. Erasmus re-worked Luther&#x27;s rhetoric that the invading Turks represent God&#x27;s judgment of decadent Christendom, but without Luther&#x27;s fatalism: Erasmus not only accused Western leaders of kingdom-threatening hypocrisy, he reworked a remedy already decreed by the Fifth Council of the Lateran: anti-expansionist moral reforms by Europe&#x27;s disunited leaders as a necessary unitive political step before any aggressive warfare against the Ottoman threat, reforms which might themselves, if sincere, prevent both the internecine and foreign warfare.

=====Jews=====

Erasmus perceived and championed strong Hellenistic rather than exclusively Hebraic influences on the intellectual milieux of Jesus, Paul, and the early church: &quot;If only the Christian church did not attach so much importance to the Old Testament!&quot; Perhaps the only Jewish book he published was his loose translation of the first century Hellenistic-Judaic &quot;On the Sovereignty of Reason&quot;, better known as 4 Maccabees. 

Erasmus&#x27; pervasive anti-ceremonialism treated the early Church debates on circumcision, food, and special days as manifestations of cultural chauvinism by the initial Jewish Christians in Antioch.

While many humanists, from Pico della Mirandola to Johannes Reuchlin, were intrigued by Jewish mysticism, Erasmus came to dislike it: &quot;I see them as a nation full of most tedious fabrications, who spread a kind of fog over everything, Talmud, Cabbala, Tetragrammaton, Gates of Light, words, words, words. I would rather have Christ mixed up with Scotus than with that rubbish of theirs.&quot;

In his &quot;Paraphrase on Romans&quot;, Erasmus voiced, as Paul, the &quot;secret&quot; that in the end times, &quot;all of the Israelites will be restored to salvation&quot; and accept Christ as their Messiah, &quot;although now part of them have fallen away from it.&quot;

Several scholars have identified cases where Erasmus&#x27; comments appear to go beyond theological anti-Judaism into slurs or approving to an extent certain anti-semitic policies, though there is some controversy.

=====Slaves=====
On the subject of slavery, Erasmus characteristically treated it in passing under the topic of tyranny: Christians were not allowed to be tyrants, which slave-owning required, but especially not to be the masters of other Christians. Erasmus had various other piecemeal arguments against slavery: for example, that it was not legitimate to enslave people taken in an unjust war, but it was not a subject that occupied him. However, his belief that &quot;nature created all men free&quot; (and slavery was imposed) was a rejection of Aristotle&#x27;s category of natural slaves.

====Politics====
Erasmus promoted the idea that a prince rules with the consent of his people, notably in his book &quot;The Education of a Christian Prince&quot; (and, through More, in the book Utopia.) He may have been influenced by the Brabantine custom of an incoming ruler being officially told of his duties and welcomed: the Joyous Entry was a kind of contract. A monarchy should not be absolute: it should be &quot;checked and diluted with a mixture of aristocracy and democracy to prevent it ever breaking out into tyranny.&quot; The same considerations applied to church princes.

Erasmus contrasts the Christian Prince with the Tyrant, who has no love from the people, will be surrounded by flatterers, and can expect no loyalty or peace. Unspoken in Erasmus&#x27; views may have been the idea that the people can remove a tyrant; however, espousing this explicitly could expose people to capital charges of sedition or treason. Erasmus typically limited his political discussion to what could be couched as personal faith and morality by or between Christians, his business as a &quot;magister&quot; of theology.

===Religious reform===
====Personal reform====
Erasmus expressed much of his reform program in terms of the proper attitude towards the sacraments and their ramifications: notably for the underappreciated sacraments of Baptism and Marriage (see &quot;On the Institution of Christian Marriage&quot;) considered as vocations more than events; and for the mysterious Eucharist, pragmatic Confession, the dangerous Last Rites (writing &quot;On the Preparation for Death&quot;), and the pastoral Holy Orders (see &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot;.) Historians have noted that Erasmus commended the benefits of immersive, docile scripture-reading in sacramental terms.

=====Sacraments=====

A test of the Reformation was the doctrine of the sacraments, and the crux of this question was the observance of the Eucharist. Erasmus was concerned that the sacramentarians, headed by Œcolampadius of Basel, were claiming Erasmus held views similar to their own in order to try to claim him for their schismatic and &quot;erroneous&quot; movement. When the Mass was finally banned in Basel in 1529, Erasmus immediately abandoned the city, as did the other expelled Catholic clergy.

In 1530, Erasmus published a new edition of the orthodox treatise of Algerus against the heretic Berengar of Tours in the eleventh century. He added a dedication, affirming his belief in the reality of the Body of Christ after consecration in the Eucharist, commonly referred to as transubstantiation. However, Erasmus found the scholastic formulation of transubstantiation to stretch language past its breaking point.

By and large, the miraculous real change that interested Erasmus, the author, more than that of the bread is the transformation in the humble partaker. Erasmus wrote several notable pastoral books and pamphlets on sacraments, always looking through rather than at the rituals or forms: 
*on marriage and wise matches, 
*preparation for confession and the need for pastoral encouragement, 
*preparation for death and the need to assuage fear, 
*training and helping the preaching duties of priests under bishops, 
*baptism and the need for that faithful to own the baptismal vows made for them.

====Catholic reform====

=====Institutional reforms=====

The Protestant Reformation began in the year following the publication of his pathbreaking edition of the New Testament in Latin and Greek (1516). The issues between the reforming and reactionary tendencies of the church, from which Protestantism later emerged, had become so clear that many intellectuals and churchmen could not escape the summons to join the debate.

According to historian C. Scott Dixon, Erasmus not only criticized church failings but questioned many of his Church&#x27;s basic teachings; however, according to biographer Erika Rummel, &quot;Erasmus was aiming at the correction of abuses rather than at doctrinal innovation or institutional change.&quot;

In theologian Louis Bouyer&#x27;s interpretation, Erasmus&#x27; agenda was &quot;to reform the Church from within by a renewal of biblical theology, based on philological study of the New Testament text, and supported by a knowledge of patristics, itself renewed by the same methods. The final object of it all was to nourish[...]chiefly moral and spiritual reform[...]&quot;

At the height of his literary fame, Erasmus was called upon to take one side, but public partisanship was foreign to his beliefs, nature, and habits. Despite all his criticism of clerical corruption and abuses within the Western Church, especially at first he sided unambiguously with neither Luther nor the anti-Lutherans publicly (though in private he lobbied assiduously against extremism from both parties), but eventually shunned the breakaway Protestant Reformation movements along with their most radical offshoots.

The world had laughed at his satire, &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot;, but few had interfered with his activities. He believed that his work had commended itself to the religious world&#x27;s best minds and dominant powers. Erasmus chose to write in Latin (and Greek), the languages of scholars. He did not build a large body of supporters in the unlettered; his critiques reached a small but elite audience.

Erasmus was also notable for exposing several important historical documents of theological and political importance as forgeries or misattributions: including pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the &quot;Gravi de pugna&quot; attributed to St Augustine, the Ad Herennium attributed to Cicero, and (by reprinting Lorenzo Valla&#x27;s work) the Donation of Constantine.

=====Anti-fraternalism=====
Reacting from his own experiences, Erasmus came to believe that monastic life and institutions no longer served the positive spiritual or social purpose they once may have: in the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; he controversially put it &quot;Monkishness is not piety.&quot; At this time, it was better to live as &quot;a monk in the world&quot; than in the monastery.

Many of his works contain diatribes against supposed monastic corruption and careerism, particularly against the mendicant friars (Franciscans and Dominicans). These orders also typically ran the university&#x27;s Scholastic theology programs, from whose ranks came his most dangerous enemies. The more some attacked him, the more offensive he became about what he saw as their political influence and materialistic opportunism.

He was scandalized by superstitions, such as that if you were buried in a Franciscan habit, you would go direct to heaven. crime and child novices. He advocated various reforms, including a ban on taking orders until the 30th year, the closure of corrupt and smaller monasteries, respect for bishops, requiring work, not begging (reflecting the practice of his own order of Augustinian Canons,) the downplaying of monastic hours, fasts and ceremonies, and a less mendacious approach to gullible pilgrims and tenants.

However, he was not in favour of speedy closures of monasteries, nor of closing larger reformed monasteries with important libraries: in his account of his pilgrimage to Walsingham, he noted that the funds extracted from pilgrims typically supported houses for the poor and elderly.

These ideas widely influenced his generation of humanists, both Catholic and Protestant, and the lurid hyperbolic attacks in his half-satire &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot; were later treated by Protestants as objective reports of near-universal corruption. Furthermore, &quot;what is said over a glass of wine, ought not to be remembered and written down as a serious statement of belief,&quot; such as his proposal to marry all monks to all nuns or to send them all away to fight the Turks and colonize new islands.

He believed the only vow necessary for Christians should be the vow of Baptism, and others such as the vows of the evangelical counsels, while admirable in intent and content, were now mainly counter-productive.

However, Erasmus frequently commended the evangelical counsels for all believers, and with more than lip service: for example, the first adage of his reputation-establishing &quot;Adagia&quot; was &quot;Between friends all is common&quot;, where he tied common ownership (such as practiced by his order&#x27;s style of poverty) with the teachings of classical philosophers and Christ.

His main Catholic opposition was from scholars in the mendicant orders. He purported that &quot;Saint Francis came lately to me in a dream and thanked me for chastising them.&quot; After his lifetime, scholars of mendicant orders have sometimes disputed Erasmus as hyperbolic and ill-informed. A 20th-century Benedictine scholar wrote of him as &quot;all sail and no rudder&quot;.

Erasmus did also have significant support and contact with reform-minded friars, including Franciscans such as Jean Vitrier and Cardinal Cisneros, and Dominicans such as Cardinal Cajetan the former master of the Order of Preachers.

====Protestant reform====
The early reformers built their theology on Erasmus&#x27; philological analyses of specific verses in the New Testament: repentance over penance (the basis of the first thesis of the Luther&#x27;s 95 Theses), justification by imputation, grace as favour or clemency, faith as hoping trust, human transformation over reformation, congregation over church, mystery over sacrament, etc. In Erasmus&#x27; view, they went too far, downplayed Sacred Tradition such as Patristic interpretations, and irresponsibly fomented bloodshed.

Erasmus was one of many scandalized by the sale of indulgences to fund Pope Leo X&#x27;s projects. His view, given in a 1518 letter to John Colet, was less theological than political: &quot;The Roman curia has abandoned any sense of shame. What could be more shameless than these constant indulgences? And now they put up war against the Turks as a pretext, when their aim really is to drive the Spaniards from Naples.&quot;

=====Increasing disagreement with Luther=====

Erasmus and Luther impacted each other greatly. Each had misgivings about each other from the beginning (Erasmus on Luther&#x27;s rash and antagonistic character, Luther on Erasmus&#x27; focus on morality rather than grace) but strategically agreed not to be negative about the other in public.

Noting Luther&#x27;s criticisms of corruption in the Church, Erasmus described Luther to Pope Leo X as &quot;a mighty trumpet of gospel truth&quot; while agreeing, &quot;It is clear that many of the reforms for which Luther calls&quot; (e.g., the sale of indulgences) &quot;are urgently needed.&quot; However, behind the scenes Erasmus forbade his publisher Froben from handling the works of Luther and tried to keep the reform movement focused on institutional rather than theological issues, yet he also privately wrote to authorities to prevent Luther&#x27;s persecution. In the words of one historian, &quot;at this earlier period he was more concerned with the fate of Luther than his theology.&quot;

In 1520, Erasmus wrote that &quot;Luther ought to be answered and not crushed.&quot; However, the publication of Luther&#x27;s &quot;On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church&quot; (Oct 1520) and subsequent bellicosity drained Erasmus&#x27; and many humanists&#x27; sympathy, even more as Christians became partisans and the partisans took to violence.

Luther hoped for his cooperation in a work which seemed only the natural outcome of Erasmus&#x27; own, and spoke with admiration of Erasmus&#x27;s superior learning. In their early correspondence, Luther expressed boundless admiration for all Erasmus had done in the cause of a sound and reasonable Christianity and urged him to join the Lutheran party. Erasmus declined to commit himself, arguing his usual &quot;small target&quot; excuse, that to do so would endanger the cause of which he regarded as one of his purposes in life. Only as an independent scholar could he hope to influence the reform of religion. When Erasmus declined to support him, the &quot;straightforward&quot; Luther became angered that Erasmus was avoiding the responsibility due either to cowardice or a lack of purpose.

However, any hesitancy on the part of Erasmus may have stemmed, not from lack of courage or conviction, but rather from a concern over the mounting disorder and violence of the reform movement. To Philip Melanchthon in 1524 he wrote:

I know nothing of your church; at the very least it contains people who will, I fear, overturn the whole system and drive the princes into using force to restrain good men and bad alike. The gospel, the word of God, faith, Christ, and Holy Spirit – these words are always on their lips; look at their lives and they speak quite another language.

Catholic theologian George Chantraine notes that, where Luther quotes Luke 11:21 &quot;He that is not with me is against me&quot;, Erasmus takes Mark 9:40 &quot;For he that is not against us, is on our part.&quot;

Though he sought to remain accommodative in doctrinal disputes, each side accused him of siding with the other, perhaps because of his perceived influence and what they regarded as his dissembling neutrality, which he regarded as peacemaking accommodation:

=====Dispute on free will=====
By 1523, and first suggested in a letter from Henry VIII, Erasmus had been convinced that Luther&#x27;s ideas on necessity/free will were a subject of core disagreement deserving a public airing, and strategized with friends and correspondents on how to respond with proper moderation without making the situation worse for all, especially for the humanist reform agenda. He eventually chose a campaign that involved an irenical &#x27;dialogue&#x27; &quot;&quot;The Inquisition of Faith&quot;, a positive, evangelical model sermon &quot;On the Measureless Mercy of God&quot;, and a gently critical &#x27;diatribe&#x27; &quot;On Free Will&quot;.&quot;

The publication of his brief book &quot;On Free Will&quot; initiated what has been called &quot;The greatest debate of that era&quot; which still has ramifications today. They bypassed discussion on reforms which they both agreed on in general, and instead dealt with authority and biblical justifications of synergism versus monergism in relation to salvation.

Luther responded with &quot;&quot; (1525).

Erasmus replied to this in his lengthy two volume &quot;Hyperaspistes&quot; and other works, which Luther ignored. Apart from the perceived moral failings among followers of the Reformers—an important sign for Erasmus—he also dreaded any change in doctrine, citing the long history of the Church as a bulwark against innovation. He put the matter bluntly to Luther:
Continuing his chastisement of Luther – and undoubtedly put off by the notion of there being &quot;no pure interpretation of Scripture anywhere but in Wittenberg&quot; – Erasmus touches upon another important point of the controversy:

===== &quot;False evangelicals&quot; =====
In 1529, Erasmus wrote &quot;An epistle against those who falsely boast they are Evangelicals&quot; to (former Bishop of Utrecht, also schooled at Deventer).
Here Erasmus complains of the doctrines and morals of the Reformers, applying the same critique he had made about public Scholastic disputations:
===== Other=====
According to historian Christopher Ocker, the early reformers &quot;needed tools that let their theological distinctions pose as commonplaces in a textual theology;[...] Erasmus provided the tools&quot; but this tendentious distinction-making, reminiscent of the recent excesses of Scholasticism to Erasmus&#x27; eyes, was &quot;was precisely what Erasmus disliked about Luther&quot; and &quot;Protestant polemicists.&quot;

Erasmus wrote books against aspects of the teaching, impacts or threats of several other Reformers:

* Ulrich von Hutten &quot;Spongia adversus aspergines Hutteni&quot; (1523) see below
* Martin Bucer &quot;Responsio ad fratres Inferioris Germaniae ad epistolam apologeticam incerto autoreproditam&quot; (1530)
* Heinrich Eppendorf &quot;Admonitio adversus mendacium et obstrectationem&quot; (1530)

However, Erasmus maintained friendly relations with other Protestants, notably the irenic Melanchthon and Albrecht Duerer.

A common accusation, supposedly started by antagonistic monk-theologians, made Erasmus responsible for Martin Luther and the Reformation: &quot;Erasmus laid the egg, and Luther hatched it.&quot; Erasmus wittily dismissed the charge, claiming that Luther had &quot;hatched a different bird entirely&quot;. Erasmus-reader Peter Canisius commented: &quot;Certainly there was no lack of eggs for Luther to hatch.&quot;

=== Philosophy ===

Erasmus has a problematic standing in the history of philosophy: whether he should be called a philosopher at all, (as, indeed, some question whether he should be considered a theologian either.) Erasmus deemed himself to be a rhetorician (rhetoric being the art of argumentation to find what was most probably true on questions where logic could not provide certainty) or grammarian rather than a philosopher. He was particularly influenced by satirist and rhetorician Lucian. Erasmus&#x27; writings shifted &quot;an intellectual culture from logical disputation about things to quarrels about texts, contexts, and words.&quot;

====Classical====
Erasmus syncretistically took phrases, ideas and motifs from many classical philosophers to furnish discussions of Christian themes: academics have identified aspects of his thought as variously Platonist (duality), Cynical (asceticism),
 Stoic (adiaphora), Epicurean (ataraxia, pleasure as virtue), realist/non-voluntarist,
and Isocratic (rhetoric, political education, syncretism.) However, his Christianized version of Epicureanism is regarded as his own.

Erasmus was sympathetic to a kind of epistemological (Ciceronian not Cartesian) Scepticism:

Historian Kirk Essary has noted that from his earliest to last works Erasmus &quot;regularly denounced the Stoics as specifically unchristian in their hardline position and advocacy of &quot;apatheia&quot;&quot;: warm affection and an appropriately fiery heart being inalienable parts of human sincerity; however historian Ross Dealy sees Erasmus&#x27; decrial of other non-gentle &quot;perverse affections&quot; as having Stoical roots.

Erasmus wrote in terms of a tri-partite nature of man, with the soul the seat of free will:

According to theologian George van Kooten, Erasmus was the first modern scholar &quot;to note the similarities between Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; and John&#x27;s Gospel&quot;, first in the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; then in the &quot;Adagia&quot;, pre-dating other scholarly interest by 400 years.
====Anti-scholasticism====

He usually eschewed metaphysical, epistemological and logical philosophy as found in Aristotle: in particular the curriculum and systematic methods of the post-Aquinas Schoolmen (Scholastics) and what he regarded as their frigid, counter-productive Aristoteleanism: &quot;What has Aristotle to do with Christ?&quot;

Erasmus held that academics must avoid philosophical factionalism as an offense against Christian concord, in order to &quot;make the whole world Christian.&quot; Indeed, Erasmus thought that Scholastic philosophy actually distracted participants from their proper focus on immediate morality, unless used moderately. And, by &quot;excluding the Platonists from their commentaries, they strangle the beauty of revelation.&quot; &quot;They are windbags blown up with Aristotle, sausages stuffed with a mass of theoretical definitions, conclusions, and propositions.&quot;

Nevertheless, church historian Dr Ernst Kohls has commented on a certain closeness of Erasmus&#x27; thought to Thomas Aquinas&#x27;, despite Erasmus&#x27; skepticism about runaway Aristotelianism and his methodological dislike of collections of disconnected sentences for quotation. Ultimately, Erasmus personally owned Aquinas&#x27; &quot;Summa theologiae&quot;, the &quot;Catena aurea&quot; and his commentary on Paul&#x27;s epistles.

====&quot;Philosophia Christi&quot;====
(Not to be confused with his Italian contemporary Chrysostom Javelli&#x27;s &quot;Philosophia Christiana&quot;.)

Erasmus approached classical philosophers theologically and rhetorically: their value was in how they pre-saged, explained or amplified the unique teachings of Christ (particularly the Sermon on the Mount): the &quot;philosophia Christi&quot;. 

In fact, Christ was &quot;the very father of philosophy&quot; (&quot;Anti-Barbieri&quot;.)

In works such as his &quot;Enchiridion&quot;, The Education of a Christian Prince and the Colloquies, Erasmus developed his idea of the &quot;philosophia Christi&quot;, a life lived according to the teachings of Jesus taken as a spiritual-ethical-social-political-legal philosophy:

In philosopher Étienne Gilson&#x27;s summary: &quot;the quite precise goal he pursues is to reject Greek philosophy outside of Christianity, into which the Middle Ages introduced Greek philosophy with the risk of corrupting this Christian Wisdom.&quot;

Useful &quot;philosophy&quot; needed to be limited to (or re-defined as) the practical and moral: 
===Theology===
Three key distinctive features of the spirituality Erasmus proposed are accommodation, inverbation, and &quot;scopus christi&quot;. 

In the view of literary historian Chester Chapin, Erasmus&#x27; tendency of thought was &quot;towards cautious &quot;dulcification&quot; of the traditional [Catholic] view&quot;.

====Accommodation====
Historian Manfred Hoffmann has described accommodation as &quot;the single most important concept in Erasmus&#x27; hermeneutic&quot;.

For Erasmus, accommodation is a universal concept: humans must accommodate each other, must accommodate the church and &quot;vice versa&quot;, and must take as their model how Christ accommodated the disciples in his interactions with them, and accommodated humans in his incarnation; which in turn merely reflects the eternal mutual accommodation within the Trinity. And the primary mechanism of accommodation is language, which mediates between reality and abstraction, which allows disputes of all kinds to be resolved and the gospel to be transmitted: in his New Testament, Erasmus notably translated the Greek &quot;logos&quot; in John 1:1 &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot; more like &quot;In the beginning was Speech: using Latin &quot;sermo&quot; (discourse, conversation, language) not &quot;verbum&quot; (word) emphasizing the dynamic and interpersonal communication rather than static principle: &quot;Christ incarnate as the eloquent oration of God&quot;: &quot;He is called Speech [sermo], because through him God, who in his own nature cannot be comprehended by any reasoning, wished to become known to us.&quot;

The role models of accommodation were Paul, that &quot;chameleon&quot; (or &quot;slippery squid&quot;) and Christ, who was &quot;more mutable than Proteus himself.&quot;

Following Paul, Quintillian (&quot;apte diecere&quot;) and Gregory the Great&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral Care&quot;, Erasmus wrote that the orator, preacher or teacher must &quot;adapt their discourse to the characteristics of their audience&quot;; this made pastoral care the &quot;art of arts&quot;. Erasmus wrote that most of his original works, from satires to paraphrases, were essentially the same themes packaged for different audiences.

In this light, Erasmus&#x27; ability to have friendly correspondence with both Thomas More and Thomas Bolyn, and with both Philip Melanchthon and Pope Adrian VI, can be seen as outworkings of his theology, rather than slippery insincerity or flattery of potential patrons. Similarly, it shows the theological basis of his pacificism, and his view of ecclesiastical authorities—from priests like himself to Church Councils—as necessary mediating peace-brokers.

====Inverbation====
For Erasmus, further to accommodating humans in his Incarnation, Christ accommodated humans by a kind of &quot;inverbation&quot;: we now knowing the resurrection, Christ is revealed by the Gospels in a way that we can know him better by reading him than those who actually heard him speak; this will or may transform us.

Since the Gospels become in effect like sacraments, for Erasmus reading them becomes a form of prayer which is spoiled by taking single sentences in isolation and using them as syllogisms. Instead, learning to understand the context, genres and literary expression in the New Testament becomes a spiritual more than academic exercise. Erasmus&#x27; has been called rhetorical theology (&quot;theologia rhetorica&quot;.)

====Scopus christi====
&quot;Scopus&quot; is the unifying reference point, the navigation goal, or the organizing principle of topics. According to his assistant-turned-foe, Œcolampadius, Erasmus&#x27;s rule was &quot;nihil in sacris literis praeter Christum quaerendum&quot; (&quot;nothing is to be sought in the sacred letters but Christ&quot;).

In Hoffmann&#x27;s words, for Erasmus &quot;Christ is the &quot;scopus&quot; of everything&quot;: &quot;the focus in which both dimensions of reality, the human and the divine, intersect&quot; and so He himself is the hermeneutical principle of scripture&quot;: &quot;the middle is the medium, the medium is the mediator, the mediator is the reconciler&quot;. In Erasmus&#x27; early &quot;Enchiridion&quot; he had given this &quot;scopus&quot; in typical medieval terms of an ascent of being to God (vertical), but from the mid-1510s life he moved to an analogy of Copernican planetary circling around Christ the centre (horizontal) or Columbian navigation towards a destination.

One effect is that scriptural interpretation must be done starting with the teachings and interactions of Jesus in the Gospels, with the Sermon on the Mount serving as the starting point, and arguably with the Beatitudes and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer at the head of the queue. This privileges peacemaking, mercy, meekness, purity of heart, hungering after righteousness, poverty of spirit, etc. as the unassailable core of Christianity and piety and true theology.

The Sermon on the Mount provides the axioms on which every legitimate theology must be built, as well as the ethics governing theological discourse, and the rules for validating theological products; Erasmus&#x27; &quot;philosophia christi&quot; treats the primary and initial teaching of Jesus in the first Gospel as a theological methodology.

For example, &quot;peacemaking&quot; is a possible topic in any Christian theology; but for Erasmus, from the Beatitude, it must be a starting-, reference- and ending-point when discussing all other theological notions, such as church authority, the Trinity, etc. Moreover, Christian theology must only be &quot;done&quot; in a peacemaking fashion for peacemaking purposes; and any theology that promotes division and warmongering is thereby anti-Christian. 

====Mystical theology====
Another important concept to Erasmus was &quot;the Folly of the Cross&quot; (which &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot; explored): the view that Truth belongs to the exuberant, perhaps ecstatic, world of what is foolish, strange, unexpected and even superficially repellent to us, rather than to the frigid worlds which intricate scholastic dialectical and syllogistic philosophical argument all too often generated; this produced in Erasmus a profound disinterest in hyper-rationality, and an emphasis on verbal, rhetorical, mystical, pastoral and personal/political moral concerns instead.

====Theological writings====

Several scholars have suggested Erasmus wrote as an evangelist not an academic theologian. Even &quot;theology was to be metamorphic speech, converting persons to Christ.&quot; Erasmus did not conceive of Christianity as fundamentally an intellectual system:

Historian William McCuaig commented &quot;I have never read a work by him on any subject that was not at bottom a piece of evangelical literature.&quot;

Apart from these programmatic works, Erasmus also produce a number of prayers, sermons, essays, masses and poems for specific benefactors and occasions, often on topics where Erasmus and his benefactor agreed. His thought was particularly influenced by Origen.

He often set himself the challenge of formulating positive, moderate, non-superstitious versions of contemporary Catholic practices that might be more acceptable both to scandalized Catholics and Protestants of good will: the better attitudes to the sacraments, saints, Mary, indulgences, statues, scriptural ignorance and fanciful Biblical interpretation, prayer, dietary fasts, external ceremonialism, authority, vows, docility, submission to Rome, etc. For example, in his &quot;Paean in Honour of the Virgin Mary&quot; (1503) Erasmus elaborated his theme that the Incarnation had been hinted far and wide, which could impact the theology of the fate of the remote unbaptized and grace, and the place of classical philosophy:

==Works==
Erasmus was the most popular, most printed and arguably most influential author of the early sixteenth century, read in all nations in the West and frequently translated. By the 1530s, his writings accounted for 10–20% of book sales in Europe. &quot;Undoubtedly he was the most read author of his age.&quot; His vast number of Latin and Greek publications included translations, paraphrases, letters, textbooks, plays for schoolboys, commentary, poems, liturgies, satires, sermons, and prayers. A large number of his later works were defences of his earlier work from attacks by Catholic and Protestant theological and literary opponents.

The &quot;Catalogue of the Works of Erasmus&quot; (2023) runs to 444 entries (120 pages), almost all from the latter half of his life. He usually wrote books in particular classical literary genres with their different rhetorical conventions: complaint, diatribe, dialogue, encomium, epistle, commentary, liturgy, sermon, etc. His letter to Ulrich von Hutten on Thomas More&#x27;s household has been called &quot;the first real biography in the real modern sense.&quot;

From his youth, Erasmus had been a voracious writer. Erasmus wrote or answered up to 40 letters per day, usually waking early in the morning and writing them in his own hand. He did not work after dinner. His writing method (recommended in &quot;De copia&quot; and &quot;De ratione studii&quot;) was to make notes on whatever he was reading, categorized by theme: he carted these commonplaces in boxes that accompanied him. When assembling a new book, he would go through the topics and cross out commonplace notes as he used them. This catalog of research notes allowed him to rapidly create books, though woven from the same topics. Towards the end of his life, as he lost dexterity, he employed secretaries or amanuenses who performed the assembly or transcription, re-wrote his writing, and in his last decade, recorded his dictation; letters were usually in his own hand, unless formal. For much of his career he wrote standing at a desk, as shown in Dürer&#x27;s portrait.

===Notable writings===

Erasmus wrote for educated audiences both

* on subjects of humanist interest: &quot;Three areas preoccupied Erasmus as a writer: language arts, education, and biblical studies. [...]All of his works served as models of style. [...]He pioneered the principles of textual criticism.&quot; and
* on pastoral subjects: &quot;to Christians in the various stages of lives:[...]for the young, for married couples, for widows,&quot; the dying, clergy, theologians, religious, princes, partakers of sacraments, etc.

He is noted for his extensive scholarly editions of the New Testament in Latin and Greek, and the complete works of numerous Church Fathers. These formed the basis of the so-called Textus Receptus Protestant bibles.

The only works with enduring popularity in modern time are his satires and semi-satires: &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot;, &quot;Julius Excluded from Heaven&quot; and &quot;The Complaint of Peace&quot;. However, his other works, such as his several thousand letters, continue to be a vital source of information to historians of numerous disciplines.

==Legacy and evaluations==

Erasmus was given the sobriquet &quot;Prince of the Humanists&quot;, and has been called &quot;the crowning glory of the Christian humanists&quot;. He has also been called &quot;the most illustrious rhetorician and educationalist of the Renaissance&quot;.

However, at times he has been viciously criticized, his works suppressed, his expertise corralled, his writings misinterpreted, his thought demonized, and his legacy marginalized. He was never judged and declared a heretic by the Catholic Church, during his lifetime or after: a semi-secret trial in Vallodolid Spain, in 1527 found him not to be a heretic, and he was sponsored and protected by Popes and Bishops.

==Personal==
===Health===
Erasmus was a quite sickly man and frequently worked from his sickbed. As a teenager he contracted Quartan fever, a non-lethal type of Malaria which recurred numerous times for the rest of his life: he attributed his survival to the intercession of St Genevieve. His digestion gave him trouble: he was intolerant of fish, beer and some wines, which were the standard diet for members of religious orders; he eventually died following an attack of dysentery.

In Cambridge he was ill, possibly with the English sweating sickness. He suffered kidney stones from his time in Venice and, in late life, with gout In 1514, he suffered a fall from his horse and injured his back.

In 1528 he suffered recurrent episodes of the stone, &quot;from which he almost died.&quot;
In 1529 his self-removal from Basel was delayed because of headcold and fever. In 1530 while traveling he suffered some near-fatal illness which several doctors diagnosed as the plague (which had killed his parents) but several others diagnosed as not the plague.

Various illnesses have been diagnosed of the skeletons claimed to be his, including pustulotic arthro-osteitis, syphilis or yaws. Other doctors have diagnosed from his written descriptions ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, enteric rheumatism and spondylarthritis.

=== Clothing ===

Until Erasmus received his 1505 and 1517 Papal dispensations to wear clerical garb, Erasmus wore versions of the local habit of his order, the Canons regular of St Augustine, Chapter of Sion, which varied by region and house, unless travelling: in general, a white or perhaps black cassock with linen and lace choir rochet for liturgical contexts, or otherwise with white &#x27; (scarf) (over left shoulder), or almuce (cape), perhaps with an asymmetrical black cope of cloth or sheepskin (&#x27;) or long black cloak.

From 1505, and certainly after 1517, he dressed as a scholar-priest. He preferred warm and soft garments: according to one source, he arranged for his clothing to be stuffed with fur to protect him against the cold, and his habit counted with a collar of fur which usually covered his nape.

All Erasmus&#x27; portraits show him wearing a knitted scholar&#x27;s bonnet.
=== Signet ring and personal motto ===

Erasmus chose the Roman god of borders and boundaries Terminus as a personal symbol and had a signet ring with a herm he thought depicted Terminus carved into a carnelian. The herm was presented to him in Rome by his student Alexander Stewart and in reality depicted the Greek god Dionysus. The ring was also depicted in a portrait of his by the Flemish painter Quentin Matsys.
The herm became part of the Erasmus branding at Froben, and is on his tombstone. In the early 1530s, Erasmus was portrayed as Terminus by Hans Holbein the Younger.
He chose &quot;&quot; (Lat. &quot;I concede to no-one&quot;) as his personal motto. The obverse of the medal by Quintin Matsys featured the Terminus herm. Mottoes on medals, along the circumference, included &quot;A better picture of Erasmus is shown in his writing&quot;, and &quot;Contemplate the end of a long life&quot; and Horace&#x27;s &quot;Death is the ultimate boundary of things,&quot; which re-casts the motto as a &quot;memento mori&quot;. There were anachronistic claims that his motto was a favourable nod to Luther&#x27;s &quot;Here I stand&quot; which Erasmus denied.

===Representations===

Erasmus frequently gifted portraits and medals with his image to friends and patrons.
* Hans Holbein painted him at least three times and perhaps as many as seven, some of the Holbein portraits of Erasmus surviving only in copies by other artists. Holbein&#x27;s three profile portraits – two (nearly identical) profile portraits and one three-quarters-view portrait – were all painted in the same year, 1523. Erasmus used the Holbein portraits as gifts for his friends in England, such as William Warham, the Archbishop of Canterbury. (Writing in a letter to Warham regarding the gift portrait, Erasmus quipped that &quot;he might have something of Erasmus should God call him from this place.&quot;) Erasmus spoke favourably of Holbein as an artist and person but was later critical, accusing him of sponging off various patrons whom Erasmus had recommended, for purposes more of monetary gain than artistic endeavor. There were scores of copies of these portraits made in Erasmus&#x27; time. Holbein&#x27;s 1532 profile woodcut was particularly lauded by those who knew Erasmus.
* Albrecht Dürer also produced portraits of Erasmus, whom he met three times, in the form of an engraving of 1526 and a preliminary charcoal sketch. Concerning the former Erasmus was unimpressed, declaring it an unfavorable likeness of him, perhaps because around 1525 he was suffering severely from kidney stones. Nevertheless, Erasmus and Dürer maintained a close friendship, with Dürer going so far as to solicit Erasmus&#x27;s support for the Lutheran cause, which Erasmus politely declined. Erasmus wrote a glowing encomium about the artist, likening him to famous Greek painter of antiquity Apelles. Erasmus was deeply affected by his death in 1528.
* Quentin Matsys produced the earliest known portraits of Erasmus, including an oil painting from life in 1517 (which had to be delayed as Erasmus&#x27; pain distorted his face) and a medal in 1519.
* In 1622, Hendrick de Keyser cast a statue of Erasmus in (gilt) bronze replacing an earlier stone version from 1557, itself replacing a wooden one of 1549, possibly a gift from the City of Basel. This was set up in the public square in Rotterdam, and today may be found outside the St. Lawrence Church. It is the oldest bronze statue in the Netherlands.
* In 1790, Georg Wilhelm Göbel struck commemorative medals.&#x27;
* Canterbury Cathedral, England has a statue of Erasmus on the North Face, placed in 1870.
* Actor Ken Bones portrays Erasmus in David Starkey&#x27;s 2009 documentary series &quot;Henry VIII: The Mind of a Tyrant&quot;

===Name used===
* The European Erasmus Programme of exchange students within the European Union is named after him. 
** The original Erasmus Programme scholarships enable European students to spend up to a year of their university courses in a university in another European country, commemorating Erasmus&#x27; impulse to travel. 
** The European Union cites the successor Erasmus+ programme as a &quot;key achievement&quot;: &quot;Almost 640,000 people studied, trained or volunteered abroad in 2020.&quot; 
** The parallel Erasmus Mundus project is aimed at attracting non-European students to study in Europe. 
* The Erasmus Prize is one of Europe&#x27;s foremost recognitions for culture, society or social science. It was won by Wikipedia in 2015.
* The Erasmus Lectures are an annual lecture on religious subjects, given by prominent Christian (mainly Catholic) and Jewish intellectuals, most notably by Joseph Ratzinger in 1988.
* A peer-reviewed annual scholarly journal &quot;Erasmus Studies&quot; has been produced since 1981. 
* Rotterdam has the Erasmus University Rotterdam:
** It has the Erasmus Institute for Philosophy and Economics (EIPE), which produces the &quot;Erasmus Journal of Philosophy and Economics&quot; 
** Erasmus University College is an &quot;international, interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science programme in Liberal Arts and Sciences.&quot;
* From 1997 to 2008, the American University of Notre Dame had an Erasmus Institute.
* The Erasmus Building in Luxembourg was completed in 1988 as the first addition to the headquarters of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The building houses the chambers of the judges of the CJEU&#x27;s General Court and three courtrooms. It is next to the Thomas More Building.
* Rotterdam has an Erasmus Bridge.
* Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, has an Erasmus Tower, Erasmus Building and an Erasmus Room. Until the early 20th century, Queens&#x27; College used to have a corkscrew that was purported to be &quot;Erasmus&#x27; corkscrew&quot;, which was a third of a metre long; as of 1987, the college still had what it calls &quot;Erasmus&#x27; chair&quot;.
* Several schools, faculties and universities in the Netherlands and Belgium are named after him, as is Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn, New York, US.

=== Exhumation ===
In 1928, the site of Erasmus&#x27; grave was dug up, and a body identified in the bones and examined. In 1974, remains were dug up in a slightly different location, accompanied by an Erasmus medal. Both remains have been claimed to be Erasmus&#x27;. However, it is possible neither is. The first bones were taller than expected and syphilitic; the second fitted the reported size and age but were accidentally smashed during photography.

<text>Encyclopedia Brown is a series of books featuring the adventures of boy detective Leroy Brown, nicknamed &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; for his intelligence and range of knowledge. The 29 books in the children&#x27;s literature series were written (one co-written) by Donald J. Sobol, with the first book published in 1963 and the last published posthumously in 2012. In addition to the main books, the &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; series has spawned a comic strip, a TV series, and compilation books of puzzles and games.

Sobol&#x27;s first &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; book was written in two weeks; subsequent books took about six months to write. Its main publisher was Bantam Skylark.

==Style==
Each book in the &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; mystery series is self contained in that the reader is not required to have read earlier books in order to understand the stories. The major characters, settings, etc. are usually introduced (or reintroduced) in each book.

Books featuring Brown are subdivided into a number—usually ten or more—of (possibly interlinked) short stories, each of which presents a mystery. The mysteries are intended to be solved by the reader, thanks to the placement of a logical or factual inconsistency somewhere within the text. This is very similar to the layout of Donald Sobol&#x27;s other book series, &quot;Two-Minute Mysteries&quot;. Many of the mysteries involve Brown helping his father, the local police chief, solve a crime; Brown outwitting town bully Bugs Meany, the leader of a gang known as the Tigers; or Brown being aided by Sally Kimball, his partner, close friend, and bodyguard. Brown, his father, or Sally invariably solves the case by exposing this inconsistency, detailed in the &quot;Answers&quot; section in the back of the book.

==Formula==

Often, these books follow a formula where the first chapter involves Brown solving a case at the dinner table for his father, the local police chief in the fictional seaside town of Idaville in an unspecified state. When Chief Brown barely tastes his meal, that is a cue he was handed a difficult case. He pulls out his casebook and goes over it with the family. Encyclopedia solves these cases by briefly closing his eyes while he thinks deeply, then asking a single question which directly leads to him finding the solution.

The second mystery often begins in the Brown garage on Rover Avenue, where Encyclopedia has set up his own detective agency to help neighborhood children solve cases for &quot;25 cents per day, plus expenses - No case too small.&quot; This second case usually involves the town bully and mischief maker Bugs Meany, leader of a gang who call themselves the Tigers, who, after being foiled, will attempt revenge in the third mystery.

In the third mystery, the plot involves Encyclopedia&#x27;s partner, close friend, and bodyguard, Sally Kimball, the one person under 14 years of age to physically stand up to Bugs. She is the only reason neither Bugs nor any of his Tigers ever try to physically attack Encyclopedia. Encyclopedia tends to dislike anyone whom Sally has a crush on, possibly indicating that he has a crush on her. Also intelligent, Sally once attempted—in the first book of the series—to prove herself smarter than Encyclopedia by stumping him with a mystery of her own creation. Ironically, the contest was held at the Tigers&#x27; clubhouse, with Bugs and the others cheering him on. However, she was beaten in the contest (although Encyclopedia admitted that she almost tricked him), after which she became his friend. In subsequent storylines Bugs or his gang usually set up some sort of trap to get Encyclopedia or Sally in trouble. However, as in the previous story, they make a key mistake which Encyclopedia exposes.

Later cases may find Encyclopedia assisting his father at a crime scene (rarely more serious than larceny, and Encyclopedia is always discreet when helping his father) or interacting with people around town, often exposing scams. One such example is a high school dropout and would-be con artist named Wilford Wiggins who spends time trying to dream up schemes to fleece kids out of their money. Like Bugs, his schemes have an inconsistency which Encyclopedia exposes.

In some cases it is Sally and not Encyclopedia who figures it out because, as she tells Encyclopedia, &quot;You are a boy.&quot; In other words, she notices things that only a girl would find inconsistent. Sally further displays her intelligence in the various mysteries in that she often can deduce who committed the crime, or whether a certain person is lying, but she simply cannot always prove it.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; books have experienced some enduring popularity.

In 1976, the Mystery Writers of America honored Sobol and his Encyclopedia Brown series with a special Edgar Award.

Educators have used Encyclopedia Brown in classrooms to instruct students in skills such as writing reports. In 1986, the Society for Visual Education, Inc. published a filmstrip series with accompanying audio cassette tapes and workbooks for elementary and middle schools&#x27; use. Four Encyclopedia Brown stories were utilized: &quot;The Case of the Missing Statue&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Happy Nephew&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Kidnapped Pigs&quot;, and &quot;The Case of the Marble Shooter&quot;. According to WorldCat&#x27;s library catalog listing, &quot;As super-sleuth Encyclopedia Brown solves four mysteries, he shows students how he fills out his reports, including selecting a topic, gathering information, taking notes, making an outline, and revising and editing.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
===Comic strip===
From December 3, 1978, to September 20, 1980, &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; was a daily and Sunday comic strip syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate. The artwork was done by Frank Bolle, and Donald J. Sobol was credited as the writer. When the strips were collected into books in the mid-1980s, the strip was credited to Elliot Caplin, based on Sobol&#x27;s characters. The strips adapted Sobol stories, both ones that had originally been Encyclopedia Brown tales and ones that had been part of Sobol&#x27;s syndicated &quot;Two-Minute Mysteries&quot; features.

===TV series===
A live action television series adaptation, also called &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot;, ran on HBO starting in 1989. Scott Bremner played the title role, with Laura Bridge playing Sally. The series ran for eight episodes. It was produced by Howard David Deutsch and directed by Savage Steve Holland. Parts of the series were filmed in Provo, Utah.

The series began with an hour-long special, &quot;The Case of the Missing Time Capsule&quot;, and subsequent six episodes were 30 minutes long.

#&quot;The Case of the Missing Time Capsule&quot; (hour long special first aired on March 2, 1989, to kick off series and aired over 200 times on HBO) &quot;Idaville is celebrating its 100th birthday by opening a time capsule left by the town founder. But before anyone can discover what riches it contains, the capsule is stolen! When E.B. and his friend Sally investigate, they find no shortage of suspects.
#&quot;The Case of the Missing U.F.O.&quot; (Case #529) aired first on 3/9/90. Something eerie is going on in Idaville when a flying saucer and flashing lights appear in the night sky. Encyclopedia Brown and his side-kick Sally interrupt their relaxing camping getaway to brave the unknown and uncover the mystery of the U.F.O.
#&quot;The Case of the Amazing Race Car&quot; (case #524) first aired 3/16/1990. Davey looks like a sure winner in a funny car derby, that is, until someone steals his car. Encyclopedia Brown steps in to solve the mystery.
#&quot;The Case of the Ghostly Rider&quot; (case #525) aired 3/23/1990. The ghost of the WildCat Kid has returned to haunt Old Glennville, can EB and Sally with a little help from Bugs Meany save the day?
#&quot;The Case of the Flaming Beauty Queen&quot; (case #932) first aired 6/5/1990. Encyclopedia Brown investigates who set the fires in the library and whether the case of the hidden money is a scam or not.
#&quot;The Case of the Incredible Culpepper&quot; first aired 7/10/1990. This episode does not seem to have been released to VHS. The big Idaville magic show is spoiled when a mountain lion belonging to The Incredible Culpepper is stolen. E.B. and Sally are immediately on the case and identify several suspects. With their typical detective skills they soon solve the crime and return the lion to Culpepper. The magic show finally entertains all the good folks of the town- Thanks to Encyclopedia Brown.)
#&quot;The Case of the Burglared Baseball Cards&quot; (case #523) first aired 9/1/1990. Encyclopedia looks into the late night theft of a priceless collection of baseball cards.
#&quot;Encyclopedia Brown, The Boy Detective in One Minute Mysteries,&quot; released straight to video (This includes 5 of the Encyclopedia Brown stories from the books, &quot;The Case of the Scattered Cards&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Foot Warmer&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Bitter Drink&quot;, “The Case of the Civil War Sword&quot;, and &quot;The Case of the Great Merko&quot;.)
Many of these episodes were later released on VHS.

===Film===
In June 2013, Warner Bros. optioned the &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; books into a feature film. Matt Johnson was in talks to write the movie. Roy Lee and Howard David Deutsch (producer of the 1989 &quot;Encyclopedia Brown&quot; TV series) and Jonathan Zakin were announced as producing.

==Solve-It-Yourself Mystery Sweepstakes==
From January 15 to June 30, 1989, a special Solve-It-Yourself Mystery Sweepstakes was held in conjunction with the Encyclopedia Brown books and Bantam Books. In the back of specially marked copies of &quot;Encyclopedia Brown and the Case of the Treasure Hunt&quot;, Sobol presented an unsolved mystery for the contestant to solve and submit an answer for a chance to win a prize. The mystery for the contest was called &quot;The Case of the Missing Birthday Gift&quot;, wherein Encyclopedia had to solve the case of a stolen bicycle that was given as a birthday gift to Willie Grant on his tenth birthday. The Tigers make an appearance as the suspects in the case; Bugs Meany, Jack Beck, and Rocky Graham all show up at the Tigers&#x27; clubhouse.

Contestants were allowed to enter as many times as they wished, provided they used a separate envelope for each entry. The sweepstakes was only available to US and Canada residents. No purchase was necessary, as one could either use the official form in the back of specially marked copies of &quot;Encyclopedia Brown and the Case of the Treasure Hunt&quot; or send in a 3&quot; by 5&quot; index card with the solution and the contestant&#x27;s contact information.

==Parodies and tributes==
The satirical newspaper &quot;The Onion&quot; ran an article in 2003 titled &quot;Idaville Detective &#x27;Encyclopedia&#x27; Brown Found Dead In Library Dumpster&quot;, which stated that Encyclopedia Brown, now a middle-aged police detective, had been murdered. The article parodied the books&#x27; tendency to have crimes solved through knowledge of trivia, and ended with Bugs Meany, who was now police commissioner, stating that he had an alibi for the murder in that &quot;I was at the North Pole watching the penguins.&quot; (Penguins reside almost exclusively south of the Equator, and so there are none in the northern polar regions.)

Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips&#x27; &quot;Criminal: Last of the Innocent&quot; graphic novel features a reference to Encyclopedia Brown, with a grown-up analogue of Encyclopedia featured in the comic, as confirmed by Ed Brubaker himself.

The comic strip &quot;FoxTrot&quot; ran a 2000 storyline where Jason and Marcus try their hand at being private investigators, out to solve a theft perpetrated on their girlfriends. One agency name they tried was &quot;Encyclopedias Brown And White&quot; (because Marcus is African-American and Jason is Caucasian), which became the title of &quot;FoxTrot&quot;&#x27;s next book of comics.

The protagonist of the 2020 film &quot;The Kid Detective&quot; is a former child prodigy detective, now an unsuccessful adult, living in a small town.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;500 Keys&quot;, the grave of Encyclopedia Brown is shown briefly next to those of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, to which Lisa comments &quot;Jeez, they&#x27;re dropping like flies&quot;.

In the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;The Futurama Mystery Liberry&quot;, the character is parodied as Wikipedia Brown.

<text>An empire is a political unit made up of several territories, military outposts, and peoples, &quot;usually created by conquest, and divided between a dominant center and subordinate peripheries&quot;. The center of the empire (sometimes referred to as the metropole) has political control over the peripheries. Within an empire, different populations have different sets of rights and are governed differently. The word derives from the Roman imperium. Narrowly defined, an empire is a sovereign state whose head of state is an emperor or empress; but not all states with aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities are called empires or are ruled by an emperor; nor have all self-described empires been accepted as such by contemporaries and historians (the Central African Empire, and some Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in early England being examples).

There have been &quot;ancient and modern, centralized and decentralized, ultra-brutal and relatively benign&quot; empires. An important distinction has been between land empires made up solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austrian Empire or the Russian Empire; and those created by sea-power, which include territories that are remote from the &#x27;home&#x27; country of the empire, such as the Spanish Empire or the British Empire. 

Aside from the more formal usage, the concept of &quot;empire&quot; is associated with such concepts as &quot;imperialism&quot;, &quot;colonialism&quot;, and &quot;globalization&quot;, with imperialism referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. The word &quot;empire&quot; can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), a political organization controlled by a single individual (a political boss), or a group (political bosses). &quot;Empire&quot; is often used as a term to describe overpowering situations causing displeasure.

==Definition==
An empire is an aggregate of many separate states or territories under a supreme ruler or oligarchy. This is in contrast to a federation, which is an extensive state voluntarily composed of autonomous states and peoples. An empire is a large polity which rules over territories outside of its original borders.

Definitions of what physically and politically constitutes an empire vary. It might be a state affecting imperial policies or a particular political structure. Empires are typically formed from diverse ethnic, national, cultural, and religious components. &#x27;Empire&#x27; and &#x27;colonialism&#x27; are used to refer to relationships between a powerful state or society versus a less powerful one; Michael W. Doyle has defined empire as &quot;effective control, whether formal or informal, of a subordinated society by an imperial society&quot;.

Imperialism for Doyle is simply the process of establishing and maintaining an empire. This is not to be confused with the Imperialism in the Marxist-Leninst sense of late modern phenomenon following the European Colonialism and representing the last stage of Capitalism. Initially, the term was New Imperialism, where the qualifier &quot;new&quot; differentiated the contemporary imperialism from earlier imperialism, such as the formation of ancient empires and the first wave of European colonization. Eventually, Lenin cancelled all earlier forms and began the history of Imperialism in the 1760s. The Leninist definition of imperialism removed the essence of empire from politics to economics and explicitly denied that modern capitalist imperialism had anything in common with the empires of the past. Few historians follow the Marxist approach and most recognize that imperialism predates the European colonialism and capitalism by 4.5 millennia at least. The Marxist historians moved so far from mainstream historians’ debates on empire that communication almost ceases.

Tom Nairn and Paul James define empires as polities that &quot;extend relations of power across territorial spaces over which they have no prior or given legal sovereignty, and where, in one or more of the domains of economics, politics, and culture, they gain some measure of extensive hegemony over those spaces to extract or accrue value&quot;. Rein Taagepera has defined an empire as &quot;any relatively large sovereign political entity whose components are not sovereign&quot;. Peter Bang characterizes empire as &quot;composite, layered and anything but uniform in their internal organization of power,&quot; and comprising &quot;a range of different territories and communities, subjected hierarchically in various ways to a dominant power.&quot; 

However, sometimes an empire is only a semantic construction, such as when a ruler assumes the title of &quot;emperor&quot;. That polity over which the ruler reigns logically becomes an &quot;empire&quot;, despite having no additional territory or hegemony. Examples of this form of empire are the Central African Empire, Mexican Empire, or the Korean Empire proclaimed in 1897 when Korea, far from gaining new territory, was on the verge of being annexed by the Empire of Japan, one of the last to use the name officially. Among the last states in the 20th century known as empires in this sense were the Central African Empire, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Manchukuo, Russia, Germany, and Korea.

Scholars typically distinguish empires from nation-states. In an empire, there is a hierarchy whereby one group of people (usually, the metropole) has command over other groups of people, and there is a hierarchy of rights and prestige for different groups of people. Josep Colomer distinguished between empires and states in the following way:

# Empires were vastly larger than states
# Empires lacked fixed or permanent boundaries whereas a state had fixed boundaries
# Empires had a &quot;compound of diverse groups and territorial units with asymmetric links with the center&quot; whereas a state had &quot;supreme authority over a territory and population&quot;
# Empires had multi-level, overlapping jurisdictions whereas a state sought monopoly and homogenization

==Characteristics==
Many empires were the result of military conquest, incorporating the vanquished states into a political union, but imperial hegemony can be established in other ways. According to Edward Luttwak, there are two main ways to establish and maintain an imperial political structure: (i) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control by force or (ii) as a coercive, hegemonic empire of indirect control. The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons. The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control, but avails military forces for further expansion.

Empires can expand by both land and sea. Territorial empires (e.g. the Macedonian Empire and Byzantine Empire) tend to be contiguous areas extending directly outwards from the original frontier. The terrestrial empire&#x27;s maritime analogue is the thalassocracy, an empire composed of islands and coasts which are accessible to its terrestrial homeland, such as the Athenian-dominated Delian League and British empires) with looser structures and more scattered territories, often consisting of many islands and other forms of possessions which required the creation and maintenance of a powerful navy.

The Athenian Empire, the Roman Empire, and the British Empire developed at least in part under elective auspices. Empires such as the Holy Roman Empire also came together by electing the emperor with votes from member realms through the Imperial election. The Empire of Brazil declared itself an empire after separating from the Portuguese Empire in 1822. France has twice transitioned from being called the French Republic to being called the French Empire while it retained an overseas empire. Europeans began applying the designation of &quot;empire&quot; to non-European monarchies, such as the Qing Empire and the Mughal Empire, as well as the Maratha Confederacy, eventually leading to the looser denotations applicable to any political structure meeting their criteria of &quot;imperium&quot;. Some monarchies styled themselves as having greater size, scope, and power than the territorial, politico-military, and economic facts support. As a consequence, some monarchs assumed the title of &quot;emperor&quot; (or its corresponding translation, &quot;tsar&quot;, &quot;empereur&quot;, &quot;kaiser&quot;, &quot;shah&quot; etc.) and renamed their states as &quot;The Empire of ...&quot;

Empires were seen as an expanding power, administration, ideas, beliefs and cultural habits. Some empires tended to impose their culture on the subject states to strengthen the imperial structure; others opted for multicultural and cosmopolitan policies. Cultures generated by empires could have notable effects that outlasted the empire itself. 

In the mid-Twentieth century, the word &quot;empire&quot; obtained a negative connotation, viewed as inherently immoral or illegitimate. Traditional or overt empire destroyed and discredited itself in the World Wars. The matters are worse in the German language where empire is &quot;reich&quot; and immediately associates with the Third Reich. For the first time in history, countries which proudly called themselves empires disappeared from the map. The postwar world came under the domination of two superpowers both of which proclaimed themselves to be enemies of empire. As former colonies came to make up the majority of states in the United Nations, &quot;empire&quot; lost all legitimacy in this major international forum. &quot;Any state stupid enough to call itself an empire became subject automatically to UN resolutions on decolonisation.&quot; Most recent histories of empires have been hostile, especially if the authors were promoting nationalism. Stephen Howe, although himself hostile, listed positive qualities: the guaranteed stability, security, and legal order for their subjects. They tried to minimize ethnic and religious antagonism inside the empire. The aristocracies that ruled them were often more cosmopolitan and broad-minded than their nationalistic successors.

==History of imperialism==

===Early empires===

Stephen Howe writes that with the exception of the Roman, Chinese and &quot;perhaps ancient Egyptian states&quot;, early empires seldom survived the death of their founder and were usually limited in scope to conquest and collection of tribute, having little impact on the everyday lives of their subjects.

With the exception of Rome, the periods of dissolution following imperial falls were equally short. Successor states seldom outlived their founders and disappeared in the next and often larger empire. Some empires, like the Neo-Babylonian, Median and Lydian were outright conquered by a larger empire. The historical pattern was not a simple rise-and-fall cycle; rather it was rise, fall, and greater rise, or as Raoul Naroll put it, &quot;expanding pulsation.&quot;

Empires were limited in scope to conquest, as Howe observed, but conquest is a considerable scope. Many fought to the death to avoid it or to be liberated from it. Imperial conquests and attempts of conquest significantly contributed to the list of wars by death toll. The imperial impact on subjects can be regarded as &quot;little,&quot; but only on those subjects who survived the imperial conquest and rule. We cannot ask the inhabitants of Carthage and Masada, for example, whether empire had little impact on their lives. We seldom hear the voices of subject peoples because history is mostly written by winners. The imperial sources tend to ignore or reduce the resistance by subdued states. But one rich primary source of the subject population is the Hebrew Prophetic books. The hatred towards the ruling empires expressed in this source makes impression of an impact more serious than estimated by Howe. A classical writer and adherent of empire, Orosius explicitly preferred to avoid the views of subject populations. And another classical Roman patriot, Lucan confessed that &quot;words cannot express how bitterly we are hated&quot; by subject peoples.

The earliest known empire appeared in southern Egypt sometime around 3200 BC. Southern Egypt was divided by three kingdoms each centered on a powerful city. Hierapolis conquered the other two cities over two centuries, and later grew into the country of Egypt. The Akkadian Empire, established by Sargon of Akkad (24th century BC), was an early all-Mesopotamian empire which spread into Anatolia, the Levant and Ancient Iran. This imperial achievement was repeated by Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria and Hammurabi of Babylon in the 19th and 18th centuries BC. In the 15th century BC, the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, ruled by Thutmose III, was ancient Africa&#x27;s major force upon incorporating Nubia and the ancient city-states of the Levant.

 in China rose the Shang Empire which was succeeded by the Zhou Empire . Both equalled or surpassed in territory their contemporary Near Eastern empires such as the Middle Assyrian Empire, Hittite Empire, Egyptian Empire and those of the Mitanni and Elamites. The Zhou Empire dissolved in 770 BC into feudal multi-state system which lasted for five and a half centuries until the universal conquest of Qin in 221 BC. The first empire comparable to Rome in organization was the Neo-Assyrian Empire (916–612 BC). The Median Empire was the first empire within the territory of Persia. By the 6th century BC, after having allied with the Babylonians, Scythians and Cimmerians to defeat the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the Medes were able to establish their own empire, which was the largest of its day and lasted for about sixty years.
===Classical period===
The Axial Age (mid-First Millennium BC) witnessed unprecedented imperial expansion in the Indo-Mediterranean region and China. The successful and extensive Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC), also known as the first Persian Empire, covered Mesopotamia, Egypt, parts of Greece, Thrace, the Middle East, much of Central Asia, and North-Western India. It is considered the first great empire in history or the first &quot;world empire&quot;. It was overthrown and replaced by the short-lived empire of Alexander the Great. His Empire was succeeded by three Empires ruled by the Diadochi—the Seleucid, Ptolemaic, and Macedonian, which, despite being independent, are called the &quot;Hellenistic Empire&quot; by virtue of their similarities in culture and administration.

Meanwhile, in the western Mediterranean the Empires of Carthage and Rome began their rise. Having decisively defeated Carthage in 202 BC, Rome defeated Macedonia in 200 BC and the Seleucids in 190–189 BC to establish an all-Mediterranean Empire. The Seleucid Empire broke apart and its former eastern part was absorbed by the Parthian Empire. In 30 BC Rome annexed Ptolemaic Egypt.

In India during the Axial Age appeared the Maurya Empire—a geographically extensive and powerful empire, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BC. The empire was founded in 322 BC by Chandragupta Maurya through the help of Chanakya, who rapidly expanded his power westward across central and western India, taking advantage of the disruptions of local powers following the withdrawal by Alexander the Great. By 320 BC, the Maurya Empire had fully occupied northwestern India as well as defeating and conquering the satraps left by Alexander. Under Emperor Ashoka the Great, the Maurya Empire became the first Indian empire to conquer the whole Indian Peninsula — an achievement repeated only twice, by the Gupta and Mughal Empires. In the reign of Ashoka Buddhism spread to become the dominant religion in many parts of the ancient India.

In 221 BC, China became an empire when the State of Qin ended the chaotic Warring States period through its conquest of the other six states, starting the Qin Empire (221–207 BC). Its sovereign adopted the new title of &quot;Huangdi&quot; (皇帝), which is translated in English as &quot;Emperor&quot;. The Qin Empire is known for the construction of the Great Wall of China and the Terracotta Army, as well as the standardization of currency, weights, measures and writing system. It laid the foundation for China&#x27;s first golden age, the Han dynasty (202 BC–AD 9, AD 25–220). The Han Empire expanded into Central Asia and established trade through the Silk Road. Confucianism was, for the first time, adopted as an official state ideology. During the reign of the Emperor Wu of Han, the Xiongnu were pacified. By this time, only four empires stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic: the Han Empire of China, the Kushan Empire, the Parthian Empire of Persia, and the Roman Empire. The collapse of the Han Empire in AD 220 saw China fragmented into the Three Kingdoms, only to be unified once again by the Jin Empire (AD 266–420). The relative weakness of the Jin Empire plunged China into political disunity that would last from AD 304 to AD 589 when the Sui Empire (AD 581–618) reunited China.

The Romans were the first people to invent and embody the concept of &quot;empire&quot; in their two mandates: to wage war and to make and execute laws. They were the most extensive Western empire until the early modern period, and left a lasting impact on European society. Many languages, cultural values, religious institutions, political divisions, urban centers, and legal systems can trace their origins to the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire governed and rested on exploitative actions. They took slaves and money from the peripheries to support the imperial center. However, the absolute reliance on conquered peoples to carry out the empire&#x27;s fortune, sustain wealth, and fight wars would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Roman Empire. The Romans were strong believers in what they called their &quot;civilizing mission&quot;. This term was legitimized and justified by writers like Cicero who wrote that only under Roman rule could the world flourish and prosper. This ideology, that was envisioned to bring a new world order, was eventually spread across the Mediterranean world and beyond. People started to build houses like Romans, eat the same food, wear the same clothes and engage in the same games. Even rights of citizenship and authority to rule were granted to people not born within Roman territory.

The Latin word &quot;imperium&quot; derives from &quot;imperare&quot;, meaning &quot;to command&quot;, and originally referred to a magistrate&#x27;s authority (usually in a military sense). As the Roman state expanded overseas, the term began to be used to describe Rome&#x27;s authority over its colonies and client states. Successful generals were often given the title &quot;imperator&quot;, an honorific roughly meaning &quot;commander&quot;. Although historians use the terms &quot;Republic&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; to identify the periods of Roman history before and after absolute power was assumed by Augustus, the Romans themselves continued to refer to their government as the &quot;Res publica&quot;, meaning &quot;public affair&quot;. On the other hand, the concept of &quot;imperium Romanum&quot;, as in, the authority of the Romans, is attested since the 2nd century BC. The modern concepts of &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;Emperor&quot; did not appear until several centuries later, long after the fall of Rome in the West. Augustus established a new &quot;de facto&quot; monarchy, but sought to maintain the appearance of a republican government. He and his early successors used the informal titles of &quot;augustus&quot; and &quot;princeps&quot;, but over time the title of &quot;imperator&quot; came to denote the office of (what is now referred to as) &quot;emperor&quot;.

The legal systems of France and its former colonies are strongly influenced by Roman law. Similarly, the United States was founded on a model inspired by the Roman Republic, with upper and lower legislative assemblies, and executive power vested in a single individual, the president. The president, as &quot;commander-in-chief&quot; of the armed forces, reflects the ancient Roman titles &quot;imperator princeps&quot;. The Roman Catholic Church, founded in the early Imperial Period, spread across Europe, first by the activities of Christian evangelists, and later by official imperial promulgation.

===Post-classical period===
In Western Asia, the term &quot;Persian Empire&quot; came to denote the Iranian imperial states established in the pre–Islamic and, beginning with the Safavid Empire, modern Persia. In the 7th century, the Arab Empire was established by Muhammad, the founder of Islam. Over the next century, in one of the fastest and vastest expansions in history, his Empire conquered Persia and expanded on three continents (Asia, Africa, and Europe). At their height, under the Umayyad Caliphate, the territory that was conquered by the Arab Empire stretched from Iberia (at the Pyrenees) in the west to India (at Sind) in the east. In 751 AD, the Arab and Chinese Empires clashed in the Battle of Talas. These two Empires crossed the whole Old World from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

In East Asia, various Chinese empires (or dynasties) dominated the political, economic and cultural landscapes during this era, the most powerful of which was probably the Tang Empire (618–690, 705–907). Other influential Chinese empires during the post-classical period include the Sui Empire (581–618), the Great Liao Empire, the Song Empire, the Western Xia Empire (1038–1227), the Great Jin Empire (1115–1234), the Western Liao Empire (1124–1218), the Great Yuan Empire (1271–1368), and the Great Ming Empire (1368–1644). During this period, Japan and Korea underwent voluntary Sinicization. The Sui, Tang and Song empires had the world&#x27;s largest economy and were the most technologically advanced during their time; the Great Yuan Empire was the world&#x27;s ninth largest empire by total land area; while the Great Ming Empire is famous for the seven maritime expeditions led by Zheng He.

Around the 6th century, the Yamato clan set up Japan&#x27;s first empire and first and only dynasty. During the next two centuries, Japan&#x27;s kingdoms and tribes came to be unified under this dynasty. The Japanese emperor adopted the Chinese title Son of Heaven. Emperor Kinmei (509–571) is considered the first historically verifiable Japanese emperor. The Japanese imperial dynasty continues to this day, albeit in an almost entirely ceremonial role, and represents the oldest continuous hereditary monarchy in the world.

The Ajuran Sultanate was a Somali empire in the medieval times that dominated the Indian Ocean trade. It was a Somali Muslim sultanate that ruled over large parts of the Horn of Africa in the Middle Ages. Through a strong centralized administration and an aggressive military stance towards invaders, the Ajuran Sultanate successfully resisted an Oromo invasion from the west and a Portuguese incursion from the east during the Gaal Madow and the Ajuran-Portuguese wars. Trading routes dating from the ancient and early medieval periods of Somali maritime enterprise were strengthened or re-established, and foreign trade and commerce in the coastal provinces flourished with ships sailing to and coming from many kingdoms and empires in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, Middle East, North Africa and East Africa.

In the 7th century, Maritime Southeast Asia witnessed the rise of a Buddhist thallasocracy, the Srivijaya Empire, which thrived for 600 years and was succeeded by the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit Empire that ruled from the 13th to 15th centuries. In the Southeast Asian mainland, the Hindu-Buddhist Khmer Empire was centered in the city of Angkor and flourished from the 9th to 13th centuries. Following the demise of the Khmer Empire, the Siamese Empire flourished alongside the Burmese and Lan Chang Empires from the 13th through the 18th centuries.

In Southeastern and Eastern Europe, during 917, the Eastern Roman Empire, sometimes called the Byzantine Empire, was forced to recognize the Imperial title of Bulgarian ruler Simeon the Great, who were then called Tsar, the first ruler to hold that precise imperial title. The Bulgarian Empire, established in the region in 680–681, remained a major power in Southeast Europe until its fall in the late 14th century. Bulgaria gradually reached its cultural and territorial apogee in the 9th century and early 10th century under Prince Boris I and Simeon I, when it became one of the largest states in Europe. This period is considered the Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture.

At the time, in the Medieval West, the title &quot;empire&quot; had a specific technical meaning that was exclusively applied to states that considered themselves the heirs and successors of the Roman Empire. Among these were the &quot;Byzantine Empire&quot;, which was the actual continuation of the Eastern portion of the Roman Empire, the Carolingian Empire, the largely Germanic Holy Roman Empire, and the Russian Empire. Yet, these states did not always fit the geographic, political, or military profiles of empires in the modern sense of the word. To legitimise their &quot;imperium&quot;, these states directly claimed the title of &quot;Empire&quot; from Rome. The &quot;sacrum Romanum imperium&quot; (Holy Roman Empire), which lasted from 800 to 1806, claimed to have exclusively comprehended Christian principalities, and was only nominally a discrete imperial state. The Holy Roman Empire was not always centrally-governed, as it had neither core nor peripheral territories, and was not governed by a central, politico-military elite. Hence, Voltaire&#x27;s remark that the Holy Roman Empire &quot;was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire&quot; is accurate to the degree that it ignores German rule over Italian, French, Provençal, Polish, Flemish, Dutch, and Bohemian populations, and the efforts of the ninth-century Holy Roman Emperors (i.e., the Ottonians) to establish central control. Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;nor an empire&quot; observation applies to its late period.

In the thirteenth century, Genghis Khan expanded the Mongol Empire to be the largest contiguous empire in the world history. However, within two generations, the empire was separated into four discrete khanates under Genghis Khan&#x27;s grandsons. One of them, Kublai Khan, conquered China and established the Yuan dynasty with the imperial capital at Beijing. One family ruled the whole Eurasian land mass from the Pacific to the Adriatic and Baltic Seas. The emergence of the Pax Mongolica had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia.

In 1204, after the Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople, the crusaders established a Latin Empire (1204–1261) in that city, while the defeated Byzantine Empire&#x27;s descendants established two smaller, short-lived empires in Asia Minor: the Empire of Nicaea (1204–1261) and the Empire of Trebizond (1204–1461). Constantinople was retaken in 1261 by the Byzantine successor state centered in Nicaea, re-establishing the Byzantine Empire until 1453, by which time the Turkish-Muslim Ottoman Empire (ca. 1300–1918), had conquered most of the region. The Ottoman Empire was a successor of the Abbasid Empire and one of the most powerful empires in the world. Centered on modern day Turkey, the Ottoman Empire overthrew the Byzantine Empire and dominated the eastern Mediterranean, battering at Austria and Malta, key geographical locations to central and south-west Europe respectively.

This was not just a rivalry of East and West but a rivalry between Christians and Muslims. Both the Christians and Muslims had alliances with other countries. The flows of trade and of cultural influences across the supposed great divide never ceased, so the countries never stopped bartering with each other. These epochal clashes between civilizations profoundly shaped many people&#x27;s thinking back then, and continues to do so in the present day. Modern hatred against Muslim communities in South-Eastern Europe, mainly in Bosnia and Kosovo, has often been articulated in terms of seeing them as unwelcome residues of this imperialism: in short, as Turks.

===Early Modern period===
In 1547, Ivan the Terrible was coronated as Emperor of Russia. He transformed Russia from a medieval state to a fledgling empire and began the conquest of Siberia. With this conquest completed by 1778, the Russian Empire became the second contiguous empire in size after the Mongol Empire.
The Islamic gunpowder empires started to develop from the 15th century. In the Indian subcontinent, the Delhi Sultanate conquered most of the Indian peninsula and spread Islam across it. It later disintegrated with the establishment of the Bengal, Gujarat, and Bahmani Sultanate. In the 16th century, the Mughal Empire was founded by Timur and Genghis Khan&#x27;s direct descendant Babur. His successors such Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan extended the empire. In the 17th century, Aurangzeb expanded the Mughal Empire over most of the South Asia and imposed Sharia. The Mughal Empire became the world&#x27;s largest economy and leading manufacturing power with a nominal GDP that valued a quarter of world GDP, superior than the combination of Europe&#x27;s GDP. It has been estimated that the Mughal emperors controlled an unprecedented one-fourth of the world&#x27;s entire economy and was home to one-fourth of the world&#x27;s population at the time. After the death of Aurangzeb, which marks the end of the medieval India and the beginning of European invasion in India, the empire was weakened by Nader Shah&#x27;s invasion. The Mysore Empire was established by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, who allied with Napoleon Bonaparte. Other independent empires were also established, such as those ruled by the Nawabs of Bengal and Nizam of Hyderabad.

The Great Qing Empire of China (1644–1912) was the fourth largest empire in world history by total land area, and laid the foundation for the modern territorial claims of both the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of China. Apart from having direct control over much of East Asia, the empire also exerted domination over other states through the Chinese tributary system. The multiethnic and multicultural nature of the Great Qing Empire was crucial to the subsequent birth of the nationalistic concept of &quot;zhonghua minzu&quot;. The empire reached its peak during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, after which the empire entered a period of prolonged decline, culminating in its collapse as a result of the Xinhai Revolution.

The Ashanti Empire (or Confederacy), also Asanteman (1701–1896), was a West African state of the Ashanti, the Akan people of the Ashanti Region, Akanland in modern-day Ghana. The Ashanti (or Asante) were a powerful, militaristic and highly disciplined people in West Africa. Their military power, which came from effective strategy and an early adoption of European firearms, created an empire that stretched from central Akanland (in modern-day Ghana) to present day Benin and Ivory Coast, bordered by the Dagomba kingdom to the north and Dahomey to the east. Due to the empire&#x27;s military prowess, sophisticated hierarchy, social stratification and culture, the Ashanti empire had one of the largest historiographies of any indigenous Sub-Saharan African political entity.

In the pre-Columbian Americas, two Empires were prominent—the Azteca in Mesoamerica and Inca in Peru. Both existed for several generations before the arrival of the Europeans. Inca had gradually conquered the whole of the settled Andean world as far south as today Santiago in Chile. In Oceania, the Tonga Empire was a lonely empire that existed from the Late Middle Ages to the Modern period.

===Colonial empires===
Beginning in the 15th century, a number of west European countries reached and colonized overseas regions across the globe. Ushering the Age of Discovery, the imperial expansion advanced to a new global scale. The extensive overseas expansion, particularly in the South Asia and Americas by the Portuguese and Spanish, later joined by the English, French and Dutch, created empires on which the Sun never sets. The global scale is one of main distinctions between the colonial and traditional land empires. Colonial empires were a transformative period in world history when previously isolated parts of the world became connected to form one world system, laid the groundwork for globalization, and set human history on the global common course.

The Portuguese Empire colonized vast portions of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania to become one of the most powerful empires of the period, the longest-lived colonial empire in European history, and one of the largest empires in history. The Spanish Empire expanded over the same continents as well as in Europe, exceeding the Portuguese rival in size and, among colonial empires, remaining second only to Britain.

The British Empire established an absolute imperial record in size and, for a century, was the foremost global power. The British established their first empire (1583–1783) in North America by colonising lands that made up British America, including parts of Canada, the Caribbean and the Thirteen Colonies. In 1776, the Continental Congress of the Thirteen Colonies declared itself independent from the British Empire, thus beginning the American Revolution. Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific, and later Africa, with subsequent exploration and conquests leading to the rise of the Second British Empire (1783–1815), which was followed by the Industrial Revolution and Britain&#x27;s Imperial Century (1815–1914). It became the largest empire in world history, encompassing one quarter of the world&#x27;s land area and one fifth of its population. The impacts of this period are still prominent in the current age &quot;including widespread use of the English language, belief in Protestant religion, economic globalization, modern precepts of law and order, and representative democracy.&quot;

In India, Britain confronted the Sikh Empire (1799–1849) in the Punjab region. Weakened by the death of its founder, Ranjit Singh, in 1839, the empire fell to the British after the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849. During the same period, the Maratha Empire (also known as the Maratha Confederacy) was a Hindu state located in present-day India. It existed from 1674 to 1818, and at its peak, the empire&#x27;s territories covered much of Southern Asia. The empire was founded and consolidated by Shivaji. After the death of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, it expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat, which halted the expansion of the empire. Later, the empire was divided into a confederacy of states which, in 1818, were lost to the British during the Anglo-Maratha wars.

France was a dominant empire possessing many colonies in various locations around the world. During Louis XIV&#x27;s long reign, from 1643 to 1715, France was Europe&#x27;s most populous, richest and powerful country. From the 16th to the 17th centuries, the First French colonial empire’s total area at its peak in 1680 was over , the second largest empire in the world at the time behind only the Spanish Empire. It had many possessions around the world, mainly in the Americas, Asia and Africa. At its peak in 1750, French India had an area of 1.5 million km2 and a total population of 100 million people and was the most populous colony under French rule. The Napoleonic Empire (1804–1814) conquered much of the continental Europe. It ruled over 90 million people and was the leading world power of the time. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the colonial empire of France was the second largest in the world behind the British Empire. The French colonial empire extended over of land at its height in the 1920s and 1930s with a totaled population of 150 million people. Including metropolitan France, the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached at the time, which is 10.0% of the Earth&#x27;s total land area. The total area of the French colonial empire, with the first (mainly in the Americas and Asia) and second (mainly in Africa and Asia), the French colonial empires combined, reached , the second largest in the world (the first being the British Empire).

The Empire of Brazil (1822–1889) was the only South American modern monarchy, established by the heir of the Portuguese Empire as an independent nation eventually became an emerging international power. The new country was huge but sparsely populated and ethnically diverse. In 1889 the monarchy was overthrown in a sudden coup d&#x27;état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic.

===Late modern period===
Beginning around 1760, the New Imperialism or Age of Imperialism characterizes a period of colonial expansion by European powers, the United States and Japan. Though the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and the collapse of the Spanish Empire in Latin America in the 1820s ended the first era of European colonialism, the period featured an unprecedented pursuit of overseas territorial acquisitions. At the time, states focused on building their empires with new technological advances and developments. During the era of New Imperialism, the European powers and Japan conquered almost all of Africa and most of Asia. The new wave of imperialism reflected ongoing imperial rivalries, their imperial ambitions, and a &quot;civilizing mission&quot;.

With the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), the Austrian Empire (1804–1867) emerged reconstituted as the Empire of Austria-Hungary (1867–1918) and claimed to &quot;inherite&quot; the imperium of Central and Western Europe. Another &quot;heir to the Holy Roman Empire&quot;, was the German Empire (1871–1918).

In the course of the Scramble for Africa (1870-1914), European empires separated between themselves almost all the continent. Symbolized by the Pink Map, the Portuguese claimed sovereignty over a wide land corridor stretching between the Atlantic shore of Angola and Indian shore of Mozambique. This led to the 1890 British Ultimatum as Britain aimed to established their own and longer corridor from Egypt to South Africa. In the clash of the corridors, the British prevailed.

The Spanish–American War of 1898 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 signaled the advent of a new extra-European empires, the United States and Japan respectively. The two events marked the closure of the &quot;imperial belt&quot;--belt of great empires stretching from west to east. Originally formed in the Old World during the Axial Age along the Silk Road, this belt shifted northward during the medieval period due to climatic change, penetrated to North America in the colonial period, and &quot;closed&quot; in the Far East c.1900. The history of empires ceased being eurocentric. The Pearl Harbor attack symbolized the fact that two non-European empires clashed on the opposite to Europe place of the globe.

The world political map was completed c.1900 leaving no sovereign void and with empires ruling over four-fifth of the world. A contemporary observer, Max Weber, generalized that great empires claim spheres of interest over a wide orbit and in the 1900s &quot;such orbits encompass the whole surface of the planet.&quot; Though seldom viewed through an imperial lens, the World Wars were imperial wars. All great powers which waged both World Wars were empires fighting for their survival or expansion.

Many scholars suppose that the end of the overseas space for imperial expansion contributed to the intensity of the World Wars if not was their main factor (chapter &quot;Circumscription theory&quot; below). According to one thesis, the overseas world provided European empires with an enormous outlet and thus prevented Europe from unifying into a single European empire. The European powers turned their exceeding energies outward and the internal European power was balanced. Correspondingly, the thesis continues, when the space for expansion ended, the empires became destined for head-on collisions, as reflected in the anxious, claustrophobic mood of the Fin de siècle. This was the time when the theory of lebensraum developed and the term geopolitics was coined to designate a new science. Furthermore, the global closure coincided with unprecedented technological advances in weapons now produced on the industrial scale. These factors caused a clash of empires of epic proportions, as vividly described by its famous participant:

The Ottoman, Austrian and Russian Empires were defeated in the First World War, though the latter Empire soon reappeared in its Soviet form. The German, Italian and Japanese Empires were defeated in the Second World War. Weakend by the same War, the rest of the European Empires underwent decolonization. The Soviet Empire collapsed in 1989-1991. The United States remained the only superpower, but whether its foreign policy qualifies as imperial is debatable (chapters &quot;Contemporary usage&quot; and &#x27;Present&quot; below).

Egyptologist Barry Kemp developed a &quot;basic model&quot; of imperial evolution. At the start, according to the model, we have a number of roughly equal players. The game inexorably follows a trajectory toward a critical point when one player accumulated sufficient power to outweigh other players and becomes unstoppable. Imagining an imperial game of this kind outlines the &quot;essence of the basic process at work in history.&quot; Kemp specialized on the Bronze Age and by accident published his game theory in 1989, the moment before modern empires completed his &quot;basic process.&quot; 

An Historian specializing on the world history explicitely applied Kemp&#x27;s game analogy to modern empires. The global closure c.1900 marks the point when empires ended their &quot;regular season&quot; and entered &quot;play-offs.&quot; The knock-out turnament began with &quot;wild card playoff&quot; (First World War), proceeded with &quot;breath-stopping series of quarterfinals and semifinals&quot; (Second World War), and &quot;culminated with a deadly boring final that went into triple overtime until the Soviets scored a golden own goal.&quot;

== Fall of empires ==
The fall of an empire is typically associated with a change in the world order, with a new hegemon replacing the former empire. There is typically a decline in soft power and hard power. During the fall, the empire typically retreats its expanded operations. Trade shrinks as the former empire shifts its priorities towards domestic policy. Living conditions may deteriorate as the economy shrinks. Balkanization or territorial divisions may occur. However, this process is not universal. Some empires are more resilient and fall gracefully while others experience complete chaos.

=== Roman Empire ===

The fall of the western half of the Roman Empire is seen as one of the most pivotal points in all of human history. This event traditionally marks the transition from classical civilization to the birth of Europe. The Roman Empire started to decline at the end of the reign of the last of the Five Good Emperors, Marcus Aurelius in 161–180 A.D. There is still a debate over the cause of the fall of one of the largest empires in history. Piganiol argues that the Roman Empire under its authority can be described as &quot;a period of terror&quot;, holding its imperial system accountable for its failure. Another theory blames the rise of Christianity as the cause, arguing that the spread of certain Christian ideals caused internal weakness of the military and state. In his book &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Peter Heather contends that there are many factors, including issues of money and manpower, which produce military limitations and culminate in the Roman army&#x27;s inability to effectively repel invading barbarians at the frontier. The Western Roman economy was already stretched to its limit in the 4th and 5th centuries C.E. due to continual conflict and loss of territory which, in turn, generated loss of revenue from the tax base. There was also the looming presence of the Persians which, at any time, took a large percentage of the fighting force&#x27;s attention. At the same time the Huns, a nomadic warrior people from the steppes of Asia, are also putting extreme pressure on the German tribes outside of the Roman frontier, which gave the German tribes no other choice, geographically, but to move into Roman territory. At this point, without increased funding, the Roman army could no longer effectively defend its borders against major waves of Germanic tribes. This inability is illustrated by the crushing defeat at Adrianople in 378 C.E. and, later, the Crossing of the Rhine in 406 C.E.

An empire can fall for many reasons. However, why the fall of the Roman Empire was fatal, that is why the post-classical Europe never repeated its ancient unity, is a completely different question. Eurocentrism in the Roman case led to the theory of inevitable imperial fall and Western declinism in imperiology which remains the only widely believed case of historical inevitability. To describe any polity as an empire is usually to damn it as doomed to disappear, usually due to imperial overstretch. Comparative history however alters the Eurocentric theory. The Chinese Empire rose synchronously with Rome and never fell. More precisely, China underwent several disintegrations but each time reunified. Asking why the post-Roman Europe, contrary to China, never reunified reveals factors which the case study of the fall of Rome cannot reveal. The latter question was addressed in this comparative analysis.

===Transition from empire===
In time, an empire may change from one political entity to another. For example, the Holy Roman Empire, a German re-constitution of the Roman Empire, metamorphosed into various political structures (i.e., federalism), and eventually, under Habsburg rule, re-constituted itself in 1804 as the Austrian Empire, an empire of much different politics and scope, which in turn became the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1867. The Roman Empire, perennially reborn, also lived on as the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire) – temporarily splitting into the Latin Empire, the Empire of Nicaea and the Empire of Trebizond before its remaining territory and centre became part of the Ottoman Empire. A similarly persistent concept of empire saw the Mongol Empire become the Khanate of the Golden Horde, the Yuan Empire of China, and the Ilkhanate before resurrection as the Timurid Empire and as the Mughal Empire.

An autocratic empire can become a republic with its imperial dominions reduced to a core territory (e.g., Weimar Germany shorn of the German colonial empire im 1918–1919, the Ottoman Empire in 1918–1923, the Austro-Hungarian Empire after 1918, or the Russian Empire after 1918 and again in 1989–91). Or it can become a republic within the same borders (e.g., the Central African Empire in 1979). Alternatively, an empire can integrate the ruling metropole with the ruled periphery to become state. Originally imperial cores, Wessex, Aragon, Sardinia, Prussia and Muskovy merged with their imperial peripheries to form the states of England, Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia respectively.

After 1945 the Empire of Japan retained its Emperor but lost its colonial possessions and became the State of Japan. Despite the semantic reference to imperial power, Japan is a &quot;de jure&quot; constitutional monarchy, with a homogeneous population of 127 million people that is 98.5 percent ethnic Japanese, making it one of the largest nation-states. The deconstruction of European colonial empires also quickened and became commonly known as decolonisation. The British Empire evolved into a loose, multinational Commonwealth of Nations, while the French colonial empire metamorphosed to a Francophone commonwealth. The same process happened to the Portuguese Empire, which evolved into a Lusophone commonwealth, and to the former territories of the extinct Spanish Empire, which alongside the Lusophone countries of Portugal and Brazil, created an Ibero-American commonwealth. France returned the French territory of Kwang-Chou-Wan to China in 1946. The British gave Hong Kong back to China in 1997 after 150 years of rule. The Portuguese territory of Macau reverted to China in 1999. Macau and Hong Kong did not become part of the provincial structure of China; they have autonomous systems of government as Special Administrative Regions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

France still governs overseas territories (French Guiana, Martinique, Réunion, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Saint Martin, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, Guadeloupe, French Southern and Antarctic Lands (TAAF), Wallis and Futuna, Saint Barthélemy, and Mayotte), and exerts hegemony in Francafrique (&quot;French Africa&quot;; 29 francophone countries such as Chad, Rwanda, etc.). Fourteen British Overseas Territories remain under British sovereignty. Fifteen countries of the Commonwealth of Nations share their head of state, King Charles III, as Commonwealth realms.

==Contemporary usage==
===United States of America===

Contemporaneously, the concept of &quot;empire&quot; is politically valid, yet is not always used in the traditional sense. One of widely discussed cases is the United States. Characterizing aspects of the US in regards to its territorial expansion, foreign policy, and its international behavior as &quot;American Empire&quot; is common. The term &quot;American Empire&quot; refers to the United States&#x27; cultural ideologies and foreign policy strategies. The term is most commonly used to describe the U.S.&#x27;s status since the 20th century, but it can also be applied to the United States&#x27; world standing before the rise of nationalism in the 20th century. The US itself was at one point a colony in the British Empire. Thomas Jefferson used the term &quot;Empire of Liberty&quot; and argued that &quot;no constitution was ever before so well calculated as ours for extensive empire &amp; self government&quot;. Jefferson in the 1780s while awaiting the fall of the Spanish empire, said: &quot;till our population can be sufficiently advanced to gain it from them piece by piece&quot;.

Even so, the ideology that the US was founded on anti-imperialist principles has prevented many from acknowledging America&#x27;s status as an empire. This active rejection of imperialist status is not limited to high-ranking government officials, as it has been ingrained in American society throughout its entire history. As David Ludden explains, &quot;journalists, scholars, teachers, students, analysts, and politicians prefer to depict the U.S. as a nation pursuing its own interests and ideals&quot;. This often results in imperialist endeavors being presented as measures taken to enhance state security. Ludden explains this phenomenon with the concept of &quot;ideological blinders&quot;, which he says prevent American citizens from realizing the true nature of America&#x27;s current systems and strategies. These &quot;ideological blinders&quot; that people wear have resulted in an &quot;invisible&quot; American empire of which most American citizens are unaware. Besides its anti-imperialist principles, the United States is not traditionally recognized as an empire, because the U.S. adopted a different political system from those that previous empires had used.

Despite the anti-imperial ideology and systematic differences, the political objectives and strategies of the United States government have been quite similar to those of previous empires. Throughout the 19th century, the United States government attempted to expand its territory by any means necessary. Regardless of the supposed motivation for this constant expansion, all of these land acquisitions were carried out by imperialistic means. This was done by financial means in some cases, and by military force in others. Most notably, the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Texas Annexation (1845), and the Mexican Cession (1848) highlight the imperialistic goals of the United States during this &quot;modern period&quot; of imperialism. The U.S. government has stopped adding additional territories, where they permanently and politically take over since the early 20th century, and instead have established 800 military bases as their outposts. With this overt but subtle military control of other countries, scholars consider U.S. foreign policy strategies to be imperialistic. Academic Krishna Kumar argues that the distinct principles of nationalism and imperialism may result in common practice; that is, the pursuit of nationalism can often coincide with the pursuit of imperialism in terms of strategy and decision making. Stuart Creighton Miller posits that the public&#x27;s sense of innocence about Realpolitik (politics based on practical considerations, rather than ideals) impacts popular recognition of US imperial conduct since it governed other countries via surrogates. These surrogates were domestically weak, right-wing governments that would collapse without US support.

Former President G. W. Bush&#x27;s Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, said: &quot;We don&#x27;t seek empires. We&#x27;re not imperialistic; we never have been.&quot; This was said in the context of the international opposition to the Iraq War led by the United States in manner widely regarded as imperial. With the 2003 invasion of Iraq underway, historian Sidney Lens argued that, from its inception, the US has used every means available to dominate foreign peoples and states. The same time, Eliot A. Cohen suggested: &quot;The Age of Empire may indeed have ended, but then an age of American hegemony has begun, regardless of what one calls it.&quot; Some scholars did not bother how to call it: &quot;When it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, it&#x27;s a duck.&quot;

===European Union===
Since the European Union was formed as a polity in 1993, it has established its own currency, its own citizenship, established discrete military forces, and exercises its limited hegemony in the Mediterranean, eastern parts of Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. The big size and high development index of the EU economy often has the ability to influence global trade regulations in its favor. The political scientist Jan Zielonka suggests that this behavior is imperial because it coerces its neighbouring countries into adopting its &quot;European&quot; economic, legal, and political structures. Tony Benn, a left-wing Labour Party MP of the United Kingdom, opposed the European integration policies of the European Union by saying, &quot;I think they&#x27;re (the European Union) building an empire there, they want us (the United Kingdom) to be a part of their empire and I don&#x27;t want that.&quot;

=== Russia ===
In the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea, political scientist Agnia Grigas argued that Moscow pursues the policy of &quot;reimperialization.&quot; Two days after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, historian specializing on empires, Niall Ferguson, interpreted the policy of Putin as an attempt to bring back the tsarist Russian Empire. By this time, the &quot;neo-imperialism,&quot; or &quot;neo-imperial ambitions&quot; of Russia became widely claimed. When Vladimir Putin denies the reality of the Ukrainian state, says another historian of empires Timothy Snyder, he is speaking the familiar language of empire. For five hundred years, European conquerors saw themselves as actors with purpose, and the colonized as instruments to realize the imperial vision.

Vladimir Putin himself used to state: &quot;For Russia to survive, it must remain an empire.&quot; In June 2022, on the 350 anniversary of the birth of the 18th-century Russian tsar Peter the Great, Putin has compared himself to him associating their twin historic quests to win back Russian lands. For critics this association implied that Putin&#x27;s &quot;complaints about historical injustice, eastward NATO expansion, and other grievances with the west were all a façade for a traditional war of conquest&quot; and imperialism. &quot;After months of denials that Russia is driven by imperial ambitions in Ukraine, Putin appeared to embrace that mission.&quot; On the same occasion, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian government, suggested Russia&#x27;s &quot;de-imperialization,&quot; instead of Russia&#x27;s official war aim of &quot;de-Nazification&quot; of Ukraine.

Later that year, Anne Applebaum approached the new Russian Empire as a fact and opined that this Empire must be defeated. Other pundits described the new Russian Empire as a failed attempt because Russia failed to annex the whole of Ukraine.

==Timeline of empires==

The chart below shows a timeline of polities that have been called empires. Dynastic changes are marked with a white line.
* The Roman Empire&#x27;s timeline listed below includes the Western and Eastern portion.
* The Empires of Nicaea and Trebizond were Byzantine successor states.
* The Empire of Bronze Age Egypt is not included in the graph. Established by Narmer circa 3000 BC, it lasted as long as China until it was conquered by Achaemenid Persia in 525 BC.
* Japan is presented for the period of its overseas Empire (1895–1945). The original Japanese Empire of &quot;the Eight Islands&quot; would be third persistent after Egypt and China.
* Many Indian empires are also included, though only Mauryans, Guptas, Delhi Sultans, Mughals, Chola Empire and Marathas ruled for large periods in India.

==Theoretical research==

===Empire versus nation state===
Empires have been the dominant international organization in world history:


Similarly, Anthony Pagden, Eliot A. Cohen, Jane Burbank and Frederick Cooper estimate that &quot;empires have always been more frequent, more extensive political and social forms than tribal territories or nations have ever been.&quot; Many empires endured for centuries, while the age of the ancient Egyptian, Chinese and Japanese Empires is counted in millennia. &quot;Most people throughout history have lived under imperial rule.&quot;

Political scientist Hedley Bull wrote that &quot;in the broad sweep of human history ... the form of states system has been the exception rather than the rule&quot;. His colleague Robert Gilpin confirmed this conclusion for the pre-modern period:

Historian Michael Doyle who undertook an extensive research on empires extended the observation into the modern era:

The author of &quot;The Idea of Nationalism: A Study in Its Origins and Background&quot;, Hans Kohn, acknowledged that it was the opposite idea—of imperialism—that was, perhaps, the most influential single idea for two millennia, the ordering of human society through unified dominion and common civilization. Yet a century ago, most of the world was ruled by persons who proudly proclaimed themselves Emperors and were proud of their Empires. Of the great powers, only the United States and France were republics.

===Universal empire===

Expert on warfare Quincy Wright generalized on what he called &quot;universal empire&quot;—empire unifying all the contemporary system:

German Sociologist Friedrich Tenbruck finds that the macro-historic process of imperial expansion gave rise to global history in which the formations of universal empires were most significant stages. A later group of political scientists, working on the phenomenon of the current unipolarity, in 2007 edited research on several pre-modern civilizations by experts in respective fields. The overall conclusion was that the balance of power was inherently unstable order and usually soon broke in favor of imperial order. Yet before the advent of the unipolarity, world historian Arnold Toynbee and political scientist Martin Wight had drawn the same conclusion with an unambiguous implication for the modern world:
The earliest thinker to approach the phenomenon of universal empire from a theoretical point of view was Polybius (2:3):

Johann Gottlieb Fichte, having witnessed the battle at Jena in 1806 when Napoleon overwhelmed Prussia, described what he perceived as a deep historical trend:

Fichte&#x27;s later compatriot, Geographer Alexander von Humboldt, in the mid-Nineteenth century observed a macro-historic trend of imperial growth in both Hemispheres: &quot;Men of great and strong minds, as well as whole nations, acted under influence of one idea, the purity of which was utterly unknown to them.&quot;
The imperial expansion filled the world . Three famous contemporary observers—Frederick Turner, Halford Mackinder and Max Weber described the event, Turner predicting American overseas expansion and Mackinder stressing that the world empire is now in sight.

In 1870, Argentine diplomat, jurist and political theorist Juan Bautista Alberdi described imperial consolidation. As von Humboldt, he found this trend unplanned and irrational but evident beyond doubt in the &quot;unwritten history of events.&quot; He linked this trend to the recent Evolution theory: Nations gravitate towards the formation of a single universal society. The laws that lead the nations in that direction are the same natural laws that has formed societies and are part of evolution. These evolutionary laws exist disregarding whether men recognize them.

Similarly, Friedrich Ratzel observed that the &quot;drive toward the building of continually larger states continues throughout the entirety of history&quot; and is active in the present. He drew &quot;Seven Laws of Expansionism&quot;. His seventh law stated: &quot;The general trend toward amalgamation transmits the tendency of territorial growth from state to state and increases the tendency in the process of transmission.&quot; He commented on this law to make its meaning clear: &quot;There is on this small planet sufficient space for only one great state.&quot;

Two other contemporaries—Kang Youwei and George Vacher de Lapouge—stressed that imperial expansion cannot indefinitely proceed on the definite surface of the globe and therefore world empire is imminent. Kang Youwei in 1885 believed that the imperial trend will culminate in the contest between Washington and Berlin and Vacher de Lapouge in 1899 estimated that the final contest will be between Russia and America in which America is likely to triumph.

The above envisaged contests indeed took place, known to us as World War I and II. Writing during the First, Oswald Spengler in &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; compared two emergences of universal empires and implied for the modern world: The Chinese League of States failed as well as the Taoist idea of intellectual self-disarmament. The Chinese states defended their last independence with bitterness but in vain. Also in vain Rome attempted to avoid conquest of the Hellenistic east. Imperialism is so necessary a product of any civilization that when a strongest people refuse to assume the role of master, it is pushed into it. It is the same with us. The Hague Conference of 1907 was the prelude of World War, the Washington Conference of 1921 will have been that of other wars. Napoleon introduced the idea of military world empire different from the preceding European maritime empires. The contest &quot;for the heritage of the whole world&quot; will culminate &quot;within two generations&quot; (from 1922). The destinies of small states are &quot;without importance to the great march of things.&quot; The strongest race will win and seize the management of the world.

Writing during the next World War, political scientists Derwent Whittlesey, Robert Strausz-Hupé and John H. Herz concluded: &quot;Now that the earth is at last parceled out, consolidation has commenced.&quot; In &quot;this world of fighting superstates there could be no end to war until one state had subjected all others, until world empire had been achieved by the strongest. This undoubtedly is the logical final stage in the geopolitical theory of evolution.&quot;

Writing in the last year of the War, American theologian Parley Paul Wormer, German historian Ludwig Dehio, and Hungarian-born writer Emery Reves drew similar conclusions. Fluctuating but persistent movement occurred through the centuries toward ever greater unity. The forward movement toward ever larger unities continues and there is no reason to conclude that it has come to an end. More likely, the greatest convergence of all time is at hand. &quot;Possibly this is the deeper meaning of the savage world conflicts&quot; of the 20th century.

The famous &quot;Anatomy of Peace&quot; by Reves, written and published in 1945, supposed that without the industrial power of the United States, Hitler already might have established world empire. Proposing world federalism, the book warned: Every dynamic force, every economic and technological reality, every &quot;law of history&quot; and logic &quot;indicates that we are on the verge of a period of empire building,&quot; which is &quot;the last phase of the struggle for the conquest of the world.&quot; As an elimination contest, one of the three remaining powers or a combination &quot;will achieve by force that unified control made mandatory by the times we live in… Anyone of three, by defeating the other two, would conquer and rule the world.&quot; If we fail to institute a unified control over the world in democratic way, the &quot;iron law of history&quot; would compel us to wage wars until world empire is finally attained through conquest. Since the former way is improbable due human blindness, we should precipitate the unification by conquest as quickly as possible and start the restoration of human liberties within the world empire.

=== Atomic bomb and empire ===
Reves added &quot;Postscript&quot; to the &quot;Anatomy&quot;, opening: &quot;A few weeks after the publication of this book, the first atomic bomb exploded over the city of Hiroshima…&quot; This new physical fact however has changed nothing in the political situation. The world empire remains inevitable and nothing else in the book would have been said differently had it been written after August 6, 1945. Not much chance we have to establish world government before the next horrible war between the two superpowers and whoever is victorious would establish the world empire. The book sold an exceptional 800,000 copies in thirty languages, was endorsed by Albert Einstein and numerous other prominent figures, and in 1950 Reves was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

The year after the War and in the first year of the nuclear age, Einstein and British philosopher Bertrand Russell, known as prominent pacifists, outlined for the near future a perspective of world empire (world government established by force). Einstein believed that, unless world government is established by agreement, an imperial world government would come by war or wars. Russell expected a third World War to result in a world government under the empire of the United States. Three years later, another prominent pacifist, theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, generalized on the ancient Empires of Egypt, Babylon, Persia and Greece to imply for the modern world: &quot;The analogy in present global terms would be the final unification of the world through the preponderant power of either America or Russia, whichever proved herself victorious in the final struggle.&quot;

Russian colleague of Russell and Niebuhr, Georgy Fedotov, wrote in 1945: All empires are but stages on the way to the sole empire which must swallow all others. The only question is who will build it and on which foundations. Universal unity is the only alternative to annihilation. Unity by conference is utopian but unity by conquest by the strongest power is not and probably the uncompleted in this War will be completed in the next. &quot;Pax Atlantica&quot; is the best of possible outcomes.

Originally drafted as a secret study for the Office of Strategic Services (the precursor of the CIA) in 1944 and published as a book three years later, &quot;The Struggle for the World...&quot; by James Burnham concludes: If either of the two Superpowers wins, the result would be a universal empire which in our case would also be a world empire. The historical stage for a world empire had already been set prior to and independently of the discovery of atomic weapons but these weapons make a world empire inevitable and imminent. &quot;The atomic weapons ... will not permit the world to wait.&quot; Only a world empire can establish monopoly on atomic weapons and thus guarantee the survival of civilization. A world empire &quot;is in fact the objective of the Third World War which, in its preliminary stages, has already began&quot;. The issue of a world empire &quot;will be decided, and in our day. In the course of the decision, both of the present antagonists may, it is true, be destroyed, but one of them must be.&quot;

The next year, world historian Crane Brinton similarly supposed that the bomb may in the hands of a very skillful and lucky nation prove to be the weapon that permits that nation to unify the world by imperial conquest, to do what Napoleon and Hitler failed to do. Combined with other &quot;wonders of science,&quot; it would permit a quick and easy conquest of the world. In 1951, Hans Morgenthau concluded that the &quot;best&quot; outcome of World War III would be world empire:

Expert on earlier civilizations, Toynbee, further developed the subject of World War III leading to world empire:

The year this volume of &quot;A Study of History&quot; was published, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles announced &quot;a knock-out blow&quot; as an official doctrine, a detailed Plan was elaborated and &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine mapped the design. Section VIII, &quot;Atomic Armaments&quot;, of the famous National Security Council Report 68 (NSC 68), approved by President Harry Truman in 1951, uses the term &quot;blow&quot; 17 times, mostly preceded by such adjectives as &quot;powerful&quot;, &quot;overwhelming&quot;, or &quot;crippling&quot;. Another term applied by the strategists was &quot;Sunday punch&quot;.

Having modeled the rise of the world empire on the cases of previous empires, Toynbee noted that, by contrast, the modern ultimate &quot;blow&quot; would be atomic. But he remains optimistic: No doubt, the modern world has far greater capacity to reconstruct than the earlier civilizations had.

A pupil of Toynbee, William McNeill, associated with the case of ancient China, which &quot;put a quietus upon the disorders of the warring states by erecting an imperial bureaucratic structure ... The warring states of the Twentieth century seem headed for a similar resolution of their conflicts.&quot; The ancient &quot;resolution&quot; McNeill evoked was one of the most sweeping universal conquests in world history, performed by Qin in 230–221 BC. Chinese classic Sima Qian (d. 86 BC) described the event (6:234): &quot;Qin raised troops on a grand scale&quot; and &quot;the whole world celebrated a great bacchanal&quot;. Herman Kahn of the RAND Corporation criticized an assembled group of SAC officers for their war plan (SIOP-62). He did not use the term bacchanal but he coined on the occasion an associating word: &quot;Gentlemen, you do not have a war plan. You have a &quot;war orgasm&quot;!&quot; History did not completely repeat itself but it passed close.

===Circumscription theory===

According to the circumscription theory of Robert Carneiro, &quot;the more sharply circumscribed area, the more rapidly it will become politically unified.&quot; The Empires of Egypt, China and Japan are named the most durable political structures in human history. Correspondingly, these are the three most circumscribed civilizations in human history. The Empires of Egypt (established by Narmer c. 3000 BC) and China (established by Cheng in 221 BC) endured for over two millennia. German Sociologist Friedrich Tenbruck, criticizing the Western idea of progress, emphasized that China and Egypt remained at one particular stage of development for millennia. This stage was universal empire. The development of Egypt and China came to a halt once their empires &quot;reached the limits of their natural habitat&quot;. Sinology does not recognize the Eurocentric view of the &quot;inevitable&quot; imperial fall; Egyptology and Japanology pose equal challenges.

Carneiro explored the Bronze Age civilizations. Stuart J. Kaufman, Richard Little and William Wohlforth researched the next three millennia, comparing eight civilizations. They conclude: The &quot;rigidity of the borders&quot; contributed importantly to hegemony in every concerned case. Hence, &quot;when the system&#x27;s borders are rigid, the probability of hegemony is high&quot;.

The circumscription theory was stressed in the comparative studies of the Roman and Chinese Empires. The circumscribed Chinese Empire recovered from all falls, while the fall of Rome, by contrast, was fatal. &quot;What counteracted this [imperial] tendency in Europe ... was a countervailing tendency for the geographical boundaries of the system to expand.&quot; If &quot;Europe had been a closed system, some great power would eventually have succeeded in establishing absolute supremacy over the other states in the region&quot;.

In the 1945 book, &quot;The Precarious Balance&quot;, on four centuries of the European power struggle, Ludwig Dehio explained the durability of the European states system by its overseas expansion: &quot;Overseas expansion and the system of states were born at the same time; the vitality that burst the bounds of the Western world also destroyed its unity.&quot; In a more famous 1945 book, Reves similarly argued that the era of outward expansion is forever closed and the historic trend of expansion will result in direct collision between the remaining powers. Edward Carr causally linked the end of the overseas outlet for imperial expansion and World Wars. In the nineteenth century, he wrote during the Second World War, imperialist wars were waged against &quot;primitive&quot; peoples. &quot;It was silly for European countries to fight against one another when they could still ... maintain social cohesion by continuous expansion in Asia and Africa. Since 1900, however, this has no longer been possible: &quot;the situation has radically changed&quot;. Now wars are between &quot;imperial powers.&quot; 

Hans Morgenthau wrote that the very imperial expansion into relatively empty geographical spaces in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries, in Africa, Eurasia, and western North America, deflected great power politics into the periphery of the earth, thereby reducing conflict. For example, the more attention Russia, France and the United States paid to expanding into far-flung territories in imperial fashion, the less attention they paid to one another, and the more peaceful, in a sense, the world was. But by the late nineteenth century, the consolidation of the great nation-states and empires of the West was consummated, and territorial gains could only be made at the expense of one another. John H. Herz outlined one &quot;chief function&quot; of the overseas expansion and the impact of its end:

Some later commentators drew similar conclusions:

The opportunity for any system to expand in size seems almost a necessary condition for it to remain balanced, at least over the long haul. Far from being impossible or exceedingly improbable, systemic hegemony is likely under two conditions: &quot;when the boundaries of the international system remain stable and no new major powers emerge from outside the system.&quot; With the system becoming global, further expansion is precluded. The geopolitical condition of &quot;global closure&quot; will remain to the end of history. Since &quot;the contemporary international system is global, we can rule out the possibility that geographic expansion of the system will contribute to the emergence of a new balance of power, as it did so many times in the past.&quot; As Quincy Wright had put it, &quot;this process can no longer continue without interplanetary wars.&quot;

One of leading experts on world-system theory, Christopher Chase-Dunn, noted that the circumscription theory is applicable for the global system, since the global system is circumscribed. In fact, within less than a century of its circumscribed existence the global system overcame the centuries-old balance of power and reached the unipolarity. Given &quot;constant spatial parameters&quot; of the global system, its unipolar structure is neither historically unusual nor theoretically surprising.

Randall Schweller theorized that a &quot;closed international system&quot;, such as the global became a century ago, would reach &quot;entropy&quot; in a kind of thermodynamic law. Once the state of entropy is reached, there is no going back. The initial conditions are lost forever. Stressing the curiosity of the fact, Schweller writes that since the moment the modern world became a closed system, the process has worked in only one direction: from many poles to two poles to one pole. Thus unipolarity might represent the entropy—stable and permanent loss of variation—in the global system.

===Present===

For Dominic Lieven, empire is all about unequal distribution of power and consequent domination. Thus the 2000s world order is more imperial than the 19th-century one because instead of several empire of roughly equal power there is one imperial superpower. ‘Empire’ has therefore replaced &quot;anarchy.&quot; Chalmers Johnson argues that the US global network of hundreds of military bases already represents a global empire in its initial form:

Simon Dalby associates the network of bases with the Roman imperial system:

Kenneth Pomeranz and Harvard Historian Niall Ferguson share the above-cited views: &quot;With American military bases in over 120 countries, we have hardly seen the end of empire.&quot; This &quot;vast archipelago of US military bases … far exceeds 19th-century British ambitions. Britain&#x27;s imperium consisted of specific, albeit numerous, colonies and clients; the American imperial vision is much more global…&quot;

Another Harvard Historian Charles S. Maier opens his &quot;Among Empires: American Ascendancy and Its Predecessors&quot; with these words: &quot;What a substratum for empire! Compared with which, the foundation of the Macedonian, the Roman and the British, sink into insignificance.&quot; One of the most accepted distinctions between earlier empires and the American Empire is the latter&#x27;s &quot;global&quot; or &quot;planetary&quot; scope. French former Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine wondered: &quot;The situation is unprecedented: What previous empire subjugated the entire world...?&quot; The quests for universal empire are old but the present quest outdoes the previous in &quot;the notable respect of being the first to actually be global in its reach.&quot; Another historian Paul Kennedy, who in 1986 predicted the imminent US &quot;imperial overstretch,&quot; in 2002 acknowledged about the present world system:

Walter Russell Mead observes that the United States attempts to recreate &quot;globally&quot; what the ancient empires of Egypt, China and Rome had each accomplished on a regional basis. Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Leeds, Zygmunt Bauman, concludes that due to its planetary dimension, the new empire cannot be drawn on a map:

&quot;Times Atlas of Empires&quot; numbers 70 empires in the world history. Niall Ferguson lists numerous parallels between them and the United States. He concludes: &quot;To those who would still insist on American exceptionalism, the historian of empires can only retort: as exceptional as all the other 69 empires.&quot; Fareed Zakaria stressed one element not exceptional for the American Empire—the concept of exceptionalism. All dominant empires thought they were special.

===Future===
In 1945, Historian Ludwig Dehio predicted global unification due to the circumscription of the global system, although he did not use this term. Being global, the system can neither expand nor be subject to external intrusion as the European states system had been for centuries:

Fifteen years later, Dehio confirmed his hypothesis: The European system owed its durability to its overseas outlet. &quot;But how can a multiple grouping of world states conceivably be supported from outside in the framework of a finite globe?&quot;

During the same time, Quincy Wright developed a similar concept. Balance-of-power politics has aimed less at preserving peace than at preserving the independence of states and preventing the development of world empire. In the course of history, the balance of power repeatedly re-emerged, but on ever-wider scale. Eventually, the scale became global. Unless we proceed to &quot;interplanetary wars,&quot; this pattern can no longer continue. In spite of significant reversals, the &quot;trend towards world unity&quot; can &quot;scarcely be denied.&quot; World unity appears to be &quot;the limit toward which the process of world history seems to tend.&quot;

The same &quot;interplanetary&quot; motif is present also in the Anatomy of Peace: The era of outward expansion is forever closed. &quot;Until and unless we are able to communicate with another planet, the theater of human history will be limited to geographically determined, constant and known dimensions.&quot; The historic trend of expansion will result in direct collision between the remaining powers. Multiplied by modern technology, the centripetal forces will accomplish what the greatest empires of the past failed. &quot;For the first time in human history, one power can conquer and rule the world.&quot;

The &quot;Father of American Anthropology,&quot; Franz Boas, known for his historical particularism and cultural relativism, outlined the &quot;inexorable laws of history&quot; by which political units grow larger in size and smaller in number. The process began in the earliest times and has continued almost always in the same direction. In the long run, the tendency to unification has been more powerful than of disintegration. &quot;Thus the history of mankind shows us the grand spectacle of the grouping of man in units of ever increasing size.&quot; The progress in the direction of unification has been so regular and so marked that we must needs conclude that the same tendencies will govern our history in the future. Today the unity of the world is not less conceivable than the modern nations were in the early history. The practical difficulties that stand in the way of the formation of still larger units count for nothing before the &quot;inexorable laws of history.&quot;

Seven later scholars—Hornell Hart, Raoul Naroll, Louis Morano, Rein Taagepera, the author of the circumscription theory Robert Carneiro and Jesse H. Ausubel &amp; Cesare Marchetti—researched expanding imperial cycles. All argued that these cycles represent an historical trend leading to world empire. Naroll and Carneiro also found this outcome &quot;close at hand,&quot; c. 2200 and 2300 respectively. In 2013, Marchetti and Ausubel estimated that the global empire is to rise within &quot;a couple more generations.&quot;

The founder of the Paneuropean Union, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, writing yet in 1943, drew a more specific and immediate future imperial project: After the War America is bound &quot;to take over the command of the skies.&quot; The danger of &quot;the utter annihilation of all enemy towns and lands&quot; can &quot;only be prevented by the air superiority of a single power ... America&#x27;s air role is the only alternative to intercontinental wars.&quot; Despite his outstanding anti-imperialism, Coudenhove-Kalergi detailed:

Coudenhove-Kalergi envisaged a kind of Pax Americana modeled on &quot;Pax Romana&quot;:

This period would be necessary transitory stage before World State is eventually established, though he did not specify how the last transformation is expected to occur. Coudenhove-Kalergi&#x27;s follower in the teleological theory of World State, Toynbee, specified two ways. One is by wars going on to a bitter end at which one surviving great power &quot;knocks out&quot; its last remaining competitor and establishes world empire, like the earlier empires used to on the regional scale. The other alternative is the United Nations. Having devoted his life to the study of history and international affairs, Toynbee did not bet on the United Nations. Instead, he identified symptoms of the traditional power politics leading to the world empire by a universal conquest.

Toynbee emphasized that the world is ripe for conquest: &quot;...Hitler&#x27;s eventual failure to impose peace on the world by the force of arms was due, not to any flaw in his thesis that the world was ripe for conquest, but to an accidental combination of incidental errors in his measures...&quot; But &quot;in falling by so narrow a margin to win the prize of world-dominion for himself, Hitler had left the prize dangling within the reach of any successor capable of pursuing the same aims of world-conquest with a little more patience, prudence, and tact.&quot; With his &quot;revolution of destruction,&quot; Hitler has performed the &quot;yeoman service&quot; for &quot;some future architect of a &quot;Pax Ecumenica&quot;... For a post-Hitlerian empire-builder, Hitler&#x27;s derelict legacy was a gift of the Gods.&quot;

The next &quot;architect of a Pax Ecumenica,&quot; known more commonly as Pax Americana, demonstrated &quot;more patience, prudence, and tact.&quot; Consequently, as President Dwight Eisenhower put it, the NATO allies became &quot;almost psychopathic&quot; whenever anyone talked about a US withdrawal, and the reception of his successor John F. Kennedy in Berlin was &quot;almost hysterical,&quot; as Chancellor Konrad Adenauer characterized it. John Ikenberry finds that the Europeans wanted a stronger, more formal and more imperial system than the United States was initially willing to provide. In the end the United States settled for this &quot;form of empire—a Pax Americana with formal commitments to Europe.&quot; According to a much debated thesis, the United States became &quot;empire by invitation.&quot; The period discussed in the thesis (1945–1952) ended precisely the year Toynbee theorized on &quot;some future architect of a Pax Ecumenica.&quot;

Dissociating America from Rome, Eisenhower gave a pessimistic forecast. In 1951, before he became president, he had written on West Europe: &quot;We cannot be a modern Rome guarding the far frontiers with our legions if for no other reason than that these are not, politically, our frontiers. What we must do is to assist these [West European] peoples.&quot; Two years later, he wrote: When it was decided to deploy US divisions to Europe, no one had &quot;for an instant&quot; thought that they would remain there for &quot;several decades&quot;—that the United States could &quot;build a sort of Roman Wall with its own troops and so protect the world.&quot;

Eisenhower assured Soviet first secretary Nikita Khrushchev on Berlin in 1959: &quot;Clearly we did not contemplate 50 years in occupation there.&quot; It lasted, remarks Marc Trachtenberg, from July 1945 to September 1994, 10 months short of 50 years. Notably, when the US troops eventually left, they left eastward. Confirming the theory of the &quot;empire by invitation,&quot; with their first opportunity East European states extended the &quot;invitation.&quot;

Oswald Spengler envisaged the &quot;Imperial Age&quot; for the world in both senses of &quot;empire,&quot; spatial (as a world-wide unit ruled by one center) and governmental (as ruled by Emperor). Published in 1922, &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; predicts the triumph of the strongest race in the fight for the whole world within &quot;two generations&quot; and of &quot;Caesarism&quot; over democracy &quot;within a century.&quot; In 2022, the Spenglerian century ended short of global &quot;Caesarism,&quot; albeit two years before its end Donald Trump had been advised to cross the Rubicon.

Chalmers Johnson regards the global military reach of the United States as empire in its &quot;initial&quot; form. Dimitri Simes finds that most of the world sees the United States as a &quot;nascent&quot; imperial power. Some scholars concerned how this empire would look in its ultimate form. The ultimate form of empire was described by Michael Doyle in his &quot;Empires&quot;. It is empire in which its two main components—the ruling core and the ruled periphery—merged to form one integrated whole. At this stage the &quot;empire&quot; as defined ceases to exist and becomes &quot;world state&quot;. Doyle exemplifies the transformation on the case of the Roman Emperor Caracalla whose edict in AD 212 extended the Roman citizenship to all inhabitants of the Mediterranean world.

Doyle&#x27;s case of the Roman Empire had also been evoked by Susan Strange in her 1988 article, &quot;The Future of the American Empire.&quot; Strange emphasized that the most persistent empires were those which best managed to integrate the ruling core and the peripheral allies. The article is partly a reply on the published a year earlier bestseller &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers&quot; which predicted imminent US &quot;imperial overstretch.&quot; Strange found this outcome unlikely, stressing the fact that the peripheral allies have been successfully recruited into the American Empire.

Envisaging a world empire of either the United States or the Soviet Union (whoever is victorious in World War III), Bertrand Russell projected the Roman scenario too: &quot;Like the Romans, they will, in the course of time, extend citizenship to the vanquished. There will then be a true world state, and it will be possible to forget that it will have owed its origin to conquest.&quot; International Relations scholar Alexander Wendt supposes world empire by universal conquest and subsequent consolidation, provided the conquering power recognizes all conquered members. For his example he also invokes the Roman Empire. In satirical criticism of the European pro-American stance in the wake of September 11, French Philosopher Régis Debray warned that the logical culmination of the motto &quot;We are all Americans&quot; would be a modernized Edict of Caracalla extending US citizenship to all the West and thus establishing the United States of the West.

To the case of Caracalla, Toynbee added the Abbasid cosmopolitan reformation of 750 AD. Both &quot;were good auguries for the prospect that, in a post-Modern chapter of Western history, a supranational commonwealth originally based on the hegemony of a paramount power over its satellites might eventually be put on the sounder basis of a constitutional partnership in which all the people of all the partner states would have their fare share in the conduct of common affairs.&quot; To the cases of Caracalla and the Abbasid revolution, Max Ostrovsky added the Han overthrow of Qin in 206 BC and more gradual cosmopolitan reformations he finds characteristic to all persistent empires and expects in the future global empire.

Crane Brinton expected that the world empire would not be built instantly but not as slowly as Rome, for much in the modern world has been speeded up. Charles Galton Darwin, a grandson of the father of Evolution Theory, suggested that China, as an isolated and enduring civilization, seems to provide the most relevant model for the global future. As the Chinese Empire, the regions of the world, periodically albeit more rarely, will be united by force into an uneasy world-empire, which will endure for a period until it falls. Along China, Ostrovsky mentions Egypt as a model for the future but, by contrast, estimates that the intermediate periods of the global empire will be shorter and rarer.

<text>The Final Solution ( ) or the Final Solution to the Jewish Question ( ) refers to a plan orchestrated by the Nazi regime of Germany during World War II for the genocide of individuals they defined as Jews. The &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish question&quot; was the official code name for the murder of all Jews within reach, which was not restricted to the European continent. This policy of deliberate and systematic genocide starting across German-occupied Europe was formulated in procedural and geopolitical terms by Nazi leadership in January 1942 at the Wannsee Conference held near Berlin, and culminated in the Holocaust, which saw the murder of 90% of Polish Jews, and two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe.

The nature and timing of the decisions that led to the Final Solution is an intensely researched and debated aspect of the Holocaust. The program evolved during the first 25 months of war leading to the attempt at &quot;murdering every last Jew in the German grasp&quot;. Christopher Browning, a historian specializing in the Holocaust, wrote that most historians agree that the Final Solution cannot be attributed to a single decision made at one particular point in time. &quot;It is generally accepted the decision-making process was prolonged and incremental.&quot; In 1940, following the Fall of France, Adolf Eichmann devised the Madagascar Plan to move Europe&#x27;s Jewish population to the French colony, but the plan was abandoned for logistical reasons, mainly a naval blockade. There were also preliminary plans to deport Jews to Palestine and Siberia. Raul Hilberg wrote that, in 1941, in the first phase of the mass-murder of Jews, the mobile killing units began to pursue their victims across occupied eastern territories; in the second phase, stretching across all of German-occupied Europe, the Jewish victims were sent on death trains to centralized extermination camps built for the purpose of systematic murder of Jews.

==Background==

The term &quot;Final Solution&quot; was a euphemism used by the Nazis to refer to their plan for the annihilation of the Jewish people. Some historians argue that the usual tendency of the German leadership was to be extremely guarded when discussing the Final Solution. For example, Mark Roseman wrote that euphemisms were &quot;their normal mode of communicating about murder&quot;. However, Jeffrey Herf has argued that the role of euphemisms in Nazi propaganda has been exaggerated, and in fact Nazi leaders often made direct threats against Jews. For example, during his speech of 30 January 1939, Hitler threatened &quot;the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe&quot;.

From gaining power in January 1933 until the outbreak of war in September 1939, the Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany was focused on intimidation, expropriating their money and property, and encouraging them to emigrate. According to the Nazi Party policy statement, Jews and the Romani people were the only &quot;alien people in Europe&quot;. In 1936, the Bureau of Romani Affairs in Munich was taken over by Interpol and renamed the Center for Combating the Gypsy Menace. Introduced at the end of 1937, the &quot;final solution of the Gypsy Question&quot; entailed round-ups, expulsions, and incarceration of Romani in concentration camps built at, until this point, Dachau, Buchenwald, Flossenbürg, Mauthausen, Natzweiler, Ravensbruck, Taucha and Westerbork. After the Anschluss with Austria in 1938, Central Offices for Jewish Emigration were established in Vienna and Berlin to increase Jewish emigration, without covert plans for their forthcoming annihilation.

The outbreak of war and the invasion of Poland brought a population of 3.5 million Polish Jews under the control of the Nazi and Soviet security forces, and marked the start of the Holocaust in Poland. In the German-occupied zone of Poland, Jews were forced into hundreds of makeshift ghettos, pending other arrangements.

In April 1941, the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized applier of Zyklon B, which meant they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight. The launch of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 coincided with the German top echelon&#x27;s newfound intent to pursue Hitler&#x27;s new anti-Semitic plan to eradicate, rather than expel, Jews. Hitler&#x27;s earlier ideas about forcible removal of Jews from the German-controlled territories to achieve &quot;Lebensraum&quot; were abandoned after the failure of the air campaign against Britain, initiating a naval blockade of Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRB/Path&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler became the chief architect of a new plan, which came to be called &quot;The Final Solution to the Jewish question&quot;. On 31 July 1941, &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring wrote to Reinhard Heydrich (Himmler&#x27;s deputy and chief of the RSHA), authorising him to make the &quot;necessary preparations&quot; for a &quot;total solution of the Jewish question&quot; and coordinate with all affected organizations. Göring also instructed Heydrich to submit concrete proposals for the implementation of the new projected goal.

Broadly speaking, the extermination of Jews was carried out in two major operations. With the onset of Operation Barbarossa, mobile killing units of the SS, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, and Order Police battalions were dispatched to the occupied Soviet Union for the express purpose of murdering all Jews. During the early stages of the invasion, Himmler himself visited Białystok at the beginning of July 1941, and requested that, &quot;as a matter of principle, any Jew&quot; behind the German-Soviet frontier was to be &quot;regarded as a partisan&quot;. His new orders gave the SS and police leaders full authority for the mass-murder behind the front lines. By August 1941, all Jewish men, women, and children were shot. In the second phase of annihilation, the Jewish inhabitants of central, western, and south-eastern Europe were transported by Holocaust trains to camps with newly built gassing facilities. Raul Hilberg wrote: &quot;In essence, the killers of the occupied USSR moved to the victims, whereas outside this arena, the victims were brought to the killers. The two operations constitute an evolution not only chronologically, but also in complexity.&quot; Massacres of about one million Jews occurred before plans for the Final Solution were fully implemented in 1942, but it was only with the decision to annihilate the entire Jewish population that extermination camps such as Auschwitz II Birkenau and Treblinka were fitted with permanent gas chambers to murder large numbers of Jews in a relatively short period of time.
The plans to exterminate all the Jews of Europe were formalized at the Wannsee Conference, held at an SS guesthouse near Berlin, on 20 January 1942. The conference was chaired by Heydrich and attended by 15 senior officials of the Nazi Party and the German government. Most of those attending were representatives of the Interior Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the Justice Ministry, including Ministers for the Eastern Territories. At the conference, Heydrich indicated that approximately 11,000,000 Jews in Europe would fall under the provisions of the &quot;Final Solution&quot;. This figure included not only Jews residing in Axis-controlled Europe, but also the Jewish populations of the United Kingdom and of neutral nations (Switzerland, Ireland, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, and European Turkey). Eichmann&#x27;s biographer David Cesarani wrote that Heydrich&#x27;s main purpose in convening the conference was to assert his authority over the various agencies dealing with Jewish issues. &quot;The simplest, most decisive way that Heydrich could ensure the smooth flow of deportations&quot; to death camps, according to Cesarani, &quot;was by asserting his total control over the fate of the Jews in the Reich and the east&quot; under the single authority of the RSHA. A copy of the minutes of this meeting (later called the Wannsee Conference Protocol) was found by the Allies in March 1947; it was too late to serve as evidence during the first Nuremberg Trial, but was used by prosecutor General Telford Taylor in the subsequent Nuremberg Trials.

After the end of World War II, surviving archival documents provided a clear record of the Final Solution policies and actions of Nazi Germany. They included the Wannsee Conference Protocol, which documented the co-operation of various German state agencies in the SS-led Holocaust, as well as some 3,000 tons of original German records captured by Allied armies, including the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; reports, which documented the progress of the mobile killing units assigned, among other tasks, to murder Jewish civilians during the attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. The evidential proof which documented the mechanism of the Holocaust was submitted at Nuremberg.

==Phase one: death squads of Operation Barbarossa==

The Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union codenamed Operation Barbarossa, which commenced on 22 June 1941, set in motion a &quot;war of annihilation&quot; which quickly opened the door to the systematic mass murder of European Jews. For Hitler, Bolshevism was merely &quot;the most recent and most nefarious manifestation of the eternal Jewish threat&quot;. On 3 March 1941, Wehrmacht Joint Operations Staff Chief Alfred Jodl repeated Hitler&#x27;s declaration that the &quot;Jewish-Bolshevik intelligentsia would have to be eliminated&quot; and that the forthcoming war would be a confrontation between two completely opposing cultures. In May 1941, Gestapo leader Heinrich Müller wrote a preamble to the new law limiting the jurisdiction of military courts in prosecuting troops for criminal actions because: &quot;This time, the troops will encounter an especially dangerous element from the civilian population, and therefore, have the right and obligation to secure themselves.&quot;
Himmler and Heydrich assembled a force of about 3,000 men from Security Police, Gestapo, Kripo, SD, and the Waffen-SS, as the so-called &quot;special commandos of the security forces&quot; known as the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, to eliminate both communists and Jews in occupied territories. These forces were supported by 21 battalions of Orpo Reserve Police under Kurt Daluege, adding up to 11,000 men. The explicit orders given to the Order Police varied between locations, but for Police Battalion 309 participating in the first mass murder of 5,500 Polish Jews in the Soviet-controlled Białystok (a Polish provincial capital), Major Weiss explained to his officers that Barbarossa is a war of annihilation against Bolshevism, and that his battalions would proceed ruthlessly against all Jews, regardless of age or sex.

After crossing the Soviet demarcation line in 1941, what had been regarded as exceptional in the Greater Germanic Reich became a normal way of operating in the east. The crucial taboo against the murder of women and children was breached not only in Białystok but also in Gargždai in late June. By July, significant numbers of women and children were being murdered behind all front-lines not only by the Germans but also by the local Ukrainian and Lithuanian auxiliary forces. On 29 July 1941, at a meeting of SS officers in Vileyka (Polish Wilejka, now Belarus), the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; had been given a dressing-down for their low execution figures. Heydrich himself issued an order to include the Jewish women and children in all subsequent shooting operations. Accordingly, by the end of July the entire Jewish population of Vileyka, men, women and children, were murdered. Around 12 August, no less than two-thirds of the Jews shot in Surazh were women and children of all ages. In late August 1941 the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; murdered 23,600 Jews in the Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre. A month later, the largest mass shooting of Soviet Jews took place on 29–30 September in the ravine of Babi Yar, near Kyiv, where more than 33,000 Jewish people of all ages were systematically machine-gunned. In mid-October 1941, HSSPF South, under the command of Friedrich Jeckeln, had reported the indiscriminate murder of more than 100,000 people.
By the end of December 1941, before the Wannsee Conference, over 439,800 Jewish people had been murdered, and the Final Solution policy in the east became common knowledge within the SS. Entire regions were reported &quot;free of Jews&quot; by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. Addressing his district governors in the General Government on 16 December 1941, Governor-General Hans Frank said: &quot;But what will happen to the Jews? Do you believe they will be lodged in settlements in Ostland? In Berlin, we were told: why all this trouble; we cannot use them in the Ostland or the Reichskommissariat either; liquidate them yourselves!&quot; Two days later, Himmler recorded the outcome of his discussion with Hitler. The result was: &quot;als Partisanen auszurotten&quot; (&quot;exterminate them as partisans&quot;). Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer wrote that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from Hitler for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust. Within two years, the total number of shooting victims in the east had risen to between 618,000 and 800,000 Jews.

===&quot;Bezirk Bialystok&quot; and &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;===

Several scholars have suggested that the Final Solution began in the newly formed district of &quot;Bezirk Bialystok&quot;. The German army took over Białystok within days. On Friday, 27 June 1941, the Reserve Police Battalion 309 arrived in the city and set the Great Synagogue on fire with hundreds of Jewish men locked inside. The burning of the synagogue was followed by a frenzy of murders both inside the homes around the Jewish neighbourhood of Chanajki, and in the city park, lasting until night time. The next day, some 30 wagons of dead bodies were taken to mass graves. As noted by Browning, the murders were led by a commander &quot;who correctly intuited and anticipated the wishes of his Führer&quot; without direct orders. For reasons unknown, the number of victims in the official report by Major Weis was cut in half. The next mass-shooting of Polish Jews within the newly formed &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot; took place in two days of 5–7 August in occupied Pińsk, where over 12,000 Jews were murdered by the &quot;Waffen SS&quot;, not the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. An additional 17,000 Jews perished there in a ghetto uprising crushed a year later with the aid of Belarusian Auxiliary Police.

An Israeli historian Dina Porat claimed that the Final Solution, i.e.: &quot;the systematic overall physical extermination of Jewish communities one after the other—began in Lithuania&quot; during the massive German chase after the Red Army across the &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;. The subject of the Holocaust in Lithuania has been analysed by Konrad Kweit from USHMM who wrote: &quot;Lithuanian Jews were among the first victims of the Holocaust [beyond the eastern borders of occupied Poland]. The Germans carried out the mass executions [...] signaling the beginning of the &#x27;Final Solution&#x27;.&quot; About 80,000 Jews were murdered in Lithuania by October (including in formerly Polish Wilno) and about 175,000 by the end of 1941 according to official reports.

===&quot;Reichskommissariat Ukraine&quot;===

Within one week from the start of Operation Barbarossa, Heydrich issued an order to his &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; for the on-the-spot execution of all Bolsheviks, interpreted by the SS to mean all Jews. One of the first indiscriminate massacres of men, women, and children in Reichskommissariat Ukraine took the lives of over 4,000 Polish Jews in occupied Łuck on 2–4 July 1941, murdered by &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; 4a assisted by the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Militia. Formed officially on 20 August 1941, the &quot;Reichskommissariat Ukraine&quot;—stretching from prewar east-central Poland to Crimea—had become operational theatre of the &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; C. Within the Soviet Union proper, between 9 July 1941 and 19 September 1941 the city of Zhytomyr was made &quot;Judenfrei&quot; in three murder operations conducted by German and Ukrainian police in which 10,000 Jews perished. In the Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre of 26–28 August 1941 some 23,600 Jews were shot in front of open pits (including 14,000–18,000 people expelled from Hungary). After an incident in Bila Tserkva in which 90 small children left behind had to be shot separately, Blobel requested that Jewish mothers hold them in their arms during mass shootings. Long before the conference at Wannsee, 28,000 Jews were shot by SS and Ukrainian military in Vinnytsia on 22 September 1941, followed by the 29 September massacre of 33,771 Jews at Babi Yar. In Dnipropetrovsk, on 13 October 1941 some 10,000–15,000 Jews were shot. In Chernihiv, 10,000 Jews were murdered and only 260 Jews were spared. In mid-October, during the Krivoy-Rog massacre of 4,000–5,000 Soviet Jews the entire Ukrainian auxiliary police force actively participated. In the first days of January 1942 in Kharkiv, 12,000 Jews were murdered, but smaller massacres continued in this period on daily basis in countless other locations. In August 1942 in the presence of only a few German SS men over 5,000 Jews were massacred in Polish Zofjówka by the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police leading to the town&#x27;s complete sweep from existence.

===&quot;Distrikt Galizien&quot;===
Historians find it difficult to determine precisely when the first concerted effort at annihilation of all Jews began in the last weeks of June 1941 during Operation Barbarossa. Dr. Samuel Drix (&quot;Witness to Annihilation&quot;), Jochaim Schoenfeld (&quot;Holocaust Memoirs&quot;), and several survivors of the Janowska concentration camp, who were interviewed in the film &quot;Janovska Camp at Lvov&quot;, among other witnesses, have argued that the Final Solution began in Lwów (Lemberg) in &quot;Distrikt Galizien&quot; of the General Government during the German advance across Soviet-occupied Poland. Statements and memoirs of survivors emphasize that, when Ukrainian nationalists and &quot;ad hoc&quot; Ukrainian People&#x27;s Militia (soon reorganized as the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police) began to murder women and children, rather than only male Jews, the &quot;Final Solution&quot; had begun. Witnesses have said that such murders happened both prior to and during the pogroms reportedly triggered by the NKVD prisoner massacre. The question of whether there was some coordination between the Lithuanian and Ukrainian militias remains open (i.e. collaborating for a joint assault in Kovno, Wilno, and Lwów).

The murders continued uninterrupted. On 12 October 1941, in Stanisławów, some 10,000–12,000 Jewish men, women, and children were shot at the Jewish cemetery by the German uniformed SS-men and Ukrainian Auxiliary Police during the so-called &quot;&quot; &quot;(de)&quot;. The shooters began firing at 12 noon and continued without stopping by taking turns. There were picnic tables set up on the side with bottles of vodka and sandwiches for those who needed to rest from the deafening noise of gunfire. It was the single largest massacre of Polish Jews in &quot;Generalgouvernement&quot; prior to mass gassings of &quot;Aktion Reinhard&quot;, which commenced at Bełżec in March 1942. Notably, the extermination operations in Chełmno had begun on 8 December 1941, one-and-a-half months before Wannsee, but Chełmno—located in &quot;Reichsgau Wartheland&quot;—was not a part of Reinhard, and neither was Auschwitz-Birkenau functioning as an extermination center until November 1944 in Polish lands annexed by Hitler and added to Germany proper.

The conference at Wannsee gave impetus to the so-called &quot;second sweep&quot; of the Holocaust by the bullet in the east. Between April and July 1942 in Volhynia, 30,000 Jews were murdered in death pits with the help of dozens of newly formed Ukrainian &quot;Schutzmannschaft&quot;. Owing to good relations with the Ukrainian &quot;Hilfsverwaltung&quot;, these auxiliary battalions were deployed by the SS also in Russia Center, Russia South, and in Byelorussia; each with about 500 soldiers divided into three companies. They participated in the extermination of 150,000 Volhynian Jews alone, or 98 percent of the Jewish inhabitants of the entire region. In July 1942 the Completion of the Final Solution in the General Government territory which included &quot;Distrikt Galizien&quot;, was ordered personally by Himmler. He set the initial deadline for 31 December 1942.

==Phase two: deportations to extermination camps==
When the Wehrmacht invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the area of the General Government was enlarged by the inclusion of regions that had been annexed by the Soviet Union since the 1939 invasion. The murders of Jews from the Łódź Ghetto in the &quot;Warthegau&quot; district began in early December 1941 with the use of gas vans (approved by Heydrich) at the Kulmhof extermination camp. Victims were misled under the deceptive guise of &quot;Resettlement in the East&quot;, organised by SS Commissioners, which was also tried and tested at Chełmno. By the time the European-wide Final Solution was formulated two months later, Heydrich&#x27;s RSHA had already confirmed the effectiveness of industrial murder by exhaust fumes, and the strength of deception.

Construction work on the first killing centre at Bełżec in occupied Poland began in October 1941, three months before the Wannsee Conference. The new facility was operational by March the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;M/MPwB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1942, two more death camps had been built on Polish lands: Sobibór operational by May 1942, and Treblinka operational in July. From July 1942, the mass murder of Polish and foreign Jews took place at Treblinka as part of Operation Reinhard, the deadliest phase of the Final Solution. More Jews were murdered at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz. By the time the mass killings of Operation Reinhard ended in 1943, roughly two million Jews in German-occupied Poland had been murdered. The total number of people murdered in 1942 in Lublin/Majdanek, Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka was 1,274,166 by Germany&#x27;s own estimation, not counting Auschwitz II Birkenau nor &quot;Kulmhof&quot;. Their bodies were buried in mass graves initially. Both Treblinka and Bełżec were equipped with powerful crawler excavators from Polish construction sites in the vicinity, capable of most digging tasks without disrupting surfaces. Although other methods of extermination, such as the cyanic poison Zyklon B, were already being used at other Nazi killing centres such as Auschwitz, the &quot;Aktion Reinhard&quot; camps used lethal exhaust gases from captured tank engines.

The &quot;Holocaust by bullets&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;Holocaust by gas&quot;) went on in the territory of occupied Poland in conjunction with the ghetto uprisings, irrespective of death camps&#x27; quota. In two weeks of July 1942, the Słonim Ghetto revolt, crushed with the help of Latvian, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian &quot;Schutzmannschaft&quot;, cost the lives of 8,000–13,000 Jews. The second largest mass shooting (to that particular date) took place in late October 1942 when the insurgency was suppressed in the Pińsk Ghetto; over 26,000 men, women and children were shot with the aid of Belarusian Auxiliary Police before the ghetto&#x27;s closure. During the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (the largest single revolt by Jews during World War II), 13,000 Jews were killed in action before May 1943. Numerous other uprisings were quelled without impacting the pre-planned Nazi deportations actions.

About two-thirds of the overall number of victims of the Final Solution were murdered before February 1943, which included the main phase of the extermination programme in the West launched by Eichmann on 11 June 1942 from Berlin. The Holocaust trains run by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and several other national railway systems delivered condemned Jewish captives from as far as Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Moravia, Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, and even Scandinavia. The cremation of exhumed corpses to destroy any evidence left behind began in early spring and continued throughout summer. The nearly completed clandestine programme of murdering all deportees was explicitly addressed by Heinrich Himmler in his Posen speeches made to the leadership of the Nazi Party on 4 October and during a conference in Posen (Poznań) of 6 October 1943 in occupied Poland. Himmler explained why the Nazi leadership found it necessary to murder Jewish women and children along with the Jewish men. The assembled functionaries were told that the Nazi state policy was &quot;the extermination of the Jewish people&quot; as such.

On 19 October 1943, five days after the prisoner revolt in Sobibór, Operation Reinhard was terminated by Odilo Globocnik on behalf of Himmler. The camps responsible for the murder of nearly 2,700,000 Jews were soon closed. Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka were dismantled and ploughed over before spring. The operation was followed by the single largest German massacre of Jews in the entire war carried out on 3 November 1943; with approximately 43,000 prisoners shot one-by-one simultaneously in three nearby locations by the Reserve Police Battalion 101 hand-in-hand with the Trawniki men from Ukraine. Auschwitz alone had enough capacity to fulfill the Nazis&#x27; remaining extermination needs.

===Auschwitz II Birkenau===
Unlike Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka, and Lublin-Majdanek, which were built in the occupied General Government territory inhabited by the largest concentrations of Jews, the killing centre at Auschwitz subcamp of Birkenau operated in Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany directly. The new gas chambers at Bunker I were finished around March 1942 when the Final Solution was officially launched at Belzec. Until mid June, 20,000 Silesian Jews were murdered there using Zyklon B. In July 1942, Bunker II became operational. In August, another 10,000–13,000 Polish Jews from Silesia were murdered, along with 16,000 French Jews declared &#x27;stateless&#x27;, and 7,700 Jews from Slovakia.

The infamous &#x27;Gate of Death&#x27; at Auschwitz II for the incoming freight trains was built of brick and cement mortar in 1943, and the three-track rail spur was added. Until mid-August, 45,000 Thessaloniki Jews were murdered in a mere six months, including over 30,000 Jews from Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz) and Bendzin Ghettos. The spring of 1944 marked the beginning of the last phase of the Final Solution at Birkenau. The new big ramps and sidings were constructed, and two freight elevators were installed inside Crematoria II and III for moving the bodies faster. The size of the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; was nearly quadrupled in preparation for the Special Operation Hungary (&quot;Sonderaktion Ungarn&quot;). In May 1944, Auschwitz-Birkenau became the site of one of the two largest mass murder operations in modern history, after the &quot;Großaktion Warschau&quot; deportations of the Warsaw Ghetto inmates to Treblinka in 1942. It is estimated that until July 1944 approximately 320,000 Hungarian Jews were gassed at Birkenau in less than eight weeks. The entire operation was photographed by the SS. In total, between April and November 1944, Auschwitz II received over 585,000 Jews from over a dozen regions as far as Greece, Italy, and France, including 426,000 Jews from Hungary, 67,000 from Łódź, 25,000 from Theresienstadt, and the last 23,000 Jews from the General Government. Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army on 27 January 1945, when the gassing had already stopped.

==Historiographic debate about the decision==
Historians disagree as to when and how the Nazi leadership decided that the European Jews should be exterminated. The controversy is commonly described as the functionalism versus intentionalism debate which began in the 1960s, and subsided thirty years later. In the 1990s, the attention of mainstream historians moved away from the question of top executive orders triggering the Holocaust and focused on factors that were overlooked earlier, such as personal initiative and ingenuity of countless functionaries in charge of the killing fields. No written evidence of Hitler ordering the Final Solution has ever been found to serve as a &quot;smoking gun&quot;, and therefore, this one particular question remains unanswered.

Hitler made numerous predictions regarding the Holocaust of the Jews of Europe prior to the beginning of World War II. During a speech given on 30 January 1939, on the sixth anniversary of his accession to power, Hitler said:

Raul Hilberg, in his book &quot;The Destruction of the European Jews&quot;, was the first historian to systematically document and analyse the Nazi project to murder every Jew in Europe. The book was initially published in 1961, and issued in an enlarged version in 1985.

Hilberg&#x27;s analysis of the steps that led to the destruction of European Jews revealed that it was &quot;an administrative process carried out by bureaucrats in a network of offices spanning a continent&quot;. Hilberg divides this bureaucracy into four components or hierarchies: the Nazi Party, the civil service, industry, and the Wehrmacht armed forces—but their cooperation is viewed as &quot;so complete that we may truly speak of their fusion into a machinery of destruction&quot;. For Hilberg, the key stages in the destruction process were: definition and registration of the Jews; expropriation of property; concentration into ghettoes and camps; and, finally, annihilation. Hilberg gives an estimate of 5.1 million as the total number of Jews murdered. He breaks this figure down into three categories: Ghettoization and general privation: over 800,000; open-air shootings: over 1,300,000; extermination camps: up to 3,000,000.

With respect to the &quot;functionalism versus intentionalism&quot; debate about a master plan for the Final Solution, or the lack thereof, Hilberg posits what has been described as &quot;a kind of structural determinism&quot;. Hilberg argues that &quot;a destruction process has an inherent pattern&quot; and the &quot;sequence of steps in a destruction process is thus determined&quot;. If a bureaucracy is motivated &quot;to inflict maximum damage upon a group of people&quot;, it is &quot;inevitable that a bureaucracy—no matter how decentralized its apparatus or how unplanned its activities—should push its victims through these stages&quot;, culminating in their annihilation.

In his monograph, &quot;The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 – March 1942&quot;, Christopher Browning argues that Nazi policy toward the Jews was radicalized twice: in September 1939, when the invasion of Poland implied policies of mass expulsion and massive loss of Jewish lives; and in spring 1941, when preparation for Operation Barbarossa involved the planning of mass execution, mass expulsion, and starvation—to dwarf what had happened in Jewish Poland.

Browning believes that the &quot;Final Solution as it is now understood—the systematic attempt to murder every last Jew within the German grasp&quot; took shape during a five-week period, from 18 September to 25 October 1941. During this time, the sites of the first extermination camps were selected, different methods of murder were tested, Jewish emigration was forbidden, and 11 transports departed for Łódź as a temporary holding station. Of this period, Browning writes, &quot;The vision of the Final Solution had crystallised in the minds of the Nazi leadership, and was being turned into reality.&quot; This was the peak of Nazi victories against the Soviet Army on the Eastern Front, and, according to Browning, the stunning series of German victories led to both an expectation that the war would soon be won, and the planning of the final destruction of the &quot;Jewish-Bolshevik enemy&quot;.

Browning describes the creation of the extermination camps, which were responsible for the largest number of murders in the Final Solution, as bringing together three separate developments within Nazi Germany: the concentration camps which had been established in Germany since 1933; an expansion of the gassing technology of the Nazi euthanasia programme to provide a murder technique of greater efficiency and psychological detachment; and the creation of &quot;factories of death&quot; to be fed endless streams of victims by mass uprooting and deportation that utilized the experience and personnel from earlier population resettlement programmes—especially the HSSPF and Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s RSHA for &quot;Jewish affairs and evacuations&quot;.

Peter Longerich argues that the search for a finite date on which the Nazis embarked upon the extermination of the Jews is futile, in his book &quot;Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews&quot; (2011). Longerich writes: &quot;We should abandon the notion that it is historically meaningful to try to filter the wealth of available historical material and pick out a single decision&quot; that led to the Holocaust.

Timothy Snyder writes that Longerich &quot;grants the significance of Greiser&#x27;s murder of Jews by gas at Chełmno in December 1941&quot;, but also detects a significant moment of escalation in spring 1942, which includes &quot;the construction of the large death factory at Treblinka for the destruction of the Warsaw Jews, and the addition of a gas chamber to the concentration camp at Auschwitz for the murder of the Jews of Silesia&quot;. Longerich suggests that it &quot;was only in the summer of 1942, that mass killing was finally understood as the realization of the Final Solution, rather than as an extensively violent preliminary to some later program of slave labor and deportation to the lands of a conquered USSR&quot;. For Longerich, to see mass-murder as the Final Solution was an acknowledgement by the Nazi leadership that there would not be a German military victory over the USSR in the near future.

David Cesarani emphasises the improvised, haphazard nature of Nazi policies in response to changing war time conditions in his overview, &quot;Final Solution: The Fate of the European Jews 1933–49&quot; (2016). &quot;Cesarani provides telling examples&quot;, wrote Mark Roseman, &quot;of a lack of coherence and planning for the future in Jewish policy, even when we would most expect it. The classic instance is the invasion of Poland in 1939, when not even the most elementary consideration had been given to what should happen to Poland&#x27;s Jews either in the shorter or longer term. Given that Poland was home to the largest Jewish population in the world, and that, in a couple of years, it would house the extermination camps, this is remarkable.&quot;

Whereas Browning places the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews in the context of the Wehrmacht victories on the Eastern front, Cesarani argues that the German subsequent realisation that there would be no swift victory over the Soviet Union &quot;scuppered the last territorial &#x27;solution&#x27; still on the table: expulsion to Siberia&quot;. Germany&#x27;s declaration of war on the United States on 11 December 1941, &quot;meant that holding European Jews hostage to deter the US from entering the conflict was now pointless&quot;. Cesarani concludes, the Holocaust &quot;was rooted in anti-Semitism, but it was shaped by war&quot;. The fact that the Nazis were, ultimately, so successful in murdering between five and six million Jews was not due to the efficiency of Nazi Germany or the clarity of their policies. &quot;Rather, the catastrophic rate of killing was due to German persistence ... and the duration of the murderous campaigns. This last factor was largely a consequence of allied military failure.&quot;
The entry of the U.S. into the War is also crucial to the time-frame proposed by Christian Gerlach, who argued in his 1997 thesis that the Final Solution decision was announced on 12 December 1941, when Hitler addressed a meeting of the Nazi Party (the &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;) and of regional party leaders (the &quot;Gauleiter&quot;). The day after Hitler&#x27;s speech, on 13 December 1941, Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary:

Cesarani notes that by 1943, as the military position of the German forces deteriorated, the Nazi leadership became more openly explicit about the Final Solution. In March, Goebbels confided to his diary: &quot;On the Jewish question especially, we are in it so deeply that there is no getting out any longer. And that is a good thing. Experience teaches that a movement and a people who have burned their bridges fight with much greater determination and fewer constraints than those that have a chance of retreat.&quot;

When Himmler addressed senior SS personnel and leading members of the regime in the Posen speeches on 4 October 1943, he used &quot;the fate of the Jews as a sort of blood bond to tie the civil and military leadership to the Nazi cause&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Eurystheus (; , ) was king of Tiryns, one of three Mycenaean strongholds in the Argolid, although other authors including Homer and Euripides cast him as ruler of Argos.

== Family ==
Eurystheus was the son of King Sthenelus and Nicippe (also called Antibia or Archippe), and he was a grandson of the hero Perseus. His sisters were Alcyone and Medusa (Astymedusa).

Eurystheus married Antimache, daughter of Amphidamas of Arcadia. Their children were Admete, Alexander, Eurybius, Mentor, Perimedes, Iphimedon, and Eurypylus.

==Mythology==
=== Labours of Heracles ===
In the contest of wills between Hera and Zeus over whose candidate would be hero, fated to defeat the remaining creatures representing an old order and bring about the reign of the Twelve Olympians, Eurystheus was Hera&#x27;s candidate and Heracles—though his name implies that at one archaic stage of myth-making he had carried &quot;Hera&#x27;s fame&quot;—was the candidate of Zeus. The arena for the actions that would bring about this deep change are the Twelve Labors imposed on Heracles by Eurystheus. The immediate necessity for the Labours of Heracles is as penance for Heracles&#x27; murder of his own family, in a fit of madness, which had been sent by Hera; however, further human rather than mythic motivation is supplied by mythographers who note that their respective families had been rivals for the throne of Mycenae. Details of the individual episodes may be found in the article on the Labours of Heracles, but Hera was connected with all of the opponents Heracles had to overcome.

Heracles&#x27; human stepfather Amphitryon was also a grandson of Perseus, and since Amphitryon&#x27;s father (Alcaeus) was older than Eurystheus&#x27; father (Sthenelus), he might have received the kingdom, but Sthenelus had banished Amphitryon for accidentally killing (a familiar mytheme) the eldest son in the family (Electryon). When, shortly before his son Heracles was born, Zeus proclaimed the next-born descendant of Perseus should get the kingdom, Hera thwarted his ambitions by delaying Alcmene&#x27;s labour and having her candidate Eurystheus born prematurely at seven months. Heracles&#x27; first task was to slay the Nemean Lion and bring back its skin, which Heracles decided to wear. Eurystheus was so scared by Heracles&#x27; fearsome guise that he hid in a subterranean bronze winejar, and from that moment forth all labors were communicated to Heracles through a herald, Copreus.

For his second labour, to slay the Lernaean Hydra, Heracles took with him his nephew, Iolaus, as a charioteer. When Eurystheus found out that Heracles&#x27; nephew had helped him he declared that the labour had not been completed alone and as a result did not count towards the ten labours set for him.

Eurystheus&#x27; third task did not involve killing a beast, but capturing one alive—the Ceryneian Hind, a golden-horned hind or sacred to Artemis. Heracles knew that he had to return the hind, as he had promised, to Artemis, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. Eurystheus did come out, but the moment Heracles let the hind go, she sprinted back to her mistress, and Heracles departed, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.

When Heracles returned with the Erymanthian Boar, Eurystheus was again frightened and hid in his jar, begging Heracles to get rid of the beast; Heracles obliged.

The fifth labour proposed by Eurystheus was to clear out the numerous stables of Augeias. Striking a deal with Augeias, Heracles proposed a payment of a tenth of Augeias&#x27; cattle if the labour was completed successfully. Not believing the task feasible, Augeias agreed, asking his son Phyleus to witness.
Heracles rerouted two nearby rivers (Alpheis and Peneios) through the stable, clearing out the dung rapidly. When Augeias learned of Heracles&#x27; bargain for the task, he refused payment. Heracles brought the case to court, and Phyleus testified against his father. Enraged, Augeias banished both Phyleus and Heracles from the land before the court had cast their vote. However, Eurystheus refused to credit the labour to Heracles, as he had performed it for payment. So Heracles went and drove Augeias out of the kingdom and installed Phyleus as king. Heracles then took his tenth of the cattle and left them to graze in a field by his home.

For his sixth labour, Heracles had to drive the Stymphalian Birds off the marshes they plagued. He did so, shooting down several birds with his Hydra-poisoned arrows and bringing them back to Eurystheus as proof.

For his seventh labour, Heracles captured the Cretan Bull. He used a lasso and rode it back to his cousin. Eurystheus offered to sacrifice the bull to Hera his patron, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered to Marathon, becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.

When Heracles brought back the man-eating Mares of Diomedes successfully, Eurystheus dedicated the horses to Hera and allowed them to roam freely in the Argolid. Bucephalus, Alexander the Great&#x27;s horse, was said to be descended from these mares.

To acquire the belt of Hippolyte, queen of the Amazons, was Heracles&#x27; ninth task. This task was at the request of Eurystheus&#x27; daughter, Admete. For the tenth labour, he stole the cattle of the giant Geryon, which Eurystheus then sacrificed to Hera.

To extend what may have once been ten Labours to the canonical dozen, it was said that Eurystheus didn&#x27;t count the Hydra, as he was assisted, nor the Augean stables, as Heracles received payment for his work. For the eleventh labour, Heracles had to obtain the Apples of the Hesperides; he convinced their father, the Titan Atlas, to help him, but did his share of work by temporarily holding up the sky in the Titan&#x27;s stead. For his final labour, he was to capture Cerberus, the three-headed hound that guarded the entrance to Hades. When he managed to bring the struggling animal back, the terrified Eurystheus hid in his jar one more time, begging Heracles to leave for good and take the dog with him.

===Death===
After Heracles died, Eurystheus remained bitter over the indignity the hero had caused him. He attempted to destroy Heracles&#x27; many children (the Heracleidae, led by Hyllus), who fled to Athens. He attacked the city but was soundly defeated, and Eurystheus and his sons were killed. Though it is widely told that Hyllus killed Eurystheus, the stories about the killer of Eurystheus and the fate of his corpse vary, but the Athenians believed the burial site of Eurystheus remained on their soil and served to protect the country against the descendants of Heracles, who traditionally included the Spartans and Argives.

After Eurystheus&#x27; death, the brothers Atreus and Thyestes, whom he had left in charge during his absence, took over the city, the former exiling the latter and assuming the kingship, while Tiryns returned to the kingship of Argos.

==Eurystheus in Euripides==
Eurystheus was a character in &quot;Heracleidae&quot;, a play by Euripides. Macaria, one of the daughters of Heracles, and her brothers and sisters hid from Eurystheus in Athens, which was ruled by King Demophon. As Eurystheus prepared to attack, an oracle told Demophon that he would win if and only if a noble woman was sacrificed to Persephone. Macaria volunteered for the sacrifice and a spring was named the Macarian spring in her honor. Eurystheus speaks prophetically of his burial within Attica, claiming that he will be an anti-hero of sorts, though one who will eventually protect the Athenians.

==In popular culture==
* Eurystheus appears in the 1958 film &quot;Hercules&quot; and is portrayed by Italian actor Arturo Dominici. In contrast to the character&#x27;s mythology, the Eurystheus depicted in the film is only a supporting character seen as a criminal recruited to kill King Aeson of Iolcus. During the film&#x27;s climax, he is confronted and strangled to death by Hercules&#x27; chain lasso.
* Eurystheus appears in the 1960 film &quot;Goliath and the Dragon,&quot; portrayed by Broderick Crawford. In this second known film appearance, he is depicted as a warlord set on conquering Thebes and becoming its new king. He sets Hercules on a dangerous mission (reminiscent of the Twelfth Labor of Hercules), believing the hero will perish and leave Thebes defenseless without its champion. Eurystheus is later killed in a dungeon scene with Hercules after being pushed by a slave girl into an open pit of snakes. 
* Eurystheus appears in the 2014 film &quot;Hercules,&quot; portrayed by Joseph Fiennes. Here, Eurystheus (depicted as King of Athens in 361 BC, when the city was actually a democracy) is responsible for the death of Hercules&#x27; family, rather than Hercules under Hera&#x27;s spell, having drugged Hercules and sent three black wolves to attack him. The wolves killed Hercules&#x27; family, though Hercules believed that it was he who killed his own family. Hercules avenges his family by stabbing Eurystheus to death with his own dagger.

<text>An effects unit, effects processor, or effects pedal is an electronic device that alters the sound of a musical instrument or other audio source through audio signal processing.

Common effects include distortion/overdrive, often used with electric guitar in electric blues and rock music; dynamic effects such as volume pedals and compressors, which affect loudness; filters such as wah-wah pedals and graphic equalizers, which modify frequency ranges; modulation effects, such as chorus, flangers and phasers; pitch effects such as pitch shifters; and time effects, such as reverb and delay, which create echoing sounds and emulate the sound of different spaces.

Most modern effects use solid-state electronics or digital signal processors. Some effects, particularly older ones such as Leslie speakers and spring reverbs, use mechanical components or vacuum tubes. Effects are often used as stompboxes, typically placed on the floor and controlled with footswitches. They may also be built into guitar amplifiers, instruments (such as the Hammond B-3 organ), tabletop units designed for DJs and record producers, and rackmounts, and are widely used as audio plug-ins in such common formats as VST, AAX, and AU.

Musicians, audio engineers and record producers use effects units during live performances or in the studio, typically with electric guitar, bass guitar, electronic keyboard or electric piano. While effects are most frequently used with electric or electronic instruments, they can be used with any audio source, such as acoustic instruments, drums, and vocals.

==Terminology==

An effects unit is also called an &quot;effect box&quot;, &quot;effects device&quot;, &quot;effects processor&quot; or simply an &quot;effect&quot;. The abbreviation &quot;F/X&quot; or &quot;FX&quot; is sometimes used. A pedal-style unit may be called a &quot;stomp box&quot;, &quot;stompbox&quot;, &quot;effects pedal&quot; or &quot;pedal&quot;. Unprocessed audio coming into an effects unit is referred to as &quot;dry&quot;, while the processed audio output is referred to as &quot;wet&quot;.

A musician bringing many pedals to a live show or recording session often mounts the pedals on a guitar pedalboard, to reduce set-up and tear-down time and, for pedalboards with lids, protect the pedals during transportation. When a musician has multiple effects in a rack mounted road case, this case may be called an &quot;effects rack&quot; or &quot;rig&quot;. When rackmounted effects are mounted in a roadcase, this also speeds up a musician&#x27;s set-up and tear-down time, because all of the effects can be connected together inside the rack case.

==Form factors==
Effects units are available in a variety of form factors. Stompboxes are used in both live performance and studio recording. Rackmount devices saw a heavy usage during the later 20th century, due to their superior processing power and desirable tones as compared to pedal-style units. However, by the 21st century, with the advent of digital plugins and more powerful stompboxes for live usage, the use of rack-mounted effect units has declined. An effects unit can consist of analog or digital electronics or a combination of the two. During a live performance, the effect is plugged into the electrical &quot;signal&quot; path of the instrument. In the studio, an instrument or another sound source — possibly an auxiliary output of a mixer or a DAW — is patched into the effect. Whatever the form factor, effects units are part of a studio or musician&#x27;s outboard gear.

=== Stompboxes ===
Stompboxes are small plastic or metal chassis that usually lie on the floor or in a pedalboard to be operated by the user&#x27;s feet. Pedals are often rectangle-shaped, but there are a range of other shapes (e.g., the circular Fuzz Face). Typical simple stompboxes have a single footswitch, one to three potentiometers for controlling the effect, and a single LED that indicates if the effect is on. A typical distortion or overdrive pedal&#x27;s three potentiometers, for example, control the level or intensity of the distortion effect, the tone of the effected signal and the output level of the effected signal. Depending on the type of pedal, the potentiometers may control different parameters of the effect. For a chorus effect, for example, the knobs may control the depth and speed of the effect. Complex stompboxes may have multiple footswitches, many knobs, additional switches or buttons that are operated with the fingers, and an alphanumeric LED display that indicates the status of the effect with short acronyms (e.g., DIST for &quot;distortion&quot;).

An is formed by connecting two or more stompboxes forming a signal chain. Effect chains are typically created between the guitar and the amp or between the preamplifier and the power amp. When a pedal is off or inactive, the electric audio signal coming into the pedal diverts onto a &quot;bypass&quot;, an unaltered &quot;dry&quot; signal that continues on to other effects down the chain. In this way, a musician can combine effects within a chain in a variety of ways without having to reconnect boxes during a performance.
A &quot;controller&quot; or &quot;effects management system&quot; lets the musician create multiple effect chains, so they can select one or several chains by tapping a single switch. The switches are usually organized in a row or a simple grid.

It is common to put compression, wah and overdrive pedals at the start of the chain; modulation (chorus, flanger, phase shifter) in the middle; and time-based units (delay/echo, reverb at the end. When using many effects, unwanted noise and hum can be introduced into the sound. Some performers use a noise gate pedal at the end of a chain to reduce unwanted noise and hum introduced by overdrive units or vintage gear.

===Rackmounts===
Rackmount effects units are typically built in a thin metal chassis with &quot;rack ears&quot; designed to be screw-mounted into the rack rails of a 19-inch rack that is standard to the music technology industry. Rackmount effects have a standardized 19-inch width, and height of 1 or more rack unit(s). Devices that are less than 19 inches wide can sometimes be made rackmount-compatible via special rackmount adapters.

A rackmount effects unit may contain electronic circuitry identical to a stompbox&#x27;s, although its circuits are typically more complex. Unlike stompboxes, rackmounts usually have several different types of effects. Rackmount effects units are controlled by knobs, switches or buttons on their front panel, and often remote-controllable by a MIDI digital control interface or pedal-style &quot;foot controller&quot;.

Rackmount effects units are most commonly used in recording studios and front of house live sound mixing situations. Musicians may use them in place of stompboxes, as use of a rack can offer space for conveniently mounting additional rackmount equipment or accessories. Rackmounted effects units are typically mounted in a rack, which may be housed within a road case, a durable case with removable access panels that protect the equipment within during transportation. Because of this, rackmount effect units are not always designed with durable protective features such as corner protectors which are used on stompboxes and amps that are designed to be transported as standalone units.

===Multi-effects and tabletop units===

A multi-effects (MFX) device is a single electronics effects pedal or rackmount device that contains many different electronic effects. multi-effects devices allow users to &quot;preset&quot; combinations of different effects, allowing musicians quick on-stage access to different effects combinations. Multi-effects units typically have a range of distortion, chorus, flanger, phaser, delay, looper and reverb effects. Pedal-style multi-effects range from fairly inexpensive stompboxes that contain two pedals and a few knobs to control the effects to large, expensive floor units with many pedals and knobs. Rack-mounted multi-effects units may be mounted in the same rack as preamplifiers and power amplifiers.

A tabletop unit is a type of multi-effects device that sits on a desk and is controlled manually. One such example is the Pod guitar amplifier modeler. Digital effects designed for DJs are often sold in tabletop models, so that the units can be placed alongside a DJ mixer, turntables and scratching gear.

===Built-in units===

Effects are often incorporated into instrument amplifiers and even some types of instruments. Electric guitar amplifiers often have built-in reverb, chorus and distortion, while acoustic guitar and keyboard amplifiers tend to only have built-in reverb. Some acoustic instrument amplifiers have reverb, chorus, compression and equalization (bass and treble) effects. Vintage guitar amps typically have tremolo and vibrato effects, and sometimes reverb. The Fender Bandmaster Reverb amp, for example, had built-in reverb and vibrato. Built-in effects may offer the user less control than standalone pedals or rackmounted units. For example, on some lower- to mid-priced bass amplifiers, the only control on the audio compression effect is a button or switch to turn it on or off, or a single knob. In contrast, a pedal or rackmounted unit would typically provide ratio, threshold and attack controls or other options to allow the user additional control over the compression.

Some guitar amplifiers have built-in multi-effects units or digital amplifier modeling effects. Bass amplifiers are less likely to have built-in effects, although some may have a compressor/limiter or fuzz bass effect.

Instruments with built-in effects include Hammond organs, electronic organs, electronic pianos and digital synthesizers. Built-in effects for keyboards typically include reverb, chorus and, for Hammond organ, vibrato. Many clonewheel organs include an overdrive effect. Occasionally, acoustic-electric and electric guitars will have built-in effects, such as a preamp or equalizer.

==History==
===Studio effects and early stand-alone units===
The earliest sound effects were strictly used in studio productions. Microphones placed in echo chambers with specially designed acoustic properties simulated the sound of live performances in different environments. In the mid to late 1940s, recording engineers and experimental musicians such as Les Paul began manipulating reel-to-reel recording tape to create echo effects and unusual, futuristic sounds. In 1941, DeArmond released the Model 601 Tremolo Control, the first commercially available stand-alone effects unit. This device produced a tremolo by passing an instrument&#x27;s electrical signal through a water-based electrolytic fluid. Most stand-alone effects of the 1950s and early 1960s such as the Gibson GA-VI vibrato unit and the Fender reverb box, were expensive and impractical, requiring bulky transformers and high voltages. The original stand-alone units were not especially in-demand as many effects came built into amplifiers. The first popular stand-alone was the 1958 Watkins Copicat, a relatively portable tape echo effect made famous by the British band, The Shadows.

===Amplifiers===
Effects built into tube-powered guitar amplifiers were the first effects that musicians used regularly outside the studio. From the late 1940s onward, the Gibson began including vibrato circuits in combo amplifiers that incorporated one or more speakers with the amp. The 1950 Ray Butts EchoSonic amp was the first to feature a tape echo, which quickly became popular with guitarists such as Chet Atkins, Carl Perkins, Scotty Moore, Luther Perkins, and Roy Orbison. Both Premier and Gibson built amplifiers with spring reverb. Fender began manufacturing the tremolo amps Tremolux in 1955 and Vibrolux in 1956.

Distortion was not an effect originally intended by amplifier manufacturers, but could often easily be achieved by &quot;overdriving&quot; the power supply in early tube amplifiers. In the 1950s, guitarists began deliberately increasing gain beyond its intended levels to achieve &quot;warm&quot; distorted sounds. Among the first musicians to experiment with distortion were Willie Johnson of Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Goree Carter, Joe Hill Louis, Ike Turner, Guitar Slim, and Chuck Berry.

In 1954, Pat Hare produced heavily distorted power chords for several recordings (including James Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Crop Blues&quot;), creating &quot;a grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound,&quot; accomplished by turning the volume knob on his amplifier &quot;all the way to the right until the speaker was screaming.&quot; Link Wray&#x27;s 1958 recording &quot;Rumble&quot; inspired young musicians such as Pete Townshend of The Who, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Jeff Beck, Dave Davies of The Kinks, and Neil Young to explore distortion by various means. In 1966, the British company Marshall Amplification began producing the Marshall 1963, a guitar amplifier capable of producing the distorted &quot;crunch&quot; that rock musicians were starting to seek.

===Stompboxes===
The electronic transistor finally made it possible to fit effects circuitry into highly portable stompbox units. Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, allowing for much more compact formats and greater stability. The first transistorized guitar effect was the 1962 Maestro Fuzz Tone pedal, which became a sensation after its use in the 1965 Rolling Stones hit &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;.

Warwick Electronics manufactured the first wah-wah pedal, The Clyde McCoy, in 1967 and that same year Roger Mayer developed the first octave effect, which Jimi Hendrix named &quot;Octavio&quot;. Upon first hearing the Octavia, Hendrix reportedly rushed back to the studio and immediately used it to record the guitar solos on &quot;Purple Haze&quot; and &quot;Fire&quot;. In 1968, Univox began marketing Shin-ei&#x27;s Uni-Vibe pedal, an effect designed by noted audio engineer Fumio Mieda that mimicked the odd phase shift and chorus effects of the Leslie rotating speakers used in Hammond organs. The pedals soon became favorite effects of guitarists Jimi Hendrix and Robin Trower. In 1976, Roland subsidiary Boss Corporation released the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble, the first chorus pedal, created by taking a chorus circuit from an amplifier and putting it into a stompbox. By the mid-1970s a variety of solid-state effects pedals including flangers, chorus pedals, ring modulators and phase shifters were available.
In the 1980s, digital rackmount units began replacing stompboxes as the effects format of choice. Often musicians would record &quot;dry&quot;, unaltered tracks in the studio and effects would be added in post-production. The success of Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Nevermind&quot; helped to re-ignite interest in stompboxes. Some grunge guitarists would chain several fuzz pedals together and plug them into a tube amplifier. Throughout the 1990s, musicians committed to a lo-fi aesthetic such as J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., Stephen Malkmus of Pavement and Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices continued to use analog effects pedals.
Effects and effects units—stompboxes in particular—have been celebrated by pop and rock musicians in album titles, songs and band names. The Big Muff, a fuzzbox manufactured by Electro-Harmonix, is commemorated by the Depeche Mode song &quot;Big Muff&quot; and the Mudhoney EP &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot;. Nine Inch Nails, Pink Floyd, George Harrison, They Might Be Giants and Joy Division are among the many musicians who have referenced effects units in their music.

==Techniques==

===Distortion===


Distortion, overdrive, and fuzz effects units add a &quot;warm&quot;, &quot;gritty&quot;, or &quot;fuzzy&quot; character to an audio signal by re-shaping or clipping it, which distorts the shape of its waveform by flattening its peaks, creating &quot;warm&quot; sounds by adding harmonics or &quot;gritty&quot; sounds by adding inharmonic overtones. Distortion effects are sometimes called gain effects, as distorted guitar sounds were first achieved by increasing the gain of tube amplifiers.

While distortion effects units produce perfectly flattened peaks or &quot;hard&quot; clipping, overdrive effects units produce &quot;soft&quot; tube-like distortion by compressing the waveform without completely flattening it. Much like guitar tube amplifiers, overdrive effects units are capable of producing &quot;clean&quot; sounds at lower volumes and distorted &quot;warm&quot; sounds at higher volumes.

Notable examples of distortion and overdrive pedals include the Boss DS-1 Distortion, Ibanez Tube Screamer, Marshall ShredMaster, MXR Distortion +, and Pro Co RAT.

A fuzz pedal, or fuzzbox, is a type of overdrive effects unit that clips a signal until it is nearly a squarewave, resulting in a heavily distorted or &quot;fuzzy&quot; sound. Fuzzboxes may contain frequency multiplier circuitry to achieve a harsh timbre by adding complex harmonics. The Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, with a fuzz effect featured prominently on the main electric guitar riff played by Keith Richards, greatly popularized the use of fuzz effects. Fuzz bass (also called bass overdrive) is a style of playing the electric bass that produces a buzzy, overdriven sound via a tube or transistor amp or by using a fuzz or overdrive pedal.

Notable examples of fuzz effect units include the: Arbiter Fuzz Face, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff, Shin-ei Companion FY-2, Univox Super-Fuzz, Vox Tone Bender, Z.Vex Fuzz Factory.

While distortion effect units are most associated with electric and bass guitar, they are also commonly used on keyboard instruments (i.e. synthesizers, combo and tonewheel organs, electric piano), as well as drums and vocals.

===Dynamics===
Also called volume and amplitude effects, dynamics effects modify the volume of an instrument. Dynamics effects were among the first effects introduced to guitarists.

&quot;Boost/volume pedal&quot;: When activated, a &quot;boost&quot; or &quot;clean boost&quot; pedal amplifies the volume of an instrument by increasing the amplitude of its audio signal. These units are generally used for &quot;boosting&quot; volume during solos and preventing signal loss in long effects chains. A guitarist switching from rhythm guitar to lead guitar for a guitar solo may use a boost to increase the volume of their solo.

Volume effects: Electro-Harmonix LPB-1, Fender Volume Pedal, MXR Micro Amp, Ernie Ball Volume Pedal. Treadle-based volume pedals are used by electric instrument players (guitar, bass, keyboards) to adjust the volume of their instrument with one foot while their hands are being used to play their instrument. Treadle-style volume pedals are often also used to create swelling effects by removing the attack of a note or chord, as popularised by pedal steel guitar players. This enables electric guitar and pedal steel players to imitate the soft swelling sound that an orchestra string section can produce, in which a note or chord starts very softly and then grows in volume. Treadle-based volume pedals do not usually have batteries or require external power.

&quot;Compressor&quot;: Compressors make loud sounds quieter and quiet sounds louder by decreasing or &quot;compressing&quot; the dynamic range of an audio signal. A compressor is often used to stabilize volume and alter the sound of a note&#x27;s &quot;attack&quot;. With extreme settings of its controls, a compressor can function as a limiter.

Compressor effects: Keeley Compressor, MXR Dyna Comp, Boss CS-3 Compression Sustainer.

&quot;Noise gate&quot;: Noise gates attenuate hum, hiss, and static in the signal by greatly diminishing the volume when the signal falls below a set threshold. Noise gates are expanders—meaning that, unlike compressors, they increase the dynamic range of an audio signal to make quiet sounds even quieter. If used with extreme settings and combined with reverb, they can create unusual sounds, such as the gated drum effect used in 1980s pop songs, a style popularized by the Phil Collins song &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;.

Noise gate effects: Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor.

===Filter===
Filter effects alter the frequency content of an audio signal that passes through them by either boosting or weakening specific frequencies or frequency regions.

&quot;Equalizer&quot;: An equalizer is a set of linear filters that strengthen (&quot;boost&quot;) or weaken (&quot;cut&quot;) specific frequency regions. While basic home stereos often have equalizers for two bands, to adjust bass and treble, professional graphic equalizers offer much more targeted control over the audio frequency spectrum. Audio engineers use highly sophisticated equalizers to eliminate unwanted sounds, make an instrument or voice more prominent, and enhance particular aspects of an instrument&#x27;s tone.

Equalizer effects: Boss GE-7 Equalizer, MXR 10-band EQ Pedal.
&quot;Talk box&quot;: A talk box directs the sound from an electric guitar or synthesizer into the mouth of a performer using a tube, allowing the sound to be shaped into vowels and consonants with movements of the mouth. The modified sound is then picked up by a microphone. In this way, the guitarist is able create the effect that the guitar is talking. Some famous uses of the talkbox include Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;, Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Black Man&quot;, Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot;, Joe Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;, Alice in Chains&#x27;s &quot;Man in the box&quot; and Peter Frampton&#x27;s &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;.

Talk boxes: Dunlop HT1 Heil Talk Box, Rocktron Banshee.
&quot;Wah-wah&quot;: A wah-wah pedal creates vowel-like sounds by altering the frequency spectrum produced by an instrument—i.e., how loud it is at each separate frequency—in what is known as a spectral glide or &quot;sweep&quot;. The device is operated by a foot treadle that manipulates a potentiometer or other electronic control. Wah-wah pedals are often used by funk and rock guitarists.

Wah effects: Dunlop Cry Baby, Morley Power Wah, Vox.

&quot;Auto-wah&quot; or, more generally, envelope filter effects: A filter effect that is controlled by the volume of the input signal. The most common filter type used for this effect pedal is the low-pass filter, although many designs include a toggle for band-pass or high-pass filters as well. Additionally, some designs can switch between a down filter mode and an up filter. This effect is commonly used in funk, reggae and jam band music.

Envelope filter effects: Musitronics Mu-Tron III, Electro-Harmonix Q-Tron Plus, DOD Envelope Filter 440.

===Modulation===

Modulation, in general electronics, means the altering of one signal based on another. In audio effects, modulation is a control feature that varies the strength or other attribute of the effect over time to alter tonal properties. Some modulation effects modulate an instrument&#x27;s audio signal with a signal generated by the effect called a carrier wave. Other modulation effects split an instrument&#x27;s audio signal in two, altering one portion of the signal and mixing it with the unaltered portion.

&quot;Chorus&quot;: Chorus pedals mimic the effect choirs and string orchestras produce naturally, by mixing similar sounds with slight differences in timbre and pitch. A chorus effect splits the audio signal and adds a slight delay and frequency variations or &quot;vibrato&quot; to one version while leaving the rest unaltered. A well-known usage of chorus is the lead guitar in &quot;Come As You Are&quot; by Nirvana.

Chorus effects: Boss CE-1 Chorus Ensemble, Electro-Harmonix Small Clone, TC Electronic Stereo Chorus.

&quot;Flanger&quot;: A flanger creates a &quot;whooshing&quot;, &quot;jet plane&quot; or &quot;spaceship&quot; sound, simulating a studio effect that was first produced by recording a track on two synchronized tape decks and periodically slowing one tape by pressing the edge of its reel (the &quot;flange&quot;). When the two tapes&#x27; audio signals are later mixed, a comb filter effect can be heard. Flanger units add a variably delayed version of the audio signal to the original or signal, creating a comb filter or Doppler effect. Some famous uses of flanger effects include &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot; by The Police, the intro to &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Love&quot; by Van Halen, and &quot;Barracuda&quot; by Heart.

Flanger effects: Electro-Harmonix Electric Mistress, MXR Flanger, Boss BF-3 Flanger.
&quot;Phaser&quot;: A phaser or phase shifter creates a slight rippling effect—amplifying some aspects of the tone while diminishing others—by splitting an audio signal in two and altering the phase of one portion. Three well-known examples of phaser are the two-handed tapping part on the Van Halen instrumental &quot;Eruption&quot; and the keyboard parts on Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; and Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Slip Slidin&#x27; Away&quot;.

Phase shift effects: Uni-Vibe, Electro-Harmonix Small Stone, MXR Phase 90.

&quot;Ring modulator&quot;: A ring modulator produces a resonant, metallic sound by frequency mixing an instrument&#x27;s audio signal with a carrier wave generated by the device&#x27;s internal oscillator. The original sound wave is suppressed and replaced by a &quot;ring&quot; of inharmonic higher and lower pitches or sidebands. A notable use of ring modulation is the guitar in the Black Sabbath song &quot;Paranoid&quot;.

Ring modulator effects: Moogerfooger MF-102 Ring Modulator.

&quot;Tremolo&quot;: A tremolo effect produces a variation in the volume of a signal. The tremolo effect should not be confused with the misleadingly-named tremolo bar, a device on a guitar bridge that creates a vibrato or pitch-bending effect. In electronic effects, a tremolo is produced by modulating an instrument&#x27;s audio signal with a sub-audible carrier wave in such a way that generates amplitude variations in the sound wave. Tremolo effects are built-in effects in some vintage guitar amplifiers. The guitar intro in the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; features a tremolo effect.

Tremolo effects: Demeter TRM-1 Tremulator, Fender Tremolux.

&quot;Slicer&quot;: Combines a modulation sequence with a noise gate or envelope filter to create a percussive and rhythmic effect like a helicopter.

&quot;Vibrato&quot;: Vibrato effects produce slight, rapid variations in pitch, mimicking the fractional semitone variations produced naturally by opera singers and violinists when they are prolonging a single note. Vibrato effects often allow the performer to control the rate of the variation as well as the difference in pitch (&quot;depth&quot;). A vibrato with an extreme &quot;depth&quot; setting (e.g., half a semitone or more) will produce a dramatic, ululating sound. In transistorized effects, vibrato is produced by mixing an instrument&#x27;s audio signal with a carrier wave in such a way that generates frequency variations in the sound wave. Guitarists often use the terms &quot;vibrato&quot; and &quot;tremolo&quot; misleadingly. A so-called &quot;vibrato unit&quot; in a guitar amplifier may actually produces tremolo, while a &quot;tremolo arm&quot; or &quot;whammy bar&quot; on a guitar produces vibrato.

Vibrato effects: Boss VB-2 Vibrato.

===Pitch and frequency===

A pitch shifter (also called an &quot;octaver&quot; for effects that shift pitch by an octave) raises or lowers (e.g. &quot;transposes&quot;) each note a performer plays by a pre-set interval. For example, a pitch shifter set to increase the pitch by a fourth will raise each note four diatonic intervals above the notes actually played. Simple, less expensive pitch shifters raise or lower the pitch by one or two octaves, while more sophisticated and expensive devices offer a range of interval alterations. A pitch shifter can be used by an electric guitarist to play notes that would normally only be available on an electric bass. As well, a bass player with a four string electric bass can use an octave pedal to obtain low notes that would normally only be obtainable with a five-string bass with a low &quot;B&quot; string.

A harmonizer is a type of sophisticated pitch shifter that combines the altered pitch with the original pitch to create a two note harmony based on the original pitch, or even with some pedals, three note harmony. Some hamonizers are able to create chorus-like effects by adding very tiny shifts in pitch.

The first mass-market digital pitch shifter was the DigiTech Whammy, introduced in 1989. It creates a &quot;strange and artificial&quot; sound, with distinctive &quot;wobbly&quot; artifacts. Its users include Jonny Greenwood and Ed O&#x27;Brien of Radiohead, Matt Bellamy of Muse, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Jack White of the White Stripes. &quot;Guitar World&quot; described the Whammy as one of the most iconic guitar pedals.

===Time-based===
Time-based effects delay the sound signal, add reverb or echos, or, if a long delay is possible, enable musicians to record &quot;loops&quot;.
&quot;Delay/echo&quot;: Delay/echo units produce an echo effect by adding a duplicate instrument-to-amplifier electrical signal to the original signal at a slight time-delay. The effect can either be a single echo called a &quot;slap&quot; or &quot;slapback&quot;, or multiple echos. A well-known use of delay is the lead guitar in the U2 song &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, and also the opening riff of &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; by Guns N&#x27; Roses.

Delay effects: Boss DD-3 Digital Delay, MXR Carbon Copy, Electro-Harmonix Deluxe Memory Man, Line 6 DL4, Roland RE-201.

&quot;Looper pedal&quot;: A looper pedal or &quot;phrase looper&quot; allows a performer to record and later replay a phrase, riff or passage from a song. Loops can be created on the spot during a performance (live looping) or they can be pre-recorded. By using a looper pedal, a singer-guitarist in a one person band can play the backing chords (or riffs) to a song, loop them with the pedal, and then sing and do a guitar solo over the chords. Some units allow a performer to layer multiple loops, enabling the performer to create the effect of a full band. The first loop effects were created with reel-to-reel tape using a tape loop. High-end boutique tape loop effects are still used by some studio producers who want a vintage sound. Digital loop effects recreate this effect using an electronic memory.
&quot;Reverb&quot;: Reverb units simulate the spacious sounds produced naturally in a huge stone cathedral (or other acoustic space such as a hall or room). This is done by creating a large number of echoes that gradually fade away in volume or &quot;decay&quot;. One early technique for creating a reverb effect was to send an amplified signal of the music via a speaker to another room with reflective surfaces, such as a tile bathroom, and then record the natural reverberations that were produced. A plate reverb system uses an electromechanical transducer to create vibrations in a plate of metal. Spring reverb systems, which are often used in guitar amplifiers, use a transducer to create vibrations in a spring. Digital reverb effects use various signal processing algorithms to create the reverb effect, often by using multiple feedback delay circuits. Rockabilly and surf guitar are two genres that make heavy use of reverb.

Reverb effects: Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail, Fender Reverb Unit.

===Feedback/sustain===

&quot;Audio feedback&quot;: Audio feedback is an effect produced when amplified sound is picked up by a microphone or guitar pickup and played back through a guitar amplifier, initiating a &quot;feedback loop&quot;, which usually consists of high-pitched sound. Feedback that occurs from a vocal mic into a PA system is almost always avoided. However, in some styles of rock music, electric guitar players intentionally create feedback by playing their instrument directly in front of a heavily amplified, distorted guitar amplifier&#x27;s speaker enclosure. The creative use of feedback effects was pioneered by guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix in the 1960s. This technique creates sustained, high-pitched overtones and unusual sounds not possible through regular playing techniques. Guitar feedback effects can be difficult to perform, because it is difficult to determine the sound volume and guitar position relative to a guitar amp&#x27;s loudspeaker necessary for achieving the desired feedback sound. Guitar feedback effects are used in a number of rock genres, including psychedelic rock, heavy metal music and punk rock.
EBow is a brand name of Heet Sound Products, of Los Angeles, California, for a small, handheld, battery-powered resonator. The Ebow was invented by Greg Heet, as a way to make a note on an electric guitar string resonate continuously, creating an effect that sounds similar to a bowed violin note or a sustained pipe organ note. The resonator uses a pickup – inductive string driver – feedback circuit, including a sensor coil, driver coil, and amplifier, to induce forced string resonance. The Ebow brand resonator is monophonic, and drives only one string at a time.

Other handheld and mounted guitar and bass resonators have been on the market since the early 1990s, produced in Germany under the SRG brand, which ceased production in 2016, and were available in both monophonic (one string at a time) and polyphonic (multiple strings at a time) models, which included multiple onboard trigger switch effects, such as HPF (high pass filter) for enhancing harmonics and producing feedback effects, and LPF (low pass filter), producing a bass boost with a cello sound on heavy gauge strings. Later EBow models, such as the plus Ebow, contain a mode slide switch on the back, which allows the player to either produce just sustain or overtone feedback in addition to sustain. Pedals such as the Boss DF-2 and FB-2 use an internally generated signal matched to the pitch of the guitar that can be sustained indefinitely by depressing the pedal. Many compressor pedals are often also marketed as &quot;sustainer pedals&quot;. As a note is sustained, it loses energy and volume due to diminishing vibration in the string. The compressor pedal boosts its electrical signal to the specified dynamic range, slightly prolonging the duration of the note. This, combined with heavy distortion and the close proximity of the guitar and the speaker cabinet, can lead to infinite sustain at higher volumes.

===Other effects===
&quot;Envelope follower&quot;: An envelope follower activates an effect once a designated volume is reached. One effect that uses an envelope follower is the &quot;auto-wah&quot;, which produces a &quot;wah&quot; effect depending on how loud or soft the notes are being played.

&quot;Guitar amplifier modeling&quot;: Amplifier modeling is a digital effect that replicates the sound of various amplifiers, most often vintage tube amplifiers and famous brands of speaker cabinets (e.g., the Ampeg SVT 8x10&quot; bass cabinet). Sophisticated modeling effects can simulate different types of speaker cabinets (e.g., the sound of an 8x10&quot; cabinet) and miking techniques. A rotary speaker simulator mimics the doppler and chorus effect sound of a vintage Leslie speaker system by replicating its volume and pitch modulations, overdrive capacity and phase shifts.

&quot;Pitch correction/vocal effects&quot;: Pitch correction effects use signal-processing algorithms to re-tune faulty intonation in a vocalist&#x27;s performance or create unusual vocoder-type vocal effects. One of the best known examples of this is Autotune, a software program and effect unit which can be used to both correct pitch (it moves a pitch to the nearest semitone), and add vocal effects. Some stompbox-style vocal pedals contain multiple effects, such as reverb and pitch correction.

&quot;Simulators&quot;: Simulators enable electric guitars to mimic the sound of other instruments such as acoustic guitar, electric bass and sitar. Pick up simulators used on guitars with single-coil pick ups replicate the sound of guitars with humbucker pick ups, or vice versa. A de-fretter is a bass guitar effect that simulates the sound of a fretless bass. The effect uses an envelope-controlled filter and voltage-controlled amplifier to &quot;soften&quot; a note&#x27;s attack both in volume and timbre.

&quot;Bitcrusher filters&quot;: Bitcrushers rely on conversion of the audio signal into a digital format (ADC) and the reduction of sound fidelity by utilising bit (and sometimes sample) rates low enough to cause significant colouration and filtering within the audible frequency range.
&quot;Rotary speakers&quot; are specially constructed amplifier and loudspeakers used to create special audio effects by rotating the speakers or a sound-directing duct
to introduce the Doppler effect and other sound reflections. The rotating speaker baffle creates a chorus-type effect. Named after its inventor, Donald Leslie, it is particularly associated with the Hammond organ but is used with a variety of instruments as well as vocals. The Hammond/Leslie combination has become an element in many genres of music. The Leslie Speaker and the Hammond Organ brands are currently owned by Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation.

The &quot;Korg Kaoss Pad&quot; is a small touchpad MIDI controller, sampler, and effects processor for audio and musical instruments, made by Korg. The Kaoss Pad&#x27;s touchpad can be used to control its internal effects engine, which can be applied to a line-in signal or to samples recorded from the line-in. Effects types include pitch shifting, distortion, filtering, wah-wah, tremolo, flanging, delay, reverberation, auto-panning, gating, phasing, and ring modulation.
The Kaoss Pad can also be used as a MIDI controller.

==Bass effects==
Bass effects are electronic effects units that are designed for use with the low pitches created by an electric bass or for an upright bass used with a bass amp or PA system. Two examples of bass effects are fuzz bass and bass chorus. Some bass amplifiers have built-in effects, such as overdrive or chorus. Upright bassists in jazz, folk, blues and similar genres may use a bass preamplifier, a small electronic device that matches the impedance between the piezoelectric pickup and the amp or PA system. Bass preamps also allow for the gain of the signal to be boosted or cut. Some models also offer equalization controls, a compressor, and a DI box connection.

==Boutique pedals==

Boutique pedals are designed by smaller, independent companies and are typically produced in limited quantities. Some may even be hand-made, with hand-soldered connections. These pedals are mainly distributed online or through mail-order, or sold in a few music stores. They are often more expensive than mass-produced pedals and offer higher-quality components, innovative designs, in-house-made knobs, and hand-painted artwork or etching. Some boutique companies focus on re-creating classic or vintage effects.

Some boutique pedal manufacturers include: BJFE, Pete Cornish, Emlyn Crowther, Death By Audio, Robert Keeley, Roger Linn, Roger Mayer, Strymon, T-Rex Engineering, ToadWorks, and Z.Vex Effects.

===Modification===
There is also a niche market for modifying or &quot;modding&quot; effects. Typically, vendors provide either custom modification services or sell new effects pedals they have already modified. The Ibanez Tube Screamer, Boss DS-1, Pro Co RAT and DigiTech Whammy are some of the most often-modified effects. Common modifications include value changes in capacitors or resistors, adding true-bypass so that the effect&#x27;s circuitry is no longer in the signal path, substituting higher-quality components, replacing the unit&#x27;s original operational amplifiers (op-amps), or adding functions to the device, such as allowing additional control of some factor or adding another output jack.

==Other pedals and rackmount units==
Not all stompboxes and rackmounted electronic devices designed for musicians are effects. Strobe tuner and regular electronic tuner pedals indicate whether a guitar string is too sharp or flat. Stompbox-format tuner pedals route the electric signal for the instrument through the unit via a 1/4&quot; patch cable. These pedal-style tuners usually have an output so that the signal can be plugged into a guitar amp to produce sound. Rackmount power conditioner devices deliver a voltage of the proper level and characteristics to enable equipment to function properly (e.g., by providing transient impulse protection). A rackmounted wireless receiver unit is used to enable a guitarist or bassist to move around on stage without being connected to a cable. A footswitch pedal such as the &quot;A/B&quot; pedal routes a guitar signal to an amplifier or enables a performer to switch between two guitars, or between two amplifiers.
Guitar amplifiers and electronic keyboards may have switch pedals for turning built-in reverb and distortion effects on and off; the pedals contain only a switch, with the circuitry for the effect being housed in the amplifier chassis. Some musicians who use rackmounted effects or laptops employ a MIDI controller pedalboard or armband remote controls to trigger sound samples, switch between different effects or control effect settings. A pedal keyboard uses pedals, but it is not an effect unit; it is a foot-operated keyboard in which the pedals are typically used to play basslines.

<doc id="10166" wikidata="Q327646" url="?curid=10166" title="Enron">
<text>Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company based in Houston, Texas. It was founded by Kenneth Lay in 1985 as a merger between Lay&#x27;s Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, both relatively small regional companies at the time of the merger. Before its bankruptcy on December 2, 2001, Enron employed approximately 20,600 staff and was a major electricity, natural gas, communications, and pulp and paper company, with claimed revenues of nearly $101 billion during 2000. &quot;Fortune&quot; named Enron &quot;America&#x27;s Most Innovative Company&quot; for six consecutive years.

At the end of 2001, it was revealed that Enron&#x27;s reported financial condition was sustained by an institutionalized, systematic, and creatively planned accounting fraud, known since as the Enron scandal. Enron became synonymous with willful, institutional fraud and systemic corruption. The scandal brought into question the accounting practices and activities of many corporations in the United States and was a factor in the enactment of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002. It affected the greater business world by causing, together with the even larger fraudulent bankruptcy of WorldCom, the dissolution of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, which had been Enron and WorldCom&#x27;s main auditor, and coconspirator in the fraud for years.

Enron filed for bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in late 2001 and selected Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges as its bankruptcy counsel. Enron emerged from bankruptcy in November 2004, under a court-approved plan of reorganization. A new board of directors changed its name to Enron Creditors Recovery Corp., and emphasized reorganizing and liquidating certain operations and assets of the pre-bankruptcy Enron. On September 7, 2006, Enron sold its last remaining subsidiary, Prisma Energy International, to Ashmore Energy International Ltd. (now AEI). It is the largest bankruptcy due specifically to fraud in United States history.

On December 2, 2024, the Enron website relaunched as satire, with Connor Gaydos, the cofounder of Birds Aren&#x27;t Real, as CEO.

==History==
===Pre-merger origins (1925–1985)===
====InterNorth====
One of Enron&#x27;s primary predecessors was InterNorth, which was formed in 1930, in Omaha, Nebraska, just a few months after Black Tuesday. The low cost of natural gas and the cheap supply of labor during the Great Depression helped to fuel the company&#x27;s early beginnings, doubling in size by 1932. Over the next 50 years, Northern expanded even more as it acquired many energy companies. It was reorganized in 1979 as the main subsidiary of a holding company, InterNorth, a diversified energy and energy-related products firm. Although most of the acquisitions conducted were successful, some ended poorly. InterNorth competed with Cooper Industries unsuccessfully over a hostile takeover of Crouse-Hinds Company, an electrical products manufacturer. Cooper and InterNorth feuded in numerous suits during the takeover that were eventually settled after the transaction was completed. The subsidiary Northern Natural Gas operated the largest pipeline company in North America. By the 1980s, InterNorth became a major force for natural gas production, transmission, and marketing as well as for natural gas liquids, and was an innovator in the plastics industry. In 1983, InterNorth merged with the Belco Petroleum Company, a Fortune 500 oil exploration and development company founded by Arthur Belfer.

====Houston Natural Gas====
The Houston Natural Gas (HNG) corporation was initially formed from the Houston Oil Co. in 1925 to provide gas to customers in the Houston market through the building of gas pipelines. Under the leadership of CEO Robert Herring from 1967 to 1981, the company took advantage of the unregulated Texas natural gas market and the commodity surge in the early 1970s to become a dominant force in the energy industry. Toward the end of the 1970s, HNG&#x27;s luck began to run out with rising gas prices forcing clients to switch to oil. In addition, with the passing of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, the Texas market was less profitable and as a result, HNG&#x27;s profits fell. After Herring died in 1981, M.D. Matthews briefly took over as CEO in a 3-year stint with initial success, but ultimately, a big dip in earnings led to his exit. In 1984, Kenneth Lay succeeded Matthews and inherited the troubled conglomerate.

====Merger====
With its conservative success, InterNorth became a target of corporate takeovers, the most prominent originating with Irwin Jacobs. InterNorth CEO Sam Segnar sought a friendly merger with HNG. In May 1985, Internorth acquired HNG for $2.3 billion, 40% higher than the current market price, and on July 16, 1985, the two entities voted to merge. The combined assets of the two companies created the second largest gas pipeline system in the US at that time. Internorth&#x27;s north–south pipelines that served Iowa and Minnesota complemented HNG&#x27;s Florida and California east-west pipelines well.

===Post-merger rise (1985–1991)===
The company was initially named HNG/InterNorth Inc., even though InterNorth was technically the parent. At the outset, Segnar was CEO but was soon fired by the board of directors to name Lay to the post. Lay moved its headquarters back to Houston and set out to find a new name, spending more than $100,000 in focus groups and consultants in the process. Lippincott &amp; Margulies, the advertising firm responsible for the InterNorth identity five years prior, suggested &quot;Enteron&quot;. During a meeting with employees on February 14, 1986, Lay announced his interest in this name change, which would be held to a stockholder vote on April 10. Less than a month from this meeting, on March 7, 1986, a spokesman for HNG/InterNorth rescinded the planned Enteron proposal, as since its announcement the name had come under scrutiny for being the same as . This same press release saw the introduction of the Enron name, which would be the new name voted on come April.

Enron still had some lingering problems left over from its merger, however, the company had to pay Jacobs, who was still a threat, over $350 million and reorganize the company. Lay sold off any parts of the company that he believed didn&#x27;t belong in the long-term future of Enron. Lay consolidated all the gas pipeline efforts under the Enron Gas Pipeline Operating Company. In addition, it ramped up its electric power and natural gas efforts. In 1988 and 1989, the company added power plants and cogeneration units to its portfolio. In 1989, Jeffrey Skilling, then a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, came up with the idea to link natural gas to consumers in more ways, effectively turning natural gas into a commodity. Enron adopted the idea and called it the &quot;Gas Bank&quot;. The division&#x27;s success prompted Skilling to join Enron as the head of the Gas Bank in 1991. Another major development inside Enron was a pivot to overseas operations with a $56 million loan in 1989 from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) for a power plant in Argentina.

====Timeline (1985–1992)====
=====1980s=====
* New regulations gradually create a market-pricing system for natural gas. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 436 (1985) provides blanket approval for pipelines that choose to become common carriers transporting gas intrastate. FERC Order 451 (1986) deregulates the wellhead, and FERC Order 490 (April 1988) authorizes producers, pipelines, and others to terminate gas sales or purchases without seeking prior FERC approval. As a result of these orders, more than 75% of gas sales are conducted through the spot market, and unprecedented market volatility exists.

======July 1985======
* Houston Natural Gas, run by Kenneth Lay merges with InterNorth, a natural gas company in Omaha, Nebraska, to form an interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline with approximately of pipeline.

======November 1985======
* Lay is appointed chairman and chief executive of the combined company. The company chooses the name Enron.

=====1986=====
* Company moves headquarters to Houston, where Ken Lay lives. Enron is both a natural gas and oil company.
* &quot;Enron&#x27;s vision:&quot; To become the premier natural gas pipeline in America.

=====1987=====
* Enron Oil, Enron&#x27;s petroleum marketing operation, reports a loss of $85 million in 8-K filings. True loss of $142–190 million is concealed until 1993. Two top Enron Oil executives in Valhalla, New York, plead guilty to charges of fraud and filing false tax returns. One serves time in prison.

=====1988=====
* The company&#x27;s major strategy shift – to pursue unregulated markets in addition to its regulated pipeline business – is decided in a gathering that became known as the &quot;Come to Jesus&quot; meeting.
* Enron enters the UK energy market following the privatization of the electricity industry there. It becomes the first U.S. company to construct a power plant, Teesside Power Station, in Great Britain.

=====1989=====
* Enron launches &quot;Gas Bank&quot;, later run by CEO Jeff Skilling in 1990, which allows gas producers and wholesale buyers to purchase gas supplies and hedge the price risk at the same time.
* Enron begins offering financing to oil and gas producers.
* Transwestern Pipeline Company, owned by Enron at that time, is the first merchant pipeline in the US to stop selling gas and become a transportation-only pipeline.

=====1990=====
* Enron launches plan to expand US natural gas business abroad.
* Enron becomes a natural gas market maker. Begins trading futures and options on the New York Mercantile Exchange and over-the-counter market using financial instruments such as swaps and options.
* Ken Lay and Rich Kinder hire Jeff Skilling from McKinsey &amp; Company to become CEO of &quot;Enron Gas Services&quot;, Enron&#x27;s &quot;Gas Bank&quot;. Enron Gas Services eventually morphs into &quot;Enron Capital and Trade Resources&quot; (ECT).
* Jeff Skilling hires Andrew Fastow from the banking industry; he starts as account director and quickly rises within the ranks of ECT.

=====1991=====
* Enron adopts mark-to-market accounting practices, reporting income and value of assets at their replacement cost.
* Rebecca Mark becomes chairman and CEO of Enron Development Corp., a unit formed to pursue international markets.
* Andy Fastow forms the first of many off-balance-sheet partnerships for legitimate purposes. Later, off-balance-sheet partnerships and transactions will become a way for money-losing ventures to be concealed and income reporting to be accelerated.

=====1992=====
* Enron acquires Transportadora de Gas del Sur.

===1991–2000===
Throughout the 1990s, Enron made a few changes to its business plan that greatly improved the perceived profitability of the company. First, Enron invested heavily in overseas assets, specifically energy. Another major shift was the gradual transition of focus from a producer of energy to a company that acted more like an investment firm and sometimes a hedge fund, making profits off the margins of the products it traded. These products were traded through the Gas Bank concept, now called the Enron Finance Corp. and headed by Skilling.

====Operations as a trading firm====
With the success of the Gas Bank trading natural gas, Skilling looked to expand the horizons of his division, Enron Capital &amp; Trade. Skilling hired Andrew Fastow in 1990 to help.

====Entrance into the retail energy market====
Starting in 1994 under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Congress allowed states to deregulate their electricity utilities, allowing them to be opened for competition. California was one such state to do so. Enron, seeing an opportunity with rising prices, was eager to jump into the market. In 1997, Enron acquired Portland General Electric (PGE). Although an Oregon utility, it had the potential to begin serving the massive California market since PGE was a regulated utility. The new Enron division, Enron Energy, ramped up its efforts by offering discounts to potential customers in California starting in 1998. Enron Energy also began to sell natural gas to customers in Ohio and wind power in Iowa. However, the company ended its retail endeavor in 1999 as it was revealed it was costing upwards of $100 million a year.

====Data management====
As fiber optic technology progressed in the 1990s, multiple companies, including Enron, attempted to make money by &quot;keeping the continuing network costs low&quot;, which was done by owning their own network. In 1997, FTV Communications LLC, a limited liability company formed by Enron subsidiary FirstPoint Communications, Inc., constructed a fiber optic network between Portland and Las Vegas. In 1998, Enron constructed a building in a rundown area of Las Vegas near E Sahara, right over the &quot;backbone&quot; of fiber optic cables providing service to technology companies nationwide. The location had the ability to send &quot;the entire Library of Congress anywhere in the world within minutes&quot; and could stream &quot;video to the whole state of California&quot;. The location was also more protected from natural disasters than areas such as Los Angeles or the East Coast. According to &quot;Wall Street Daily&quot;, &quot;Enron had a secret&quot;, it &quot;wanted to trade bandwidth like it traded oil, gas, electricity, etc. It launched a secret plan to build an enormous amount of fiber optic transmission capacity in Las Vegas ... it was all part of Enron&#x27;s plan to essentially own the internet.&quot; Enron sought to have all US internet service providers rely on their Nevada facility to supply bandwidth, which Enron would sell in a fashion similar to other commodities.

In January 2000, Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling announced to analysts that they were going to open trading for their own &quot;high-speed fiber-optic networks that form the backbone for Internet traffic&quot;. Investors quickly bought Enron stock following the announcement &quot;as they did with most things Internet-related at the time&quot;, with stock prices rising from $40 per share in January 2000 to $70 per share in March, peaking at $90 in the summer of 2000. Enron executives obtained windfall gains from the rising stock prices, with a total of $924 million of stocks sold by high-level Enron employees between 2000 and 2001. The head of Enron Broadband Services, Kenneth Rice, sold 1 million shares himself, earning about $70 million in returns. As prices of existing fiber optic cables plummeted due to the vast oversupply of the system, with only 5% of the 40 million miles being active wires, Enron purchased the inactive &quot;dark fibers&quot;, expecting to buy them at low cost and then make a profit as the need for more usage by internet providers increased, with Enron expecting to lease its acquired dark fibers in 20-year contracts to providers. However, Enron&#x27;s accounting would use estimates to determine how much their dark fiber would be worth when &quot;lit&quot; and apply those estimates to their current income, adding exaggerated revenue to their accounts since transactions were not yet made and it was not known if the cables would ever be active. Enron&#x27;s trading with other energy companies within the broadband market was its attempt to lure large telecommunications companies, such as Verizon Communications, into its broadband scheme to create its own new market.

By the second quarter of 2001, Enron Broadband Services was reporting losses. On March 12, 2001, a proposed 20-year deal between Enron and Blockbuster Inc. to stream movies on demand over Enron&#x27;s connections was canceled, with Enron shares dropping from $80 per share in mid-February 2001 to below $60 the week after the deal was killed. The branch of the company that Jeffrey Skilling &quot;said would eventually add $40 billion to Enron&#x27;s stock value&quot; added only about $408 million in revenue for Enron in 2001, with the company&#x27;s broadband arm closed shortly after its meager second-quarter earnings report in July 2001.

Following the bankruptcy of Enron, telecommunications holdings were sold for &quot;pennies on the dollar&quot;. In 2002, Rob Roy of Switch Communications purchased Enron&#x27;s Nevada facility in an auction attended only by Roy. Enron&#x27;s &quot;fiber plans were so secretive that few people even knew about the auction.&quot; The facility was sold for only $930,000. Following the sale, Switch expanded to control &quot;the biggest data center in the world&quot;.

====Overseas expansion====
Enron, seeing stability after the merger, began to look overseas for new possible energy opportunities in 1991. Enron&#x27;s first such opportunity was a natural gas power plant utilizing cogeneration that the company built near Middlesbrough, UK. The power plant was so large it could produce up to 3% of the United Kingdom&#x27;s electricity demand with a capacity of over 1,875 megawatts. Seeing the success in England, the company developed and diversified its assets worldwide under the name of Enron International (EI), headed by former HNG executive Rebecca Mark. By 1994, EI&#x27;s portfolio included assets in The Philippines, Australia, Guatemala, Germany, France, India, Argentina, the Caribbean, China, England, Colombia, Turkey, Bolivia, Brazil, Indonesia, Norway, Poland, and Japan. The division was producing a large share of earnings for Enron, contributing 25% of earnings in 1996. Mark and EI believed the water industry was the next market to be deregulated by authorities. Seeing the potential, they searched for ways to enter the market, similar to PGE.

During this period of growth, Enron introduced a new corporate identity on January 14, 1997, and from that point adopted their distinctive tricolor E logo. This logo was one of the final projects of legendary graphic designer Paul Rand before his death in 1996, and debuted almost three months after his departure.

In 1998, Enron International acquired Wessex Water for $2.88 billion. Wessex Water became the core asset of a new company, Azurix, which expanded to other water companies. After Azurix&#x27;s promising IPO in June 1999, Enron &quot;sucked out over $1 billion in cash while loading it up with debt&quot;, according to Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind, authors of &quot;The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron&quot;. Additionally, British water regulators required Wessex to cut its rates by 12% starting in April 2000, and an upgrade was required of the utility&#x27;s aging infrastructure, estimated at costing over a billion dollars. By the end of 2000 Azurix had an operating profit of less than $100 million and was $2 billion in debt. In August 2000, after Azurix stock took a plunge following its earnings report, Mark resigned from Azurix and Enron. Azurix assets, including Wessex, were eventually sold by Enron.

===Misleading financial accounts===
In 1990, Enron&#x27;s chief operating officer Jeffrey Skilling hired Andrew Fastow, who was well acquainted with the burgeoning deregulated energy market that Skilling wanted to exploit. In 1993, Fastow began establishing numerous limited liability special-purpose entities, a common business practice in the energy industry. However, it also allowed Enron to transfer some of its liabilities off its books, allowing it to maintain a robust and generally increasing stock price and thus keep its critical investment-grade credit ratings.

Enron was originally involved in transmitting and distributing electricity and natural gas throughout the US. The company developed, built, and operated power plants and pipelines while dealing with rules of law and other infrastructures worldwide. Enron owned a large network of natural gas pipelines, which stretched coast to coast and border to border including Northern Natural Gas, Florida Gas Transmission, Transwestern Pipeline Company, and a partnership in Northern Border Pipeline from Canada. The states of California, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island had already passed power deregulation laws by July 1996, the time of Enron&#x27;s proposal to acquire Portland General Electric corporation. During 1998, Enron began operations in the water sector, creating the Azurix Corporation, which it part-floated on the New York Stock Exchange during June 1999. Azurix failed to become successful in the water utility market, and one of its major concessions, in Buenos Aires, was a large-scale money-loser.

Enron grew wealthy due largely to marketing, promoting power, and having a high stock price. Enron was named &quot;America&#x27;s Most Innovative Company&quot; by &quot;Fortune&quot; for six consecutive years, from 1996 to 2001. It was on the &quot;Fortune&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Companies to Work for in America&quot; list during 2000, and had offices that were stunning in their opulence. Enron was hailed by many, including labor and the workforce, as an overall great company, praised for its large long-term pensions, benefits for its workers, and extremely effective management until the exposure of its corporate fraud. The first analyst to question the company&#x27;s success story was Daniel Scotto, an energy market expert at BNP Paribas, who issued a note in August 2001 entitled &quot;Enron: All stressed up and no place to go&quot; which encouraged investors to sell Enron stocks, although he only changed his recommendation on the stock from &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;neutral&quot;.

As was later discovered, many of Enron&#x27;s recorded assets and profits were inflated, wholly fraudulent, or nonexistent. One example was in 1999 when Enron promised to repay Merrill Lynch&#x27;s investment with interest to show a profit on its books. Debts and losses were put into entities formed offshore that were not included in the company&#x27;s financial statements; other sophisticated and arcane financial transactions between Enron and related companies were used to eliminate unprofitable entities from the company&#x27;s books.

The company&#x27;s most valuable asset and the largest source of honest income, the 1930s-era Northern Natural Gas company, was eventually purchased by a group of Omaha investors who relocated its headquarters to their city; it is now a unit of Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway Energy. NNG was established as collateral for a $2.5 billion capital infusion by Dynegy Corporation when Dynegy was planning to buy Enron. When Dynegy examined Enron&#x27;s financial records carefully, they repudiated the deal and dismissed their CEO, Chuck Watson. The new chairman and CEO, the late Daniel Dienstbier, had been president of NNG and an Enron executive at one time and was forced out by Ken Lay. Dienstbier was an acquaintance of Warren Buffett. NNG continues to be profitable now.

===2002–2006===
* In 2003, Enron moved its subsidiaries of Transwestern Pipeline, Citrus Corporation, and Northern Plains Natural Gas Company into a separate corporation. The plan was to distribute the shares of the new pipeline company to creditors as part of the planned reorganization. Enron later announced the name of the new pipeline corporation as CrossCountry Energy (CCE).
* As a result of an attempted merger with Dynegy and a series of court cases between Enron and Dynegy, Northern Plains became a part of Dynegy as a settlement from Enron. MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, later purchased the pipeline company from Dynegy for $928 million. 
* In 2004, CCE was in turn purchased by CCE Holdings Inc. (CCEH), a joint venture between Southern Union Co. and GE Commercial Finance Energy Financial Service. Citrus Corporation, which owns 100% of Florida Gas Transmission Corporation, was 50% owned by CCE and a subsidiary of El Paso Natural Gas Company. CCEH acquired 50% of Citrus Corporation as purchased CCE. CCEH was the successful bidder in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York auction of CCE.
* In 2006, 50% of CCEH was purchased by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP). CCEH later redeemed ETP&#x27;s 50% ownership into 100% ownership of Transwestern.

== 2001 accounting scandals ==

In 2001, after a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures perpetrated throughout the 1990s involving Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen that bordered on fraud, Enron filed for the then largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in history (since surpassed by those of Worldcom during 2002 and Lehman Brothers during 2008), resulting in $11 billion in shareholder losses.

As the scandal progressed, Enron share prices decreased from US$90 during the summer of 2000, to just pennies. Enron&#x27;s demise occurred after the revelation that much of its profit and revenue were the result of deals with special-purpose entities (limited partnerships which it controlled). This maneuver allowed many of Enron&#x27;s debts and losses to disappear from its financial statements.

Enron filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. In addition, the scandal caused the dissolution of Arthur Andersen, which at the time was one of the Big Five of the world&#x27;s accounting firms. The company was found guilty of obstruction of justice in 2002 for destroying documents related to the Enron audit. Since the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons, Andersen was forced to stop auditing public companies. Although the conviction was dismissed in 2005 by the Supreme Court, the damage to the Andersen name has prevented it from recovering or reviving itself as a viable business even on a limited scale.

Enron also withdrew a naming-rights deal with the Houston Astros Major League Baseball club for its new stadium, which was known formerly as Enron Field (now Daikin Park).

===Accounting practices===
Enron used a variety of deceptive and fraudulent tactics and accounting practices to cover its fraud in reporting Enron&#x27;s financial information. Special-purpose entities were created to mask significant liabilities from Enron&#x27;s financial statements. These entities made Enron seem more profitable than it was, and created a dangerous spiral in which, each quarter, corporate officers would have to perform more and more financial deception to create the illusion of billions of dollars in profit while the company was actually losing money. This practice increased their stock price to new levels, at which point the executives began to work on insider information and trade millions of dollars worth of Enron stock. The executives and insiders at Enron knew about the offshore accounts that were hiding losses for the company; the investors, however, did not. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow directed the team that created the off-books companies and manipulated the deals to provide himself, his family, and his friends with hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed revenue, at the expense of the corporation for which he worked and its stockholders.

In 1999, Enron initiated EnronOnline, an Internet-based trading operation, which was used by virtually every energy company in the United States. By promoting the company&#x27;s aggressive investment strategy, Enron&#x27;s president and chief operating officer Jeffrey Skilling helped make Enron the biggest wholesaler of gas and electricity, trading over $27 billion per quarter. The corporation&#x27;s financial claims, however, had to be accepted at face value. Under Skilling, Enron adopted mark-to-market accounting, in which anticipated future profits from any deal were tabulated as if currently real. Thus, Enron could record gains from what over time might turn out to be losses, as the company&#x27;s fiscal health became secondary to manipulating its stock price during the so-called Tech boom. But when a company&#x27;s success is measured by undocumented financial statements, actual balance sheets are inconvenient. Indeed, Enron&#x27;s unscrupulous actions were often gambles to keep the deception going and so increase the stock price. An advancing price meant a continued infusion of investor capital on which debt-ridden Enron in large part subsisted (much like a financial &quot;pyramid&quot; or &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot;). Attempting to maintain the illusion, Skilling verbally attacked Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman, who questioned Enron&#x27;s unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference telephone call. When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling replied, &quot;Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that ... asshole.&quot; Though the comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press, Wall Street analysts and public, it became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling&#x27;s offensiveness.

===Post-bankruptcy===
Enron initially planned to retain its three domestic pipeline companies as well as most of its overseas assets. However, before emerging from bankruptcy, Enron sold its domestic pipeline companies as CrossCountry Energy for $2.45 billion and later sold other assets to Vulcan Capital Management.

Enron sold its last business, Prisma Energy, during 2006, leaving Enron asset-less. During early 2007, its name was changed to Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation. Its goal was to repay the old Enron&#x27;s remaining creditors and end Enron&#x27;s affairs. In December 2008, it was announced that Enron&#x27;s creditors would receive $7.2 billion from the company&#x27;s liquidation (approximately 17 percent of the debts owed by the company). After Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase were sued for their role in abetting Enron&#x27;s practices with loans, the two companies agreed to give billions of dollars to Enron&#x27;s creditors. By May 2011, $21.8 billion had been distributed to the creditors, totaling 53 percent of Enron&#x27;s debts at the time of bankruptcy. Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation was ultimately dissolved on November 28, 2016.

Azurix, the former water utility part of the company, remains under Enron ownership, although it is currently asset-less. It is involved in several litigations against the government of Argentina claiming compensation relating to the negligence and corruption of the local governance during its management of the Buenos Aires water concession in 1999, which resulted in substantial amounts of debt (approx. $620 million) and the eventual collapse of the branch.

Soon after emerging from bankruptcy in November 2004, Enron&#x27;s new board of directors sued 11 financial institutions for helping Lay, Fastow, Skilling, and others hide Enron&#x27;s true financial condition. The proceedings were dubbed the &quot;megaclaims litigation&quot;. Among the defendants were Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. , Enron has settled with all of the institutions, ending with Citigroup. Enron was able to obtain nearly $7.2 billion to distribute to its creditors as a result of the megaclaims litigation. As of December 2009, some claim and process payments were still being distributed.

Enron has been featured since its bankruptcy in popular culture, including in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes &quot;That &#x27;90s Show&quot; (Homer buys Enron stock while Marge chooses to keep her own Microsoft shares) and &quot;Special Edna&quot;, which features a scene of an Enron-themed amusement park ride. The 2007 film &quot;Bee Movie&quot; also featured a joke reference to a parody company of Enron called &quot;Honron&quot; (a play on the words honey and Enron). The 2003 documentary &quot;The Corporation&quot; made frequent references to Enron post-bankruptcy, calling the company a &quot;bad apple&quot;.

==Insider trading scandal==

===Peak and decline of stock price===
In August 2000, Enron&#x27;s stock price attained its greatest value, closing at $90 on the 23rd. At this time, Enron executives, who possessed inside information on the hidden losses, began to sell their stock. At the same time, the general public and Enron&#x27;s investors were told to buy the stock. Executives told the investors that the stock would continue to increase until it attained possibly the $130 to $140 range, while secretly unloading their shares.

As executives sold their shares, the price began to decrease. Investors were told to continue buying stock or hold steady if they already owned Enron because the stock price would rebound shortly. Kenneth Lay&#x27;s strategy for responding to Enron&#x27;s continuing problems was his demeanor. As he did many times, Lay would issue a statement or make an appearance to calm investors and assure them that Enron was doing well. In March 2001 an article by Bethany McLean appeared in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine noting that no one understood how the company made money and questioning whether Enron stock was overvalued.

By August 15, 2001, Enron&#x27;s stock price had decreased to $42. Many of the investors still trusted Lay and believed that Enron would rule the market. They continued to buy or retain their stock as the equity value decreased. As October ended, the stock had decreased to $15. Many considered this a great opportunity to buy Enron stock because of what Lay had been telling them in the media.

Lay was accused of selling more than $70 million worth of stock at this time, which he used to repay cash advances on lines of credit. He sold another $29 million worth of stock in the open market. Also, Lay&#x27;s wife, Linda, was accused of selling 500,000 shares of Enron stock totaling $1.2 million on November 28, 2001. The money earned from this sale did not go to the family but rather to charitable organizations, which had already received pledges of contributions from the foundation. Records show that Mrs. Lay made the sale order sometime between 10:00 and 10:20 am. News of Enron&#x27;s problems, including the millions of dollars in losses they hid, became public about 10:30 that morning, and the stock price soon decreased to less than one dollar.

Former Enron executive Paula Rieker was charged with criminal insider trading and sentenced to two years probation. Rieker obtained 18,380 Enron shares for $15.51 a share. She sold that stock for $49.77 a share in July 2001, a week before the public was told what she already knew about the $102 million loss. In 2002, after the tumultuous fall of Enron&#x27;s external auditor, and management consultant, Andersen LLP, former Andersen Director, John M. Cunningham coined the phrase, &quot;We have all been Enroned.&quot;

The fallout resulted in both Lay and Skilling being convicted of conspiracy, fraud, and insider trading. Lay died before sentencing, Skilling got 24 years and 4 months and a $45 million penalty (later reduced). Fastow was sentenced to six years of jail time, and Lou Pai settled out of court for $31.5 million.

==California&#x27;s deregulation and subsequent energy crisis==

In October 2000, Daniel Scotto, the most renowned utility analyst on Wall Street, suspended his ratings on all energy companies conducting business in California because of the possibility that the companies would not receive full and adequate compensation for the deferred energy accounts used as the basis for the California Deregulation Plan enacted during the late 1990s. Five months later, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) was forced into bankruptcy. Republican Senator Phil Gramm, husband of Enron Board member Wendy Gramm and also the second-largest recipient of campaign contributions from Enron, succeeded in legislating California&#x27;s energy commodity trading deregulation. Despite warnings from prominent consumer groups which stated that this law would give energy traders too much influence over energy commodity prices, the legislation was passed in December 2000.

As the periodical Public Citizen reported:Because of Enron&#x27;s new, unregulated power auction, the company&#x27;s &quot;Wholesale Services&quot; revenues quadrupled – from $12 billion in the first quarter of 2000 to $48.4 billion in the first quarter of 2001.After the passage of the deregulation law, California had a total of 38 Stage 3 rolling blackouts declared, until federal regulators intervened in June 2001. These blackouts occurred as a result of a poorly designed market system that was manipulated by traders and marketers, as well as from poor state management and regulatory oversight. Subsequently, Enron traders were revealed as intentionally encouraging the removal of power from the market during California&#x27;s energy crisis by encouraging suppliers to shut down plants to perform unnecessary maintenance, as documented in recordings made at the time. These acts contributed to the need for rolling blackouts, which adversely affected many businesses dependent upon a reliable supply of electricity, and inconvenienced a large number of retail customers. This scattered supply increased the price, and Enron traders were thus able to sell power at premium prices, sometimes up to a factor of 20 times its normal peak value.

The callousness of the traders&#x27; attitude toward ratepayers was documented in an evidence tape of a conversation regarding the matter, and sarcastically referencing the confusion of retiree voters in Florida&#x27;s Miami-Dade County in the November 2000, presidential election.
&quot;They&#x27;re fucking taking all the money back from you guys? All the money you guys stole from those poor grandmothers in California?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, Grandma Millie man. But she&#x27;s the one who couldn&#x27;t figure out how to fucking vote on the butterfly ballot.&quot; (Laughing from both sides.)
&quot;Yeah, now she wants her fucking money back for all the power you&#x27;ve charged right up, jammed right up her ass for fucking $250 a megawatt-hour.&quot;

The traders had been discussing the efforts of the Snohomish PUD in Northwestern Washington state to recover the massive overcharges that Enron had engineered. Morgan Stanley, which had taken Enron&#x27;s place in the lawsuit, fought the release of the documents that the PUD had sought to make its case, but were being withheld by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

==Former management and corporate governance==


==Products==
Enron traded in more than 30 different products, including oil and LNG transportation, broadband, principal investments, risk management for commodities, shipping / freight, streaming media, and water and wastewater. Products traded on EnronOnline in particular included petrochemicals, plastics, power, pulp and paper, steel, and weather risk management.

Enron manufactured gas valves, circuit breakers, thermostats, and electrical equipment in Venezuela using INSELA SA, a 50–50 joint venture with General Electric. Enron owned three paper and pulp products companies: Garden State Paper, a newsprint mill; as well as Papiers Stadacona and St. Aurelie Timberlands. Enron had a controlling stake in the Louisiana-based petroleum exploration and production company Mariner Energy.

=== EnronOnline ===
Enron opened EnronOnline, an electronic trading platform for energy commodities, on November 29, 1999. Conceptualized by the company&#x27;s European Gas Trading team, it was the first web-based transaction system that allowed buyers and sellers to buy, sell, and trade commodity products globally. It allowed users to do business only with Enron. The site allowed Enron to transact with participants in the global energy markets. The main commodities offered on EnronOnline were natural gas and electricity, although there were 500 other products including credit derivatives, bankruptcy swaps, pulp, gas, plastics, paper, steel, metals, freight, and TV commercial time. At its maximum, more than $6 billion worth of commodities were transacted using EnronOnline every day, but specialists questioned how Enron reported trades and calculated its profits, saying that the same fraudulent accounting that was rampant at Enron&#x27;s other operations may have been used in trading.

After Enron&#x27;s bankruptcy in late 2001, EnronOnline was sold to the Swiss financial giant UBS. Within a year, UBS abandoned its efforts to relaunch the division and closed it in November 2002.

=== Enron International ===
Enron International (EI) was Enron&#x27;s wholesale asset development and asset management business. Its primary emphasis was developing and building natural gas power plants outside North America. Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EECC) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron International and built almost all of Enron International&#x27;s power plants. Unlike other business units of Enron, Enron International had a strong cash flow at the bankruptcy filing. Enron International consisted of all of Enron&#x27;s foreign power projects, including ones in Europe.

The company&#x27;s Teesside plant was one of the largest gas-fired power stations in the world, built and operated by Enron from 1989, and produced 3 percent of the United Kingdom&#x27;s energy needs. Enron owned half of the plant&#x27;s equity, with the remaining 50 percent split between four regional electricity companies.

==== Management ====
Rebecca Mark was the CEO of Enron International until she resigned to manage Enron&#x27;s newly acquired water business, Azurix, in 1997. Mark had a major role in the development of the Dabhol project in India, Enron&#x27;s largest international endeavor.

==== Projects ====
Enron International constructed power plants and pipelines across the globe. Some are presently still operating, including the massive Teesside plant in England. Others, like a barge-mounted plant off Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, cost Enron money through lawsuits and investment losses. Puerto Plata was a barge-mounted power plant next to the hotel &quot;Hotelero del Atlantico&quot;. When the plant was activated, winds blew soot from the plant onto the hotel guests&#x27; meals, blackening their food. The winds also blew garbage from nearby slums into the plant&#x27;s water-intake system. For some time the only solution was to hire men who would row out and push the garbage away with their paddles. Through mid-2000 the company collected a paltry $3.5 million from a $95 million investment. Enron also had other investment projects in Europe, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Mexico, Jamaica, Venezuela, elsewhere in South America and across the Caribbean.

==== India ====
Around 1992 Indian experts came to the United States to find energy investors to help with India&#x27;s energy shortage problems. During December 1993, Enron finalized a 20-year power-purchase contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The contract allowed Enron to construct a massive 2,015 megawatt power plant on a remote volcanic bluff south of Mumbai through a two-phase project called Dabhol Power Station. Construction would be completed in two phases, and Enron would form the Dabhol Power Company to help manage the plant. The power project was the first step in a $20 billion scheme to help rebuild and stabilize India&#x27;s power grid. Enron, GE (which was selling turbines to the project), and Bechtel (which was constructing the plant), each contributed 10% equity with the remaining 90% covered by the MSEB 

In 1996, when India&#x27;s Congress Party was no longer in power, the Indian government assessed the project as being excessively expensive, refused to pay for the plant, and stopped construction. The MSEB was required by contract to continue to pay Enron plant maintenance charges, even if no power was purchased from the plant. The MSEB determined that it could not afford to purchase the power (at Rs. 8 per unit kWh) charged by Enron. The plant operator was unable to find alternate customers for Dabhol power due to the absence of a free market in the regulated structure of utilities in India.

By 2000, the Dabhol plant was almost complete and Phase 1 had begun producing power. Enron as a whole, however, was heavily overextended, and in the summer of that year Mark and all the key executives at Enron International were asked to resign from Enron to reshape the company and get rid of asset businesses. Shortly thereafter a payment dispute with MSEB ensued, and Enron issued a stop-work order on the plant in June 2001. From 1996 until Enron&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2001 the company tried to revive the project and revive interest in India&#x27;s need for the power plant without success. By December 2001 the Enron scandal and bankruptcy cut short any opportunity to revive the construction and complete the plant. In 2005, an Indian government-run company, Ratnagiri Gas and Power, was set up to finish construction on the Dabhol facility and operate the plant.

==== Project summer ====
During the summer of 2001, Enron attempted to sell several of Enron International&#x27;s assets, many of which were not sold. The public and media believed it was unknown why Enron wanted to sell these assets, suspecting it was because Enron needed cash. Employees who worked with company assets were told in 2000 that Jeff Skilling believed that business assets were an outdated means of a company&#x27;s worth, and instead he wanted to build a company based on &quot;intellectual assets&quot;.

=== Enron Global Exploration &amp; Production, Inc. ===
Enron Global Exploration &amp; Production Inc. (EGEP) was an Enron subsidiary that was born from the split of domestic assets via EOG Resources (formerly Enron Oil and Gas EOG) and international assets via EGEP (formerly Enron Oil and Gas Int&#x27;l, Ltd EOGIL). 
Among the EGEP assets were the Panna-Mukta and the South Tapti fields, discovered by the Indian state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which operated the fields initially.
December 1994, a joint venture began between ONGC (40%), Enron (30%) and Reliance (30%).
Mid-year of 2002, British Gas (BG) completed the acquisition of EGEP&#x27;s 30% share of the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields for $350 million, a few months before Enron filed bankruptcy.

==Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service==
During the mid-1990s, Enron established an endowment for the Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service, awarded by Rice University&#x27;s Baker Institute to &quot;recognize outstanding individuals for their contributions to public service&quot;. Recipients were:
* 1995: Colin Powell.
* 1997: Mikhail Gorbachev.
* 1999 (early): Eduard Shevardnadze.
* 1999 (late): Nelson Mandela.
* 2001: Alan Greenspan.

Greenspan, because of his position as the Fed chairman, was not at liberty to accept the $10,000 honorarium, the $15,000 sculpture, nor the crystal trophy, but only accepted the &quot;honor&quot; of being named an Enron Prize recipient. The situation was further complicated because a few days earlier, Enron had filed paperwork admitting it had falsified financial statements for five years. Greenspan did not mention Enron a single time during his speech. At the ceremony, Ken Lay stated, &quot;I&#x27;m looking forward to our first woman recipient.&quot; The next morning, it was reported in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; that no decision had been made on whether the name of the prize would be changed. 19 days after the prize was awarded to Greenspan, Enron declared bankruptcy.

In early 2002, Enron was awarded MIT&#x27;s (in)famous Ig Nobel Prize for &quot;Most Creative Use of Imaginary Numbers&quot;. The various former members of the Enron management team all refused to accept the award in person, although no reason was given at the time.

== Enron&#x27;s influence on politics ==
* George W. Bush, sitting U.S. president at the time of Enron&#x27;s collapse, received $312,500 to his campaigns and $413,800 to his presidential war chest and inaugural fund.
* Dick Cheney, sitting U.S. vice president at the time of Enron&#x27;s collapse, met with Enron executives six times to develop a new energy policy. He refused to show minutes to Congress.
* John Ashcroft, the attorney general at the time, recused himself from the DOJ&#x27;s investigation into Enron due to receiving $57,499 when running for a senate seat in 2000.
* Lawrence Lindsay, White House Economic Advisor at the time, made $50,000 as a consultant with Enron before moving to the White House in 2000.
* Karl Rove, White House senior advisor at the time, waited five months before selling $100,000 of Enron stock.
* Marc F. Racicot, Republican National Committee chairman nominee at the time, was handpicked by George W. Bush to serve as a lawyer with Bracewell LLP, a firm that lobbied for Enron.

== &quot;Women of Enron&quot; ==
In 2002, the &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine featured a nude pictorial &quot;Women of Enron&quot;, with ten former and contemporary Enron female employees. The women said they posed for the fun and to earn some money.

== 2024 satirical reboot and meme coin ==

On December 2, 2024, a new tweet was posted on the @Enron X account. The tweet had the caption &quot;We&#x27;re back. Can we talk?&quot;, along with a promotional video. Viewers also noticed that the website enron.com was also functional. The replies alleged a potential cryptocurrency scam, but others pointed to the new terms of service including a clause explicitly stating that the content on the website was parody protected under the First Amendment. Many pointed out that this was likely a joke, as the domain seemed to be registered by Peter McIndoe, a performance artist and founder of Birds Aren&#x27;t Real. Additionally, the rights to the Enron name had been purchased at auction by The College Company for $275 in 2020. On December 9, it was announced that the CEO of Enron was Connor Gaydos, another cofounder of The College Company and Birds Aren&#x27;t Real. It was also announced that Enron planned to hold a new &quot;Enron Power Summit&quot; on January 6, 2025. On December 12, the Twitter page @Pubity posted video of Gaydos being pied in the face. Many viewers quickly assumed the incident was staged, and it may have been a parody of an incident when Jeff Skilling was pied in the face by a California woman.

On January 6, 2025, Enron announced the Enron Egg, its first new product in 20 years. Gaydos claimed that the product was a micro nuclear reactor capable of powering a suburban home for 10 years using 20% enriched uranium in the form of uranium zirconium hydride. The announcement supposedly took place at the previously-announced &quot;Enron Power Summit,&quot; but the Houston Chronicle was unable to confirm that such an event actually took place.

<text>Eusebius of Alexandria () was a 6th-century Christian author to whom certain extant homilies are attributed.

==Biography==
Nothing is known of the author. In all events, he was not a patriarch of Alexandria, as is affirmed in an early biography, written by one Johannes, a notary, and stating that Eusebius was called by Cyril to be his successor in the episcopate.

There has been much dispute regarding the details of his life and the age in which he lived. Galland (Vet. Patr. Biblioth., VIII, 23) says: &quot;de Eusebio qui vulgo dicitur episcopus Alexandræ incerta omnia&quot; (Concerning Eusebius, commonly called bishop of Alexandria there is nothing sure). His writings have been attributed to Eusebius of Emesa, Eusebius of Cæsarea, and others. According to an old biography said to have been written by his notary, the monk John, and discovered by Cardinal Mai, he lived in the fifth century and led a monastic life near Alexandria. The fame of his virtues attracted the attention of Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria, who visited him with his clergy, and in 444, when dying, had him elected his successor, and consecrated him bishop, though much against his will. Eusebius displayed great zeal in the exercise of his office and did much good by his preaching. Among those he converted was a certain Alexander, a man of senatorial rank. After having ruled his see for seven or, according to another account, for twenty years, he made Alexander his successor and retired to the desert, whence Cyril had summoned him and there died in the odor of sanctity.

While Mai seems to have established the existence of a Eusebius of Alexandria who lived in the fifth century, it had been objected than neither the name of Eusebius or his successor Alexander, appears in the list of the occupants of that ancient see. Dioscurus is mentioned as the immediate successor of Cyril. Nor does the style of the homilies seem on the whole in keeping with the age of Cyril. It may be noted, however, that the biographer of Eusebius expressly states that the Cyril in question is the great opponent of Nestorius. Various solution of the difficulty have been proposed. Thilo thinks that the authorship of the homilies is to be assigned either to a certain monk – one of four brothers 3 of the fifth century, or to a presbyter and court chaplain of Justinian I, who took an active part in the theological strifes of the sixth century. Mai suggests that after the death of Cyril, there were two bishops at Alexandria, Dioscurus, the Monophysite leader, and Eusebius, the head of the Catholic party. The homilies cover a variety of subjects, and the author is one of the earliest patristic witnesses to the doctrine regarding the descent of Christ into Hell. A list of homilies with the complete text is given by Mai. They may also be found in Migne, which was published with an introduction by Rand in &quot;Modern Philology&quot;, II, 261.

==Works==
These homilies enjoyed some renown in the Eastern Church in the sixth and seventh centuries.

The discourses belong probably to the fifth or sixth century, and possibly originated in Alexandria. They deal with the life of Jesus of Nazareth and with questions of ecclesiastical life and practise, which they resolve in a monastic-ascetic way. Their literary character is not quite clear; while most of them are adapted for public delivery, not a few bear the character of ecclesiastical pronouncements. They are now in print except four included among John Chrysostom&#x27;s works. The fragments preserved in the so-called &quot;Sacra parallela&quot; are to be found in Karl Holl&#x27;s &quot;Fragmente vornicänischer Kirchenväter.&quot; A homily concerning the observance of Sunday is attributed by Zahn to Eusebius of Emesa.

<text>Eusebius (Bruno) of Angers (died September 1, 1081) was bishop of Angers, France.

He first appears in the historical record as bishop of Angers at the synod of Rheims in 1049, and for a long time had been an adherent of Berengar&#x27;s doctrine of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. As such he was highly regarded by Berengar himself and by his opponents Theodwin of Liège, Durand of Troarne, and Humbert of Mourmoutiers. But when he recognized the strength of the opposition, he favored a compromise; at any rate he advised Berengar is 1054 to swear to the formula presented to him.

Nevertheless, Berengar considered him his friend many years later and requested him to silence a certain Galfrid Martini or to arrange a disputation. In his reply Eusebius not only regretted the whole controversy, but also stated that he would abide by the words of the Bible, according to which the bread and wine after the consecration become the body and blood of the Lord (see transubstantiation); if one asks how this can take place, the answer must be that it is not according to the order of nature but in accordance with the divine omnipotence; at any rate one must be careful not to give offense to the plain Christian. The epistle is a downright renunciation of Berengar in case he should still maintain his view.

In favor of the supposition that Eusebius changed his opinion from deference to the Count of Anjou, the decided opponent of Berengar and his doctrine, it can be adduced that he did not defend Berengar against the hostilities of the court, and that for a long time he sided with this violent prince. It is also possible that the fact impressed itself upon Eusebius that the religious consciousness of the time more and more opposed Berengar. Our knowledge, however, is too fragmentary to pass a very accurate sentence.

<text>Eusebius of Caesarea (30 May AD 339), also known as Eusebius Pamphilius, was a Greek Syro-Palestinian historian of Christianity, exegete, and Christian polemicist. In about AD 314 he became the bishop of Caesarea Maritima in the Roman province of Syria Palaestina.

Together with Pamphilus, Eusebius was a scholar of the biblical canon and is regarded as one of the most learned Christians during late antiquity. He wrote the &quot;Demonstrations of the Gospel&quot;, &quot;Preparations for the Gospel&quot; and &quot;On Discrepancies between the Gospels&quot;, studies of the biblical text. His work &quot;Onomasticon&quot; is an early geographical lexicon of places in the Holy Land mentioned in the Bible. As &quot;Father of Church History&quot; (not to be confused with the title of Church Father), he produced the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, &quot;On the Life of Pamphilus&quot;, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and &quot;On the Martyrs&quot;. He also produced a biographical work on Constantine the Great, the first Christian Roman emperor, who was &quot;Augustus&quot; between AD 306 and AD 337.

==Sources==
Little is known about the life of Eusebius. His successor at the See of Caesarea, Acacius, wrote a &quot;Life of Eusebius&quot;, a work that has since been lost. Eusebius&#x27;s own surviving works probably only represent a small portion of his total output. Beyond notices in his extant writings, the major sources are the 5th-century ecclesiastical historians Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, and the 4th-century Christian author Jerome. There are assorted notices of his activities in the writings of his contemporaries Athanasius, Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia, and Alexander of Alexandria. Eusebius&#x27;s pupil, Eusebius of Emesa, provides some incidental information.

==Early life==
Most scholars date the birth of Eusebius to some point between AD 260 and 265. He was most likely born in or around Caesarea Maritima. Nothing is known about his parents. He was baptized and instructed in the city, and lived in Syria Palaestina in 296, when Diocletian&#x27;s army passed through the region (in the &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;, Eusebius recalls seeing Constantine traveling with the army).

Eusebius was made presbyter by Agapius of Caesarea. Some, like theologian and ecclesiastical historian John Henry Newman, understand Eusebius&#x27;s statement that he had heard Dorotheus of Tyre &quot;expound the Scriptures wisely in the Church&quot; to indicate that Eusebius was Dorotheus&#x27;s pupil while the priest was resident in Antioch; others, like the scholar D. S. Wallace-Hadrill, deem the phrase too ambiguous to support the contention.

Through the activities of the theologian Origen (185/6–254) and the school of his follower Pamphilus (later 3rd century – 309), Caesarea became a center of Christian learning. Origen was largely responsible for the collection of usage information, or which churches were using which gospels, regarding the texts which became the New Testament. The information used to create the late-fourth-century Easter Letter, which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; [HE] of Eusebius of Caesarea, wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origen&#x27;s list at HE 6:25. Eusebius got his information about what texts were accepted by the third-century churches throughout the known world, a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen.

On his deathbed, Origen had made a bequest of his private library to the Christian community in the city. Together with the books of his patron Ambrosius, Origen&#x27;s library (including the original manuscripts of his works) formed the core of the collection that Pamphilus established. Pamphilus also managed a school that was similar to (or perhaps a re-establishment of) that of Origen. He was compared to Demetrius of Phalerum—as well as to another (evidently, learnèd) scholar by the name of &quot;Pisistratus&quot;—for Pamphilus had gathered Bibles &quot;from all parts of the world&quot;. Like his model Origen, Pamphilus maintained close contact with his students. Eusebius, in his history of the persecutions, alludes to the fact that many of the Caesarean martyrs lived together, presumably under Pamphilus.

Soon after Pamphilus settled in Caesarea ( 280s), he began teaching Eusebius, who was then somewhere between twenty and twenty-five. Because of his close relationship with his schoolmaster, Eusebius was sometimes called &quot;Eusebius Pamphili&quot;: &quot;Eusebius, son of Pamphilus&quot;. The name may also indicate that Eusebius was made Pamphilus&#x27; heir. Pamphilus gave Eusebius a strong admiration for the thought of Origen. Neither Pamphilus nor Eusebius knew Origen personally; Pamphilus probably picked up Origenist ideas during his studies under Pierius (nicknamed &quot;Origen Junior&quot;) in Alexandria.

Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Preparation for the Gospel&quot; bears witness to the literary tastes of Origen: Eusebius quotes no comedy, tragedy, or lyric poetry, but makes reference to all the works of Plato and to an extensive range of later philosophic works, largely from Middle Platonists from Philo to the late 2nd century. Whatever its secular contents, the primary aim of Origen and Pamphilus&#x27;s school was to promote sacred learning. The library&#x27;s biblical and theological contents were more impressive: Origen&#x27;s &quot;Hexapla&quot; and &quot;Tetrapla&quot;; a copy of the original Aramaic version of the Gospel of Matthew; and many of Origen&#x27;s own writings. Marginal comments in extant manuscripts note that Pamphilus and his friends and pupils, including Eusebius, corrected and revised much of the biblical text in their library. Their efforts made the hexaplaric Septuagint text increasingly popular in Syria and Palestine. Soon after joining Pamphilus&#x27;s school, Eusebius started helping his master expand the library&#x27;s collections and broaden access to its resources. At about this time Eusebius compiled a &quot;Collection of Ancient Martyrdoms&quot;, presumably for use as a general reference tool.
In the 290s, Eusebius began work on his most important work, the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, a narrative history of the Church and Christian community from the Apostolic Age to Eusebius&#x27;s own time. At about the same time, he worked on his &quot;Chronicle&quot;, a universal calendar of events from the Creation to, again, Eusebius&#x27;s own time. He completed the first editions of the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; and &quot;Chronicle&quot; before 300.

==Bishop of Caesarea==

Eusebius succeeded Agapius as Bishop of Caesarea soon after 313 and was called on by Arius who had been excommunicated by his bishop Alexander of Alexandria. An episcopal council in Caesarea pronounced Arius blameless. Eusebius enjoyed the favor of the Emperor Constantine. Because of this he was called upon to present the creed of his own church to the 318 attendees of the Council of Nicaea in 325. However, the anti-Arian creed from Palestine prevailed, becoming the basis for the Nicene Creed.

The theological views of Arius, that taught the subordination of the Son to the Father, continued to be controversial. Eustathius of Antioch strongly opposed the growing influence of Origen&#x27;s theology as the root of Arianism. Eusebius, an admirer of Origen, was reproached by Eustathius for deviating from the Nicene faith. Eusebius prevailed and Eustathius was deposed at a synod in Antioch.

However, Athanasius of Alexandria became a more powerful opponent and in 334 he was summoned before a synod in Caesarea (which he refused to attend). In the following year, he was again summoned before a synod in Tyre at which Eusebius of Caesarea presided. Athanasius, foreseeing the result, went to Constantinople to bring his cause before the Emperor. Constantine called the bishops to his court, among them Eusebius. Athanasius was condemned and exiled at the end of 335. Eusebius remained in the Emperor&#x27;s favour throughout this time and more than once was exonerated with the explicit approval of the Emperor Constantine. After the Emperor&#x27;s death (), Eusebius wrote the &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;, an important historical work because of eyewitness accounts and the use of primary sources.

==Works==

Of the extensive literary activity of Eusebius, a relatively large portion has been preserved. Although posterity suspected him of Arianism, Eusebius had made himself indispensable by his method of authorship; his comprehensive and careful excerpts from original sources saved his successors the painstaking labor of original research. Hence, much has been preserved, quoted by Eusebius, which otherwise would have been lost.

The literary productions of Eusebius reflect on the whole the course of his life. At first, he occupied himself with works on biblical criticism under the influence of Pamphilus and probably of Dorotheus of Tyre of the School of Antioch. Afterward, the persecutions under Diocletian and Galerius directed his attention to the martyrs of his own time and the past, and this led him to the history of the whole Church and finally to the history of the world, which, to him, was only a preparation for ecclesiastical history.

Then followed the time of the Arian controversies, and dogmatic questions came into the foreground. Christianity at last found recognition by the State; and this brought new problems – apologies of a different sort had to be prepared. Lastly, Eusebius wrote eulogies in praise of Constantine. To all this activity must be added numerous writings of a miscellaneous nature, addresses, letters, and the like, and exegetical works that extended over the whole of his life and that include both commentaries and an important treatise on the location of biblical place names and the distances between these cities.

===&quot;Onomasticon&quot;===
===Biblical text criticism===

Pamphilus and Eusebius occupied themselves with the textual criticism of the Septuagint text of the Old Testament and especially of the New Testament. An edition of the Septuagint seems to have been already prepared by Origen, which, according to Jerome, was revised and circulated by Eusebius and Pamphilus. For an easier survey of the material of the four Evangelists, Eusebius divided his edition of the New Testament into paragraphs and provided it with a synoptical table so that it might be easier to find the pericopes that belong together. These canon tables or &quot;Eusebian canons&quot; remained in use throughout the Middle Ages, and illuminated manuscript versions are important for the study of early medieval art, as they are the most elaborately decorated pages of many Gospel books. Eusebius detailed in &quot;Epistula ad Carpianum&quot; how to use his canons.

===&quot;Chronicle&quot;===

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; ( (&quot;Pantodape historia&quot;)) is divided into two parts. The first part, the &quot;Chronography&quot; ( (&quot;Chronographia&quot;)), gives an epitome of universal history from the sources, arranged according to nations. The second part, the &quot;Canons&quot; ( (&quot;Chronikoi kanones&quot;)), furnishes a synchronism of the historical material in parallel columns, the equivalent of a parallel timeline.

The work as a whole has been lost in the original Greek, but it may be reconstructed from later chronographists of the Byzantine school who made excerpts from the work, especially George Syncellus. The tables of the second part have been completely preserved in a Latin translation by Jerome, and both parts are still extant in an Armenian translation. The loss of the Greek originals has given the Armenian translation a special importance; thus, the first part of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot;, of which only a few fragments exist in Greek, has been preserved entirely in Armenian, though with lacunae. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; as preserved extends to the year 325.

===&quot;Church History&quot;===

In his &quot;Church History&quot; or &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, Eusebius wrote the second surviving history of the Christian Church as a chronologically ordered account, based on earlier sources, complete from the period of the Apostles to his own epoch. The time scheme correlated the history with the reigns of the Roman Emperors, and the scope was broad. Included were the bishops and other teachers of the Church, Christian relations with the Jews and those deemed heretical, and the Christian martyrs through 324. Although its accuracy and biases have been questioned, it remains an important source on the early church due to Eusebius&#x27;s access to materials now lost.

===&quot;Life of Constantine&quot;===
Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Life of Constantine&quot; (&quot;Vita Constantini&quot;) is a eulogy or panegyric, and therefore its style and selection of facts are affected by its purpose, rendering it inadequate as a continuation of the &quot;Church History.&quot; As the historian Socrates Scholasticus said, at the opening of his history which was designed as a continuation of Eusebius, &quot;Also in writing the life of Constantine, this same author has but slightly treated of matters regarding Arius, being more intent on the rhetorical finish of his composition and the praises of the emperor than on an accurate statement of facts.&quot; The work was unfinished at Eusebius&#x27;s death. Some scholars have questioned the Eusebian authorship of this work. 

==== Conversion of Constantine according to Eusebius ====

Writing after Constantine had died, Eusebius claimed that the emperor himself had recounted to him that some time between the death of his father – the &quot;augustus&quot; Constantius – and his final battle against his rival Maxentius as &quot;augustus&quot; in the West, Constantine experienced a vision in which he and his soldiers beheld a Christian symbol, &quot;a cross-shaped trophy formed from light&quot;, above the sun at midday. Attached to the symbol was the phrase &quot;by this conquer&quot; (), a phrase often rendered into Latin as &quot;in hoc signo vinces&quot;. In a dream that night &quot;the Christ of God appeared to him with the sign which had appeared in the sky, and urged him to make himself a copy of the sign which had appeared in the sky, and to use this as a protection against the attacks of the enemy.&quot; Eusebius relates that this happened &quot;on a campaign he [Constantine] was conducting somewhere&quot;. It is unclear from Eusebius&#x27;s description whether the shields were marked with a Christian cross or with a &quot;chi-rho&quot;, a staurogram, or another similar symbol.

The Latin text &quot;De mortibus persecutorum&quot; contains an early account of the 28 October 312 Battle of the Milvian Bridge written by Lactantius probably in 313, the year following the battle. Lactantius does not mention a vision in the sky but describes a revelatory dream on the eve of battle. Eusebius&#x27;s work of that time, his &quot;Church History&quot;, also makes no mention of the vision. The Arch of Constantine, constructed in AD 315, neither depicts a vision nor any Christian insignia in its depiction of the battle. In his posthumous biography of Constantine, Eusebius agrees with Lactantius that Constantine received instructions in a dream to apply a Christian symbol as a device to his soldiers&#x27; shields, but unlike Lactantius and subsequent Christian tradition, Eusebius does not date the events to October 312 and does not connect Constantine&#x27;s vision and dream-vision with the Battle of the Milvian Bridge.

===Minor historical works===
Before he compiled his church history, Eusebius edited a collection of martyrdoms of the earlier period and a biography of Pamphilus. The martyrology has not survived as a whole, but it has been preserved almost completely in parts. It contained:
* an epistle of the congregation of Smyrna concerning the martyrdom of Polycarp;
* the martyrdom of Pionius;
* the martyrdoms of Carpus, Papylus, and Agathonike;
* the martyrdoms in the congregations of Vienne and Lyon;
* the martyrdom of Apollonius.

Of the life of Pamphilus, only a fragment survives. A work on the martyrs of Palestine in the time of Diocletian was composed after 311; numerous fragments are scattered in legendaries which have yet to be collected. The life of Constantine was compiled after the death of the emperor and the election of his sons as Augusti (337). It is more a rhetorical eulogy on the emperor than a history but is of great value on account of numerous documents incorporated into it.

===Apologetic and dogmatic works===
To the class of apologetic and dogmatic works belong:
* The &quot;Apology for Origen&quot;, the first five books of which, according to the definite statement of Photius, were written by Pamphilus in prison, with the assistance of Eusebius. Eusebius added the sixth book after the death of Pamphilus. We possess only a Latin translation of the first book, made by Rufinus.
* A treatise against Hierocles (a Roman governor), in which Eusebius combated the former&#x27;s glorification of Apollonius of Tyana in a work entitled &quot;A Truth-loving Discourse&quot; (Greek: &quot;Philalethes logos&quot;); in spite of manuscript attribution to Eusebius, however, it has been argued (by Thomas Hagg and more recently, Aaron Johnson) that this treatise &quot;Against Hierocles&quot; was written by someone other than Eusebius of Caesarea.
* &quot;Praeparatio evangelica&quot; (&quot;Preparation for the Gospel&quot;), commonly known by its Latin title, which attempts to prove the excellence of Christianity over every pagan religion and philosophy. The &quot;Praeparatio&quot; consists of fifteen books which have been completely preserved. Eusebius considered it an introduction to Christianity for pagans. But its value for many later readers is more because Eusebius studded this work with so many lively fragments from historians and philosophers which are nowhere else preserved. Here alone is preserved Pyrrho&#x27;s translation of the Buddhist Three marks of existence upon which Pyrrho based Pyrrhonism. Here alone is a summary of the writings of the Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon of which the accuracy has been shown by the mythological accounts found on the Ugaritic tables. Here alone is the account from Diodorus Siculus&#x27;s sixth book of Euhemerus&#x27; wondrous voyage to the island of Panchaea where Euhemerus purports to have found his true history of the gods. And here almost alone is preserved writings of the neo-Platonist philosopher Atticus along with so much else.
* &quot;Demonstratio evangelica&quot; (&quot;Proof of the Gospel&quot;) is closely connected to the &quot;Praeparatio&quot; and comprised originally twenty books of which ten have been completely preserved as well as a fragment of the fifteenth. Here Eusebius treats of the person of Jesus Christ. The work was probably finished before 311;
* Another work which originated in the time of the persecution, entitled &quot;Prophetic Extracts&quot; (&quot;Eclogae propheticae&quot;). It discusses in four books the Messianic texts of Scripture. The work is merely the surviving portion (books 6–9) of the &quot;General elementary introduction&quot; to the Christian faith, now lost. The fragments given as the Commentary on Luke in the PG have been claimed to derive from the missing tenth book of the General Elementary Introduction (see D. S. Wallace-Hadrill); however, Aaron Johnson has argued that they cannot be associated with this work.

* The treatise &quot;On Divine Manifestation&quot; or &quot;On the Theophania&quot; (&quot;Peri theophaneias&quot;), of unknown date. It treats of the incarnation of the Divine Logos, and its contents are in many cases identical with the &quot;Demonstratio evangelica.&quot; Only fragments are preserved in Greek, but a complete Syriac translation of the &quot;Theophania&quot; survives in an early 5th-century manuscript. Samuel Lee, the editor (1842) and translator (1843) of the Syriac &quot;Theophania,&quot; thought that the work must have been written &quot;after the general peace restored to the Church by Constantine, and before either the &#x27;Praeparatio,&#x27; or the &#x27;Demonstratio Evangelica,&#x27; was written ... It appears probable ... therefore, that this was one of the first productions of Eusebius, if not the first after the persecutions ceased.&quot; Hugo Gressmann, noting in 1904 that the &quot;Demonstratio&quot; seems to be mentioned at IV. 37 and V. 1, and that II. 14 seems to mention the extant practice of temple prostitution at Hieropolis in Phoenica, concluded that the &quot;Theophania&quot; was probably written shortly after 324. Others have suggested a date as late as 337.
* A polemical treatise against Marcellus of Ancyra, the &quot;Against Marcellus&quot;, dating from about 337;
* A supplement to the last-named work, also against Marcellus, entitled &quot;Ecclesiastical Theology&quot;, in which he defended the Nicene doctrine of the Logos against the party of Athanasius.

A number of writings, belonging in this category, have been entirely lost.

===Exegetical and miscellaneous works===
All of the exegetical works of Eusebius have suffered damage in transmission. The majority of them are known to us only from long portions quoted in Byzantine catena-commentaries. However these portions are very extensive. Extant are:
* An enormous Commentary on the Psalms;
* A commentary on Isaiah, discovered more or less complete in a manuscript in Florence early in the 20th century and published 50 years later;
* Small fragments of commentaries on Romans and 1 Corinthians.

Eusebius also wrote a work &#x27;, &quot;On the Differences of the Gospels&quot; (including solutions). This was written for the purpose of harmonizing the contradictions in the reports of the different Evangelists. This work was recently (2011) translated into the English language by David J. Miller and Adam C. McCollum and was published under the name &quot;Eusebius of Caesarea: Gospel Problems and Solutions&quot;. The original work was also translated into Syriac, and lengthy quotations exist in a &quot;catena&quot; in that language, and also in Arabic catenas.

Eusebius also wrote treatises on the biblical past; these three treatises have been lost. They were:

* A work on the Greek equivalents of Hebrew Gentilic nouns;
* A description of old Judea with an account of the loss of the ten tribes;
* A plan of Jerusalem and the Temple of Solomon.

The addresses and sermons of Eusebius are mostly lost, but some have been preserved, e.g., a sermon on the consecration of the church in Tyre and an address on the thirtieth anniversary of the reign of Constantine (336).

Most of Eusebius&#x27;s letters are lost. His letters to Carpianus and Flacillus exist complete. Fragments of a letter to the empress Constantia also exists.

==Doctrine==

Eusebius is fairly unusual in his preterist, or fulfilled, eschatological view. Saying &quot;the Holy Scriptures foretell that there will be unmistakable signs of the Coming of Christ. Now there were among the Hebrews three outstanding offices of dignity, which made the nation famous, firstly the kingship, secondly that of prophet, and lastly the high priesthood. The prophecies said that the abolition and complete destruction of all these three together would be the sign of the presence of the Christ. And that the proofs that the times had come, would lie in the ceasing of the Mosaic worship, the desolation of Jerusalem and its Temple, and the subjection of the whole Jewish race to its enemies. ...The holy oracles foretold that all these changes, which had not been made in the days of the prophets of old, would take place at the coming of the Christ, which I will presently shew to have been fulfilled as never before in accordance with the predictions&quot; (&quot;Demonstratio Evangelica&quot; VIII).

From a dogmatic point of view, Eusebius is related in his views to Origen. Like Origen, he started from the fundamental thought of the absolute sovereignty (&quot;monarchia&quot;) of God. God is the cause of all beings. But he is not merely a cause; in him everything good is included, from him all life originates, and he is the source of all virtue. God sent Christ into the world that it may partake of the blessings included in the essence of God. Eusebius expressly distinguishes the Son as distinct from Father as a ray is also distinct from its source the sun.

Eusebius held that men were sinners by their own free choice and not by the necessity of their natures. Eusebius said:
The Creator of all things has impressed a natural law upon the soul of every man, as an assistant and ally in his conduct, pointing out to him the right way by this law; but, by the free liberty with which he is endowed, making the choice of what is best worthy of praise and acceptance, he has acted rightly, not by force, but from his own free-will, when he had it in his power to act otherwise, As, again, making him who chooses what is worst, deserving of blame and punishment, because he has by his own motion neglected the natural law, and becoming the origin and fountain of wickedness, and misusing himself, not from any extraneous necessity, but from free will and judgment. The fault is in him who chooses, not in God. For God has not made nature or the substance of the soul bad; for he who is good can make nothing but what is good. Everything is good which is according to nature. Every rational soul has naturally a good free-will, formed for the choice of what is good. But when a man acts wrongly, nature is not to be blamed; for what is wrong, takes place not according to nature, but contrary to nature, it being the work of choice, and not of nature.
A letter Eusebius is supposed to have written to Constantine&#x27;s daughter Constantina, refusing to fulfill her request for images of Christ, was quoted in the decrees (now lost) of the Iconoclast Council of Hieria in 754, and later quoted in part in the rebuttal of the Hieria decrees in the Second Council of Nicaea of 787, now the only source from which some of the text is known. The authenticity or authorship of the letter remains uncertain.

=== Nicene Creed ===
In the June 2002 issue of the &quot;Church History&quot; journal, Pier Franco Beatrice reports that Eusebius testified that the word &quot;homoousios&quot; (consubstantial) &quot;was inserted in the Nicene Creed solely by the personal order of Constantine.&quot;
However, the council evidently did not force the insertion of the word and instead adopted a text related to the confession of Jerusalem. The role of Constantine remained uncertain during the council.

==Assessment==
* Socrates Scholasticus (a 5th-century Christian historian), writing in his own &quot;Church History&quot;, criticized the &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;, stating that Eusebius was &quot;more intent on the rhetorical finish of his composition and the praises of the emperor, than on an accurate statement of facts&quot;.
*Edward Gibbon openly distrusted the writings of Eusebius concerning the number of martyrs, by noting a passage in the shorter text of the &quot;Martyrs of Palestine&quot; attached to the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (Book 8, Chapter 2) in which Eusebius introduces his description of the martyrs of the Great Persecution under Diocletian with: &quot;Wherefore we have decided to relate nothing concerning them except the things in which we can vindicate the Divine judgment. ... We shall introduce into this history in general only those events which may be useful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity.&quot; In the longer text of the same work, chapter 12, Eusebius states: &quot;I think it best to pass by all the other events which occurred in the meantime: such as ... the lust of power on the part of many, the disorderly and unlawful ordinations, and the schisms among the confessors themselves; also the novelties which were zealously devised against the remnants of the Church by the new and factious members, who added innovation after innovation and forced them in unsparingly among the calamities of the persecution, heaping misfortune upon misfortune. I judge it more suitable to shun and avoid the account of these things, as I said at the beginning.&quot;
* When his own honesty was challenged by his contemporaries, Gibbon appealed to a chapter heading in Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Praeparatio evangelica&quot; (Book XII, Chapter 31) in which Eusebius discussed &quot;that it will be necessary sometimes to use falsehood as a remedy for the benefit of those who require such a mode of treatment.&quot;
* Although Gibbon refers to Eusebius as the &quot;gravest&quot; of the ecclesiastical historians, he also suggests that Eusebius was more concerned with the passing political concerns of his time than with his duty as a reliable historian.
* Jacob Burckhardt (19th century cultural historian) dismissed Eusebius as &quot;the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity&quot;.
* Other critics of Eusebius&#x27;s work cite the panegyrical tone of the &quot;Vita&quot;, plus the omission of internal Christian conflicts in the &quot;Canones&quot;, as reasons to interpret his writing with caution.

Alternate views have suggested that Gibbon&#x27;s dismissal of Eusebius is inappropriate:
* With reference to Gibbon&#x27;s comments, Joseph Barber Lightfoot (late 19th century theologian and former Bishop of Durham) pointed out that Eusebius&#x27;s statements indicate his honesty in stating what he was not going to discuss, and also his limitations as a historian in not including such material. He also discusses the question of accuracy. &quot;The manner in which Eusebius deals with his very numerous quotations elsewhere, where we can test his honesty, is a sufficient vindication against this unjust charge.&quot; Lightfoot also notes that Eusebius cannot always be relied on: &quot;A far more serious drawback to his value as a historian is the loose and uncritical spirit in which he sometimes deals with his materials. This shows itself in diverse ways. He is not always to be trusted in his discrimination of genuine and spurious documents.&quot;
* Averil Cameron (professor at King&#x27;s College London and Oxford) and Stuart Hall (historian and theologian), in their translation of the &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;, point out that writers such as Burckhardt found it necessary to attack Eusebius in order to undermine the ideological legitimacy of the Habsburg empire, which based itself on the idea of Christian empire derived from Constantine, and that the most controversial letter in the &quot;Life&quot; has since been found among the papyri of Egypt.
* In &quot;Church History&quot; (Vol. 59, 1990), Michael J. Hollerich (assistant professor at the Jesuit Santa Clara University, California) replies to Burckhardt&#x27;s criticism of Eusebius, that &quot;Eusebius has been an inviting target for students of the Constantinian era. At one time or another they have characterized him as a political propagandist, a good courtier, the shrewd and worldly adviser of the Emperor Constantine, the great publicist of the first Christian emperor, the first in a long succession of ecclesiastical politicians, the herald of Byzantinism, a political theologian, a political metaphysician, and a caesaropapist. It is obvious that these are not, in the main, neutral descriptions. Much traditional scholarship, sometimes with barely suppressed disdain, has regarded Eusebius as one who risked his orthodoxy and perhaps his character because of his zeal for the Constantinian establishment.&quot; Hollerich concludes that &quot;the standard assessment has exaggerated the importance of political themes and political motives in Eusebius&#x27;s life and writings and has failed to do justice to him as a churchman and a scholar&quot;.

While many have shared Burckhardt&#x27;s assessment, particularly with reference to the &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;, others, while not pretending to extol his merits, have acknowledged the irreplaceable value of his works which may principally reside in the copious quotations that they contain from other sources, often lost.

==Veneration==

The earliest recorded feast day of Eusebius is found in the earliest known Syrian Martyrology dating to the year 411 translated by William Wright. The Martyrology lists his feast day as May 30. Eusebius continues to be venerated as a Saint by the modern-day Syrian Orthodox Church as well, with a feast day on February 29 according to the official calendar of Saints created by Corbishop Rajan Achen.

Eusebius was long venerated in the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop J. B. Lightfoot writes in his entry for St. Eusebius in Henry Wace&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century AD, with an Account of Principal Sects and Heresies&quot; (1911) that &quot;in the Martyrologium Romanum itself he held his place for centuries&quot; and in &quot;Gallican service-books the historian is commemorated as a saint.&quot; However, Lightfoot notes that in &quot;the revision of this Martyrology under Gregory XIII his name was struck out, and Eusebius of Samosata was substituted, under the mistaken idea that Caesarea had been substituted for Samosata by a mistake.&quot; The Roman Catholic author Henri Valois includes in his translations on Eusebius&#x27;s writings testimonies of ancient authors in favor and against Eusebius; in the former category he includes evidence of Eusebius in several martyrologies and being entitled &quot;Blessed&quot; dating back to Victorius of Aquitaine. Valois includes both Usuardus and Notker, who list his feast as June 21 in the Roman Martyrology, and a Gallican breviary is included for June 21 that reads as follows:
A bone fragment relic of Eusebius within its original reliquary is on display at the Shrine of All Saints located within St. Martha&#x27;s Catholic Church in Morton Grove, Illinois.
