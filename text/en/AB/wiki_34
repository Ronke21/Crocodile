<text>Customer relationship management (CRM) is a process in which a business or another organization administers its interactions with customers, typically using data analysis to study large amounts of information.

CRM systems compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company&#x27;s website, telephone (which many software come with a softphone), email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media. They allow businesses to learn more about their target audiences and how to better cater to their needs, thus retaining customers and driving sales growth. CRM may be used with past, present or potential customers. The concepts, procedures, and rules that a corporation follows when communicating with its consumers are referred to as CRM. This complete connection covers direct contact with customers, such as sales and service-related operations, forecasting, and the analysis of consumer patterns and behaviours, from the perspective of the company.

The global customer relationship management market size is projected to grow from $101.41 billion in 2024 to $262.74 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 12.6% 

==History==
The concept of customer relationship management started in the early 1970s, when customer satisfaction was evaluated using annual surveys or by front-line asking. At that time, businesses had to rely on standalone mainframe systems to automate sales, but the extent of technology allowed them to categorize customers in spreadsheets and lists. One of the best-known precursors of modern-day CRM is the Farley File. Developed by Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign manager, James Farley, the Farley File was a comprehensive set of records detailing political and personal facts about people FDR and Farley met or were supposed to meet. Using it, people that FDR met were impressed by his &quot;recall&quot; of facts about their family and what they were doing professionally and politically. In 1982, Kate and Robert D. Kestenbaum introduced the concept of database marketing, namely applying statistical methods to analyze and gather customer data. By 1986, Pat Sullivan and Mike Muhney had released a customer evaluation system called ACT! based on the principle of a digital Rolodex, which offered a contact management service for the first time.

The trend was followed by numerous companies and independent developers trying to maximize lead potential, including Tom Siebel of Siebel Systems, who designed the first CRM product, Siebel Customer Relationship Management, in 1993. In order to compete with these new and quickly growing stand-alone CRM solutions, established enterprise resource planning (ERP) software companies like Oracle, Zoho Corporation, SAP, Peoplesoft (an Oracle subsidiary as of 2005) and Navision started extending their sales, distribution and customer service capabilities with embedded CRM modules. This included embedding sales force automation or extended customer service (e.g. inquiry, activity management) as CRM features in their ERP.

Customer relationship management was popularized in 1997 due to the work of Siebel, Gartner, and IBM. Between 1997 and 2000, leading CRM products were enriched with shipping and marketing capabilities. Siebel introduced the first mobile CRM app called Siebel Sales Handheld in 1999. The idea of a stand-alone, cloud-hosted customer base was soon adopted by other leading providers at the time, including PeopleSoft (acquired by Oracle), Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com.

The first open-source CRM system was developed by SugarCRM in 2004. During this period, CRM was rapidly migrating to the cloud, as a result of which it became accessible to sole entrepreneurs and small teams. This increase in accessibility generated a huge wave of price reduction. Around 2009, developers began considering the options to profit from social media&#x27;s momentum and designed tools to help companies become accessible on all users&#x27; favourite networks. Many startups at the time benefited from this trend to provide exclusively social CRM solutions, including Base and Nutshell. The same year, Gartner organized and held the first Customer Relationship Management Summit, and summarized the features systems should offer to be classified as CRM solutions. In 2013 and 2014, most of the popular CRM products were linked to business intelligence systems and communication software to improve corporate communication and end-users&#x27; experience. The leading trend is to replace standardized CRM solutions with industry-specific ones, or to make them customizable enough to meet the needs of every business. In November 2016, Forrester released a report where it &quot;identified the nine most significant CRM suites from eight prominent vendors&quot;.

== Types ==
=== Strategic ===
Strategic CRM concentrates upon the development of a customer-centric business culture.

The focus of a business on being customer-centric (in design and implementation of their CRM strategy) will translate into an improved CLV.

=== Operational ===
The primary goal of CRM systems is integration and automation of sales, marketing, and customer support. Therefore, these systems typically have a dashboard that gives an overall view of the three functions on a single customer view, a single page for each customer that a company may have. The dashboard may provide client information, past sales, previous marketing efforts, and more, summarizing all of the relationships between the customer and the firm. Operational CRM is made up of three main components: sales force automation, marketing automation, and service automation.
* Sales force automation works with all stages in the sales cycle, from initially entering contact information to converting a prospective client into an actual client. It implements sales promotion analysis, automates the tracking of a client&#x27;s account history for repeated sales or future sales and coordinates sales, marketing, call centers, and retail outlets. It prevents duplicate efforts between a salesperson and a customer and also automatically tracks all contacts and follow-ups between both parties.
* Marketing automation focuses on easing the overall marketing process to make it more effective and efficient. CRM tools with marketing automation capabilities can automate repeated tasks, for example, sending out automated marketing emails at certain times to customers or posting marketing information on social media. The goal with marketing automation is to turn a sales lead into a full customer. CRM systems today also work on customer engagement through social media.
* Service automation is the part of the CRM system that focuses on direct customer service technology. Through service automation, customers are supported through multiple channels such as phone, email, knowledge bases, ticketing portals, FAQs, and more.

=== Analytical ===
The role of analytical CRM systems is to analyze customer data collected through multiple sources and present it so that business managers can make more informed decisions. Analytical CRM systems use techniques such as data mining, correlation, and pattern recognition to analyze customer data. These analytics help improve customer service by finding small problems which can be solved, perhaps by marketing to different parts of a consumer audience differently. For example, through the analysis of a customer base&#x27;s buying behavior, a company might see that this customer base has not been buying a lot of products recently. After reviewing their data, the company might think to market to this subset of consumers differently to best communicate how this company&#x27;s products might benefit this group specifically.

=== Collaborative ===

The third primary aim of CRM systems is to incorporate external stakeholders such as suppliers, vendors, and distributors, and share customer information across groups/departments and organizations. For example, feedback can be collected from technical support calls, which could help provide direction for marketing products and services to that particular customer in the future.

===Customer data platform===

A customer data platform (CDP) is a computer system used by marketing departments that assembles data about individual people from various sources into one database, with which other software systems can interact. , about twenty companies were selling such systems and revenue for them was around US$300 million.

== Components ==

The main components of CRM are building and managing customer relationships through marketing, observing relationships as they mature through distinct phases, managing these relationships at each stage and recognizing that the distribution of the value of a relationship to the firm is not homogeneous. When building and managing customer relationships through marketing, firms might benefit from using a variety of tools to help organizational design, incentive schemes, customer structures, and more to optimize the reach of their marketing campaigns. Through the acknowledgment of the distinct phases of CRM, businesses will be able to benefit from seeing the interaction of multiple relationships as connected transactions. The final factor of CRM highlights the importance of CRM through accounting for the profitability of customer relationships. By studying the particular spending habits of customers, a firm may be able to dedicate different resources and amounts of attention to different types of consumers.

Relational Intelligence, which is the awareness of the variety of relationships a customer can have with a firm and the ability of the firm to reinforce or change those connections, is an important component of the main phases of CRM. Companies may be good at capturing demographic data, such as gender, age, income, and education, and connecting them with purchasing information to categorize customers into profitability tiers, but this is only a firm&#x27;s industrial view of customer relationships. A lack of relational intelligence is a sign that firms still see customers as resources that can be used for up-sell or cross-sell opportunities, rather than people looking for interesting and personalized interactions.

CRM systems include:

* Data warehouse technology, which is used to aggregate transaction information, to merge the information with CRM products, and to provide key performance indicators.
* Opportunity management, which helps the company to manage unpredictable growth and demand and implement a good forecasting model to integrate sales history with sales projections.
* CRM systems that track and measure marketing campaigns over multiple networks, tracking customer analysis by customer clicks and sales.
* Some CRM software is available as a software as a service (SaaS), delivered via the internet and accessed via a web browser instead of being installed on a local computer. Businesses using the software do not purchase it but typically pay a recurring subscription fee to the software vendor.
* For small businesses, a CRM system may consist of a contact management system that integrates emails, documents, jobs, faxes, and scheduling for individual accounts. CRM systems available for specific markets (legal, finance) frequently focus on event management and relationship tracking as opposed to financial return on investment (ROI).
* CRM systems for eCommerce focus on marketing automation tasks such as cart rescue, re-engaging users with email, and personalization.
* Customer-centric relationship management (CCRM) is a nascent sub-discipline that focuses on customer preferences instead of customer leverage. CCRM aims to add value by engaging customers in individual, interactive relationships.
* Systems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents, fundraising, sponsors&#x27; demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communication with individuals.
* CRM not only indicates technology and strategy but also indicates an integrated approach that includes employees knowledge and organizational culture to embrace the CRM philosophy.

==Effect on customer satisfaction==
Customer satisfaction has important implications for the economic performance of firms because it has the ability to increase customer loyalty and usage behavior and reduce customer complaints and the likelihood of customer defection. The implementation of a CRM approach is likely to affect customer satisfaction and customer knowledge for a variety of different reasons.

Firstly, firms can customize their offerings for each customer. By accumulating information across customer interactions and processing this information to discover hidden patterns, CRM applications help firms customize their offerings to suit the individual tastes of their customers. This customization enhances the perceived quality of products and services from a customer&#x27;s viewpoint, and because the perceived quality is a determinant of customer satisfaction, it follows that CRM applications indirectly affect customer satisfaction. CRM applications also enable firms to provide timely, accurate processing of customer orders and requests and the ongoing management of customer accounts. For example, Piccoli and Applegate discuss how Wyndham uses IT tools to deliver a consistent service experience across its various properties to a customer. Both an improved ability to customize and reduced variability of the consumption experience enhance perceived quality, which in turn positively affects customer satisfaction. CRM applications also help firms manage customer relationships more effectively across the stages of relationship initiation, maintenance, and termination.

=== Customer benefits ===
With CRM systems, customers are served on the day-to-day process. With more reliable information, their demand for self-service from companies will decrease. If there is less need to interact with the company for different problems, then the customer satisfaction level is expected to increase. These central benefits of CRM will be connected hypothetically to the three kinds of equity, which are relationship, value, and brand, and in the end to customer equity. Eight benefits were recognized to provide value drivers.
# Enhanced ability to target profitable customers.
# Integrated assistance across channels.
# Enhanced sales force efficiency and effectiveness.
# Improved pricing.
# Customized products and services.
# Improved customer service efficiency and effectiveness.
# Individualized marketing messages are also called campaigns.
# Connect customers and all channels on a single platform.

=== Examples ===
Research has found a 5% increase in customer retention boosts lifetime customer profits by 50% on average across multiple industries, as well as a boost of up to 90% within specific industries such as insurance. Companies that have mastered customer relationship strategies have the most successful CRM programs. For example, MBNA Europe has had a 75% annual profit growth since 1995. The firm heavily invests in screening potential cardholders. Once proper clients are identified, the firm retains 97% of its profitable customers. They implement CRM by marketing the right products to the right customers. The firm&#x27;s customers&#x27; card usage is 52% above the industry norm, and the average expenditure is 30% more per transaction. Also 10% of their account holders ask for more information on cross-sale products.

Amazon has also seen successes through its customer proposition. The firm implemented personal greetings, collaborative filtering, and more for the customer. They also used CRM training for the employees to see up to 80% of customers repeat.

==Customer profile==

A customer profile is a detailed description of any particular classification of customer which is created to represent the typical users of a product or service. Customer profiling is a method to understand your customers in terms of demographics, behaviour and lifestyle. It is used to help make customer-focused decisions without confusing the scope of the project with personal opinion. Overall profiling is gathering information that sums up consumption habits so far and projects them into the future so that they can be grouped for marketing and advertising purposes.
Customer or consumer profiles are the essences of the data that is collected alongside core data (name, address, company) and processed through customer analytics methods, essentially a type of profiling. 
The three basic methods of customer profiling are the psychographic approach, the consumer typology approach, and the consumer characteristics approach. These customer profiling methods help you design your business around who your customers are and help you make better customer-centered decisions.

== Improving CRM ==
Consultants hold that it is important for companies to establish strong CRM systems to improve their relational intelligence. According to this argument, a company must recognize that people have many different types of relationships with different brands. One research study analyzed relationships between consumers in China, Germany, Spain, and the United States, with over 200 brands in 11 industries including airlines, cars, and media. This information is valuable as it provides demographic, behavioral, and value-based customer segmentation. These types of relationships can be both positive and negative. Some customers view themselves as friends of the brands, while others as enemies, and some are mixed with a love-hate relationship with the brand. Some relationships are distant, intimate, or anything in between.

=== Data analysis ===
Managers must understand the different reasons for the types of relationships, and provide the customer with what they are looking for. Companies can collect this information by using surveys, interviews, and more, with current customers. 
Companies must also improve the relational intelligence of their CRM systems. Companies store and receive huge amounts of data through emails, online chat sessions, phone calls, and more. Many companies do not properly make use of this great amount of data, however. All of these are signs of what types of relationships the customer wants with the firm, and therefore companies may consider investing more time and effort in building out their relational intelligence. Companies can use data mining technologies and web searches to understand relational signals. Social media such as social networking sites, blogs, and forums can also be used to collect and analyze information. Understanding the customer and capturing this data allows companies to convert customers&#x27; signals into information and knowledge that the firm can use to understand a potential customer&#x27;s desired relations with a brand.

=== Employee training ===
Many firms have also implemented training programs to teach employees how to recognize and create strong customer-brand relationships. Other employees have also been trained in social psychology and the social sciences to help bolster customer relationships. Customer service representatives must be trained to value customer relationships and trained to understand existing customer profiles. Even the finance and legal departments should understand how to manage and build relationships with customers.

==In practice==
===Call centers===
Contact centre CRM providers are popular for small and mid-market businesses. These systems codify the interactions between the company and customers by using analytics and key performance indicators to give the users information on where to focus their marketing and customer service. This allows agents to have access to a caller&#x27;s history to provide personalized customer communication. The intention is to maximize average revenue per user, decrease churn rate and decrease idle and unproductive contact with the customers.

Growing in popularity is the idea of gamifying, or using game design elements and game principles in a non-game environment such as customer service environments. The gamification of customer service environments includes providing elements found in games like rewards and bonus points to customer service representatives as a method of feedback for a job well done.
Gamification tools can motivate agents by tapping into their desire for rewards, recognition, achievements, and competition.

===Contact-center automation===
Contact-center automation, CCA, the practice of having an integrated system that coordinates contacts between an organization and the public, is designed to reduce the repetitive and tedious parts of a contact center agent&#x27;s job. Automation prevents this by having pre-recorded audio messages that help customers solve their problems. For example, an automated contact center may be able to re-route a customer through a series of commands asking him or her to select a certain number to speak with a particular contact center agent who specializes in the field in which the customer has a question. Software tools can also integrate with the agent&#x27;s desktop tools to handle customer questions and requests. This also saves time on behalf of the employees.

=== Social media ===
Social CRM involves the use of social media and technology to engage and learn from consumers. Because the public, especially young people, are increasingly using social networking sites, companies use these sites to draw attention to their products, services and brands, with the aim of building up customer relationships to increase demand. With the increase in the use of social media platforms, integrating CRM with the help of social media can potentially be a quicker and more cost-friendly process.

Some CRM systems integrate social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to track and communicate with customers. These customers also share their own opinions and experiences with a company&#x27;s products and services, giving these firms more insight. Therefore, these firms can both share their own opinions and also track the opinions of their customers.

Enterprise feedback management software platforms combine internal survey data with trends identified through social media to allow businesses to make more accurate decisions on which products to supply.

=== Location-based services ===
CRM systems can also include technologies that create geographic marketing campaigns. The systems take in information based on a customer&#x27;s physical location and sometimes integrates it with popular location-based GPS applications. It can be used for networking or contact management as well to help increase sales based on location.

===Business-to-business transactions===
Despite the general notion that CRM systems were created for customer-centric businesses, they can also be applied to B2B environments to streamline and improve customer management conditions. For the best level of CRM operation in a B2B environment, the software must be personalized and delivered at individual levels.

The main differences between business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business CRM systems concern aspects like sizing of contact databases and length of relationships.

==Market trends==

=== Social networking ===
In the Gartner CRM Summit 2010 challenges like &quot;system tries to capture data from social networking traffic like Twitter, handles Facebook page addresses or other online social networking sites&quot; were discussed and solutions were provided that would help in bringing more clientele.

The era of the &quot;social customer&quot; refers to the use of social media by customers.

=== Mobile ===
Some CRM systems are equipped with mobile capabilities, making information accessible to remote sales staff.

=== Cloud computing and SaaS ===
Many CRM vendors offer subscription-based web tools (cloud computing) and SaaS. Salesforce.com was the first company to provide enterprise applications through a web browser, and has maintained its leadership position.

Traditional providers moved into the cloud-based market via acquisitions of smaller providers: Oracle purchased RightNow in October 2011, and Taleo and Eloqua in 2012; SAP acquired SuccessFactors in December 2011 and NetSuite acquired Verenia in 2022.

=== Sales and sales force automation ===
Sales forces also play an important role in CRM, as maximizing sales effectiveness and increasing sales productivity is a driving force behind the adoption of CRM software. Some of the top CRM trends identified in 2021 include focusing on customer service automation such as chatbots, hyper-personalization based on customer data and insights, and the use of unified CRM systems. CRM vendors support sales productivity with different products, such as tools that measure the effectiveness of ads that appear in 3D video games.

Pharmaceutical companies were some of the first investors in sales force automation (SFA) and some are on their third- or fourth-generation implementations. However, until recently, the deployments did not extend beyond SFA—limiting their scope and interest to Gartner analysts.

=== Vendor relationship management ===
Another related development is vendor relationship management (VRM), which provide tools and services that allow customers to manage their individual relationship with vendors. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard&#x27;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society and Identity Commons&#x27; Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of &quot;CRM&quot; Magazine.

=== Customer success ===
Another trend worth noting is the rise of Customer Success as a discipline within companies. More and more companies establish Customer Success teams as separate from the traditional Sales team and task them with managing existing customer relations. This trend fuels demand for additional capabilities for a more holistic understanding of customer health, which is a limitation for many existing vendors in the space. As a result, a growing number of new entrants enter the market while existing vendors add capabilities in this area to their suites.

=== AI and predictive analytics ===
In 2017, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics were identified as the newest trends in CRM.

==Criticism==

Companies face large challenges when trying to implement CRM systems. Consumer companies frequently manage their customer relationships haphazardly and unprofitably. They may not effectively or adequately use their connections with their customers, due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of a CRM system&#x27;s analysis. Clients may be treated like an exchange party, rather than a unique individual, due to, occasionally, a lack of a bridge between the CRM data and the CRM analysis output. Many studies show that customers are frequently frustrated by a company&#x27;s inability to meet their relationship expectations, and on the other side, companies do not always know how to translate the data they have gained from CRM software into a feasible action plan. In 2003, a Gartner report estimated that more than $2 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. According to CSO Insights, less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent. Many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis. In a 2007 survey from the UK, four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. Forty-three percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing systems. However, market research regarding consumers&#x27; preferences may increase the adoption of CRM among developing countries&#x27; consumers.

Collection of customer data such as personally identifiable information must strictly obey customer privacy laws, which often requires extra expenditures on legal support.

Part of the paradox with CRM stems from the challenge of determining exactly what CRM is and what it can do for a company. The CRM paradox, also referred to as the &quot;dark side of CRM&quot;, may entail favoritism and differential treatment of some customers. This can happen because a business prioritizes customers who are more profitable, more relationship-orientated or tend to have increased loyalty to the company. Although focusing on such customers by itself is not a bad thing, it can leave other customers feeling left out and alienated potentially decreasing profits because of it.

CRM technologies can easily become ineffective if there is no proper management, and they are not implemented correctly. The data sets must also be connected, distributed, and organized properly so that the users can access the information that they need quickly and easily. Research studies also show that customers are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with contact center experiences due to lags and wait times. They also request and demand multiple channels of communication with a company, and these channels must transfer information seamlessly. Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies to deliver a cross-channel customer experience that can be both consistent as well as reliable.

<text>Chuck-a-luck, also known as birdcage, or sweat rag, is a game of chance played with three dice. It is derived from grand hazard and both can be considered a variant of sic bo, which is a popular casino game, although chuck-a-luck is more of a carnival game than a true casino game. The game is sometimes used as a fundraiser for charity.

==Rules==
Chuck-a-luck is played with three standard six-sided, numbered dice that are kept in a device shaped somewhat like an hourglass which resembles a wire-frame bird cage and pivots about its centre. The dealer rotates the cage end over end, with the dice landing on the bottom.

Wagers are placed based on possible combinations that can appear on the three dice. The possible wagers are usually fewer than the wagers that are possible in sic bo and, in that sense, chuck-a-luck can be considered to be a simpler game. In the simplest variant, bettors place stakes on a board with six numbered spaces, labelled 1 through 6, inclusive. They receive a 1:1 payout if the number bet on appears once, a 2:1 payout if the number appears twice, and a 3:1 payout if the number is rolled all 3 times. In this respect, the basic game is identical to Crown and Anchor, but with numbered dice instead of symbols.

Additional wagers that are commonly seen, and their associated odds, are set out in the table below.

;Notes
===House advantage or edge===
Chuck-a-luck is a game of chance. On average, the players are expected to lose more than they win. The casino&#x27;s advantage (house advantage or house edge) is greater than most other casino games and can be much greater for certain wagers. According to John Scarne, &quot;habitual gamblers stay away from Chuck-a-Luck because they know how little chance they have against such a high [house edge]. They call Chuck-a-Luck &#x27;the champ chump&#x27;s game.

For the single die bet, there are 216 (6 × 6 × 6) possible outcomes for a throw of three dice. For a specific number:

* there are 75 possible outcomes where only one die will match the number;
* there are 15 possible outcomes where two dice will match; and
* there is one possible outcome where all three dice will match; and so
* there are 125 possible outcomes where no die will match the number.

At payouts of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 10 to 1 respectively for each of these types of outcome, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:

1 - ((75/216) × 2 + (15/216) × 3 + (1/216) × 11) = 4.6%

At more disadvantageous payouts of 1 to 1, 2 to 1 and 3 to 1, the expected loss as a percentage of the stake wagered is:

1 - ((75/216) × 2 + (15/216) × 3 + (1/216) × 4) = 7.9%

If the payouts are adjusted to 1 to 1, 3 to 1 and 5 to 1 respectively, the expected loss as a percentage is:

1 - ((75/216) × 2 + (15/216) × 4 + (1/216) × 6) = 0%

Commercially organised gambling games almost always have a house advantage which acts as a fee for the privilege of being allowed to play the game, so the last scenario would represent a payout system used for a home game, where players take turns being the role of banker/casino.

==Variants==

* As noted previously, the single-die wager of chuck-a-luck is essentially identical to Crown and Anchor, the traditional Vietnamese game &quot;Bau cua ca cop&quot;, and the Chinese dice game Hoo Hey How, each of which use six-sided dice with symbols instead of pips.
* A version of the Big Six wheel is loosely based on chuck-a-luck, with selected combinations of three dice appearing in 54 slots on a spinning wheel. Because of the distribution of the combinations, the house advantage or edge for this wheel is greater than for chuck-a-luck.

==In popular culture==
There is a reference to chuck-a-luck in the Abbott and Costello film &quot;Hold That Ghost&quot;.

In Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1952 film, &quot;Rancho Notorious&quot;, chuck-a-luck is the name of the ranch run by Altar Keane (played by Marlene Dietrich) where outlaws hide from the law. Chuck-a-luck is featured in the lyrics to the theme song and in some plot points.

The game is played by Lazar in the James Bond movie &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;.

The game is played by Freddie Rumsen in &quot;Mad Men Season 2 Episode 9: Six-Month Leave&quot;.

In Dragonfly in Amber the character Claire Randall describes the activity inside of an inn as having several soldiers playing chuck-a-luck on the floor along with a dog sleeping by the fire and smelling strongly of hops.

<text>Chipmunks are small, striped rodents of subtribe Tamiina. Chipmunks are found in North America, with the exception of the Siberian chipmunk which is found primarily in Asia.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Chipmunks are classified as four genera: &quot;Tamias&quot;, of which the eastern chipmunk (&quot;T. striatus&quot;) is the only living member; &quot;Eutamias&quot;, of which the Siberian chipmunk (&quot;E. sibiricus&quot;) is the only living member; &quot;Nototamias&quot;, which consists of three extinct species, and &quot;Neotamias&quot;, which includes the 23 remaining, mostly western North American, species. These classifications were treated as subgenera due to the chipmunks&#x27; morphological similarities. As a result, most taxonomies over the twentieth century have placed the chipmunks into a single genus. Joseph C. Moore reclassified chipmunks to form a subtribe Tamiina in a 1959 study, and this classification has been supported by studies of mitochondrial DNA.

The common name originally may have been spelled &quot;chitmunk&quot;, from the native Odawa (Ottawa) word &quot;jidmoonh&quot;, meaning &quot;red squirrel&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Ojibwe &quot;ajidamoo&quot;). The earliest form cited in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is &quot;chipmonk&quot;, from 1842. Other early forms include &quot;chipmuck&quot; and &quot;chipminck&quot;, and in the 1830s they were also referred to as &quot;chip squirrels&quot;, probably in reference to the sound they make. In the mid-19th century, John James Audubon and his sons included a lithograph of the chipmunk in their &quot;Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America&quot;, calling it the &quot;chipping squirrel [or] hackee&quot;. Chipmunks have also been referred to as &quot;ground squirrels&quot; (although the name &quot;ground squirrel&quot; may refer to other squirrels, such as those of the genus &quot;Spermophilus&quot;).

==Diet==
Chipmunks have an omnivorous diet primarily consisting of seeds, nuts and other fruits, and buds. They also commonly eat grass, shoots, and many other forms of plant matter, as well as fungi, insects and other arthropods, small frogs, worms, and bird eggs. They will also occasionally eat newly hatched baby birds. Around humans, chipmunks can eat cultivated grains and vegetables, and other plants from farms and gardens, so they are sometimes considered pests. Chipmunks mostly forage on the ground, but they climb trees to obtain nuts such as hazelnuts and acorns. At the beginning of autumn, many species of chipmunk begin to stockpile nonperishable foods for winter. They mostly cache their foods in a larder in their burrows and remain in their nests until spring, unlike some other species which make multiple small caches of food. Cheek pouches allow chipmunks to carry food items to their burrows for either storage or consumption.

==Ecology and life history==

Eastern chipmunks, the largest of the chipmunks, mate in early spring and again in early summer, producing litters of four or five young twice each year. Western chipmunks breed only once a year. The young emerge from the burrow after about six weeks and strike out on their own within the next two weeks.

These small mammals fulfill several important functions in forest ecosystems. Their activities harvesting and hoarding tree seeds play a crucial role in seedling establishment. They consume many different kinds of fungi, including those involved in symbiotic mycorrhizal associations with trees, and are a vector for dispersal of the spores of subterranean sporocarps (truffles) in some regions. 

Chipmunks construct extensive burrows which can be more than in length with several well-concealed entrances. The sleeping quarters are kept clear of shells, and feces are stored in refuse tunnels.

The eastern chipmunk hibernates in the winter, while western chipmunks do not, relying on the stores in their burrows.

Chipmunks play an important role as prey for various predatory mammals and birds but are also opportunistic predators themselves, particularly with regard to bird eggs and nestlings, as in the case of eastern chipmunks and mountain bluebirds (&quot;Siala currucoides&quot;).

Chipmunks typically live about three years, although some have been observed living to nine years in captivity.

Chipmunks are diurnal. In captivity, they are said to sleep for an average of about 15 hours a day. It is thought that mammals which can sleep in hiding, such as rodents and bats, tend to sleep longer than those that must remain on alert.

<text>Computer music is the application of computing technology in music composition, to help human composers create new music or to have computers independently create music, such as with algorithmic composition programs. It includes the theory and application of new and existing computer software technologies and basic aspects of music, such as sound synthesis, digital signal processing, sound design, sonic diffusion, acoustics, electrical engineering, and psychoacoustics. The field of computer music can trace its roots back to the origins of electronic music, and the first experiments and innovations with electronic instruments at the turn of the 20th century.

==History==

Much of the work on computer music has drawn on the relationship between music and mathematics, a relationship that has been noted since the Ancient Greeks described the &quot;harmony of the spheres&quot;.

Musical melodies were first generated by the computer originally named the CSIR Mark 1 (later renamed CSIRAC) in Australia in 1950. There were newspaper reports from America and England (early and recently) that computers may have played music earlier, but thorough research has debunked these stories as there is no evidence to support the newspaper reports (some of which were speculative). Research has shown that people &quot;speculated&quot; about computers playing music, possibly because computers would make noises, but there is no evidence that they did it.

The world&#x27;s first computer to play music was the CSIR Mark 1 (later named CSIRAC), which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard in the late 1940s. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIR Mark 1 to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1950 the CSIR Mark 1 was used to play music, the first known use of a digital computer for that purpose. The music was never recorded, but it has been accurately reconstructed. In 1951 it publicly played the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; of which only the reconstruction exists. However, the CSIR Mark 1 played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice, as Max Mathews did, which is current computer-music practice.

The first music to be performed in England was a performance of the British National Anthem that was programmed by Christopher Strachey on the Ferranti Mark 1, late in 1951. Later that year, short extracts of three pieces were recorded there by a BBC outside broadcasting unit: the National Anthem, &quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot;, and &quot;In the Mood&quot;; this is recognized as the earliest recording of a computer to play music as the CSIRAC music was never recorded. This recording can be heard at the Manchester University site. Researchers at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch declicked and restored this recording in 2016 and the results may be heard on SoundCloud.

Two further major 1950s developments were the origins of digital sound synthesis by computer, and of algorithmic composition programs beyond rote playback. Amongst other pioneers, the musical chemists Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson worked on a series of algorithmic composition experiments from 1956 to 1959, manifested in the 1957 premiere of the &quot;Illiac Suite&quot; for string quartet. Max Mathews at Bell Laboratories developed the influential MUSIC I program and its descendants, further popularising computer music through a 1963 article in &quot;Science&quot;. The first professional composer to work with digital synthesis was James Tenney, who created a series of digitally synthesized and/or algorithmically composed pieces at Bell Labs using Mathews&#x27; MUSIC III system, beginning with &quot;Analog #1 (Noise Study)&quot; (1961). After Tenney left Bell Labs in 1964, he was replaced by composer Jean-Claude Risset, who conducted research on the synthesis of instrumental timbres and composed &quot;Computer Suite from Little Boy&quot; (1968).

Early computer-music programs typically did not run in real time, although the first experiments on CSIRAC and the Ferranti Mark 1 did operate in real time. From the late 1950s, with increasingly sophisticated programming, programs would run for hours or days, on multi million-dollar computers, to generate a few minutes of music. One way around this was to use a &#x27;hybrid system&#x27; of digital control of an analog synthesiser and early examples of this were Max Mathews&#x27; GROOVE system (1969) and also MUSYS by Peter Zinovieff (1969).

Until now partial use has been exploited for musical research into the substance and form of sound (convincing examples are those of Hiller and Isaacson in Urbana, Illinois, US; Iannis Xenakis in Paris and Pietro Grossi in Florence, Italy).

In May 1967 the first experiments in computer music in Italy were carried out by the &quot;S 2F M studio&quot; in Florence in collaboration with &quot;General Electric Information Systems&quot; Italy. &quot;Olivetti-General Electric GE 115&quot; (Olivetti S.p.A.) is used by Grossi as a &quot;performer&quot;: three programmes were prepared for these experiments. The programmes were written by Ferruccio Zulian and used by Pietro Grossi for playing Bach, Paganini, and Webern works and for studying new sound structures.
John Chowning&#x27;s work on FM synthesis from the 1960s to the 1970s allowed much more efficient digital synthesis, eventually leading to the development of the affordable FM synthesis-based Yamaha DX7 digital synthesizer, released in 1983.

Interesting sounds must have a fluidity and changeability that allows them to remain fresh to the ear. In computer music this subtle ingredient is bought at a high computational cost, both in terms of the number of items requiring detail in a score and in the amount of interpretive work the instruments must produce to realize this detail in sound. 

=== In Japan ===

In Japan, experiments in computer music date back to 1962, when Keio University professor Sekine and Toshiba engineer Hayashi experimented with the computer. This resulted in a piece entitled &quot;TOSBAC Suite&quot;, influenced by the &quot;Illiac Suite&quot;. Later Japanese computer music compositions include a piece by Kenjiro Ezaki presented during Osaka Expo &#x27;70 and &quot;Panoramic Sonore&quot; (1974) by music critic Akimichi Takeda. Ezaki also published an article called &quot;Contemporary Music and Computers&quot; in 1970. Since then, Japanese research in computer music has largely been carried out for commercial purposes in popular music, though some of the more serious Japanese musicians used large computer systems such as the &quot;Fairlight&quot; in the 1970s.

In the late 1970s these systems became commercialized, including systems like the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, where a microprocessor-based system controls an analog synthesizer, released in 1978. In addition to the Yamaha DX7, the advent of inexpensive digital chips and microcomputers opened the door to real-time generation of computer music. In the 1980s, Japanese personal computers such as the NEC PC-88 came installed with FM synthesis sound chips and featured audio programming languages such as Music Macro Language (MML) and MIDI interfaces, which were most often used to produce video game music, or chiptunes. By the early 1990s, the performance of microprocessor-based computers reached the point that real-time generation of computer music using more general programs and algorithms became possible.

==Advances==
Advances in computing power and software for manipulation of digital media have dramatically affected the way computer music is generated and performed. Current-generation micro-computers are powerful enough to perform very sophisticated audio synthesis using a wide variety of algorithms and approaches. Computer music systems and approaches are now ubiquitous, and so firmly embedded in the process of creating music that we hardly give them a second thought: computer-based synthesizers, digital mixers, and effects units have become so commonplace that use of digital rather than analog technology to create and record music is the norm, rather than the exception.

==Research==
There is considerable activity in the field of computer music as researchers continue to pursue new and interesting computer-based synthesis, composition, and performance approaches. Throughout the world there are many organizations and institutions dedicated to the area of computer and electronic music study and research, including the CCRMA (Center of Computer Research in Music and Acoustic, Stanford, USA), ICMA (International Computer Music Association), C4DM (Centre for Digital Music), IRCAM, GRAME, SEAMUS (Society for Electro Acoustic Music in the United States), CEC (Canadian Electroacoustic Community), and a great number of institutions of higher learning around the world.

===Music composed and performed by computers===

Later, composers such as Gottfried Michael Koenig and Iannis Xenakis had computers generate the sounds of the composition as well as the score. Koenig produced algorithmic composition programs which were a generalization of his own serial composition practice. This is not exactly similar to Xenakis&#x27; work as he used mathematical abstractions and examined how far he could explore these musically. Koenig&#x27;s software translated the calculation of mathematical equations into codes which represented musical notation. This could be converted into musical notation by hand and then performed by human players. His programs Project 1 and Project 2 are examples of this kind of software. Later, he extended the same kind of principles into the realm of synthesis, enabling the computer to produce the sound directly. SSP is an example of a program which performs this kind of function. All of these programs were produced by Koenig at the Institute of Sonology in Utrecht in the 1970s. In the 2000s, Andranik Tangian developed a computer algorithm to determine the time event structures for rhythmic canons and rhythmic fugues, which were then &quot;manually&quot; worked out into harmonic compositions &quot;Eine kleine Mathmusik I&quot; and &quot;Eine kleine Mathmusik II&quot; performed by computer;
for scores and recordings see.

===Computer-generated scores for performance by human players===
Computers have also been used in an attempt to imitate the music of great composers of the past, such as Mozart. A present exponent of this technique is David Cope, whose computer programs analyses works of other composers to produce new works in a similar style. Cope&#x27;s best-known program is Emily Howell.

Melomics, a research project from the University of Málaga (Spain), developed a computer composition cluster named Iamus, which composes complex, multi-instrument pieces for editing and performance. Since its inception, Iamus has composed a full album in 2012, also named &quot;Iamus&quot;, which &quot;New Scientist&quot; described as &quot;the first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra&quot;. The group has also developed an API for developers to utilize the technology, and makes its music available on its website.

===Computer-aided algorithmic composition===

Computer-aided algorithmic composition (CAAC, pronounced &quot;sea-ack&quot;) is the implementation and use of algorithmic composition techniques in software. This label is derived from the combination of two labels, each too vague for continued use. The label &quot;computer-aided composition&quot; lacks the specificity of using generative algorithms. Music produced with notation or sequencing software could easily be considered computer-aided composition. The label &quot;algorithmic composition&quot; is likewise too broad, particularly in that it does not specify the use of a computer. The term computer-aided, rather than computer-assisted, is used in the same manner as computer-aided design.

==Machine improvisation==

Machine improvisation uses computer algorithms to create improvisation on existing music materials. This is usually done by sophisticated recombination of musical phrases extracted from existing music, either live or pre-recorded. In order to achieve credible improvisation in particular style, machine improvisation uses machine learning and pattern matching algorithms to analyze existing musical examples. The resulting patterns are then used to create new variations &quot;in the style&quot; of the original music, developing a notion of stylistic re-injection.
This is different from other improvisation methods with computers that use algorithmic composition to generate new music without performing analysis of existing music examples.

===Statistical style modeling===
Style modeling implies building a computational representation of the musical surface that captures important stylistic features from data. Statistical approaches are used to capture the redundancies in terms of pattern dictionaries or repetitions, which are later recombined to generate new musical data. Style mixing can be realized by analysis of a database containing multiple musical examples in different styles. Machine Improvisation builds upon a long musical tradition of statistical modeling that began with Hiller and Isaacson&#x27;s &quot;Illiac Suite for String Quartet&quot; (1957) and Xenakis&#x27; uses of Markov chains and stochastic processes. Modern methods include the use of lossless data compression for incremental parsing, prediction suffix tree, string searching and more. Style mixing is possible by blending models derived from several musical sources, with the first style mixing done by S. Dubnov in a piece NTrope Suite using Jensen-Shannon joint source model. Later the use of factor oracle algorithm (basically a &quot;factor oracle&quot; is a finite state automaton constructed in linear time and space in an incremental fashion) was adopted for music by Assayag and Dubnov and became the basis for several systems that use stylistic re-injection.

===Implementations===

The first implementation of statistical style modeling was the LZify method in Open Music, followed by the Continuator system that implemented interactive machine improvisation that interpreted the LZ incremental parsing in terms of Markov models and used it for real time style modeling developed by François Pachet at Sony CSL Paris in 2002. Matlab implementation of the Factor Oracle machine improvisation can be found as part of Computer Audition toolbox. There is also an NTCC implementation of the Factor Oracle machine improvisation.

OMax is a software environment developed in IRCAM. OMax uses OpenMusic and Max. It is based on researches on stylistic modeling carried out by Gerard Assayag and Shlomo Dubnov and on researches on improvisation with the computer by G. Assayag, M. Chemillier and G. Bloch (a.k.a. the &quot;OMax Brothers&quot;) in the Ircam Music Representations group.
One of the problems in modeling audio signals with factor oracle is the symbolization of features from continuous values to a discrete alphabet. This problem was solved in the Variable Markov Oracle (VMO) available as python implementation, using an information rate criteria for finding the optimal or most informative representation.

=== Use of artificial intelligence ===
The use of artificial intelligence to generate new melodies, cover pre-existing music, and clone artists&#x27; voices, is a recent phenomenon that has been reported to disrupt the music industry.

==Live coding==

Live coding (sometimes known as &#x27;interactive programming&#x27;, &#x27;on-the-fly programming&#x27;, &#x27;just in time programming&#x27;) is the name given to the process of writing software in real time as part of a performance. Recently it has been explored as a more rigorous alternative to laptop musicians who, live coders often feel, lack the charisma and pizzazz of musicians performing live.

<text>A concept is an abstract idea that serves as a foundation for more concrete principles, thoughts, and beliefs.
Concepts play an important role in all aspects of cognition. As such, concepts are studied within such disciplines as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, and these disciplines are interested in the logical and psychological structure of concepts, and how they are put together to form thoughts and sentences. The study of concepts has served as an important flagship of an emerging interdisciplinary approach, cognitive science.

In contemporary philosophy, three understandings of a concept prevail:
* mental representations, such that a concept is an entity that exists in the mind (a mental object)
* abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Fregean senses, abstract objects rather than a mental object or a mental state

Concepts are classified into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed &quot;superordinate&quot; and lower levels termed &quot;subordinate&quot;. Additionally, there is the &quot;basic&quot; or &quot;middle&quot; level at which people will most readily categorize a concept. For example, a basic-level concept would be &quot;chair&quot;, with its superordinate, &quot;furniture&quot;, and its subordinate, &quot;easy chair&quot;.

Concepts may be exact or inexact. When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of &quot;tree&quot;, it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking. A concept is by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other ideas.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the cognitive science disciplines of linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are regularly formalized in mathematics, computer science, databases and artificial intelligence. Examples of specific high-level conceptual classes in these fields include classes, schema or categories. In informal use, the word &quot;concept&quot; can refer to any idea.

== Ontology of concepts ==
A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what they &quot;are&quot;. Philosophers construe this question as one about the ontology of concepts—what kind of things they are. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept&#x27;s ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.

=== Concepts as mental representations ===
==== The psychological view of concepts ====

Within the framework of the representational theory of mind, the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called &quot;mental representations&quot; (colloquially understood as &quot;ideas in the mind&quot;). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called &quot;propositional attitudes&quot; (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it &quot;believing&quot;, &quot;doubting&quot;, &quot;wondering&quot;, &quot;accepting&quot;, etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.

==== The physicalist view of concepts ====
In a physicalist theory of mind, a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain. Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives. Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them. The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as categorization, memory, decision making, learning, and inference.

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term cortical memory, in contrast to episodic memory of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in hippocampus. Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as patient HM. The abstraction from the day&#x27;s hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day&#x27;s events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organized into more abstract concepts. (&quot;Sort&quot; is itself another word for concept, and &quot;sorting&quot; thus means to organize into concepts.)

=== Concepts as abstract objects ===
The semantic view of concepts suggests that concepts are abstract objects. In this view, concepts are abstract objects of a category out of a human&#x27;s mind rather than some mental representations.

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and natural language. However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept &quot;dog&quot; is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept—or the reference class or extension. Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called &quot;lexical concepts&quot;.

The study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science.

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. A concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word &quot;moon&quot; (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only &quot;represents&quot; that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

==== &quot;A priori&quot; concepts and &quot;a posteriori&quot; concepts ====
Kant maintained the view that human minds possess not only empirical or &quot;a posteriori&quot; concepts, but also pure or &quot;a priori&quot; concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts categories, in the sense of the word that means predicate, attribute, characteristic, or quality. But these pure categories are predicates of things &quot;in general&quot;, not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an &quot;a priori&quot; concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an &quot;a posteriori&quot; concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the schema. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction &quot;a posteriori concepts&quot; (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an &quot;a posteriori&quot; concept is a general representation (&quot;Vorstellung&quot;) or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects (Logic §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical &quot;a posteriori&quot; concepts are created.
====Embodied content====
In cognitive linguistics, abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see conceptual blending). A common class of blends are metaphors. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or &quot;recollections&quot;, in Plato&#x27;s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.

==== Realist universal concepts ====

Platonist views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects. Plato was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say, this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato&#x27;s ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by Kurt Gödel as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.

==== Sense and reference ====

Gottlob Frege, founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status.

==== Concepts in calculus ====
According to Carl Benjamin Boyer, in the introduction to his &quot;The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development&quot;, concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the derivative and the integral are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious limits in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts, is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle), and was prominently held until the 1970s. The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure. Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition. Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both &quot;necessary&quot; and jointly &quot;sufficient&quot; for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept. A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A set of features is considered sufficient if having all the parts required by the definition entails membership in the class. For example, the classic example &quot;bachelor&quot; is said to be defined by &quot;unmarried&quot; and &quot;man&quot;. An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition. Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the &quot;law of the excluded middle&quot;, which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class. In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in philosophy—concept analysis. Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept. For example, Shoemaker&#x27;s classic &quot;Time Without Change&quot; explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory, it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments summarized as follows:
* It seems that there simply are no definitions—especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.
* It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don&#x27;t know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.
* Quine&#x27;s argument against analyticity in Two Dogmas of Empiricism also holds as an argument against definitions.
* Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.
* Experiments and research showed that assumptions of well defined concepts and categories might not be correct. Researcher Hampton asked participants to differentiate whether items were in different categories. Hampton did not conclude that items were either clear and absolute members or non-members. Instead, Hampton found that some items were barely considered category members and others that were barely non-members. For example, participants considered sinks as barely members of kitchen utensil category, while sponges were considered barely non-members, with much disagreement among participants of the study. If concepts and categories were very well defined, such cases should be rare. Since then, many researches have discovered borderline members that are not clearly in or out of a category of concept.
* Rosch found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory. See below.
* Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.

=== Prototype theory ===
Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure. Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess. Wittgenstein, Rosch, Mervis, Brent Berlin, Anglin, and Posner are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory. Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as &quot;family resemblances&quot;. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership; a dog can still be a dog with only three legs. This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects. Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like &#x27;vegetable&#x27; or &#x27;furniture&#x27; as more or less typical of that class. It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power. We can judge an item&#x27;s membership of the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member—the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities. Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category. Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain. Some of these are: visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

The Prototype perspective is proposed as an alternative view to the Classical approach. While the Classical theory requires an all-or-nothing membership in a group, prototypes allow for more fuzzy boundaries and are characterized by attributes. Lakoff stresses that experience and cognition are critical to the function of language, and Labov&#x27;s experiment found that the function that an artifact contributed to what people categorized it as. For example, a container holding mashed potatoes versus tea swayed people toward classifying them as a bowl and a cup, respectively. This experiment also illuminated the optimal dimensions of what the prototype for &quot;cup&quot; is.

Prototypes also deal with the essence of things and to what extent they belong to a category. There have been a number of experiments dealing with questionnaires asking participants to rate something according to the extent to which it belongs to a category. This question is contradictory to the Classical Theory because something is either a member of a category or is not. This type of problem is paralleled in other areas of linguistics such as phonology, with an illogical question such as &quot;is /i/ or /o/ a better vowel?&quot; The Classical approach and Aristotelian categories may be a better descriptor in some cases.

=== Theory-theory ===

Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further. This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing. Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us. In this sense, concepts&#x27; structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world. How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory. This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is). When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don&#x27;t in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. Theory-theory also postulates that people&#x27;s theories about the world are what inform their conceptual knowledge of the world. Therefore, analysing people&#x27;s theories can offer insights into their concepts. In this sense, &quot;theory&quot; means an individual&#x27;s mental explanation rather than scientific fact. This theory criticizes classical and prototype theory as relying too much on similarities and using them as a sufficient constraint. It suggests that theories or mental understandings contribute more to what has membership to a group rather than weighted similarities, and a cohesive category is formed more by what makes sense to the perceiver. Weights assigned to features have shown to fluctuate and vary depending on context and experimental task demonstrated by Tversky. For this reason, similarities between members may be collateral rather than causal.

According to the theory of ideasthesia (or &quot;sensing concepts&quot;), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for the creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or qualia) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon. This question is also known as the hard problem of consciousness. Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on synesthesia where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer. Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;concept&quot; is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin &quot;&quot; – &quot;something conceived&quot;).

<doc id="6984" wikidata="Q150851" url="?curid=6984" title="Colin Powell">
<text>Colin Luther Powell ( ; – ) was an American statesman, diplomat, and army officer who was the 65th United States secretary of state from 2001 to 2005. He was the first African-American to hold the office. He was the 15th national security advisor from 1987 to 1989, and the 12th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1989 to 1993.

Powell was born in New York City in 1937 to parents who immigrated from Jamaica. He was raised in the South Bronx and educated in the New York City public schools, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in geology from the City College of New York. He joined the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps while at City College and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on graduating in 1958. He was a professional soldier for 35 years, holding many command and staff positions and rising to the rank of four-star general. He was commander of the U.S. Army Forces Command in 1989.

Powell&#x27;s last military assignment, from October 1989 to September 1993, was as Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, the highest military position in the United States Department of Defense. During this time, he oversaw twenty-eight crises, including the invasion of Panama in 1989 and Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf War against Iraq in 1990–1991. He formulated the Powell Doctrine, which limits American military action unless it satisfies criteria regarding American national security interests, overwhelming force, and widespread public support. He served as secretary of state under Republican president George W. Bush. As secretary of state, Powell gave a presentation to the United Nations Security Council regarding the rationale for the Iraq War, but he later admitted that the speech contained substantial inaccuracies. He resigned after Bush was reelected in 2004.

In 1995, Powell wrote his autobiography, &quot;My American Journey&quot; and then in retirement another book titled, &quot;It Worked for Me: Lessons in Life and Leadership&quot; (2012). He pursued a career as a public speaker, addressing audiences across the country and abroad. Before his appointment as Secretary of State he chaired America&#x27;s Promise. In the 2016 United States presidential election, Powell, who was not a candidate, received three electoral votes from Washington state for the office of President of the United States. He won numerous U.S. and foreign military awards and decorations. His civilian awards included the Presidential Medal of Freedom (twice), the Congressional Gold Medal, the Presidential Citizens Medal, and the Secretary&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award. Powell died from complications of COVID-19 in 2021, while being treated for a form of blood cancer that damaged his immune system.

==Early life==
Colin Luther Powell was born on , in Harlem, a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan. He was born to Jamaican immigrants Maud Ariel (née McKoy) and Luther Theophilus Powell. His parents were both of mixed African, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. Luther worked as a shipping clerk and Maud as a seamstress. Powell was raised in the South Bronx and attended the now closed Morris High School, from which he graduated in 1954.

While at school, Powell worked at a local baby furniture store, where he picked up Yiddish from the Eastern European Jewish shopkeepers and some of the customers. He also served as a Shabbos goy, helping Orthodox families with needed tasks on the Sabbath. He received a bachelor of science degree in geology from the City College of New York in 1958 and said that he was a &quot;C average&quot; student. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t doing well in civil engineering&quot;. While at CCNY, Powell shifted his study focus to the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) and became a &quot;straight A student&quot; in it; he held the distinction of being the first chairman to have attained his commission through the ROTC. Powell also graduated from George Washington University with an MBA in 1971 and an honorary doctor of public service in 1990.

==Military career==
Powell was a professional soldier for thirty-five years, holding a variety of command and staff positions and rising to the rank of general.

===Training===
While attending the City College of New York, Powell joined the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC). He described the experience as one of the happiest experiences of his life. According to Powell: 

As a cadet, Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing.

===Early career===
Upon graduation, he received a commission as an Army second lieutenant; at this time, the Army was newly desegregated . He underwent training in the state of Georgia, where he was refused service in bars and restaurants because of the color of his skin. After attending basic training at Fort Benning, Powell was assigned to the 48th Infantry, in West Germany, as a platoon leader. From 1960 to 1962, he served as group liaison officer, company executive officer, and commander of Company A, 1st Battle Group, 4th Infantry, 2nd Infantry Brigade, 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.

===Vietnam War===

Captain Powell served a tour in Vietnam as a South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) advisor from 1962 to 1963. While on patrol in a Viet Cong-held area, he was wounded by stepping on a punji stake. The large infection made it difficult for him to walk, and caused his foot to swell for a short time, shortening his first tour.

Powell returned to Vietnam as a major in 1968, serving as assistant chief of staff of operations for the 23rd (Americal) Infantry Division. During the second tour in Vietnam he was decorated with the Soldier&#x27;s Medal for bravery after he survived a helicopter crash and single-handedly rescued three others, including division commander Major General Charles M. Gettys, from the burning wreckage.

====My Lai massacre inquiry====
Powell was charged with investigating a detailed letter by 11th Light Infantry Brigade soldier Tom Glen, which backed up rumored allegations of the 1968 My Lai massacre. Powell wrote: &quot;In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between Americal soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent&quot;. Later, Powell&#x27;s assessment would be described as whitewashing the news of the massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public. In May 2004, Powell said to television and radio host Larry King, &quot;I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. I got there after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored&quot;.

===After the Vietnam War===

When he returned to the U.S. from Vietnam in 1971, Powell earned a Master of Business Administration degree from George Washington University in Washington, D.C. He later served a White House Fellowship under President Richard Nixon from 1972 to 1973. During 1975–1976 he attended the National War College, Washington, D.C.

In his autobiography, &quot;My American Journey&quot;, Powell named several officers he served under who inspired and mentored him. As a lieutenant colonel commanding 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry in South Korea, Powell was very close to his division commander, Major General Henry &quot;Gunfighter&quot; Emerson, whom he regarded as one of the most caring officers he ever met. Emerson insisted his troops train at night to fight a possible North Korean attack, and made them repeatedly watch the television film &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; to promote racial harmony. Powell always professed that what set Emerson apart was his great love of his soldiers and concern for their welfare. After a race riot occurred, in which African-American soldiers almost killed a white officer, Powell was charged by Emerson to crack down on black militants; Powell&#x27;s efforts led to the discharge of one soldier, and other efforts to reduce racial tensions. During 1976–1977 he commanded the 2nd Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division.

Powell subsequently served as the junior military assistant to deputy secretaries of defense Charles Duncan and Graham Claytor, receiving a promotion to brigadier general on 1 June 1979. At the ceremony, he received from Secretary Harold Brown&#x27;s protocol officer, Stuart Purviance, a framed quotation by President Abraham Lincoln. The quote was &quot;I can make a brigadier general in five minutes. But it&#x27;s not so easy to replace one hundred ten horses&quot;. Taped to the back of the frame was an envelope with instructions that it not be opened for ten years. When Powell opened the note in 1989, after he had become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he read Purviance&#x27;s prediction that Powell would become Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Powell wrote that he kept the Lincoln quote as a reminder to remain humble despite his rank and position.

===National Security Advisor and other advisory roles===
Powell retained his role as the now-senior military assistant into the presidency of Ronald Reagan, serving under Claytor&#x27;s successor as deputy secretary of defense, Frank Carlucci. Powell and Carlucci formed a close friendship, referring to each by first names in private, as Powell refused any sort of first-name basis in an official capacity. It was on Powell&#x27;s advice that newly-elected President Ronald Reagan presented Roy Benavidez the Medal of Honor; Benavidez had received the Distinguished Service Cross, which his commander argued should be upgraded, but army officials believed there was no living eyewitness to testify to Benavidez&#x27;s heroism. A soldier who had been present during the action in question learned in July 1980 of the effort to upgrade Benavidez&#x27;s medal and provided the necessary sworn statement; the upgrade to the Medal of Honor was approved in December 1980. Powell also declined an offer from Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh Jr. to be his under secretary due to his reluctance to assume a political appointment; James R. Ambrose was selected instead. Intent on attaining a division command, Powell petitioned Carlucci and Army chief of staff Edward C. Meyer for reassignment away from the Pentagon, with Meyer appointing Powell as assistant division commander for operations and training of the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colorado under Major General John W. Hudachek.

After he left Fort Carson, Powell became the senior military assistant to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, whom he assisted during the 1983 invasion of Grenada and the 1986 airstrike on Libya. Under Weinberger, Powell was also involved in the unlawful transfer of U.S.-made TOW anti-tank missiles and Hawk anti-aircraft missiles from Israel to Iran as part of the criminal conspiracy that would later become known as the Iran–Contra affair. In November 1985, Powell solicited and delivered to Weinberger a legal assessment that the transfer of Hawk missiles to Israel or Iran, without Congressional notification, would be &quot;a clear violation&quot; of the law. Despite this, thousands of TOW missiles and hundreds of Hawk missiles and spare parts were transferred from Israel to Iran until the venture was exposed in a Lebanese magazine, &quot;Ash-Shiraa&quot;, in November 1986. According to Iran-Contra Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, when questioned by Congress, Powell &quot;had given incomplete answers&quot; concerning notes withheld by Weinberger and that the activities of Powell and others in concealing the notes &quot;seemed corrupt enough to meet the new, poorly defined test of obstruction&quot;. Following his resignation as Secretary of Defense, Weinberger was indicted on five felony charges, including one count Obstruction of Congress for concealing the notes. Powell was never indicted by the Independent Counsel in connection with the Iran-Contra affair.
In 1986, Powell took over the command of V Corps in Frankfurt, Germany, from Robert Lewis &quot;Sam&quot; Wetzel. The next year, he served as United States Deputy National Security Advisor, under Frank Carlucci.

Following the Iran–Contra scandal, Powell became, at the age of 49, Ronald Reagan&#x27;s National Security Advisor, serving from 1987 to 1989 while retaining his Army commission as a lieutenant general. He helped negotiate a number of arms treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev, the leader of the Soviet Union.

In April 1989, after his tenure with the National Security Council, Powell was promoted to four-star general under President George H. W. Bush and briefly served as the Commander in Chief, Forces Command (FORSCOM), headquartered at Fort McPherson, Georgia, overseeing all active U.S. Army regulars, U.S. Army Reserve, and National Guard units in the Continental U.S., Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. He became the third general since World War II to reach four-star rank without ever serving as a division commander, joining Dwight D. Eisenhower and Alexander Haig.

Later that year, President George H. W. Bush selected him as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

===Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===
Powell&#x27;s last military assignment, from 1 October 1989 to 30 September 1993, was as the 12th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military position in the Department of Defense. At age 52, he became the youngest officer, and first Afro-Caribbean American, to serve in this position. Powell was also the first JCS chair who received his commission through ROTC.

During this time, Powell oversaw responses to 28 crises, including the invasion of Panama in 1989 to remove General Manuel Noriega from power and Operation Desert Storm in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. During these events, Powell earned the nickname &quot;the reluctant warrior&quot; – although Powell himself disputed this label, and spoke in favor of the first Bush administration&#x27;s Gulf War policies.

As a military strategist, Powell advocated an approach to military conflicts that maximizes the potential for success and minimizes casualties. A component of this approach is the use of overwhelming force, which he applied to Operation Desert Storm in 1991. His approach has been dubbed the Powell Doctrine. Powell continued as chairman of the JCS into the Clinton presidency. However, as a realist, he considered himself a bad fit for an administration largely made up of liberal internationalists. He clashed with then-U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright over the Bosnian crisis, as he opposed any military intervention that did not involve U.S. interests.

Powell also regularly clashed with Secretary of Defense Leslie Aspin, whom he was initially hesitant to support after Aspin was nominated by President Clinton. During a lunch meeting between Powell and Aspin in preparation of Operation Gothic Serpent, Aspin was more focused on eating salad than listening and paying attention to Powell&#x27;s presentation on military operations. The incident caused Powell to grow more irritated towards Aspin and led to his early resignation on 30 September 1993. Powell was succeeded temporarily by Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral David E. Jeremiah, who took the position as Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Soon after Powell&#x27;s resignation, on 3–4 October 1993, the Battle of Mogadishu, the aim of which was to capture Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, was initiated and ended in disaster. Powell later defended Aspin, saying in part that he could not fault Aspin for Aspin&#x27;s decision to remove a Lockheed AC-130 from the list of armaments requested for the operation.

Powell took an early resignation from his tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 30 September 1993. 

The following year President Clinton sent newly-retired Powell, together with former President Jimmy Carter and Senator Sam Nunn, to visit Haiti in an effort to persuade General Raoul Cédras and the ruling junta to abdicate in favor of former Haitian President Aristide, under the threat of an imminent US invasion to remove them by force. Powell&#x27;s status as a retired general was well known and respected in Haiti and was held to be instrumental in persuading Gen. Cédras. 

During his chairmanship of the JCS, there was discussion of awarding Powell a fifth star, granting him the rank of General of the Army. But even in the wake of public and Congressional pressure to do so, Clinton-Gore presidential transition team staffers decided against it.

==Potential presidential candidate==

Powell&#x27;s experience in military matters made him a very popular figure with both American political parties. Many Democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters, while many Republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past Republican administrations. Put forth as a potential Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 1992 U.S. presidential election or even potentially replacing Vice President Dan Quayle as the Republican vice presidential nominee, Powell eventually declared himself a Republican and began to campaign for Republican candidates in 1995. He was touted as a possible opponent of Bill Clinton in the 1996 U.S. presidential election, possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in Iowa and even leading New Hampshire polls for the GOP nomination, but Powell declined, citing a lack of passion for politics. Powell defeated Clinton 50–38 in a hypothetical match-up proposed to voters in the exit polls conducted on Election Day. Despite not standing in the race, Powell won the Republican New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary on write-in votes.

In 1997, Powell founded America&#x27;s Promise with the objective of helping children from all socioeconomic sectors. That same year saw the establishment of The Colin L. Powell Center for Leadership and Service. The mission of the center is to &quot;prepare new generations of publicly engaged leaders from populations previously underrepresented in public service and policy circles, to build a strong culture of civic engagement at City College, and to mobilize campus resources to meet pressing community needs and serve the public good&quot;.

Powell was mentioned as a potential candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, but again decided against running. Once Texas Governor George W. Bush secured the Republican nomination, Powell endorsed him for president and spoke at the 2000 Republican National Convention. Bush won the general election and appointed Powell as secretary of state in 2001.

In the electoral college vote count of 2016, Powell received three votes for president from faithless electors from the state of Washington.

==Secretary of State (2001–2005)==

President-elect George W. Bush named Powell as his nominee to be secretary of state in a ceremony at his ranch in Crawford, Texas on 16 December 2000. This made Powell the first person to formally accept a Cabinet post in the Bush administration, as well the first black United States secretary of state. As secretary of state, Powell was perceived as moderate. Powell was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate by voice vote on 20 January 2001, and ceremonially sworn in on 26 January. Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S. Secretary of State in thirty years. This is partly attributed to a letter from former diplomat George F. Kennan, who advised Powell to focus on his duties as the president&#x27;s principal foreign policy advisor and avoid trips that risked undercutting the duties of the ambassadors.

On 11 September 2001, Powell was in Lima, Peru, meeting with president Alejandro Toledo and attending a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States. After the terror attacks that day, Powell&#x27;s job became of critical importance in managing the United States of America&#x27;s relationships with foreign countries to secure a stable coalition in the War on Terrorism.

===2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq===

Powell came under fire for his role in building the case for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. A 2004 report by the Iraq Survey Group concluded that the evidence that Powell offered to support the allegation that the Iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) was inaccurate. As early as 2000 on the day Powell was nominated to be Secretary of State he told the press &quot;Saddam is sitting on a failed regime that is not going to be around in a few years time&quot;.

In a press statement on 24 February 2001, Powell had said that sanctions against Iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein. Powell favored involving the international community in the invasion, as opposed to a unilateral approach.


Powell&#x27;s chief role was to garner international support for a multi-national coalition to mount the invasion. To this end, Powell addressed a plenary session of the United Nations Security Council on 5 February 2003, to argue in favor of military action. Citing numerous anonymous Iraqi defectors, Powell asserted that &quot;there can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more&quot;. Powell also stated that there was &quot;no doubt in my mind&quot; that Saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons. Powell stated that he gave his speech to the UN on &quot;four days&#x27; notice&quot;.

 Britain&#x27;s &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; reported soon afterwards that a British intelligence dossier that Powell had referred to as a &quot;fine paper&quot; during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by American graduate student Ibrahim al-Marashi.

A Senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in Powell&#x27;s speech. State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery. The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence, particularly that which was single-sourced to the informant known as Curveball. Powell later recounted how Vice President Dick Cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, &quot;You&#x27;ve got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points&quot;. Powell&#x27;s longtime aide-de-camp and Chief of Staff from 1989 to 2003, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, later characterized Cheney&#x27;s view of Powell&#x27;s mission as to &quot;go up there and sell it, and we&#x27;ll have moved forward a peg or two. Fall on your damn sword and kill yourself, and I&#x27;ll be happy, too&quot;.

In September 2005, Powell was asked about the speech during an interview with Barbara Walters and responded that it was a &quot;blot&quot; on his record. He went on to say, &quot;It will always be a part of my record. It was painful. It&#x27;s painful now&quot;.

Wilkerson later said that he inadvertently participated in a hoax on the American people in preparing Powell&#x27;s erroneous testimony before the United Nations Security Council.

As recounted in &quot;Soldier: The Life of Colin Powell&quot;, in 2001 before 9/11, Richard A. Clarke, a National Security Council holdover from the Clinton administration, pushed the new Bush administration for action against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, a move opposed by Paul Wolfowitz who advocated for the creation of a &quot;U.S.-protected, opposition-run &#x27;liberated&#x27; enclave around the southern Iraqi city of Basra&quot;. Powell referred to Wolfowitz and other top members of Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s staff &quot;as the &#x27;JINSA crowd,&#x27; &quot; in reference to the pro-Israel Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. Again invoking &quot;the JINSA crowd&quot; Powell also attributed the decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003 to the neoconservative belief that regime change in Baghdad &quot;was a first and necessary stop on the road to peace in Jerusalem&quot;.

A review of &quot;Soldier&quot; by Tim Rutten criticized Powell&#x27;s remarks as a &quot;blot on his record&quot;, accusing Powell of slandering &quot;neoconservatives in the Defense Department – nearly all of them Jews&quot; with &quot;old and wholly unmeritorious allegations of dual loyalty&quot;. A 2007 article about fears that Jewish groups &quot;will be accused of driving America into a war with the regime in Tehran&quot; cited the DeYoung biography and quoted JINSA&#x27;s then-executive director, Thomas Neumann, as &quot;surprised&quot; Powell &quot;would single out a Jewish group when naming those who supported the war&quot;. Neumann said, &quot;I am not accusing Powell of anything, but these are words that the antisemites will use in the future&quot;.

Once Saddam Hussein had been deposed, Powell&#x27;s renewed role was to once again establish a working international coalition, this time to assist in the rebuilding of post-war Iraq. On 13 September 2004, Powell testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his February 2003 UN presentation were &quot;wrong&quot; and that it was &quot;unlikely&quot; that any stockpiles of WMDs would be found. Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, Powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community, including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that &quot;what one person knew, everyone else knew&quot;.

===Other foreign policy issues===
Additionally, Powell was critical of other aspects of U.S. foreign policy in the past, such as its support for the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état that deposed the democratically elected president Salvador Allende in favor of Augusto Pinochet. From two separate interviews in 2003, Powell stated in one about the 1973 event: &quot;I can&#x27;t justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time. It was a different time. There was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world. Communism was a threat to the democracies in this part of the world. It was a threat to the United States&quot;. In another interview, he also simply stated: &quot;With respect to your earlier comment about Chile in the 1970s and what happened with Mr. Allende, it is not a part of American history that we&#x27;re proud of.&quot;
In the Hainan Island incident of 1 April 2001, a United States US EP-3 surveillance aircraft collided mid-air with a Chinese Shenyang J-8 jet fighter over the South China Sea. While somewhat ambiguous, Powell&#x27;s expression of &quot;very sorry&quot; was accepted as sufficient for the formal apology that China had sought. The incident was nonetheless a serious flare-up in United States-China relations and created negative feelings towards the United States by the Chinese public and increased public feelings of Chinese nationalism.

In September 2004, Powell described the Darfur genocide as &quot;genocide&quot;, thus becoming the first cabinet member to apply the term &quot;genocide&quot; to events in an ongoing conflict.
In November the president &quot;forced Powell to resign&quot;, according to Walter LaFeber. Powell announced his resignation as Secretary of State on 15 November 2004, shortly after Bush was reelected. Bush&#x27;s desire for Powell to resign was communicated to Powell via a phone call by Bush&#x27;s chief of staff, Andrew Card. The following day, Bush nominated National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice as Powell&#x27;s successor.

In mid-November, Powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that Iran was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system. The accusation came at the same time as the settlement of an agreement between Iran, the IAEA, and the European Union.

Although biographer Jeffrey J. Matthews is highly critical of how Powell misled the United Nations Security Council regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, he credits Powell with a series of achievements at the State Department. These include restoration of morale to psychologically demoralized professional diplomats, leadership of the international HIV/AIDS initiative, resolving a crisis with China, and blocking efforts to tie Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the United States.

==Life after diplomatic service==
After retiring from the role of Secretary of State, Powell returned to private life. In April 2005, he was privately telephoned by Republican senators Lincoln Chafee and Chuck Hagel, at which time Powell expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of John Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations, but refrained from advising the senators to oppose Bolton (Powell had clashed with Bolton during Bush&#x27;s first term). The decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to Bolton&#x27;s chances of confirmation. Bolton was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the Senate.
On 28 April 2005, an opinion piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot; by Sidney Blumenthal (a former top aide to President Bill Clinton) claimed that Powell was in fact &quot;conducting a campaign&quot; against Bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together, which among other things had resulted in Powell cutting Bolton out of talks with Iran and Libya after complaints about Bolton&#x27;s involvement from the British. Blumenthal added that &quot;The foreign relations committee has discovered that Bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to 10 intercepts by the National Security Agency. Staff members on the committee believe that Bolton was probably spying on Powell, his senior advisors and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that Bolton opposed&quot;.

In September 2005, Powell criticized the response to Hurricane Katrina, and said thousands of people were not properly protected because they were poor, rather than because they were black.
On 5 January 2006, he participated in a meeting at the White House of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. In September 2006, Powell sided with more moderate Senate Republicans in supporting more rights for detainees and opposing President Bush&#x27;s terrorism bill. He backed Senators John Warner, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham in their statement that U.S. military and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the U.S. in the name of fighting terrorism. Powell stated that &quot;The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism&quot;.

In 2007, he joined the board of directors of Steve Case&#x27;s new company Revolution Health. Powell also served on the Council on Foreign Relations Board of directors. In 2008, Powell served as a spokesperson for National Mentoring Month, a campaign held each January to recruit volunteer mentors for at-risk youth. Soon after Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 election, Powell began being mentioned as a possible cabinet member. He was not nominated. In September 2009, Powell advised President Obama against surging U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The president announced the surge the following December.

In 2010, Powell joined the Smithsonian advisory council. Together with his wife, Alma Powell, they are the founding donors who offer their support to the museum&#x27;s capital campaign and Living History campaign. He was an advocate for the National Museum of African American History and Culture. In March 2014, Salesforce.com announced that Powell had joined its board of directors.

==Political positions==
During his early political career through his tenure within the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell was an independent. Powell was a moderate Republican from 1995 until 2021. In 2021, Powell recanted his status as a Republican following the storming of the United States Capitol on 6 January. The attack moved Powell to call for President Trump&#x27;s resignation, noting: &quot;I wish he would do what Nixon did and just step down. Somebody ought to go up to him and it&#x27;s over&quot;. Powell also accused Trump of attempting to &quot;overthrow the government&quot;, and that Trump&#x27;s false claims of a stolen election were &quot;dangerous for our democracy&quot;. Powell was pro-choice regarding abortion, and expressed some support for an assault weapons ban. He stated in his autobiography that he supported affirmative action that levels the playing field, without giving a leg up to undeserving persons because of racial issues. Powell originally suggested the don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy to President Clinton, though he later supported its repeal as proposed by Robert Gates and Admiral Mike Mullen in January 2010, saying &quot;circumstances had changed&quot;. 

Powell gained attention in 2004 when, in a conversation with British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, he reportedly referred to neoconservatives within the Bush administration as &quot;fucking crazies&quot;.

In a September 2006 letter to John McCain, Powell expressed opposition to President Bush&#x27;s push for military tribunals of those formerly and currently classified as enemy combatants. Specifically, he objected to the effort in Congress to &quot;redefine Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention&quot;. He also asserted: &quot;The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism&quot;.

===Defending the Iraq War===
At the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, Powell stated that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to President Bush &quot;the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers&quot;. During this discussion, he insisted that the U.S. appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: &quot;I also had to say to him that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn&#x27;t working and we don&#x27;t think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I&#x27;m with you, I support you&quot;.

In a 2008 interview on CNN, Powell reiterated his support for the 2003 decision to invade Iraq in the context of his endorsement of Barack Obama, stating: &quot;My role has been very, very straightforward. I wanted to avoid a war. The president [Bush] agreed with me. We tried to do that. We couldn&#x27;t get it through the U.N. and when the president made the decision, I supported that decision. And I&#x27;ve never blinked from that. I&#x27;ve never said I didn&#x27;t support a decision to go to war&quot;.

Powell&#x27;s position on the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 was less consistent. In December 2006, he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the U.S. military had enough troops to carry it out successfully. He stated: &quot;I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work&quot;. Following his endorsement of Barack Obama in October 2008, however, Powell praised General David Petraeus and U.S. troops, as well as the Iraqi government, concluding that &quot;it&#x27;s starting to turn around&quot;. By mid-2009, he had concluded a surge of U.S. forces in Iraq should have come sooner, perhaps in late 2003.

===Endorsement of Barack Obama===
Powell donated the maximum allowable amount to John McCain&#x27;s campaign in the summer of 2007 and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain&#x27;s bid during the 2008 U.S. presidential election.

McCain won the Republican presidential nomination, but the Democrats nominated the first black candidate, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. On 19 October 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Obama during a &quot;Meet the Press&quot; interview, citing &quot;his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities&quot;, in addition to his &quot;style and substance&quot;. He additionally referred to Obama as a &quot;transformational figure&quot;. Powell further questioned McCain&#x27;s judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that despite the fact that she is admired, &quot;now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don&#x27;t believe she&#x27;s ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president&quot;. He said that Obama&#x27;s choice for vice president, Joe Biden, was ready to be president. He also added that he was &quot;troubled&quot; by the &quot;false intimations that Obama was Muslim&quot;. Powell stated that &quot;[Obama] is a Christianhe&#x27;s always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer&#x27;s no, that&#x27;s not America&quot;. Powell then mentioned Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan, a Muslim American soldier in the U.S. Army who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, &quot;Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me&quot;. Powell concluded his Sunday morning talk show comments with &quot;It isn&#x27;t easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and I regret that [...] I think we need a transformational figure. I think we need a president who is a generational change and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen. John McCain&quot;. Later in a 12 December 2008, CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign, Palin pushed the Republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it.

When asked why he was still a Republican on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; he said, &quot;I&#x27;m still a Republican. And I think the Republican Party needs me more than the Democratic Party needs me. And you can be a Republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration, and improving our education system, and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything inconsistent with this&quot;.

===Views on the Obama administration===
In a July 2009 CNN interview with John King, Powell expressed concern over President Obama increasing the size of the federal government and the size of the federal budget deficit. In September 2010, he criticized the Obama administration for not focusing &quot;like a razor blade&quot; on the economy and job creation. Powell reiterated that Obama was a &quot;transformational figure&quot;. In a video that aired on CNN.com in November 2011, Colin Powell said in reference to Barack Obama, &quot;many of his decisions have been quite sound. The financial system was put back on a stable basis&quot;.

On 25 October 2012, 12 days before the presidential election, he gave his endorsement to President Obama for re-election during a broadcast of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;. He considered the administration to have had success and achieved progress in foreign and domestic policy arenas. As additional reasons for his endorsement, Powell cited the changing positions and perceived lack of thoughtfulness of Mitt Romney on foreign affairs, and a concern for the validity of Romney&#x27;s economic plans.

In an interview with ABC&#x27;s Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos during ABC&#x27;s coverage of President Obama&#x27;s second inauguration, Powell criticized members of the Republican Party who spread &quot;things that demonize the president&quot;. He called on GOP leaders to publicly denounce such talk.

===2016 e-mail leaks and criticism of Donald Trump===
Powell was very vocal on the state of the Republican Party. Speaking at a Washington Ideas forum in early October 2015, he warned the audience that the Republican Party had begun a move to the fringe right, lessening the chances of a Republican White House in the future. He also remarked on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&#x27;s statements regarding immigrants, noting that there were many immigrants working in Trump hotels.

In March 2016, Powell denounced the &quot;nastiness&quot; of the 2016 Republican primaries during an interview on CBS &quot;This Morning&quot;. He compared the race to reality television, and stated that the campaign had gone &quot;into the mud&quot;.

In August 2016, Powell accused the Hillary Clinton campaign of trying to pin her email controversy on him. Speaking to &quot;People&quot; magazine, Powell said, &quot;The truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did&quot;.

On 13 September 2016, emails were obtained that revealed Powell&#x27;s private communications regarding both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Powell privately reiterated his comments regarding Clinton&#x27;s email scandal, writing, &quot;I have told Hillary&#x27;s minions repeatedly that they are making a mistake trying to drag me in, yet they still try&quot;, and complaining that &quot;Hillary&#x27;s mafia keeps trying to suck me into it&quot; in another email. In another email discussing Clinton&#x27;s controversy, Powell said she should have told everyone what she did &quot;two years ago&quot;, and said that she has not &quot;been covering herself with glory&quot;. Writing on the 2012 Benghazi attack controversy surrounding Clinton, Powell said to then U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice, &quot;Benghazi is a stupid witch hunt&quot;. Commenting on Clinton in a general sense, he mused that &quot;Everything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris&quot;, and in another email stated &quot;I would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect&quot;.

Powell called Donald Trump a &quot;national disgrace&quot;, with &quot;no sense of shame&quot;. He wrote of Trump&#x27;s role in the birther movement, which he called &quot;racist&quot;. He suggested the media ignore Trump: &quot;To go on and call him an idiot just emboldens him&quot;. The emails were obtained by the media as the result of a hack.

Powell endorsed Clinton on 25 October 2016, stating it was &quot;because I think she&#x27;s qualified, and the other gentleman is not qualified&quot;.

Despite not running in the election, Powell received three electoral votes for president from faithless electors in Washington who had pledged to vote for Clinton, coming in third overall. After Barack Obama, he was the second black person to receive electoral votes in a presidential election.

===Views on the Trump administration===
In an interview in October 2019, Powell warned that the GOP needed to &quot;get a grip&quot; and put the country before their party, standing up to then-president Trump rather than worrying about political fallout. He said: &quot;When they see things that are not right, they need to say something about it because our foreign policy is in shambles right now, in my humble judgment, and I see things happening that are hard to understand&quot;. On 7 June 2020, Powell announced he would be voting for former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election. In August, Powell delivered a speech in support of Biden&#x27;s candidacy at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

In January 2021, after the Capitol building was attacked by Trump supporters, Powell told CNN: &quot;I can no longer call myself a fellow Republican&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Powell married Alma Johnson on 25 August 1962. Their son, Michael Powell, was the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from 2001 to 2005. Their daughters are Linda Powell, an actress, and Annemarie Powell. Alma died in 2024. 

As a hobby, Powell restored old Volvo and Saab automobiles. In 2013, he faced questions about his relationship with the Romanian diplomat Corina Crețu, after a hacked AOL email account had been made public. He acknowledged a &quot;very personal&quot; email relationship but denied further involvement. He was an Episcopalian.
On 18 October 2021, Powell, who was being treated for multiple myeloma, died at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center of complications from COVID-19 at the age of 84. He had been vaccinated, but his myeloma compromised his immune system; he also had early-stage Parkinson&#x27;s disease. President Joe Biden and four of the five living former presidents issued statements calling Powell an American hero. Then-former president Donald Trump released a statement saying &quot;He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!&quot; and referred to him as a &quot;classic RINO&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrison_10/18/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Present at the funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral were President Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, along with First Lady Jill Biden and former first ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, and Hillary Clinton (also representing her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who was unable to attend following treatment for sepsis) as well as many other dignitaries.

Powell is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Section 60, Grave 11917.

<doc id="6985" wikidata="Q43177" url="?curid=6985" title="Chlorophyll">
<text>Chlorophyll is any of several related green pigments found in cyanobacteria and in the chloroplasts of algae and plants. Its name is derived from the Greek words (, &quot;pale green&quot;) and (, &quot;leaf&quot;). Chlorophyll allows plants to absorb energy from light. Those pigments are involved in oxygenic photosynthesis, as opposed to bacteriochlorophylls, related molecules found only in bacteria and involved in anoxygenic photosynthesis.

Chlorophylls absorb light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum as well as the red portion. Conversely, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum. Hence chlorophyll-containing tissues appear green because green light, diffusively reflected by structures like cell walls, is less absorbed. Two types of chlorophyll exist in the photosystems of green plants: chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

==History==
Chlorophyll was first isolated and named by Joseph Bienaimé Caventou and Pierre Joseph Pelletier in 1817.
The presence of magnesium in chlorophyll was discovered in 1906, and was the first detection of that element in living tissue.

After initial work done by German chemist Richard Willstätter spanning from 1905 to 1915, the general structure of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; was elucidated by Hans Fischer in 1940. By 1960, when most of the stereochemistry of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; was known, Robert Burns Woodward published a total synthesis of the molecule. In 1967, the last remaining stereochemical elucidation was completed by Ian Fleming, and in 1990 Woodward and co-authors published an updated synthesis. Chlorophyll &quot;f&quot; was announced to be present in cyanobacteria and other oxygenic microorganisms that form stromatolites in 2010; a molecular formula of C55H70O6N4Mg and a structure of (2-formyl)-chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; were deduced based on NMR, optical and mass spectra.

==Photosynthesis==

Chlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis, which allows plants to absorb energy from light.

Chlorophyll molecules are arranged in and around photosystems that are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. In these complexes, chlorophyll serves three functions:
# The function of the vast majority of chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light.
# Having done so, these same centers execute their second function: The transfer of that energy by resonance energy transfer to a specific chlorophyll pair in the reaction center of the photosystems.
# This specific pair performs the final function of chlorophylls: Charge separation, which produces the unbound protons (H) and electrons (e) that separately propel biosynthesis.

The two currently accepted photosystem units are and which have their own distinct reaction centres, named P700 and P680, respectively. These centres are named after the wavelength (in nanometers) of their red-peak absorption maximum. The identity, function and spectral properties of the types of chlorophyll in each photosystem are distinct and determined by each other and the protein structure surrounding them.

The function of the reaction center of chlorophyll is to absorb light energy and transfer it to other parts of the photosystem. The absorbed energy of the photon is transferred to an electron in a process called charge separation. The removal of the electron from the chlorophyll is an oxidation reaction. The chlorophyll donates the high energy electron to a series of molecular intermediates called an electron transport chain. The charged reaction center of chlorophyll (P680+) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron stripped from water. The electron that reduces P680+ ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into O2 and H+ through several intermediates. This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms such as plants produce O2 gas, and is the source for practically all the O2 in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II; thus the P700+ of Photosystem I is usually reduced as it accepts the electron, via many intermediates in the thylakoid membrane, by electrons coming, ultimately, from Photosystem II. Electron transfer reactions in the thylakoid membranes are complex, however, and the source of electrons used to reduce P700+ can vary.

The electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorophyll pigments is used to pump H+ ions across the thylakoid membrane, setting up a proton-motive force a chemiosmotic potential used mainly in the production of ATP (stored chemical energy) or to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. NADPH is a universal agent used to reduce CO2 into sugars as well as other biosynthetic reactions.

Reaction center chlorophyll–protein complexes are capable of directly absorbing light and performing charge separation events without the assistance of other chlorophyll pigments, but the probability of that happening under a given light intensity is small. Thus, the other chlorophylls in the photosystem and antenna pigment proteins all cooperatively absorb and funnel light energy to the reaction center. Besides chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;, there are other pigments, called accessory pigments, which occur in these pigment–protein antenna complexes.

==Chemical structure==

Several chlorophylls are known. All are defined as derivatives of the parent chlorin by the presence of a fifth, ketone-containing ring beyond the four pyrrole-like rings. Most chlorophylls are classified as chlorins, which are reduced relatives of porphyrins (found in hemoglobin). They share a common biosynthetic pathway with porphyrins, including the precursor uroporphyrinogen III. Unlike hemes, which contain iron bound to the N4 center, most chlorophylls bind magnesium. The axial ligands attached to the Mg2+ center are often omitted for clarity. Appended to the chlorin ring are various side chains, usually including a long phytyl chain (). The most widely distributed form in terrestrial plants is chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;. Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; has methyl group in place of a formyl group in chlorophyll &quot;b&quot;. This difference affects the absorption spectrum, allowing plants to absorb a greater portion of visible light.

The structures of chlorophylls are summarized below:


Chlorophyll &quot;e&quot; is reserved for a pigment that has been extracted from algae in 1966 but not chemically described. Besides the lettered chlorophylls, a wide variety of sidechain modifications to the chlorophyll structures are known in the wild. For example, &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot;, a cyanobacterium, uses 8-vinyl Chl &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

==Measurement of chlorophyll content==

Chlorophylls can be extracted from the protein into organic solvents. In this way, the concentration of chlorophyll within a leaf can be estimated. Methods also exist to separate chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; and chlorophyll &quot;b&quot;.

In diethyl ether, chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; has approximate absorbance maxima of 430 nm and 662 nm, while chlorophyll &quot;b&quot; has approximate maxima of 453 nm and 642 nm. The absorption peaks of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; are at 465 nm and 665 nm. Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; fluoresces at 673 nm (maximum) and 726 nm. The peak molar absorption coefficient of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; exceeds 105 M−1 cm−1, which is among the highest for small-molecule organic compounds. In 90% acetone-water, the peak absorption wavelengths of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; are 430 nm and 664 nm; peaks for chlorophyll &quot;b&quot; are 460 nm and 647 nm; peaks for chlorophyll &quot;c1&quot; are 442 nm and 630 nm; peaks for chlorophyll &quot;c2&quot; are 444 nm and 630 nm; peaks for chlorophyll &quot;d&quot; are 401 nm, 455 nm and 696 nm.

Ratio fluorescence emission can be used to measure chlorophyll content. By exciting chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; fluorescence at a lower wavelength, the ratio of chlorophyll fluorescence emission at and can provide a linear relationship of chlorophyll content when compared with chemical testing. The ratio &quot;F&quot;735/&quot;F&quot;700 provided a correlation value of &quot;r&quot;2 0.96 compared with chemical testing in the range from 41 mg m−2 up to 675 mg m−2. Gitelson also developed a formula for direct readout of chlorophyll content in mg m−2. The formula provided a reliable method of measuring chlorophyll content from 41 mg m−2 up to 675 mg m−2 with a correlation &quot;r&quot;2 value of 0.95.

Also, the chlorophyll concentration can be estimated by measuring the light transmittance through the plant leaves. The assessment of leaf chlorophyll content using optical sensors such as Dualex and SPAD allows researchers to perform real-time and non-destructive measurements. Research shows that these methods have a positive correlation with laboratory measurements of chlorophyll.

==Biosynthesis==

In some plants, chlorophyll is derived from glutamate and is synthesised along a branched biosynthetic pathway that is shared with heme and siroheme.
Chlorophyll synthase is the enzyme that completes the biosynthesis of chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;:
:chlorophyllide &quot;a&quot; + phytyl diphosphate formula_1 chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; + diphosphate
This conversion forms an ester of the carboxylic acid group in chlorophyllide &quot;a&quot; with the 20-carbon diterpene alcohol phytol. Chlorophyll &quot;b&quot; is made by the same enzyme acting on chlorophyllide &quot;b&quot;. The same is known for chlorophyll &quot;d&quot; and &quot;f&quot;, both made from corresponding chlorophyllides ultimately made from chlorophyllide &quot;a&quot;.

In Angiosperm plants, the later steps in the biosynthetic pathway are light-dependent. Such plants are pale (etiolated) if grown in darkness. Non-vascular plants and green algae have an additional light-independent enzyme and grow green even in darkness.

Chlorophyll is bound to proteins. Protochlorophyllide, one of the biosynthetic intermediates, occurs mostly in the free form and, under light conditions, acts as a photosensitizer, forming free radicals, which can be toxic to the plant. Hence, plants regulate the amount of this chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this regulation is achieved at the step of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthesis pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide; so do the mutants with a damaged regulatory system.

==Senescence and the chlorophyll cycle==
The process of plant senescence involves the degradation of chlorophyll: for example the enzyme chlorophyllase () hydrolyses the phytyl sidechain to reverse the reaction in which chlorophylls are biosynthesised from chlorophyllide &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;. Since chlorophyllide &quot;a&quot; can be converted to chlorophyllide &quot;b&quot; and the latter can be re-esterified to chlorophyll &quot;b&quot;, these processes allow cycling between chlorophylls &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Moreover, chlorophyll &quot;b&quot; can be directly reduced (via ) back to chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;, completing the cycle.
In later stages of senescence, chlorophyllides are converted to a group of colourless tetrapyrroles known as nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (NCC&#x27;s) with the general structure:
These compounds have also been identified in ripening fruits and they give characteristic autumn colours to deciduous plants.

==Distribution==
Chlorophyll maps from 2002 to 2024, provided by NASA, show milligrams of chlorophyll per cubic meter of seawater each month. Places where chlorophyll amounts are very low, indicating very low numbers of phytoplankton, are blue. Places where chlorophyll concentrations are high, meaning many phytoplankton were growing, are yellow. The observations come from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA&#x27;s Aqua satellite. Land is dark gray, and places where MODIS could not collect data because of sea ice, polar darkness, or clouds are light gray. The highest chlorophyll concentrations, where tiny surface-dwelling ocean plants are, are in cold polar waters or in places where ocean currents bring cold water to the surface, such as around the equator and along the shores of continents. It is not the cold water itself that stimulates the phytoplankton. Instead, the cool temperatures are often a sign that the water has welled up to the surface from deeper in the ocean, carrying nutrients that have built up over time. In polar waters, nutrients accumulate in surface waters during the dark winter months when plants cannot grow. When sunlight returns in the spring and summer, the plants flourish in high concentrations.

==Uses==
=== Culinary ===
Synthetic chlorophyll is registered as a food additive colorant, and its E number is E140. Chefs use chlorophyll to color a variety of foods and beverages green, such as pasta and spirits. Absinthe gains its green color naturally from the chlorophyll introduced through the large variety of herbs used in its production. Chlorophyll is not soluble in water, and it is first mixed with a small quantity of vegetable oil to obtain the desired solution.

===In marketing===
In years 1950–1953 in particular, chlorophyll was used as a marketing tool to promote toothpaste, sanitary towels, soap and other products. This was based on claims that it was an odor blocker — a finding from research by F. Howard Westcott in the 1940s — and the commercial value of this attribute in advertising led to many companies creating brands containing the compound. However, it was soon determined that the hype surrounding chlorophyll was not warranted and the underlying research may even have been a hoax. As a result, brands rapidly discontinued its use. In the 2020s, chlorophyll again became the subject of unsubstantiated medical claims, as social media influencers promoted its use in the form of &quot;chlorophyll water&quot;, for example.

<doc id="6986" wikidata="Q190156" url="?curid=6986" title="Carotene">
<text>The term carotene (also carotin, from the Latin &quot;carota&quot;, &quot;carrot&quot;) is used for many related unsaturated hydrocarbon substances having the formula C40Hx, which are synthesized by plants but in general cannot be made by animals (with the exception of some aphids and spider mites which acquired the synthesizing genes from fungi). Carotenes are photosynthetic pigments important for photosynthesis.

Carotenes contain no oxygen atoms. They absorb ultraviolet, violet, and blue light and scatter orange or red light, and yellow light(in low concentrations).

Carotenes are responsible for the orange colour of the carrot, after which this class of chemicals is named, and for the colours of many other fruits, vegetables and fungi (for example, sweet potatoes, chanterelle and orange cantaloupe melon). Carotenes are also responsible for the orange (but not all of the yellow) colours in dry foliage. They also (in lower concentrations) impart the yellow coloration to milk-fat and butter. Omnivorous animal species which are relatively poor converters of coloured dietary carotenoids to colourless retinoids, such as humans and chickens, have yellow-coloured body fat, as a result of the carotenoid retention from the vegetable portion of their diet.

Carotenes contribute to photosynthesis by transmitting the light energy they absorb to chlorophyll. They also protect plant tissues by helping to absorb the energy from singlet oxygen, an excited form of the oxygen molecule O2 which is formed during photosynthesis.

β-Carotene is composed of two retinyl groups, and is broken down in the mucosa of the human small intestine by β-carotene 15,15&#x27;-monooxygenase to retinal, a form of vitamin A. β-Carotene can be stored in the liver and body fat and converted to retinal as needed, thus making it a form of vitamin A for humans and some other mammals. The carotenes α-carotene and γ-carotene, due to their single retinyl group (β-ionone ring), also have some vitamin A activity (though less than β-carotene), as does the xanthophyll carotenoid β-cryptoxanthin. All other carotenoids, including lycopene, have no beta-ring and thus no vitamin A activity (although they may have antioxidant activity and thus biological activity in other ways).

Animal species differ greatly in their ability to convert retinyl (beta-ionone) containing carotenoids to retinals. Carnivores in general are poor converters of dietary ionone-containing carotenoids. Pure carnivores such as ferrets lack β-carotene 15,15&#x27;-monooxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinals at all (resulting in carotenes not being a form of vitamin A for this species); while cats can convert a trace of β-carotene to retinol, although the amount is totally insufficient for meeting their daily retinol needs.

==Molecular structure==
Carotenes are polyunsaturated hydrocarbons containing 40 carbon atoms per molecule, variable numbers of hydrogen atoms, and no other elements. Some carotenes are terminated by rings, on one or both ends of the molecule. All are coloured, due to the presence of conjugated double bonds. Carotenes are tetraterpenes, meaning that they are derived from eight 5-carbon isoprene units (or four 10-carbon terpene units).

Carotenes are found in plants in two primary forms designated by characters from the Greek alphabet: alpha-carotene (α-carotene) and beta-carotene (β-carotene). Gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, and zeta-carotene (γ, δ, ε, and ζ-carotene) also exist. Since they are hydrocarbons, and therefore contain no oxygen, carotenes are fat-soluble and insoluble in water (in contrast with other carotenoids, the xanthophylls, which contain oxygen and thus are less chemically hydrophobic).

==History==

The discovery of carotene from carrot juice is credited to Heinrich Wilhelm Ferdinand Wackenroder, a finding made during a search for antihelminthics, which he published in 1831. He obtained it in small ruby-red flakes soluble in ether, which when dissolved in fats gave &quot;a beautiful yellow colour&quot;. William Christopher Zeise recognised its hydrocarbon nature in 1847, but his analyses gave him a composition of C5H8. It was Léon-Albert Arnaud in 1886 who confirmed its hydrocarbon nature and gave the formula C26H38, which is close to the theoretical composition of C40H56. Adolf Lieben in studies, also published in 1886, of the colouring matter in corpora lutea, first came across carotenoids in animal tissue, but did not recognise the nature of the pigment. Johann Ludwig Wilhelm Thudichum, in 1868–1869, after stereoscopic spectral examination, applied the term &#x27;luteine&#x27; (lutein) to this class of yellow crystallizable substances found in animals and plants. Richard Martin Willstätter, who gained the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1915, mainly for his work on chlorophyll, assigned the composition of C40H56, distinguishing it from the similar but oxygenated xanthophyll, C40H56O2. With Heinrich Escher, in 1910, lycopene was isolated from tomatoes and shown to be an isomer of carotene. Later work by Escher also differentiated the &#x27;luteal&#x27; pigments in egg yolk from that of the carotenes in cow corpus luteum.

==Dietary sources==
The following foods contain carotenes in notable amounts:

*carrots
*wolfberries (goji)
*cantaloupe
*mangoes
*red bell pepper 
*papaya
*spinach
*kale
*sweet potato
*tomato
*dandelion greens
*broccoli
*collard greens
*winter squash
*pumpkin
*cassava

Absorption from these foods is enhanced if eaten with fats, as carotenes are fat soluble, and if the food is cooked for a few minutes until the plant cell wall splits and the color is released into any liquid. 12 μg of dietary β-carotene supplies the equivalent of 1 μg of retinol, and 24 μg of α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin provides the equivalent of 1 μg of retinol.

==Forms of carotene==

The two primary isomers of carotene, α-carotene and β-carotene, differ in the position of a double bond (and thus a hydrogen) in the cyclic group at one end (the right end in the diagram at right).

β-Carotene is the more common form and can be found in yellow, orange, and green leafy fruits and vegetables. As a rule of thumb, the greater the intensity of the orange colour of the fruit or vegetable, the more β-carotene it contains.

Carotene protects plant cells against the destructive effects of ultraviolet light so β-carotene is an antioxidant.

==β-Carotene and physiology==

===β-Carotene and cancer===
An article on the American Cancer Society says that The Cancer Research Campaign has called for warning labels on β-carotene supplements to caution smokers that such supplements may increase the risk of lung cancer.

The New England Journal of Medicine published an article in 1994 about a trial which examined the relationship between daily supplementation of β-carotene and vitamin E (α-tocopherol) and the incidence of lung cancer. The study was done using supplements and researchers were aware of the epidemiological correlation between carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables and lower lung cancer rates. The research concluded that no reduction in lung cancer was found in the participants using these supplements, and furthermore, these supplements may, in fact, have harmful effects.

The Journal of the National Cancer Institute and The New England Journal of Medicine published articles in 1996 about a trial with a goal to determine if vitamin A (in the form of retinyl palmitate) and β-carotene (at about 30 mg/day, which is 10 times the Reference Daily Intake) supplements had any beneficial effects to prevent cancer. The results indicated an &quot;increased&quot; risk of lung and prostate cancers for the participants who consumed the β-carotene supplement and who had lung irritation from smoking or asbestos exposure, causing the trial to be stopped early.

A review of all randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature by the Cochrane Collaboration published in &quot;JAMA&quot; in 2007 found that synthetic β-carotene &quot;increased&quot; mortality by 1–8% (Relative Risk 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.08). However, this meta-analysis included two large studies of smokers, so it is not clear that the results apply to the general population. The review only studied the influence of synthetic antioxidants and the results should not be translated to potential effects of fruits and vegetables.

===β-Carotene and photosensitivity===
Oral β-carotene is prescribed to people suffering from erythropoietic protoporphyria. It provides them some relief from photosensitivity.

===Carotenemia===

Carotenemia or hypercarotenemia is excess carotene, but unlike excess vitamin A, carotene is non-toxic. Although hypercarotenemia is not particularly dangerous, it can lead to an oranging of the skin (carotenodermia), but not the conjunctiva of eyes (thus easily distinguishing it visually from jaundice). It is most commonly associated with consumption of an abundance of carrots, but it also can be a medical sign of more dangerous conditions.

==Production==

Carotenes are produced in a general manner for other terpenoids and terpenes, i.e. by coupling, cyclization, and oxygenation reactions of isoprene derivatives. Lycopene is the key precursor to carotenoids. It is formed by coupling of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and geranyllinally pyrophosphate.

Most of the world&#x27;s synthetic supply of carotene comes from a manufacturing complex located in Freeport, Texas and owned by DSM. The other major supplier BASF also uses a chemical process to produce β-carotene. Together these suppliers account for about 85% of the β-carotene on the market. In Spain Vitatene produces natural β-carotene from fungus &quot;Blakeslea trispora&quot;, as does DSM but at much lower amount when compared to its synthetic β-carotene operation. In Australia, organic β-carotene is produced by Aquacarotene Limited from dried marine algae &quot;Dunaliella salina&quot; grown in harvesting ponds situated in Karratha, Western Australia. BASF Australia is also producing β-carotene from microalgae grown in two sites in Australia that are the world&#x27;s largest algae farms. In Portugal, the industrial biotechnology company Biotrend is producing natural all-&quot;trans&quot;-β-carotene from a non-genetically modified bacteria of the genus &quot;Sphingomonas&quot; isolated from soil.

Carotenes are also found in palm oil, corn, and in the milk of dairy cows, causing cow&#x27;s milk to be light yellow, depending on the feed of the cattle, and the amount of fat in the milk (high-fat milks, such as those produced by Guernsey cows, tend to be yellower because their fat content causes them to contain more carotene).

Carotenes are also found in some species of termites, where they apparently have been picked up from the diet of the insects.

===Synthesis===
There are currently two commonly used methods of total synthesis of β-carotene. The first was developed by BASF and is based on the Wittig reaction with Wittig himself as patent holder:

The second is a Grignard reaction, elaborated by Hoffman-La Roche from the original synthesis of Inhoffen et al. They are both symmetrical; the BASF synthesis is C20 + C20, and the Hoffman-La Roche synthesis is C19 + C2 + C19.

==Nomenclature==
Carotenes are carotenoids containing no oxygen. Carotenoids containing some oxygen are known as xanthophylls.

The two ends of the β-carotene molecule are structurally identical, and are called β-rings. Specifically, the group of nine carbon atoms at each end form a β-ring.

The α-carotene molecule has a β-ring at one end; the other end is called an ε-ring. There is no such thing as an &quot;α-ring&quot;.

These and similar names for the ends of the carotenoid molecules form the basis of a systematic naming scheme, according to which:
* α-carotene is β,ε-carotene;
* β-carotene is β,β-carotene;
* γ-carotene (with one β ring and one uncyclized end that is labelled &quot;psi&quot;) is β,ψ-carotene;
* δ-carotene (with one ε ring and one uncyclized end) is ε,ψ-carotene;
* ε-carotene is ε,ε-carotene
* lycopene is ψ,ψ-carotene

ζ-Carotene is the biosynthetic precursor of neurosporene, which is the precursor of lycopene, which, in turn, is the precursor of the carotenes α through ε.

==Food additive==
Carotene is used to colour products such as juice, cakes, desserts, butter and margarine. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU (listed as additive E160a) Australia and New Zealand (listed as 160a) and the US.

<text>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, cyclic AMP, or 3&#x27;,5&#x27;-cyclic [[adenosine monophosphate]]) is a second messenger, or cellular signal occurring within cells, that is important in many biological processes. cAMP is a derivative of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and used for intracellular signal transduction in many different organisms, conveying the cAMP-dependent pathway.

==History==
Earl Sutherland of Vanderbilt University won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971 &quot;for his discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the action of hormones&quot;, especially epinephrine, via second messengers (such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cyclic AMP).

==Synthesis==
The synthesis of cAMP is stimulated by trophic hormones that bind to receptors on the cell surface. cAMP levels reach maximal levels within minutes and decrease gradually over an hour in cultured cells. 
Cyclic AMP is synthesized from ATP by adenylate cyclase located on the inner side of the plasma membrane and anchored at various locations in the interior of the cell. Adenylate cyclase is &quot;activated&quot; by a range of signaling molecules through the activation of adenylate cyclase stimulatory G (Gs)-protein-coupled receptors. Adenylate cyclase is &quot;inhibited&quot; by agonists of adenylate cyclase inhibitory G (Gi)-protein-coupled receptors. Liver adenylate cyclase responds more strongly to glucagon, and muscle adenylate cyclase responds more strongly to adrenaline.

cAMP decomposition into AMP is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphodiesterase.

==Functions==
cAMP is a second messenger, used for intracellular signal transduction, such as transferring into cells the effects of hormones like glucagon and adrenaline, which cannot pass through the plasma membrane. It is also involved in the activation of protein kinases. In addition, cAMP binds to and regulates the function of ion channels such as the HCN channels and a few other cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins such as Epac1 and RAPGEF2.

===Role in eukaryotic cells===
cAMP is associated with kinases function in several biochemical processes, including the regulation of glycogen, sugar, and lipid metabolism.

In eukaryotes, cyclic AMP works by activating protein kinase A (PKA, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase). PKA is normally inactive as a tetrameric holoenzyme, consisting of two catalytic and two regulatory units (C2R2), with the regulatory units blocking the catalytic centers of the catalytic units.

Cyclic AMP binds to specific locations on the regulatory units of the protein kinase, and causes dissociation between the regulatory and catalytic subunits, thus enabling those catalytic units to phosphorylate substrate proteins.

The active subunits catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues of protein substrates. The phosphorylated proteins may act directly on the cell&#x27;s ion channels, or may become activated or inhibited enzymes. Protein kinase A can also phosphorylate specific proteins that bind to promoter regions of DNA, causing increases in transcription. Not all protein kinases respond to cAMP. Several classes of protein kinases, including protein kinase C, are not cAMP-dependent.

Further effects mainly depend on cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which vary based on the type of cell.

Still, there are some minor PKA-independent functions of cAMP, e.g., activation of calcium channels, providing a minor pathway by which growth hormone-releasing hormone causes a release of growth hormone.

However, the view that the majority of the effects of cAMP are controlled by PKA is an outdated one. In 1998 a family of cAMP-sensitive proteins with guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity was discovered. These are termed Exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac) and the family comprises Epac1 and Epac2. The mechanism of activation is similar to that of PKA: the GEF domain is usually masked by the N-terminal region containing the cAMP binding domain. When cAMP binds, the domain dissociates and exposes the now-active GEF domain, allowing Epac to activate small Ras-like GTPase proteins, such as Rap1.

====Additional role of secreted cAMP in social amoebae====

In the species &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;, cAMP acts outside the cell as a secreted signal. The chemotactic aggregation of cells is organized by periodic waves of cAMP that propagate between cells over distances as large as several centimetres. The waves are the result of a regulated production and secretion of extracellular cAMP and a spontaneous biological oscillator that initiates the waves at centers of territories.

=== Role in bacteria ===
In bacteria, the level of cAMP varies depending on the medium used for growth. In particular, cAMP is low when glucose is the carbon source. This occurs through inhibition of the cAMP-producing enzyme, adenylate cyclase, as a side-effect of glucose transport into the cell. The transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP) also called CAP (catabolite gene activator protein) forms a complex with cAMP and thereby is activated to bind to DNA. CRP-cAMP increases expression of a large number of genes, including some encoding enzymes that can supply energy independent of glucose.

cAMP, for example, is involved in the positive regulation of the lac operon. In an environment with a low glucose concentration, cAMP accumulates and binds to the allosteric site on CRP (cAMP receptor protein), a transcription activator protein. The protein assumes its active shape and binds to a specific site upstream of the lac promoter, making it easier for RNA polymerase to bind to the adjacent promoter to start transcription of the lac operon, increasing the rate of lac operon transcription. With a high glucose concentration, the cAMP concentration decreases, and the CRP disengages from the lac operon.

==Pathology==
Since cyclic AMP is a second messenger and plays vital role in cell signalling, it has been implicated in various disorders but not restricted to the roles given below:

=== Role in human carcinoma ===
Some research has suggested that a deregulation of cAMP pathways and an aberrant activation of cAMP-controlled genes is linked to the growth of some cancers.

=== Role in prefrontal cortex disorders ===
Recent research suggests that cAMP affects the function of higher-order thinking in the prefrontal cortex through its regulation of ion channels called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN). When cAMP stimulates the HCN, the channels open, This research, especially the cognitive deficits in age-related illnesses and ADHD, is of interest to researchers studying the brain.

cAMP is involved in activation of trigeminocervical system leading to neurogenic inflammation and causing migraine. 

=== Role in infectious disease agents&#x27; pathogenesis ===
Disrupted functioning of cAMP has been noted as one of the mechanisms of several bacterial exotoxins. 

They can be subgrouped into two distinct categories:

* Toxins that interfere with enzymes ADP-ribosyl-transferases, and
* invasive adenylate cyclases.

==== ADP-ribosyl-transferases related toxins ====

* Cholera toxin is an AB toxin that has five B subunints and one A subunit. The toxin acts by the following mechanism: First, the B subunit ring of the cholera toxin binds to GM1 gangliosides on the surface of target cells. If a cell lacks GM1 the toxin most likely binds to other types of glycans, such as Lewis Y and Lewis X, attached to proteins instead of lipids.

== Uses ==
Forskolin is commonly used as a tool in biochemistry to raise levels of cAMP in the study and research of cell physiology.

<text>Giovanni Cimabue (; ), – 1302, was an Italian painter and designer of mosaics from Florence. He was also known as Cenni di Pepo or Cenni di Pepi.

Although heavily influenced by Byzantine models, Cimabue is generally regarded as one of the first great Italian painters to break from the Italo-Byzantine style. Compared with the norms of medieval art, his works have more lifelike figural proportions and a more sophisticated use of shading to suggest volume. According to Italian painter and historian Giorgio Vasari, Cimabue was the teacher of Giotto, the first great artist of the Italian Proto-Renaissance. However, many scholars today tend to discount Vasari&#x27;s claim by citing earlier sources that suggest otherwise.

==Life==

Little is known about Cimabue&#x27;s early life. One source that recounts his career is Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;, but its accuracy is uncertain. 
He was born in Florence and died in Pisa. Hayden Maginnis speculates that he could have trained in Florence under masters who were culturally connected to Byzantine art. The art historian Pietro Toesca attributed the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; in the church of San Domenico in Arezzo to Cimabue, dating around 1270, making it the earliest known attributed work that departs from the Byzantine style. Cimabue&#x27;s Christ is bent, and the clothes have the golden striations that were introduced by Coppo di Marcovaldo.

Around 1272, Cimabue is documented as being present in Rome, and a little later he made another &quot;Crucifix&quot; for the Florentine church of Santa Croce. Now restored, having been damaged by the 1966 Arno River flood, the work was larger and more advanced than the one in Arezzo, with traces of naturalism perhaps inspired by the works of Nicola Pisano.

According to Vasari, Cimabue, while travelling from Florence to Vespignano, came upon the 10-year-old Giotto (c. 1277) drawing his sheep with a rough rock upon a smooth stone. He asked if Giotto would like to come and stay with him, which the child accepted with his father&#x27;s permission. Vasari elaborates that during Giotto&#x27;s apprenticeship, he allegedly painted a fly on the nose of a portrait Cimabue was working on; the teacher attempted to sweep the fly away several times before he understood his pupil&#x27;s prank. Many scholars now discount Vasari&#x27;s claim that he took Giotto as his pupil, citing earlier sources that suggest otherwise.

Around 1280, Cimabue painted the &quot;Maestà&quot;, originally displayed in the church of San Francesco at Pisa, but now at the Louvre. This work established a style that was followed subsequently by numerous artists, including Duccio di Buoninsegna in his &quot;Rucellai Madonna&quot; (in the past, wrongly attributed to Cimabue) as well as Giotto. Other works from the period, which were said to have heavily influenced Giotto, include a &quot;Flagellation&quot; (Frick Collection), mosaics for the Baptistery of Florence (now largely restored), the &quot;Maestà&quot; at the Santa Maria dei Servi in Bologna and the &quot;Madonna&quot; in the Pinacoteca of Castelfiorentino. A workshop painting, perhaps assignable to a slightly later period, is the &quot;Maestà with Saints Francis and Dominic&quot; now in the Uffizi.

During the pontificate of Pope Nicholas IV, the first Franciscan pope, Cimabue worked in Assisi. At Assisi, in the transept of the Lower Basilica of San Francesco, he created a fresco named &quot;Madonna with Child Enthroned, Four Angels and St Francis&quot;. The left portion of this fresco is lost, but it may have shown St Anthony of Padua (the authorship of the painting has been recently disputed for technical and stylistic reasons). Cimabue was subsequently commissioned to decorate the apse and the transept of the Upper Basilica of Assisi, in the same period of time that Roman artists were decorating the nave. The cycle he created there comprises scenes from the Gospels, the lives of the Virgin Mary, St Peter and St Paul. The paintings are now in poor condition because of oxidation of the brighter colours that were used by the artist.

The &quot;Maestà of Santa Trinita&quot;, dated to c. 1290–1300, which was originally painted for the church of Santa Trinita in Florence, is now in the Uffizi Gallery. The softer expression of the characters suggests that it was influenced by Giotto, who was by then already active as a painter.

Cimabue spent the last period of his life, 1301 to 1302, in Pisa. There, he was commissioned to finish a mosaic of Christ Enthroned, originally begun by Maestro Francesco, in the apse of the city&#x27;s cathedral. Cimabue was to create the part of the mosaic depicting St John the Evangelist, which remains the sole surviving work documented as being by the artist. Cimabue died around 1302.

==Character==
According to Vasari, quoting a contemporary of Cimabue, &quot;Cimabue of Florence was a painter who lived during the author&#x27;s own time, a nobler man than anyone knew but he was as a result so haughty and proud that if someone pointed out to him any mistake or defect in his work, or if he had noted any himself... he would immediately destroy the work, no matter how precious it might be.&quot;

The nickname Cimabue translates as &quot;bull-head&quot; but also possibly as &quot;one who crushes the views of others&quot;, from the Italian verb &quot;cimare&quot;, meaning &quot;to top&quot;, &quot;to shear&quot;, and &quot;to blunt&quot;. The conclusion for the second meaning is drawn from similar commentaries on Dante, who was also known &quot;for being contemptuous of criticism&quot;.

==Legacy==
History has long regarded Cimabue as the last of an era that was overshadowed by the Italian Renaissance. As early as 1543, Vasari wrote of Cimabue, &quot;Cimabue was, in one sense, the principal cause of the renewal of painting,&quot; with the qualification that, &quot;Giotto truly eclipsed Cimabue&#x27;s fame just as a great light eclipses a much smaller one.&quot;

== In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; ==
In Canto XI of his &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, Dante laments the quick loss of public interest in Cimabue in the face of Giotto&#x27;s revolution in art. Cimabue himself does not appear in &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, but is mentioned by Oderisi, who is also repenting for his pride. The artist serves to represent the fleeting nature of fame in contrast with the Enduring God.

&lt;poem&gt;
O vanity of human powers,
how briefly lasts the crowning green of glory,
unless an age of darkness follows!
In painting Cimabue thought he held the field
but now it&#x27;s Giotto has the cry,
so that the other&#x27;s fame is dimmed.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Market ==
On 27 October 2019, &quot;The Mocking of Christ&quot;, was sold for €24m (£20m; $26.6m), a price the auctioneers described as a new world record for a medieval painting. The picture had been located in the kitchen of a home in northern France, and its owner had been unaware of its value.

<text>Corporatocracy or corpocracy is an economic, political and judicial system controlled or influenced by business corporations or corporate interests.

The concept has been used in explanations of bank bailouts, excessive pay for CEOs, and the exploitation of national treasuries, people, and natural resources. It has been used by critics of globalization, sometimes in conjunction with criticism of the World Bank or unfair lending practices, as well as criticism of free trade agreements. Corporate rule is also a common theme in dystopian science-fiction media.

==Forms of corporatocracy==

Corporatocracy can manifest in different forms, varying according to the degree of involvement of corporations in the political and social sphere, for example: Crony capitalism, in which corporations obtain favors and privileges from the state in exchange for funding or political support; Connivance capitalism, in which corporations collude with each other to form oligopolies or cartels, limiting competition and influencing market rules; Authoritarian capitalism, in which corporations ally themselves with repressive or anti-democratic political regimes, benefiting from protection and impunity; Inverted totalitarianism, theorized by professor Sheldon Wolin, a system where economic powers like corporations exert subtle but substantial power over a system that superficially seems democratic.

==Use of corporatocracy and similar ideas==

Historian Howard Zinn argues that during the Gilded Age in the United States, the U.S. government was acting exactly as Karl Marx described capitalist states: &quot;pretending neutrality to maintain order, but serving the interests of the rich&quot;.

According to economist Joseph Stiglitz, there has been a severe increase in the market power of corporations, largely due to U.S. antitrust laws being weakened by neoliberal reforms, leading to growing income inequality and a generally underperforming economy. He states that to improve the economy, it is necessary to decrease the influence of money on U.S. politics.

In his 1956 book &quot;The Power Elite&quot;, sociologist C. Wright Mills stated that together with the military and political establishment, leaders of the biggest corporations form a &quot;power elite&quot;, which is in control of the U.S.

Economist Jeffrey Sachs described the United States as a corporatocracy in &quot;The Price of Civilization&quot; (2011). He suggested that it arose from four trends: weak national parties and strong political representation of individual districts, the large U.S. military establishment after World War II, large corporations using money to finance election campaigns, and globalization tilting the balance of power away from workers.
In 2013, economist Edmund Phelps criticized the economic system of the U.S. and other western countries in recent decades as being what he calls &quot;the new corporatism&quot;, which he characterizes as a system in which the state is far too involved in the economy and is tasked with &quot;protecting everyone against everyone else&quot;, but at the same time, big companies have a great deal of influence on the government, with lobbyists&#x27; suggestions being &quot;welcome, especially if they come with bribes&quot;.

==Corporate influence on politics in the United States==
===Corruption===
During the Gilded Age in the United States, corruption was rampant, as business leaders spent significant amounts of money ensuring that government did not regulate their activities.

===Corporate influence on legislation===

Corporations have a significant influence on the regulations and regulators that monitor them. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren stated in December 2014 that an omnibus spending bill required to fund the government was modified late in the process to weaken banking regulations. The modification made it easier to allow taxpayer-funded bailouts of banking &quot;swaps entities&quot;, which the Dodd-Frank banking regulations prohibited. She singled out Citigroup, one of the largest banks, which had a role in modifying the legislation. She also stated that both Wall Street bankers and members of the government that formerly had worked on Wall Street stopped bi-partisan legislation that would have broken up the largest banks. She repeated President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s warnings regarding powerful corporate entities that threatened the &quot;very foundations of Democracy&quot;.

In a 2015 interview, former President Jimmy Carter stated that the United States is now &quot;an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery&quot; due to the &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; ruling, which effectively removed limits on donations to political candidates. Wall Street spent a record $2 billion trying to influence the 2016 United States elections.

Joel Bakan, a University of British Columbia law professor and the author of the award-winning book &quot;The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power&quot;, writes:


==Perceived symptoms of corporatocracy in the United States==
===Share of income===
With regard to income inequality, the 2014 income analysis of the University of California, Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez confirms that relative growth of income and wealth is not occurring among small and mid-sized entrepreneurs and business owners (who generally populate the lower half of top one per-centers in income), but instead only among the top .1 percent of the income distribution, who earn $2,000,000 or more every year.

Corporate power can also increase income inequality. Nobel Prize winner of economics Joseph Stiglitz wrote in May 2011: &quot;Much of today’s inequality is due to manipulation of the financial system, enabled by changes in the rules that have been bought and paid for by the financial industry itself—one of its best investments ever. The government lent money to financial institutions at close to zero percent interest and provided generous bailouts on favorable terms when all else failed. Regulators turned a blind eye to a lack of transparency and to conflicts of interest.&quot; Stiglitz stated that the top 1% got nearly &quot;one-quarter&quot; of the income and own approximately 40% of the wealth.

Measured relative to GDP, total compensation and its component wages and salaries have been declining since 1970. This indicates a shift in income from labor (persons who derive income from hourly wages and salaries) to capital (persons who derive income via ownership of businesses, land, and assets).

Larry Summers estimated in 2007 that the lower 80% of families were receiving $664 billion less income than they would be with a 1979 income distribution, or approximately $7,000 per family. Not receiving this income may have led many families to increase their debt burden, a significant factor in the 2007–2009 subprime mortgage crisis, as highly leveraged homeowners suffered a much larger reduction in their net worth during the crisis. Further, since lower income families tend to spend relatively more of their income than higher income families, shifting more of the income to wealthier families may slow economic growth.

===Effective corporate tax rates===
Some large U.S. corporations have used a strategy called tax inversion to change their headquarters to a non-U.S. country to reduce their tax liability. About 46 companies have reincorporated in low-tax countries since 1982, including 15 since 2012. Six more also planned to do so in 2015.

===Stock buybacks versus wage increases===
One indication of increasing corporate power was the removal of restrictions on their ability to buy back stock, contributing to increased income inequality. Writing in the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; in September 2014, William Lazonick blamed record corporate stock buybacks for reduced investment in the economy and a corresponding impact on prosperity and income inequality. Between 2003 and 2012, the 449 companies in the S&amp;P 500 used 54% of their earnings ($2.4 trillion) to buy back their own stock. An additional 37% was paid to stockholders as dividends. Together, these were 91% of profits. This left little for investment in productive capabilities or higher income for employees, shifting more income to capital rather than labor. He blamed executive compensation arrangements, which are heavily based on stock options, stock awards, and bonuses, for meeting earnings per share (EPS) targets. EPS increases as the number of outstanding shares decreases. Legal restrictions on buybacks were greatly eased in the early 1980s. He advocates changing these incentives to limit buybacks.

In the 12 months to March 31, 2014, S&amp;P 500 companies increased their stock buyback payouts by 29% year on year, to $534.9 billion. U.S. companies are projected to increase buybacks to $701 billion in 2015, according to Goldman Sachs, an 18% increase over 2014. For scale, annual non-residential fixed investment (a proxy for business investment and a major GDP component) was estimated to be about $2.1 trillion for 2014.

===Industry concentration===

Brid Brennan of the Transnational Institute stated that the concentration of corporations increases their influence over government: &quot;It&#x27;s not just their size, their enormous wealth and assets that make the TNCs [transnational corporations] dangerous to democracy. It&#x27;s also their concentration, their capacity to influence, and often infiltrate, governments and their ability to act as a genuine international social class in order to defend their commercial interests against the common good. It is such decision-making power as well as the power to impose deregulation over the past 30 years, resulting in changes to national constitutions, and to national and international legislation which has created the environment for corporate crime and impunity.&quot; Brennan concludes that this concentration in power leads to again more concentration of income and wealth.

An example of such industry concentration is in banking. The top 5 U.S. banks had approximately 30% of the U.S. banking assets in 1998; this rose to 45% by 2008 and to 48% by 2010, before falling to 47% in 2011.

&quot;The Economist&quot; also stated that an increasingly profitable corporate financial and banking sector caused Gini coefficients to rise in the U.S. since 1980: &quot;Financial services&#x27; share of GDP in America, doubled to 8% between 1980 and 2000; over the same period their profits rose from about 10% to 35% of total corporate profits, before collapsing in 2007–09. Bankers are being paid more, too. In America the compensation of workers in financial services was similar to average compensation until 1980. Now it is twice that average.&quot;

=== Mass incarceration ===
Several scholars have linked mass incarceration of the poor in the United States with the rise of neoliberalism. Sociologist Loïc Wacquant and Marxist economic geographer David Harvey have argued that the criminalization of poverty and mass incarceration is a neoliberal policy for dealing with social instability among economically marginalized populations. According to Wacquant, this situation follows the implementation of other neoliberal policies, which have allowed for the retrenchment of the social welfare state and the rise of punitive workfare, whilst increasing gentrification of urban areas, privatization of public functions, the shrinking of collective protections for the working class via economic deregulation and the rise of underpaid, precarious wage labor. By contrast, it is extremely lenient in dealing with those in the upper echelons of society, in particular when it comes to economic crimes of the upper class and corporations such as fraud, embezzlement, insider trading, credit and insurance fraud, money laundering and violation of commerce and labor codes. According to Wacquant, neoliberalism does not shrink government, but instead sets up a &quot;centaur state&quot; with little governmental oversight for those at the top and strict control of those at the bottom.

=== Austerity ===
In his 2014 book, Mark Blyth claims that austerity not only fails to stimulate growth, but effectively passes that debt down to the working classes. As such, many academics such as Andrew Gamble view Austerity in Britain less as an economic necessity, and more as a tool of statecraft, driven by ideology and not economic requirements. A study published in &quot;The BMJ&quot; in November 2017 found the Conservative government austerity programme had been linked to approximately 120,000 deaths since 2010; however, this was disputed, for example on the grounds that it was an observational study which did not show cause and effect. More studies claim adverse effects of austerity on population health, which include an increase in the mortality rate among pensioners which has been linked to unprecedented reductions in income support, an increase in suicides and the prescription of antidepressants for patients with mental health issues, and an increase in violence, self-harm, and suicide in prisons.
Clara E. Mattei, assistant professor of economics at the New School for Social Research, posits that austerity is less of a means to &quot;fix the economy&quot; and is more of an ideological weapon of class oppression wielded by economic and political elites in order to suppress revolts and unrest by the working class public and close off any alternatives to the capitalist system. She traces the origins of modern austerity to post-World War I Britain and Italy, when it served as a &quot;powerful counteroffensive&quot; to rising working class agitation and anti-capitalist sentiment. In this, she quotes British economist G. D. H. Cole writing on the British response to the economic downturn of 1921:&quot;The big working-class offensive had been successfully stalled off; and British capitalism, though threatened with economic adversity, felt itself once more safely in the saddle and well able to cope, both industrially and politically, with any attempt that might still be made from the labour side to unseat it.&quot;

<text>The culture of Canada embodies the artistic, culinary, literary, humour, musical, political and social elements that are representative of Canadians. Throughout Canada&#x27;s history, its culture has been influenced firstly by its indigenous cultures, and later by European culture and traditions, mostly by the British and French. Over time, elements of the cultures of Canada&#x27;s immigrant populations have become incorporated to form a Canadian cultural mosaic. Certain segments of Canada&#x27;s population have, to varying extents, also been influenced by American culture due to shared language (in English-speaking Canada), significant media penetration, and geographic proximity.

Canada is often characterized as being &quot;very progressive, diverse, and multicultural&quot;. Canada&#x27;s federal government has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration. Canada&#x27;s culture draws from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a just society are constitutionally protected. Canadian policies—such as abortion, euthanasia, same-sex marriage, and cannabis; an emphasis on cultural diversity; large-scale immigration; abolishing capital punishment; publicly funded health care; higher and more progressive taxation; efforts to eliminate poverty; and strict gun control are social indicators of the country&#x27;s political and cultural values. Canadians view the country&#x27;s institutions of health care, military peacekeeping, the national park system, and the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; as integral to their national identity.

The Canadian government has influenced culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media, such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and promotes many events which it considers to promote Canadian traditions. It has also tried to protect Canadian culture by setting legal minimums on Canadian content in many media using bodies like the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).

==Cultural components ==

===History===
====Influences====
For thousands of years, Canada has been inhabited by indigenous peoples from a variety of different cultures and of several major linguistic groupings. Although not without conflict and bloodshed, early European interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations in what is now Canada were arguably peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. Over the course of three centuries, countless North American Indigenous words, inventions, concepts, and games have become an everyday part of Canadian language and use. Many places in Canada, both natural features and human habitations, use indigenous names. The name &quot;Canada&quot; itself derives from the St. Lawrence Huron-Iroquoian word &quot;Kanata&quot; meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;. The name of Canada&#x27;s capital city Ottawa comes from the Algonquin language term &quot;adawe&quot; meaning &quot;to trade&quot;.

In the 17th-century, French colonials settled New France in Acadia, in the present-day Maritimes, and in &quot;Canada&quot;, along the St. Lawrence River in present-day Quebec and Ontario. These regions were under French control from 1534 to 1763. However, the British conquered Acadia in 1710 and conquered &quot;Canada&quot; in 1760. The British were able to deport most of the Acadians, but they were unable to deport the Canadiens of &quot;Canada&quot; because they severely outnumbered the British forces. The British therefore had to make deals with Canadiens and hope they would one day become assimilated. The American Revolution, from 1775 to 1783, provoked the migration of 40,000 to 50,000 United Empire Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies to the newly conquered British lands, which brought American influences to Canada for the first time. Following the War of 1812, many Scottish and English people settled in Upper Canada and Lower Canada. Many Irish people fleeing the Great Famine also arrived between 1845 and 1852.

The Canadian Forces and overall civilian participation in the First World War and Second World War helped to foster Canadian nationalism; however, in 1917 and 1944, conscription crises highlighted the considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones. As a result of the First and Second World Wars, the Government of Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority. Canada, until the 1940s, was often described as &quot;binational&quot;, with the 2 components being the cultural, linguistic and political identities of English Canadians and of French Canadians.

Legislative restrictions on immigration (such as the Continuous journey regulation and &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot;) that had favoured British, American and other European immigrants (such as Dutch, German, Italian, Polish, Swedish and Ukrainian) were amended during the 1960s, resulting in an influx of people of many different ethnicities. By the end of the 20th century, immigrants were increasingly Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, Jamaican, Filipino, Lebanese, Pakistani and Haitian. By the 21st century Canada had thirty four ethnic groups with at least one hundred thousand members each, of which eleven have over 1,000,000 people and numerous others are represented in smaller numbers. , 16.2% of the population self-identify as a visible minority.

====Development of popular culture====

Themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian culture. Modern Canadian culture as it is understood today can be traced to its time period of westward expansion and nation building. Contributing factors include Canada&#x27;s unique geography, climate, and cultural makeup. Being a cold country with long winter nights for most of the year, certain unique leisure activities developed in Canada during this period including ice hockey and embracement of the summer indigenous game of lacrosse.

By the 19th century, Canadians came to believe themselves possessed of a unique &quot;northern character,&quot; due to the long, harsh winters that only those of hardy body and mind could survive. This hardiness was claimed as a Canadian trait, and sports that reflected this, such as snowshoeing and cross-country skiing, were asserted as characteristically Canadian. During this period, the churches tried to influence leisure activities by preaching against drinking, and scheduling annual revivals and weekly club activities. In a society in which most middle-class families now owned a harmonium or piano, and standard education included at least the rudiments of music, the result was often an original song. Such stirrings frequently occurred in response to noteworthy events, and few local or national excitements were allowed to pass without some musical comment.

By the 1930s, radio played a major role in uniting Canadians behind their local or regional teams. Rural areas were especially influenced by sports coverage and the propagation of national myths. Outside the sports and music arena, Canadians expressed a national character of being hard working, peaceful, orderly and polite.

===Political culture===

====Cultural legislation====
French Canada&#x27;s early development was relatively cohesive during the 17th and 18th centuries, and this was preserved by the &quot;Quebec Act&quot; of 1774, which allowed Roman Catholics to hold offices and practice their faith. In 1867, the &quot;Constitution Act&quot; was thought to meet the growing calls for Canadian autonomy while avoiding the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the Civil War in the United States. The compromises reached during this time between the English- and French-speaking Fathers of Confederation set Canada on a path to bilingualism which in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity. The English and French languages have had limited constitutional protection since 1867 and full official status since 1969. Section 133 of the Constitution Act of 1867 (BNA Act) guarantees that both languages may be used in the Parliament of Canada. Canada adopted its &quot;first Official Languages Act&quot; in 1969, giving English and French equal status in the government of Canada. Doing so makes them &quot;official&quot; languages, having preferred status in law over all other languages used in Canada.

Prior to the advent of the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; in 1960 and its successor the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; in 1982, the laws of Canada did not provide much in the way of civil rights and this issue was typically of limited concern to the courts. Canada since the 1960s has placed emphasis on equality and inclusiveness for all people. Multiculturalism in Canada was adopted as the official policy of the Canadian government and is enshrined in Section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In 1995, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in &quot;Egan v. Canada&quot; that sexual orientation should be &quot;read in&quot; to Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a part of the Constitution of Canada guaranteeing equal rights to all Canadians. Following a series of decisions by provincial courts and the Supreme Court of Canada, on July 20, 2005, the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; (Bill C-38) became law, legalizing same-sex marriage in Canada. Furthermore, sexual orientation was included as a protected status in the human-rights laws of the federal government and of all provinces and territories.

==== Contemporary politics====
Canadian governments at the federal level have a tradition of liberalism, and govern with a moderate, centrist political ideology. Canada&#x27;s egalitarian approach to governance emphasizing social justice and multiculturalism, is based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics that has wide public and political support. Peace, order, and good government are constitutional goals of the Canadian government.

Canada has a multi-party system in which many of its legislative customs derive from the unwritten conventions of and precedents set by the Westminster parliament of the United Kingdom. The country has been dominated by two parties, the centre-left Liberal Party of Canada and the centre-right Conservative Party of Canada. The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale, with the Conservatives sitting on the right and the New Democratic Party occupying the left. Smaller parties like the Quebec nationalist Bloc Québécois and the Green Party of Canada have also been able to exert their influence over the political process by representation at the federal level.

====Nationalism and protectionism====
In general, Canadian nationalists are concerned about the protection of Canadian sovereignty and loyalty to the Canadian State, placing them in the civic nationalist category. It has likewise often been suggested that anti-Americanism plays a prominent role in Canadian nationalist ideologies. A unified, bi-cultural, tolerant and sovereign Canada remains an ideological inspiration to many Canadian nationalists. Alternatively Quebecois nationalism and support for maintaining French Canadian culture many of whom were supporters of the Quebec sovereignty movement during the late-20th century.

Cultural protectionism in Canada has, since the mid-20th century, taken the form of conscious, interventionist attempts on the part of various Canadian governments to promote Canadian cultural production. Sharing a large border, a common language (for the majority), and being exposed to massive diffusions of American media makes it difficult for Canada to preserve its own culture versus being assimilated to American culture. While Canada tries to maintain its cultural differences, it also must balance this with responsibility in trade arrangements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA).

====Foreign relations ====
The notion of peacekeeping is deeply embedded in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy apart from its closest ally, the United States. Canada&#x27;s foreign policy of peacekeeping, peace enforcement, peacemaking, and peacebuilding has been intertwined with its tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions since the end of World War II.

Canada&#x27;s central role in the development of peacekeeping in the mid-1950s gave it credibility and established it as a country fighting for the &quot;common good&quot; of all nations. Canada has since been engaged with the United Nations, NATO and the European Union (EU) in promoting its middle power status into an active role in world affairs.

Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the United Nations, such as the Vietnam War or the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Canada has participated in US-led, UN-sanctioned operations such as the first Gulf War, in Afghanistan and Libya. The country also participates with its NATO allies in UN-sanctioned missions, such as the Kosovo Conflict and in Haiti.

===Values===

Canadian values are the perceived commonly shared ethical and human values of Canadians. Canadians generally value freedom and individuality, often making personal decisions based on family interests rather than collective Canadian identity. Tolerance and sensitivity hold significant importance in Canada&#x27;s multicultural society, as does politeness and fairness Canadians typically tend to embrace liberal views on social and political issues. A majority of Canadians shared the values of human rights, respect for the law and gender equality. Universal access to publicly funded health services &quot;is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national health care insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country.&quot; 

The major political parties have claimed explicitly that they uphold Canadian values, but use generalities to specify them. Historian Ian MacKay argues that, thanks to the long-term political impact of &quot;Rebels, Reds, and Radicals&quot;, and allied leftist political elements, &quot;egalitarianism, social equality, and peace... are now often simply referred to...as &#x27;Canadian values.&#x27;&quot; 

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, was intended to be a source for Canadian values and national unity. The 15th Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; that:

Numerous scholars, beginning in the 1940s with American sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset; have tried to identify, measure and compare them with other countries, especially the United States. However, there are critics who say that such a task is practically impossible.

Denis Stairs a professor of political Science at Dalhousie University; links the concept of Canadian values with nationalism. [Canadians typically]...believe, in particular, that they subscribe to a distinctive set of values – &quot;Canadian&quot; values – and that those values are special in the sense of being unusually virtuous.

===Identity===

Canada&#x27;s large geographic size, the presence of a significant number of indigenous peoples, the conquest of one European linguistic population by another and relatively open immigration policy have led to an extremely diverse society. As a result, the issue of Canadian identity remains under scrutiny.

Canada has constitutional protection for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than cultural assimilation or a single national myth. In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and many commentators speak of a French Canadian culture as distinguished from English Canadian culture. However, as a whole, Canada is in theory, a cultural mosaic—a collection of several regional, and ethnic subcultures.

As Professor Alan Cairns noted about the &quot; Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms &quot;, &quot;the initial federal government premise was on developing a pan-Canadian identity&quot;&#x27;. Pierre Trudeau himself later wrote in his &quot;Memoirs (1993)&quot; that &quot;Canada itself&quot; could now be defined as a &quot;society where all people are equal and where they share some fundamental values based upon freedom&quot;, and that all Canadians could identify with the values of liberty and equality.

Political philosopher Charles Blattberg suggests that Canada is a &quot;multinational country&quot;; as all Canadians are members of Canada as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, and this is a community that contains many other kinds within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, and civic (the provincial and municipal governments) sorts, but also national communities, which often include or overlap with many of the other kinds.

Journalist and author Richard Gwyn has suggested that &quot;tolerance&quot; has replaced &quot;loyalty&quot; as the touchstone of Canadian identity. Journalist and professor Andrew Cohen wrote in 2007:
Canada&#x27;s 15th prime minister Pierre Trudeau in regards to uniformity stated:

In 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau defined the country as the world&#x27;s first postnational state: &quot;There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada&quot;.

The question of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by three fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between English Canadians and French Canadians stemming from the French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between English Canadians and the British Empire, resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power; and finally, the close proximity of English-speaking Canadians to the United States. Much of the debate over contemporary Canadian identity is argued in political terms, and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values.

In 2013, more than 90% of Canadians believed that the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and the national flag were the top symbols of Canadian identity. Next highest were the national anthem, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and hockey.

==== Inter-provincial interactions ====
Western alienation is the notion that the western provinces have historically been alienated, and in extreme cases excluded, from mainstream Canadian political affairs in favour of Eastern Canada or more specifically the central provinces. Western alienation claims that these latter two are politically represented, and economically favoured, more significantly than the former, which has given rise to the sentiment of alienation among many western Canadians. Likewise; the Quebec sovereignty movement that lead to the Québécois nation and the province of Quebec being recognized as a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada, highlights the sharp divisions between the Anglo and Francophone population.

Though more than half of Canadians live in just two provinces (Ontario and Quebec), each province is largely self-contained due to provincial economic self-sufficiency. Only 15 percent of Canadians live in a different province from where they were born, and only 10 percent go to another province for university. Canada has always been like this, and stands in sharp contrast to the United States&#x27; internal mobility which is much higher. For example 30 percent live in a different state from where they were born, and 30 percent go away for university. Scott Gilmore in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; argues that &quot;Canada is a nation of strangers&quot;, in the sense that for most individuals, the rest of Canada outside their province is little-known. Another factor is the cost of internal travel. Intra-Canadian airfares are high—it is cheaper and more common to visit the United States than to visit another province. Gilmore argues that the mutual isolation makes it difficult to muster national responses to major national issues.

===Humour===

Canadian humour is an integral part of the Canadian Identity. There are several traditions in Canadian humour in both English and French. While these traditions are distinct and at times very different, there are common themes that relate to Canadians&#x27; shared history and geopolitical situation in the Western Hemisphere and the world. Various trends can be noted in Canadian comedy. One trend is the portrayal of a &quot;typical&quot; Canadian family in an ongoing radio or television series. Other trends include outright absurdity, and political and cultural satire. Irony, parody, satire, and self-deprecation are arguably the primary characteristics of Canadian humour.

The beginnings of Canadian national radio comedy date to the late 1930s with the debut of &quot;The Happy Gang&quot;, a long-running weekly variety show that was regularly sprinkled with corny jokes in between tunes. Canadian television comedy begins with Wayne and Shuster, a sketch comedy duo who performed as a comedy team during the Second World War, and moved their act to radio in 1946 before moving on to television. &quot;Second City Television&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;SCTV&quot;, &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;, &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;, &quot;Corner Gas&quot; and more recently &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot; are regarded as television shows which were very influential on the development of Canadian humour. Canadian comedians have had great success in the film industry and are amongst the most recognized in the world.

Humber College in Toronto and the École nationale de l&#x27;humour in Montreal offer post-secondary programmes in comedy writing and performance. Montreal is also home to the bilingual (English and French) Just for Laughs festival and to the Just for Laughs Museum, a bilingual, international museum of comedy. Canada has a national television channel, The Comedy Network, devoted to comedy. Many Canadian cities feature comedy clubs and showcases, most notable, The Second City branch in Toronto (originally housed at The Old Fire Hall) and the Yuk Yuk&#x27;s national chain. The Canadian Comedy Awards were founded in 1999 by the Canadian Comedy Foundation for Excellence, a not-for-profit organization.

==Symbols==
Predominant symbols of Canada include the maple leaf, beaver, and the Canadian horse. Many official symbols of the country such as the Flag of Canada have been changed or modified over the past few decades to Canadianize them and de-emphasise or remove references to the United Kingdom. Other prominent symbols include the sports of hockey and lacrosse, the Canada goose, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk; material items such as Canadian beer, maple syrup, tuques, canoes, nanaimo bars, butter tarts and the Quebec dish of poutine have also been defined as uniquely Canadian. Symbols of the Canadian monarchy continue to be featured in, for example, the Arms of Canada, the armed forces, and the prefix His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Ship. The designation &quot;Royal&quot; remains for institutions as varied as the Royal Canadian Armed Forces, Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet.

==Arts==

===Visual arts===
Indigenous artists were producing art in the territory that is now called Canada for thousands of years prior to the arrival of European settler colonists and the eventual establishment of Canada as a nation state. Like the peoples that produced them, indigenous art traditions spanned territories that extended across the current national boundaries between Canada and the United States. The majority of indigenous artworks preserved in museum collections date from the period after European contact and show evidence of the creative adoption and adaptation of European trade goods such as metal and glass beads. Canadian sculpture has been enriched by the walrus ivory, muskox horn and caribou antler and soapstone carvings by the Inuit artists. These carvings show objects and activities from the daily life, myths and legends of the Inuit. Inuit art since the 1950s has been the traditional gift given to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.

The works of most early Canadian painters followed European trends. During the mid-19th century, Cornelius Krieghoff, a Dutch-born artist in Quebec, painted scenes of the life of the &quot;habitants&quot; (French-Canadian farmers). At about the same time, the Canadian artist Paul Kane painted pictures of indigenous life in western Canada. A group of landscape painters called the Group of Seven developed the first distinctly Canadian style of painting, inspired by the works of the legendary landscape painter Tom Thomson. All these artists painted large, brilliantly coloured scenes of the Canadian wilderness.

Since the 1930s, Canadian painters have developed a wide range of highly individual styles. Emily Carr became famous for her paintings of totem poles in British Columbia. Other noted painters have included the landscape artist David Milne, the painters Jean-Paul Riopelle, Harold Town and Charles Carson and multi-media artist Michael Snow. The abstract art group Painters Eleven, particularly the artists William Ronald and Jack Bush, also had an important impact on modern art in Canada. Government support has played a vital role in their development enabling visual exposure through publications and periodicals featuring Canadian art, as has the establishment of numerous art schools and colleges across the country.

===Literature===
Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. Canada&#x27;s early literature, whether written in English or French, often reflects the Canadian perspective on nature, frontier life, and Canada&#x27;s position in the world, for example the poetry of Bliss Carman or the memoirs of Susanna Moodie and Catherine Parr Traill. These themes, and Canada&#x27;s literary history, inform the writing of successive generations of Canadian authors, from Leonard Cohen to Margaret Atwood.

By the mid-20th century, Canadian writers were exploring national themes for Canadian readers. Authors were trying to find a distinctly Canadian voice, rather than merely emulating British or American writers. Canadian identity is closely tied to its literature. The question of national identity recurs as a theme in much of Canada&#x27;s literature, from Hugh MacLennan&#x27;s &quot;Two Solitudes&quot; (1945) to Alistair MacLeod&#x27;s &quot;No Great Mischief&quot; (1999). Canadian literature is often categorized by region or province; by the socio-cultural origins of the author (for example, Acadians, indigenous peoples, LGBT, and Irish Canadians); and by literary period, such as &quot;Canadian postmoderns&quot; or &quot;Canadian Poets Between the Wars&quot;.

Canadian authors have accumulated numerous international awards. In 1992, Michael Ondaatje became the first Canadian to win the Booker Prize for &quot;The English Patient&quot;. Margaret Atwood won the Booker in 2000 for &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; and Yann Martel won it in 2002 for the &quot;Life of Pi&quot;. Carol Shields&#x27;s &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot; won the Governor General&#x27;s Awards in Canada in 1993, the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the 1994 National Book Critics Circle Award. In 2013, Alice Munro was the first Canadian to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for her work as &quot;master of the modern short story&quot;. Munro is also a recipient of the Man Booker International Prize for her lifetime body of work, and three-time winner of Canada&#x27;s Governor General&#x27;s Award for fiction.

===Theatre===

Canada has had a thriving stage theatre scene since the late 1800s. Theatre festivals draw many tourists in the summer months, especially the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, and the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. The Famous People Players are only one of many touring companies that have also developed an international reputation. Canada also hosts one of the largest fringe festivals, the Edmonton International Fringe Festival.
Canada&#x27;s largest cities host a variety of modern and historical venues. The Toronto Theatre District is Canada&#x27;s largest, as well as being the third largest English-speaking theatre district in the world. In addition to original Canadian works, shows from the West End and Broadway frequently tour in Toronto. Toronto&#x27;s Theatre District includes the venerable Roy Thomson Hall; the Princess of Wales Theatre; the Tim Sims Playhouse; The Second City; the Canon Theatre; the Panasonic Theatre; the Royal Alexandra Theatre; historic Massey Hall; and the city&#x27;s new opera house, the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts. Toronto&#x27;s Theatre District also includes the Theatre Museum Canada.

Montreal&#x27;s theatre district (&quot;Quartier des Spectacles&quot;) is the scene of performances that are mainly French-language, although the city also boasts a lively anglophone theatre scene, such as the Centaur Theatre. Large French theatres in the city include Théâtre Saint-Denis and Théâtre du Nouveau Monde.

Vancouver is host to, among others, the Vancouver Fringe Festival, the Arts Club Theatre Company, Carousel Theatre, Bard on the Beach, Theatre Under the Stars and Studio 58.

Calgary is home to Theatre Calgary, a mainstream regional theatre; Alberta Theatre Projects, a major centre for new play development in Canada; the Calgary Animated Objects Society; and One Yellow Rabbit, a touring company.

There are three major theatre venues in Ottawa; the Ottawa Little Theatre, originally called the Ottawa Drama League at its inception in 1913, is the longest-running community theatre company in Ottawa. Since 1969, Ottawa has been the home of the National Arts Centre, a major performing-arts venue that houses four stages and is home to the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra and Opera Lyra Ottawa. Established in 1975, the Great Canadian Theatre Company specializes in the production of Canadian plays at a local level.

===Television===
Canadian television, especially supported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, is the home of a variety of locally produced shows. French-language television, like French Canadian film, is buffered from excessive American influence by the fact of language, and likewise supports a host of home-grown productions. The success of French-language domestic television in Canada often exceeds that of its English-language counterpart. In recent years nationalism has been used to prompt products on television. The &quot;I Am Canadian&quot; campaign by Molson beer, most notably the commercial featuring Joe Canadian, infused domestically brewed beer and nationalism.

Canada&#x27;s television industry is in full expansion as a site for Hollywood productions. Since the 1980s, Canada, and Vancouver in particular, has become known as Hollywood North. The American TV series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; was filmed in Toronto. Canadian producers have been very successful in the field of science fiction since the mid-1990s, with such shows as &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;&quot;, the new &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;My Babysitter&#x27;s a Vampire&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; all filmed in Vancouver.

The CRTC&#x27;s Canadian content regulations dictate that a certain percentage of a domestic broadcaster&#x27;s transmission time must include content that is produced by Canadians, or covers Canadian subjects. These regulations also apply to US cable television channels such as MTV and the Discovery Channel, which have local versions of their channels available on Canadian cable networks. Similarly, BBC Canada, while showing primarily BBC shows from the United Kingdom, also carries Canadian output.

===Film===
A number of Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood significantly contributed to the creation of the motion picture industry in the early days of the 20th century. Over the years, many Canadians have made enormous contributions to the American entertainment industry, although they are frequently not recognized as Canadians.

Canada has developed a vigorous film industry that has produced a variety of well-known films and actors. In fact, this eclipsing may sometimes be creditable for the bizarre and innovative directions of some works, such as auteurs Atom Egoyan (&quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, 1997) and David Cronenberg (&quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, &quot;A History of Violence&quot;) and the &quot;avant-garde&quot; work of Michael Snow and Jack Chambers. Also, the distinct French-Canadian society permits the work of directors such as Denys Arcand and Denis Villeneuve, while First Nations cinema includes the likes of &quot;&quot;. At the 76th Academy Awards, Arcand&#x27;s &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot; became Canada&#x27;s first film to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

The National Film Board of Canada is a public agency that produces and distributes films and other audiovisual works which reflect Canada to Canadians and the rest of the world&#x27;. Canada has produced many popular documentaries such as &quot;The Corporation&quot;, &quot;Nanook of the North&quot;, &quot;Final Offer&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) is considered by many to be one of the most prevalent film festivals for Western cinema. It is the première film festival in North America from which the Oscars race begins.

===Music===

The music of Canada has reflected the multi-cultural influences that have shaped the country. Indigenous, the French, and the British have all made historical contributions to the musical heritage of Canada. The country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles since the mid-1600s. From the 17th century onward, Canada has developed a music infrastructure that includes church halls; chamber halls; conservatories; academies; performing arts centres; record companies; radio stations, and television music-video channels. The music has subsequently been heavily influenced by American culture because of its proximity and migration between the two countries. Canadian rock has had a considerable impact on the development of modern popular music and the development of the most popular subgenres.

Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British patriotism, preceding the first legal steps to independence by over 50 years. The earliest known song, &quot;The Bold Canadian&quot;, was written in 1812. The national anthem of Canada, &quot;O Canada&quot; adopted in 1980, was originally commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Honourable Théodore Robitaille, for the 1880 Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony. Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French, before English lyrics were written in 1906.

Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada&#x27;s music industry awards, the Juno Awards, which were first awarded in a ceremony during the summer of 1970.

==Media==

Canada&#x27;s media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized. The &quot;Broadcasting Act&quot; declares &quot;the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada&quot;. Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).

Canadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a &quot;handful of corporations&quot;. The largest of these corporations is the country&#x27;s national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French. In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec.

Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing. Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.

==Sports==

Sports in Canada consists of a variety of games. Although there are many contests that Canadians value, the most common are ice hockey, box lacrosse, Canadian football, basketball, soccer, curling, baseball and ringette. All but curling and soccer are considered domestic sports as they were either invented by Canadians or trace their roots to Canada.

Ice hockey, referred to as simply &quot;hockey&quot;, is Canada&#x27;s most prevalent winter sport, its most popular spectator sport, and its most successful sport in international competition. It is Canada&#x27;s official national winter sport. Lacrosse, a sport with indigenous origins, is Canada&#x27;s oldest and official summer sport. Canadian football is Canada&#x27;s second most popular spectator sport, and the Canadian Football League&#x27;s annual championship, the Grey Cup, is the country&#x27;s largest annual sports event.

While other sports have a larger spectator base, association football, known in Canada as &quot;soccer&quot; in both English and French, has the most registered players of any team sport in Canada, and is the most played sport with all demographics, including ethnic origin, ages and genders. Professional teams exist in many cities in Canada – with a trio of teams in North America&#x27;s top pro league, Major League Soccer – and international soccer competitions such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro and the UEFA Champions League attract some of the biggest audiences in Canada. Other popular team sports include curling, street hockey, rugby league, rugby union, softball and Ultimate frisbee. Popular individual sports include auto racing, boxing, karate, kickboxing, hunting, sport shooting, fishing, cycling, golf, hiking, horse racing, ice skating, skiing, snowboarding, swimming, triathlon, disc golf, water sports, and several forms of wrestling.

As a country with a generally cool climate, Canada has enjoyed greater success at the Winter Olympics than at the Summer Olympics, although significant regional variations in climate allow for a wide variety of both team and individual sports. Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, while the Lou Marsh Trophy is awarded annually to Canada&#x27;s top athlete by a panel of journalists. There are numerous other Sports Halls of Fame in Canada.

==Cuisine==
Canadian cuisine varies widely depending on the region. The former Canadian prime minister Joe Clark has been paraphrased to have noted: &quot;Canada has a cuisine of cuisines. Not a stew pot, but a smorgasbord.&quot; While there are considerable overlaps between Canadian food and the rest of the cuisine in North America, many unique dishes (or versions of certain dishes) are found and available only in the country. Common contenders for the Canadian national food include poutine and butter tarts. Other popular Canadian made foods include indigenous fried bread bannock, French tourtière, Kraft Dinner, ketchup chips, date squares, nanaimo bars, back bacon, the caesar cocktail and many many more. The Canadian province of Quebec is the birthplace and world&#x27;s largest producer of maple syrup, The Montreal-style bagel and Montreal-style smoked meat are both food items originally developed by Jewish communities living in Quebec

The three earliest cuisines of Canada have First Nations, English, and French roots. The indigenous population of Canada often have their own traditional cuisine. The cuisines of English Canada are closely related to British and American cuisine. Finally, the traditional cuisines of French Canada have evolved from 16th-century French cuisine because of the tough conditions of colonial life and the winter provisions of Coureur des bois. With subsequent waves of immigration in the 18th and 19th century from Central, Southern, and Eastern Europe, and then from Asia, Africa and Caribbean, the regional cuisines were subsequently affected.

== Public opinion data ==
A 2022 web survey by the Association for Canadian Studies found that an absolute majority of respondents in all provinces except Alberta disagreed with the statement that &quot;there is only one Canadian culture&quot;. Most respondents didn&#x27;t choose what music to listen to based on whether or not the artist was Canadian. While half of Quebeckers and more than one third of respondents in the rest of Canada agreed that &quot;I worry about preserving my culture&quot; at the same time 60% of respondents agreed that &quot;If a Canadian artist is good enough, they will become discovered without the need for specific Canadian content rules&quot;. Forty-six percent of respondents had no favourite Canadian musical artist. Rock, pop, and country music were the most popular genres of music, with above twenty percent fan bases in all age categories, but with hip-hop also appealing to more than twenty percent in the youngest cohort (18–35 years old). Film genre preferences were largely as the same across age categories, with comedies and action films the most popular, except that only one percent of older people (&gt;55 years old) were fans of animated movies compared to eleven percent in young adults, while older adults showed a strong preference for dramas compared to younger people. Three out of four respondents could not name a single Canadian visual artist, living or dead.

==Outside views==
In a 2002 interview with the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, Aga Khan, the 49th Imam of the Ismaili Muslims, described Canada as &quot;the most successful pluralist society on the face of our globe&quot;, citing it as &quot;a model for the world&quot;. A 2007 poll ranked Canada as the country with the most positive influence in the world. 28,000 people in 27 countries were asked to rate 12 countries as either having a positive or negative worldwide influence. Canada&#x27;s overall influence rating topped the list with 54 per cent of respondents rating it mostly positive and only 14 per cent mostly negative. A global opinion poll for the BBC saw Canada ranked the second most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany) in 2013 and 2014.

The United States is home to a number of perceptions about Canadian culture, due to the countries&#x27; partially shared heritage and the relatively large number of cultural features common to both the US and Canada. For example, the average Canadian may be perceived as more reserved than his or her American counterpart. Canada and the United States are often inevitably compared as sibling countries, and the perceptions that arise from this oft-held contrast have gone to shape the advertised worldwide identities of both nations: the United States is seen as the rebellious child of the British Crown, forged in the fires of violent revolution; Canada is the calmer offspring of the United Kingdom, known for a more relaxed national demeanour.

<doc id="7003" wikidata="Q726441" url="?curid=7003" title="Cauchy distribution">
<text>The Cauchy distribution, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a continuous probability distribution. It is also known, especially among physicists, as the Lorentz distribution (after Hendrik Lorentz), Cauchy–Lorentz distribution, Lorentz(ian) function, or Breit–Wigner distribution. The Cauchy distribution formula_1 is the distribution of the -intercept of a ray issuing from formula_2 with a uniformly distributed angle. It is also the distribution of the ratio of two independent normally distributed random variables with mean zero.

The Cauchy distribution is often used in statistics as the canonical example of a &quot;pathological&quot; distribution since both its expected value and its variance are undefined (but see below). The Cauchy distribution does not have finite moments of order greater than or equal to one; only fractional absolute moments exist. The Cauchy distribution has no moment generating function.

In mathematics, it is closely related to the Poisson kernel, which is the fundamental solution for the Laplace equation in the upper half-plane.

It is one of the few stable distributions with a probability density function that can be expressed analytically, the others being the normal distribution and the Lévy distribution.

== Definitions ==
Here are the most important constructions.

=== Rotational symmetry ===
If one stands in front of a line and kicks a ball with at a uniformly distributed random angle towards the line, then the distribution of the point where the ball hits the line is a Cauchy distribution.

For example, consider a point at formula_3 in the x-y plane, and select a line passing through the point, with its direction (angle with the formula_4-axis) chosen uniformly (between −180° and 0°) at random. The intersection of the line with the x-axis follows a Cauchy distribution with location formula_5 and scale formula_6.

This definition gives a simple way to sample from the standard Cauchy distribution. Let formula_7 be a sample from a uniform distribution from formula_8, then we can generate a sample, formula_4 from the standard Cauchy distribution using

formula_10
When formula_11 and formula_12 are two independent normally distributed random variables with expected value 0 and variance 1, then the ratio formula_13 has the standard Cauchy distribution.

More generally, if formula_14 is a rotationally symmetric distribution on the plane, then the ratio formula_13 has the standard Cauchy distribution.

===Probability density function (PDF)===
The Cauchy distribution is the probability distribution with the following probability density function (PDF)
formula_16

where formula_5 is the location parameter, specifying the location of the peak of the distribution, and formula_6 is the scale parameter which specifies the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM), alternatively formula_19 is full width at half maximum (FWHM). formula_6 is also equal to half the interquartile range and is sometimes called the probable error. This function is also known as a Lorentzian function, and an example of a nascent delta function, and therefore approaches a Dirac delta function in the limit as formula_21. Augustin-Louis Cauchy exploited such a density function in 1827 with an infinitesimal scale parameter, defining this Dirac delta function.

==== Properties of PDF ====
The maximum value or amplitude of the Cauchy PDF is formula_22, located at formula_23.

It is sometimes convenient to express the PDF in terms of the complex parameter formula_24

formula_25

The special case when formula_26 and formula_27 is called the standard Cauchy distribution with the probability density function
formula_28

In physics, a three-parameter Lorentzian function is often used:
formula_29
formula_30

Note that

formula_31

is a monotone function in formula_6 and that the solution formula_6 must satisfy

formula_34

Solving just for formula_5 requires solving a polynomial of degree formula_36, and solving just for formula_37 requires solving a polynomial of degree formula_38. Therefore, whether solving for one parameter or for both parameters simultaneously, a numerical solution on a computer is typically required. The benefit of maximum likelihood estimation is asymptotic efficiency; estimating formula_5 using the sample median is only about 81% as asymptotically efficient as estimating formula_5 by maximum likelihood. The truncated sample mean using the middle 24% order statistics is about 88% as asymptotically efficient an estimator of formula_5 as the maximum likelihood estimate. When Newton&#x27;s method is used to find the solution for the maximum likelihood estimate, the middle 24% order statistics can be used as an initial solution for formula_5.

The shape can be estimated using the median of absolute values, since for location 0 Cauchy variables formula_43, the formula_44 the shape parameter.

*The wrapped Cauchy distribution, taking values on a circle, is derived from the Cauchy distribution by wrapping it around the circle.
*If formula_57, formula_58, then formula_59. For half-Cauchy distributions, the relation holds by setting formula_60.

=== Lévy measure ===
The Cauchy distribution is the stable distribution of index 1. The Lévy–Khintchine representation of such a stable distribution of parameter formula_61 is given, for formula_62 by:

formula_63

where

formula_64

and formula_65 can be expressed explicitly. In the case formula_66 of the Cauchy distribution, one has formula_67.

This last representation is a consequence of the formula

formula_68

===Multivariate Cauchy distribution===
A random vector formula_69 is said to have the multivariate Cauchy distribution if every linear combination of its components formula_70 has a Cauchy distribution. That is, for any constant vector formula_71, the random variable formula_72 should have a univariate Cauchy distribution. The characteristic function of a multivariate Cauchy distribution is given by:

formula_73

where formula_74 and formula_75 are real functions with formula_74 a homogeneous function of degree one and formula_75 a positive homogeneous function of degree one. More formally:

formula_78

for all formula_79.

An example of a bivariate Cauchy distribution can be given by:
formula_80
Note that in this example, even though the covariance between formula_4 and formula_82 is 0, formula_4 and formula_82 are not statistically independent.

We also can write this formula for complex variable. Then the probability density function of complex Cauchy is :

formula_85

The properties of multidimensional Cauchy distribution are then special cases of the multivariate Student distribution.

==Occurrence and applications==
===In general===

*In spectroscopy, the Cauchy distribution describes the shape of spectral lines which are subject to homogeneous broadening in which all atoms interact in the same way with the frequency range contained in the line shape. Many mechanisms cause homogeneous broadening, most notably collision broadening. Lifetime or natural broadening also gives rise to a line shape described by the Cauchy distribution.
*Applications of the Cauchy distribution or its transformation can be found in fields working with exponential growth. A 1958 paper by White derived the test statistic for estimators of formula_86 for the equation formula_87 and where the maximum likelihood estimator is found using ordinary least squares showed the sampling distribution of the statistic is the Cauchy distribution.
*The Cauchy distribution is often the distribution of observations for objects that are spinning. The classic reference for this is called the Gull&#x27;s lighthouse problem and as in the above section as the Breit–Wigner distribution in particle physics.
*In hydrology the Cauchy distribution is applied to extreme events such as annual maximum one-day rainfalls and river discharges. The blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the Cauchy distribution to ranked monthly maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of the cumulative frequency analysis.
*The expression for the imaginary part of complex electrical permittivity, according to the Lorentz model, is a Cauchy distribution.
*As an additional distribution to model fat tails in computational finance, Cauchy distributions can be used to model VAR (value at risk) producing a much larger probability of extreme risk than Gaussian Distribution.

===Relativistic Breit–Wigner distribution===

In nuclear and particle physics, the energy profile of a resonance is described by the relativistic Breit–Wigner distribution, while the Cauchy distribution is the (non-relativistic) Breit–Wigner distribution.

==History==

A function with the form of the density function of the Cauchy distribution was studied geometrically by Fermat in 1659, and later was known as the witch of Agnesi, after Maria Gaetana Agnesi included it as an example in her 1748 calculus textbook. Despite its name, the first explicit analysis of the properties of the Cauchy distribution was published by the French mathematician Poisson in 1824, with Cauchy only becoming associated with it during an academic controversy in 1853. Poisson noted that if the mean of observations following such a distribution were taken, the standard deviation did not converge to any finite number. As such, Laplace&#x27;s use of the central limit theorem with such a distribution was inappropriate, as it assumed a finite mean and variance. Despite this, Poisson did not regard the issue as important, in contrast to Bienaymé, who was to engage Cauchy in a long dispute over the matter.

<text>Control engineering, also known as control systems engineering and, in some European countries, automation engineering, is an engineering discipline that deals with control systems, applying control theory to design equipment and systems with desired behaviors in control environments. The discipline of controls overlaps and is usually taught along with electrical engineering, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering at many institutions around the world.

The practice uses sensors and detectors to measure the output performance of the process being controlled; these measurements are used to provide corrective feedback helping to achieve the desired performance. Systems designed to perform without requiring human input are called automatic control systems (such as cruise control for regulating the speed of a car). Multi-disciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by mathematical modeling of a diverse range of systems.

==Overview==
Modern day control engineering is a relatively new field of study that gained significant attention during the 20th century with the advancement of technology. It can be broadly defined or classified as practical application of control theory. Control engineering plays an essential role in a wide range of control systems, from simple household washing machines to high-performance fighter aircraft. It seeks to understand physical systems, using mathematical modelling, in terms of inputs, outputs and various components with different behaviors; to use control system design tools to develop controllers for those systems; and to implement controllers in physical systems employing available technology. A system can be mechanical, electrical, fluid, chemical, financial or biological, and its mathematical modelling, analysis and controller design uses control theory in one or many of the time, frequency and complex-s domains, depending on the nature of the design problem.

Control engineering is the engineering discipline that focuses on the modeling of a diverse range of dynamic systems (e.g. mechanical systems) and the design of controllers that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner. Although such controllers need not be electrical, many are and hence control engineering is often viewed as a subfield of electrical engineering.

Electrical circuits, digital signal processors and microcontrollers can all be used to implement control systems. Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airliners to the cruise control present in many modern automobiles.

In most cases, control engineers utilize feedback when designing control systems. This is often accomplished using a PID controller system. For example, in an automobile with cruise control the vehicle&#x27;s speed is continuously monitored and fed back to the system, which adjusts the motor&#x27;s torque accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, control theory can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback. In practically all such systems stability is important and control theory can help ensure stability is achieved.

Although feedback is an important aspect of control engineering, control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback. This is known as open loop control. A classic example of open loop control is a washing machine that runs through a pre-determined cycle without the use of sensors.

== History ==

Automatic control systems were first developed over two thousand years ago. The first feedback control device on record is thought to be the ancient Ktesibios&#x27;s water clock in Alexandria, Egypt, around the third century BCE. It kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and, therefore, the water flow from that vessel.

This certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in Baghdad when the Mongols captured the city in 1258 CE. A variety of automatic devices have been used over the centuries to accomplish useful tasks or simply just to entertain. The latter includes the automata, popular in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, featuring dancing figures that would repeat the same task over and over again; these automata are examples of open-loop control. Milestones among feedback, or &quot;closed-loop&quot; automatic control devices, include the temperature regulator of a furnace attributed to Drebbel, circa 1620, and the centrifugal flyball governor used for regulating the speed of steam engines by James Watt in 1788.

In his 1868 paper &quot;On Governors&quot;, James Clerk Maxwell was able to explain instabilities exhibited by the flyball governor using differential equations to describe the control system. This demonstrated the importance and usefulness of mathematical models and methods in understanding complex phenomena, and it signaled the beginning of mathematical control and systems theory. Elements of control theory had appeared earlier but not as dramatically and convincingly as in Maxwell&#x27;s analysis.

Control theory made significant strides over the next century. New mathematical techniques, as well as advances in electronic and computer technologies, made it possible to control significantly more complex dynamical systems than the original flyball governor could stabilize. New mathematical techniques included developments in optimal control in the 1950s and 1960s followed by progress in stochastic, robust, adaptive, nonlinear control methods in the 1970s and 1980s. Applications of control methodology have helped to make possible space travel and communication satellites, safer and more efficient aircraft, cleaner automobile engines, and cleaner and more efficient chemical processes.

Before it emerged as a unique discipline, control engineering was practiced as a part of mechanical engineering and control theory was studied as a part of electrical engineering since electrical circuits can often be easily described using control theory techniques. In the first control relationships, a current output was represented by a voltage control input. However, not having adequate technology to implement electrical control systems, designers were left with the option of less efficient and slow responding mechanical systems. A very effective mechanical controller that is still widely used in some hydro plants is the governor. Later on, previous to modern power electronics, process control systems for industrial applications were devised by mechanical engineers using pneumatic and hydraulic control devices, many of which are still in use today.

===Mathematical modelling===
David Quinn Mayne, (1930–2024) was among the early developers of a rigorous mathematical method for analysing Model predictive control algorithms (MPC). It is currently used in tens of thousands of applications and is a core part of the advanced control technology by hundreds of process control producers. MPC&#x27;s major strength is its capacity to deal with nonlinearities and hard constraints in a simple and intuitive fashion. His work underpins a class of algorithms that are provably correct, heuristically explainable, and yield control system designs which meet practically important objectives.

== Education ==
At many universities around the world, control engineering courses are taught primarily in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering, but some courses can be instructed in mechatronics engineering, and aerospace engineering. In others, control engineering is connected to computer science, as most control techniques today are implemented through computers, often as embedded systems (as in the automotive field). The field of control within chemical engineering is often known as process control. It deals primarily with the control of variables in a chemical process in a plant. It is taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of any chemical engineering program and employs many of the same principles in control engineering. Other engineering disciplines also overlap with control engineering as it can be applied to any system for which a suitable model can be derived. However, specialised control engineering departments do exist, for example, in Italy there are several master in Automation &amp; Robotics that are fully specialised in Control engineering or the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at the University of Sheffield or the Department of Robotics and Control Engineering at the United States Naval Academy and the Department of Control and Automation Engineering at the Istanbul Technical University.

Control engineering has diversified applications that include science, finance management, and even human behavior. Students of control engineering may start with a linear control system course dealing with the time and complex-s domain, which requires a thorough background in elementary mathematics and Laplace transform, called classical control theory. In linear control, the student does frequency and time domain analysis. Digital control and nonlinear control courses require Z transformation and algebra respectively, and could be said to complete a basic control education.

== Careers ==
A control engineer&#x27;s career starts with a bachelor&#x27;s degree and can continue through the college process. Control engineer degrees are typically paired with an electrical or mechanical engineering degree, but can also be paired with a degree in chemical engineering. According to a &quot;Control Engineering&quot; survey, most of the people who answered were control engineers in various forms of their own career.

There are not very many careers that are classified as &quot;control engineer&quot;, most of them are specific careers that have a small semblance to the overarching career of control engineering. A majority of the control engineers that took the survey in 2019 are system or product designers, or even control or instrument engineers. Most of the jobs involve process engineering or production or even maintenance, they are some variation of control engineering.

Because of this, there are many job opportunities in aerospace companies, manufacturing companies, automobile companies, power companies, chemical companies, petroleum companies, and government agencies. Some places that hire Control Engineers include companies such as Rockwell Automation, NASA, Ford, Phillips 66, Eastman, and Goodrich. Control Engineers can possibly earn $66k annually from Lockheed Martin Corp. They can also earn up to $96k annually from General Motors Corporation. Process Control Engineers, typically found in Refineries and Specialty Chemical plants, can earn upwards of $90k annually.

In India, control System Engineering is provided at different levels with a diploma, graduation and postgraduation. These programs require the candidate to have chosen physics, chemistry and mathematics for their secondary schooling or relevant bachelor&#x27;s degree for postgraduate studies.

== Recent advancement ==

Originally, control engineering was all about continuous systems. Development of computer control tools posed a requirement of discrete control system engineering because the communications between the computer-based digital controller and the physical system are governed by a computer clock. The equivalent to Laplace transform in the discrete domain is the Z-transform. Today, many of the control systems are computer controlled and they consist of both digital and analog components.

Therefore, at the design stage either digital components are mapped into the continuous domain and the design is carried out in the continuous domain, or analog components are mapped into discrete domain and design is carried out there. The first of these two methods is more commonly encountered in practice because many industrial systems have many continuous systems components, including mechanical, fluid, biological and analog electrical components, with a few digital controllers.

Similarly, the design technique has progressed from paper-and-ruler based manual design to computer-aided design and now to computer-automated design or CAD which has been made possible by evolutionary computation. CAD can be applied not just to tuning a predefined control scheme, but also to controller structure optimisation, system identification and invention of novel control systems, based purely upon a performance requirement, independent of any specific control scheme.

Resilient control systems extend the traditional focus of addressing only planned disturbances to frameworks and attempt to address multiple types of unexpected disturbance; in particular, adapting and transforming behaviors of the control system in response to malicious actors, abnormal failure modes, undesirable human action, etc.

<text>Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;. It is spread mostly by insects in the subfamily Triatominae, known as &quot;kissing bugs&quot;. The symptoms change throughout the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or swelling at the site of the bite. After four to eight weeks, untreated individuals enter the chronic phase of disease, which in most cases does not result in further symptoms. Up to 45% of people with chronic infections develop heart disease 10–30 years after the initial illness, which can lead to heart failure. Digestive complications, including an enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon, may also occur in up to 21% of people, and up to 10% of people may experience nerve damage.

 is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the kissing bug&#x27;s bite wound and the bug&#x27;s infected feces. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, consuming food or drink contaminated with the parasites, and vertical transmission (from a mother to her baby). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope or detecting its DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for in the blood.
Prevention focuses on eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. This may involve the use of insecticides or bed-nets. Other preventive efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. Early infections are treatable with the medications benznidazole or nifurtimox, which usually cure the disease if given shortly after the person is infected, but become less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end-stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox often cause side effects, including skin disorders, digestive system irritation, and neurological symptoms, which can result in treatment being discontinued. New drugs for Chagas disease are under development, and while experimental vaccines have been studied in animal models, a human vaccine has not been developed. 
It is estimated that 6.5 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2019, resulting in approximately 9,490 annual deaths. Most people with the disease are poor, and most do not realize they are infected. Large-scale population migrations have carried Chagas disease to new regions, which include the United States and many European countries. The disease affects more than 150 types of animals.

The disease was first described in 1909 by Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named. Chagas disease is classified as a neglected tropical disease.

==Signs and symptoms==

Chagas disease occurs in two stages: an acute stage, which develops one to two weeks after the insect bite, and a chronic stage, which develops over many years. The acute stage is often symptom-free. When present, the symptoms are typically minor and not specific to any particular disease. Signs and symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, and enlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. Sometimes, people develop a swollen nodule at the site of infection, which is called &quot;Romaña&#x27;s sign&quot; if it is on the eyelid, or a &quot;chagoma&quot; if it is elsewhere on the skin. In rare cases (less than 1–5%), infected individuals develop severe acute disease, which can involve inflammation of the heart muscle, fluid accumulation around the heart, and inflammation of the brain and surrounding tissues, and may be life-threatening. The acute phase typically lasts four to eight weeks and resolves without treatment.

Unless treated with antiparasitic drugs, individuals remain infected with after recovering from the acute phase. Most chronic infections are asymptomatic, which is referred to as &quot;indeterminate&quot; chronic Chagas disease. However, over decades with the disease, approximately 30–40% of people develop organ dysfunction (&quot;determinate&quot; chronic Chagas disease), which most often affects the heart or digestive system.

The most common long-term manifestation is heart disease, which occurs in 14–45% of people with chronic Chagas disease. People with Chagas heart disease often experience heart palpitations, and sometimes fainting, due to irregular heart function. By electrocardiogram, people with Chagas heart disease most frequently have arrhythmias. As the disease progresses, the heart&#x27;s ventricles become enlarged (dilated cardiomyopathy), which reduces its ability to pump blood. In many cases the first sign of Chagas heart disease is heart failure, thromboembolism, or chest pain associated with abnormalities in the microvasculature.

Also common in chronic Chagas disease is damage to the digestive system, which affects 10–21% of people. Enlargement of the esophagus or colon are the most common digestive issues. Those with enlarged esophagus often experience pain (odynophagia) or trouble swallowing (dysphagia), acid reflux, cough, and weight loss. Individuals with enlarged colon often experience constipation, and may develop severe blockage of the intestine or its blood supply. Up to 10% of chronically infected individuals develop nerve damage that can result in numbness and altered reflexes or movement. While chronic disease typically develops over decades, some individuals with Chagas disease (less than 10%) progress to heart damage directly after acute disease.

Signs and symptoms differ for people infected with through less common routes. People infected through ingestion of parasites tend to develop severe disease within three weeks of consumption, with symptoms including fever, vomiting, shortness of breath, cough, and pain in the chest, abdomen, and muscles. Those infected congenitally typically have few to no symptoms, but can have mild non-specific symptoms, or severe symptoms such as jaundice, respiratory distress, and heart problems. People infected through organ transplant or blood transfusion tend to have symptoms similar to those of vector-borne disease, but the symptoms may not manifest for anywhere from a week to five months. Chronically infected individuals who become immunosuppressed due to HIV infection can have particularly severe and distinct disease, most commonly characterized by inflammation in the brain and surrounding tissue or brain abscesses. Symptoms vary widely based on the size and location of brain abscesses, but typically include fever, headaches, seizures, loss of sensation, or other neurological issues that indicate particular sites of nervous system damage. Occasionally, these individuals also experience acute heart inflammation, skin lesions, and disease of the stomach, intestine, or peritoneum.

==Cause==

Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite , which is typically introduced into humans through the bite of triatomine bugs, also called &quot;kissing bugs&quot;. When the insect defecates at the bite site, motile forms called trypomastigotes enter the bloodstream and invade various host cells. Inside a host cell, the parasite transforms into a replicative form called an amastigote, which undergoes several rounds of replication. The replicated amastigotes transform back into trypomastigotes, which burst the host cell and are released into the bloodstream. Trypomastigotes then disseminate throughout the body to various tissues, where they invade cells and replicate. Over many years, cycles of parasite replication and immune response can severely damage these tissues, particularly the heart and digestive tract.

===Transmission===

&quot;T. cruzi&quot; can be transmitted by various triatomine bugs in the genera &quot;Triatoma&quot;, &quot;Panstrongylus&quot;, and &quot;Rhodnius&quot;. The primary vectors for human infection are the species of triatomine bugs that inhabit human dwellings, namely &quot;Triatoma infestans&quot;, &quot;Rhodnius prolixus&quot;, &quot;Triatoma dimidiata&quot; and &quot;Panstrongylus megistus&quot;. These insects are known by a number of local names, including &quot;vinchuca&quot; in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, &quot;barbeiro&quot; (the barber) in Brazil, &quot;pito&quot; in Colombia, &quot;chinche&quot; in Central America, and &quot;chipo&quot; in Venezuela. The bugs tend to feed at night, preferring moist surfaces near the eyes or mouth. A triatomine bug can become infected with when it feeds on an infected host. replicates in the insect&#x27;s intestinal tract and is shed in the bug&#x27;s feces. When an infected triatomine feeds, it pierces the skin and takes in a blood meal, defecating at the same time to make room for the new meal. The bite is typically painless, but causes itching. Scratching at the bite introduces the -laden feces into the bite wound, initiating infection.

In addition to classical vector spread, Chagas disease can be transmitted through the consumption of food or drink contaminated with triatomine insects or their feces. Since heating or drying kills the parasites, drinks and especially fruit juices are the most frequent source of infection. This oral route of transmission has been implicated in several outbreaks, where it led to unusually severe symptoms, likely due to infection with a higher parasite load than from the bite of a triatomine bug—a single crushed triatomine in a food or beverage harboring &quot;T cruzi&quot; can contain about 600,000 metacyclic trypomastigotes, while triatomine fecal matter contains 3,000-4,000 per μL.

&quot;T. cruzi&quot; can be transmitted independent of the triatomine bug during blood transfusion, following organ transplantation, or across the placenta during pregnancy. Transfusion with the blood of an infected donor infects the recipient 10–25% of the time. To prevent this, blood donations are screened for in many countries with endemic Chagas disease, as well as the United States. Similarly, transplantation of solid organs from an infected donor can transmit to the recipient. This is especially true for heart transplant, which transmits &quot;T. cruzi&quot; 75–100% of the time, and less so for transplantation of the liver (0–29%) or a kidney (0–19%). An infected mother can pass to her child through the placenta; this occurs in up to 15% of births by infected mothers. As of 2019, 22.5% of new infections occurred through congenital transmission.

==Pathophysiology==

In the acute phase of the disease, signs and symptoms are caused directly by the replication of and the immune system&#x27;s response to it. During this phase, can be found in various tissues throughout the body and circulating in the blood. During the initial weeks of infection, parasite replication is brought under control by the production of antibodies and activation of the host&#x27;s inflammatory response, particularly cells that target intracellular pathogens such as NK cells and macrophages, driven by inflammation-signaling molecules like TNF-α and IFN-γ.

During chronic Chagas disease, long-term organ damage develops over years due to continued replication of the parasite and damage from the immune system. Early in the course of the disease, is found frequently in the striated muscle fibers of the heart. As disease progresses, the heart becomes generally enlarged, with substantial regions of cardiac muscle fiber replaced by scar tissue and fat. Areas of active inflammation are scattered throughout the heart, with each housing inflammatory immune cells, typically macrophages and T cells. Late in the disease, parasites are rarely detected in the heart, and may be present at only very low levels.

In the heart, colon, and esophagus, chronic disease leads to a massive loss of nerve endings. In the heart, this may contribute to arrhythmias and other cardiac dysfunction. In the colon and esophagus, loss of nervous system control is the major driver of organ dysfunction. Loss of nerves impairs the movement of food through the digestive tract, which can lead to blockage of the esophagus or colon and restriction of their blood supply.

The parasite can insert kinetoplast DNA into host cells, an example of horizontal gene transfer. Vertical inheritance of the inserted kDNA has been demonstrated in rabbits and birds. In chickens, offspring carrying inserted kDNA show symptoms of disease despite carrying no live trypanosomes. In 2010, integrated kDNA was found to be vertically transmitted in five human families.

==Diagnosis==

The presence of &quot;T. cruzi&quot; in the blood is diagnostic of Chagas disease. During the acute phase of infection, it can be detected by microscopic examination of fresh anticoagulated blood, or its buffy coat, for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with Giemsa, for direct visualization of parasites. Blood smear examination detects parasites in 34–85% of cases. The sensitivity increases if techniques such as microhematocrit centrifugation are used to concentrate the blood. On microscopic examination of stained blood smears, trypomastigotes appear as S or U-shaped organisms with a flagellum connected to the body by an undulating membrane. A nucleus and a smaller structure called a kinetoplast are visible inside the parasite&#x27;s body; the kinetoplast of is relatively large, which helps to distinguish it from other species of trypanosomes that infect humans.

Alternatively, &quot;T. cruzi&quot; DNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In acute and congenital Chagas disease, PCR is more sensitive than microscopy, and it is more reliable than antibody-based tests for the diagnosis of congenital disease because it is not affected by the transfer of antibodies against from a mother to her baby (passive immunity). PCR is also used to monitor levels in organ transplant recipients and immunosuppressed people, which allows infection or reactivation to be detected at an early stage.

In chronic Chagas disease, the concentration of parasites in the blood is too low to be reliably detected by microscopy or PCR, so the diagnosis is usually made using serological tests, which detect immunoglobulin G antibodies against in the blood. Two positive serology results, using different test methods, are required to confirm the diagnosis. If the test results are inconclusive, additional testing methods such as Western blot can be used.

Various rapid diagnostic tests for Chagas disease are available. These tests are easily transported and can be performed by people without special training. They are useful for screening large numbers of people and testing people who cannot access healthcare facilities, but their sensitivity is relatively low, and it is recommended that a second method is used to confirm a positive result.

&quot;T. cruzi&quot; parasites can be grown from blood samples by blood culture, xenodiagnosis, or by inoculating animals with the person&#x27;s blood. In the blood culture method, the person&#x27;s red blood cells are separated from the plasma and added to a specialized growth medium to encourage multiplication of the parasite. It can take up to six months to obtain the result. Xenodiagnosis involves feeding the blood to triatomine insects, and then examining their feces for the parasite 30 to 60 days later. These methods are not routinely used, as they are slow and have low sensitivity.

==Prevention==
Efforts to prevent Chagas disease have largely focused on vector control to limit exposure to triatomine bugs. Insecticide-spraying programs have been the mainstay of vector control, consisting of spraying homes and the surrounding areas with residual insecticides. This was originally done with organochlorine, organophosphate, and carbamate insecticides, which were supplanted in the 1980s with pyrethroids. These programs have drastically reduced transmission in Brazil and Chile, and eliminated major vectors from certain regions: &quot;Triatoma infestans&quot; from Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and parts of Peru and Paraguay, as well as &quot;Rhodnius prolixus&quot; from Central America. Vector control in some regions has been hindered by the development of insecticide resistance among triatomine bugs. In response, vector control programs have implemented alternative insecticides (e.g. fenitrothion and bendiocarb in Argentina and Bolivia), treatment of domesticated animals (which are also fed on by triatomine bugs) with pesticides, pesticide-impregnated paints, and other experimental approaches. In areas with triatomine bugs, transmission of can be prevented by sleeping under bed nets and by housing improvements that prevent triatomine bugs from colonizing houses.

Blood transfusion was formerly the second-most common mode of transmission for Chagas disease. can survive in refrigerated stored blood, and can survive freezing and thawing, allowing it to persist in whole blood, packed red blood cells, granulocytes, cryoprecipitate, and platelets. The development and implementation of blood bank screening tests have dramatically reduced the risk of infection during a blood transfusion. Nearly all blood donations in Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening. Widespread screening is also common in non-endemic nations with significant populations of immigrants from endemic areas, including the United Kingdom (implemented in 1999), Spain (2005), the United States (2007), France and Sweden (2009), Switzerland (2012), and Belgium (2013). Serological tests, typically ELISAs, are used to detect antibodies against proteins in donor blood.

Other modes of transmission have been targeted by Chagas disease prevention programs. Treating -infected mothers during pregnancy reduces the risk of congenital transmission of the infection. To this end, many countries in Latin America have implemented routine screening of pregnant women and infants for infection, and the World Health Organization recommends screening all children born to infected mothers to prevent congenital infection from developing into chronic disease. Similarly to blood transfusions, many countries with endemic Chagas disease screen organs for transplantation with serological tests.

There is no vaccine against Chagas disease. Several experimental vaccines have been tested in animals infected with and were able to reduce parasite numbers in the blood and heart, but no vaccine candidates had undergone clinical trials in humans as of 2016.

==Management==

Chagas disease is managed using antiparasitic drugs to eliminate &quot;T. cruzi&quot; from the body, and symptomatic treatment to address the effects of the infection. As of 2018, benznidazole and nifurtimox were the antiparasitic drugs of choice for treating Chagas disease, though benznidazole is the only drug available in most of Latin America. For either drug, treatment typically consists of two to three oral doses per day for 60 to 90 days. Antiparasitic treatment is most effective early in the course of infection: it eliminates from 50 to 80% of people in the acute phase (WHO: &quot;nearly 100 %&quot;), but only 20–60% of those in the chronic phase. Treatment of chronic disease is more effective in children than in adults, and the cure rate for congenital disease approaches 100% if treated in the first year of life. Antiparasitic treatment can also slow the progression of the disease and reduce the possibility of congenital transmission. Elimination of does not cure the cardiac and gastrointestinal damage caused by chronic Chagas disease, so these conditions must be treated separately. Antiparasitic treatment is not recommended for people who have already developed dilated cardiomyopathy.

Benznidazole is usually considered the first-line treatment because it has milder adverse effects than nifurtimox, and its efficacy is better understood. Both benznidazole and nifurtimox have common side effects that can result in treatment being discontinued. The most common side effects of benznidazole are skin rash, digestive problems, decreased appetite, weakness, headache, and sleeping problems. These side effects can sometimes be treated with antihistamines or corticosteroids, and are generally reversed when treatment is stopped. However, benznidazole is discontinued in up to 29% of cases. Nifurtimox has more frequent side effects, affecting up to 97.5% of individuals taking the drug. The most common side effects are loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, and various neurological disorders including mood changes, insomnia, paresthesia and peripheral neuropathy. Treatment is discontinued in up to 75% of cases. Both drugs are contraindicated for use in pregnant women and people with liver or kidney failure. As of 2019, resistance to these drugs has been reported.

===Complications===
In the chronic stage, treatment involves managing the clinical manifestations of the disease. The treatment of Chagas cardiomyopathy is similar to that of other forms of heart disease. Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors may be prescribed, but some people with Chagas disease may not be able to take the standard dose of these drugs because they have low blood pressure or a low heart rate. To manage irregular heartbeats, people may be prescribed anti-arrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, or have a pacemaker implanted. Blood thinners may be used to prevent thromboembolism and stroke. Chronic heart disease caused by untreated &quot;T. cruzi&quot; infection is a common reason for heart transplantation surgery. Because transplant recipients take immunosuppressive drugs to prevent organ rejection, they are monitored using PCR to detect reactivation of the disease. People with Chagas disease who undergo heart transplantation have higher survival rates than the average heart transplant recipient.

Mild gastrointestinal disease may be treated symptomatically, such as by using laxatives for constipation or taking a prokinetic drug like metoclopramide before meals to relieve esophageal symptoms. Surgery to sever the muscles of the lower esophageal sphincter (cardiomyotomy) may be performed in more severe cases of esophageal disease, and surgical removal of the affected part of the organ may be required for advanced megacolon and megaesophagus.

==Epidemiology==

In 2019, an estimated 6.5 million people worldwide had Chagas disease, with approximately 173,000 new infections and 9,490 deaths each year. The disease resulted in a global annual economic burden estimated at US$7.2 billion in 2013, 86% of which is borne by endemic countries. Chagas disease results in the loss of over 800,000 disability-adjusted life years each year.
The endemic area of Chagas disease stretches from the southern United States to northern Chile and Argentina, with Bolivia (6.1%), Argentina (3.6%), and Paraguay (2.1%) exhibiting the highest prevalence of the disease. Within continental Latin America, Chagas disease is endemic to 21 countries: Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. In endemic areas, due largely to vector control efforts and screening of blood donations, annual infections and deaths have fallen by 67% and more than 73% respectively from their peaks in the 1980s to 2010. Transmission by insect vector and blood transfusion has been completely interrupted in Uruguay (1997), Chile (1999), and Brazil (2006), and in Argentina, vectorial transmission had been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces as of 2001. During Venezuela&#x27;s humanitarian crisis, vectorial transmission has begun occurring in areas where it had previously been interrupted, and Chagas disease seroprevalence rates have increased. Transmission rates have also risen in the Gran Chaco region due to insecticide resistance and in the Amazon basin due to oral transmission.

While the rate of vector-transmitted Chagas disease has declined throughout most of Latin America, the rate of orally transmitted disease has risen, possibly due to increasing urbanization and deforestation bringing people into closer contact with triatomines and altering the distribution of triatomine species. Orally transmitted Chagas disease is of particular concern in Venezuela, where 16 outbreaks have been recorded between 2007 and 2018.

Chagas exists in two different ecological zones. In the Southern Cone region, the main vector lives in and around human homes. In Central America and Mexico, the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas. In both zones, Chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas, where also circulates in wild and domestic animals. commonly infects more than 100 species of mammals across Latin America including opossums (&quot;Didelphis&quot; spp.), armadillos, marmosets, bats, various rodents and dogs all of which can be infected by the vectors or orally by eating triatomine bugs and other infected animals. For entomophagous animals this is a common mode. &quot;Didelphis&quot; spp. are unique in that they do not require the triatomine for transmission, completing the life cycle through their own urine and feces. Veterinary transmission also occurs through vertical transmission through the placenta, blood transfusion and organ transplants.

===Non-endemic countries===
Though Chagas is traditionally considered a disease of rural Latin America, international migration has dispersed those with the disease to numerous non-endemic countries, primarily in North America and Europe. As of 2020, approximately 300,000 infected people are living in the United States, and in 2018 it was estimated that 30,000 to 40,000 people in the United States had Chagas cardiomyopathy. The vast majority of cases in the United States occur in immigrants from Latin America, but local transmission is possible. Eleven triatomine species are native to the United States, and some southern states have persistent cycles of disease transmission between insect vectors and animal reservoirs, which include woodrats, possums, raccoons, armadillos and skunks. However, locally acquired infection is very rare: only 28 cases were documented from 1955 to 2015. As of 2013, the cost of treatment in the United States was estimated to be US$900 million annually (global cost $7 billion), which included hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers.

Chagas disease affected approximately 68,000 to 123,000 people in Europe as of 2019. Spain, which has a high rate of immigration from Latin America, has the highest prevalence of the disease. It is estimated that 50,000 to 70,000 people in Spain are living with Chagas disease, accounting for the majority of European cases. The prevalence varies widely within European countries due to differing immigration patterns. Italy has the second highest prevalence, followed by the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

==History==
&quot;T. cruzi&quot; likely circulated in South American mammals long before the arrival of humans on the continent. has been detected in ancient human remains across South America, from a 9000-year-old Chinchorro mummy in the Atacama Desert, to remains of various ages in Minas Gerais, to an 1100-year-old mummy as far north as the Chihuahuan Desert near the Rio Grande. Many early written accounts describe symptoms consistent with Chagas disease, with early descriptions of the disease sometimes attributed to Miguel Diaz Pimenta (1707), (1735), and Theodoro J. H. Langgaard (1842).

The formal description of Chagas disease was made by Carlos Chagas in 1909 after examining a two-year-old girl with fever, swollen lymph nodes, and an enlarged spleen and liver. Upon examination of her blood, Chagas saw trypanosomes identical to those he had recently identified from the hindgut of triatomine bugs and named &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot; in honor of his mentor, Brazilian physician Oswaldo Cruz. He sent infected triatomine bugs to Cruz in Rio de Janeiro, who showed the bite of the infected triatomine could transmit to marmoset monkeys as well. In just two years, 1908 and 1909, Chagas published descriptions of the disease, the organism that caused it, and the insect vector required for infection. Almost immediately thereafter, at the suggestion of Miguel Couto, then professor of the , the disease was widely referred to as &quot;Chagas disease&quot;. Chagas&#x27; discovery brought him national and international renown, but in highlighting the inadequacies of the Brazilian government&#x27;s response to the disease, Chagas attracted criticism to himself and to the disease that bore his name, stifling research on his discovery and likely frustrating his nomination for the Nobel Prize in 1921.

In the 1930s, Salvador Mazza rekindled Chagas disease research, describing over a thousand cases in Argentina&#x27;s Chaco Province. In Argentina, the disease is known as &quot;mal de Chagas-Mazza&quot; in his honor. Serological tests for Chagas disease were introduced in the 1940s, demonstrating that infection with was widespread across Latin America. This, combined with successes eliminating the malaria vector through insecticide use, spurred the creation of public health campaigns focused on treating houses with insecticides to eradicate triatomine bugs. The 1950s saw the discovery that treating blood with crystal violet could eradicate the parasite, leading to its widespread use in transfusion screening programs in Latin America. Large-scale control programs began to take form in the 1960s, first in São Paulo, then various locations in Argentina, then national-level programs across Latin America. These programs received a major boost in the 1980s with the introduction of pyrethroid insecticides, which did not leave stains or odors after application and were longer-lasting and more cost-effective. Regional bodies dedicated to controlling Chagas disease arose through support of the Pan American Health Organization, with the Initiative of the Southern Cone for the Elimination of Chagas Diseases launching in 1991, followed by the Initiative of the Andean countries (1997), Initiative of the Central American countries (1997), and the Initiative of the Amazon countries (2004).

==Research==
===Treatments===
Fexinidazole, an antiparasitic drug approved for treating African trypanosomiasis, has shown activity against Chagas disease in animal models. As of 2019, it is undergoing phase II clinical trials for chronic Chagas disease in Spain. Other drug candidates include GNF6702, a proteasome inhibitor that is effective against Chagas disease in mice and is undergoing preliminary toxicity studies, and AN4169, which has had promising results in animal models.

Several experimental vaccines have been tested in animals. In addition to subunit vaccines, some approaches have involved vaccination with attenuated parasites or organisms that express some of the same antigens as but do not cause human disease, such as &quot;Trypanosoma rangeli&quot; or &quot;Phytomonas serpens&quot;. DNA vaccination has also been explored. As of 2019, vaccine research has mainly been limited to small animal models.

===Diagnostic tests===
As of 2018, standard diagnostic tests for Chagas disease were limited in their ability to measure the effectiveness of antiparasitic treatment, as serological tests may remain positive for years after is eliminated from the body, and PCR may give false-negative results when the parasite concentration in the blood is low. Several potential biomarkers of treatment response are under investigation, such as immunoassays against specific antigens, flow cytometry testing to detect antibodies against different life stages of , and markers of physiological changes caused by the parasite, such as alterations in coagulation and lipid metabolism.

Another research area is the use of biomarkers to predict the progression of chronic disease. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, brain and atrial natriuretic peptide, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 have been studied as indicators of the prognosis of Chagas cardiomyopathy.

&quot;T. cruzi&quot; shed acute-phase antigen (SAPA), which can be detected in blood using ELISA or Western blot, has been used as an indicator of early acute and congenital infection. An assay for antigens in urine has been developed to diagnose congenital disease.

<text>Christiaan Neethling Barnard (8November 19222September 2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon who performed the world&#x27;s first human-to-human heart transplant operation. On 3 December 1967, Barnard transplanted the heart of accident victim Denise Darvall into the chest of 54-year-old Louis Washkansky, who regained full consciousness and was able to talk easily with his wife, before dying 18 days later of pneumonia, largely brought on by the anti-rejection drugs that suppressed his immune system. Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, an assessment which has been criticised as misleading. Barnard&#x27;s second transplant patient, Philip Blaiberg, whose operation was performed at the beginning of 1968, returned home from the hospital and lived for a year and a half.

Born in Beaufort West, Cape Province, Barnard studied medicine and practised for several years in his native South Africa. As a young doctor experimenting on dogs, Barnard developed a remedy for the infant defect of intestinal atresia. His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States. In 1955, he travelled to the United States and was initially assigned further gastrointestinal work by Owen Harding Wangensteen at the University of Minnesota. He was introduced to the heart-lung machine, and Barnard was allowed to transfer to the service run by open heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei. Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town.

He retired as head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after rheumatoid arthritis in his hands ended his surgical career. He became interested in anti-aging research, and in 1986 his reputation suffered when he promoted Glycel, an expensive &quot;anti-aging&quot; skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter. During his remaining years, he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world. He died in 2001 at the age of 78 after an asthma attack.

==Early life==
Barnard was born on November 8, 1922 and grew up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, Union of South Africa. His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. One of his four brothers, Abraham, was a &quot;blue baby&quot; who died of a heart problem at the age of three (Barnard would later guess that it was tetralogy of Fallot). The family also experienced the loss of a daughter who was stillborn and who had been the fraternal twin of Barnard&#x27;s older brother Johannes, who was twelve years older than Christiaan. Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the University of Cape Town Medical School, where he obtained his MB ChB in 1945.

His father served as a missionary to mixed-race people. His mother, the former Maria Elisabeth de Swart, instilled in the surviving brothers the belief that they could do anything they set their minds to.

==Career==
Barnard did his internship and residency at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, after which he worked as a general practitioner in Ceres, a rural town in the Cape Province. In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at Groote Schuur as a registrar. He completed his master&#x27;s degree, receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the University of Cape Town. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the same university for a dissertation titled &quot;The treatment of tuberculous meningitis&quot;.

Soon after qualifying as a doctor, Barnard performed experiments on dogs while investigating intestinal atresia, congenital, life-threatening obstructions in the intestines. He followed a medical hunch that this was caused by inadequate blood flow to the fetus. After nine months and forty-three attempts, Barnard was able to reproduce this condition in a fetus puppy by tying off some of the blood supply to a puppy&#x27;s intestines and then placing the animal back in the womb, after which it was born some two weeks later, with the condition of intestinal atresia. He was also able to cure the condition by removing the piece of intestine with inadequate blood supply. The mistake of previous surgeons had been attempting to reconnect ends of intestine which themselves still had inadequate blood supply. To be successful, it was typically necessary to remove between 15 and 20 centimeters of intestine (6 to 8 inches). Jannie Louw used this innovation in a clinical setting, and Barnard&#x27;s method saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town. This technique was also adapted by surgeons in Britain and the US. In addition, Barnard analyzed 259 cases of tubercular meningitis.

Owen Wangensteen at the University of Minnesota in the United States had been impressed by the work of Alan Thal, a young South African doctor working in Minnesota. Wangensteen asked the Groote Schuur Head of Medicine John Brock if he might recommend any similarly talented South Africans, and Brock recommended Barnard. In December 1955, Barnard travelled to Minneapolis, Minnesota to begin a two-year scholarship under Chief of Surgery Wangensteen, who assigned Barnard more work on the intestines, which Barnard accepted even though he wanted to move onto something new. Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with Vince Gott who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei. Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve (McRae writes, &quot;It was the type of inspired thinking that entranced Barnard&quot;). In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the heart-lung machine for an operation. Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lillehei&#x27;s service. It was during this time that Barnard became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation surgeon Norman Shumway. Barnard also became friendly with Gil Campbell, who had demonstrated that a dog&#x27;s lung could be used to oxygenate blood during open-heart surgery. (The year before Barnard arrived, Lillehei and Campbell had used this procedure for twenty minutes during surgery on a 13-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect, and the boy had made a full recovery.) Barnard and Campbell met regularly for early breakfast. In 1958, Barnard received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis titled &quot;The aortic valve – problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve&quot;. The same year he was awarded a Ph.D. for his dissertation titled &quot;The aetiology of congenital intestinal atresia&quot;. Barnard described the two years he spent in the United States as &quot;the most fascinating time in my life.&quot;

Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at Groote Schuur hospital, as well as holding a joint post at the University of Cape Town. He was promoted to full-time lecturer and Director of Surgical Research at the University of Cape Town. In 1960, he flew to Moscow in order to meet Vladimir Demikhov, a top expert on organ transplants (later he credited Demikhov&#x27;s accomplishment saying that &quot;if there is a father of heart and lung transplantation then Demikhov certainly deserves this title.&quot;) In 1961 he was appointed Head of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the teaching hospitals of the University of Cape Town. He rose to associate professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1962. Barnard&#x27;s younger brother Marius, who also studied medicine, eventually became Barnard&#x27;s right-hand man at the department of Cardiac Surgery. Over time, Barnard became known as a brilliant surgeon with many contributions to the treatment of cardiac diseases, such as the Tetralogy of Fallot and Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly. He was promoted to Professor of Surgical Science in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1972. In 1981, Barnard became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Among the recognition he received over the years, he was named Professor Emeritus in 1984.

==Historical context==

Following the first-ever successful kidney transplant in 1953, in the United States, Barnard performed South Africa&#x27;s second kidney transplant in October 1967, the first having been done in Johannesburg the previous year.

On 23 January 1964, James Hardy at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi, performed the world&#x27;s first heart transplant and world&#x27;s first cardiac xenotransplant by transplanting the heart of a chimpanzee into a desperately ill and dying man. This heart did beat in the patient&#x27;s chest for approximately 60 to 90 minutes. The patient, Boyd Rush, died without regaining consciousness.

Barnard had experimentally transplanted forty-eight hearts into dogs, which was about a fifth the number that Adrian Kantrowitz had performed at Maimonides Medical Center in New York and about a sixth the number Norman Shumway had performed at Stanford University in California. Barnard had no dogs which had survived longer than ten days, unlike Kantrowitz and Shumway who had had dogs survive for more than a year.

With the availability of new breakthroughs introduced by several pioneers, also including Richard Lower at the Medical College of Virginia, several surgical teams were in a position to prepare for a human heart transplant. Barnard had a patient willing to undergo the procedure, but as with other surgeons, he needed a suitable donor.

During the Apartheid era in South Africa, non-white persons and citizens were not given equal opportunities in the medical professions. At Groote Schuur Hospital, Hamilton Naki was an informally taught surgeon. He started out as a gardener and cleaner. One day he was asked to help out with an experiment on a giraffe. From this modest beginning, Naki became principal lab technician and taught hundreds of surgeons, and assisted with Barnard&#x27;s organ transplant program. Barnard said, &quot;Hamilton Naki had better technical skills than I did. He was a better craftsman than me, especially when it came to stitching, and had very good hands in the theatre&quot;. A popular myth, propagated principally by a widely discredited documentary film called &quot;Hidden Heart&quot; and an erroneous newspaper article, maintains incorrectly that Naki was present during the Washkansky transplant.

==First human-to-human heart transplant==
Barnard performed the world&#x27;s first human-to-human heart transplant operation in the early morning hours of Sunday 3 December 1967. Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer who was suffering from diabetes and incurable heart disease, was the patient. Barnard was assisted by his brother Marius Barnard, as well as a team of thirty staff members. The operation lasted approximately five hours.

Barnard stated to Washkansky and his wife Ann Washkansky that the transplant had an 80% chance of success. This has been criticised by the ethicists Peter Singer and Helga Kuhse as making claims for chances of success to the patient and family which were &quot;unfounded&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot;.

Barnard later wrote, &quot;For a dying man it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side.&quot; The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear. Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall&#x27;s father for Denise&#x27;s heart to be used in the transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower&#x27;s technique. Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall&#x27;s heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard&#x27;s urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, &quot;Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, &#x27;It works.&#x27;&quot;

Washkansky survived the operation and lived for 18 days; he died from pneumonia, possibly due to the immunosuppressive drugs he was taking.

==Additional heart transplants==
Barnard and his patient received worldwide publicity. A 2017 BBC retrospective article described the occasion as one where &quot;Journalists and film crews flooded into Cape Town&#x27;s Groote Schuur Hospital, soon making Barnard and Washkansky household names.&quot; Barnard himself was described as &quot;charismatic&quot; and &quot;photogenic&quot; while initial reports labeled the operation as &quot;successful&quot; despite the death of Washkansky 18 days later.

Worldwide, approximately 100 transplants were performed by various doctors during 1968. However, only a third of these patients lived longer than three months. Many medical centers stopped performing transplants. In fact, a US National Institutes of Health publication states, &quot;Within several years, only Shumway&#x27;s team at Stanford was attempting transplants.&quot;

Barnard&#x27;s second transplant operation was conducted on 2 January 1968, and the patient, Philip Blaiberg, survived for 19 months. Blaiberg&#x27;s heart was donated by Clive Haupt, a 24-year-old black man who suffered a stroke, inciting controversy (especially in the African-American press) during the time of South African apartheid. Dirk van Zyl, who received a new heart in 1971, was the longest-lived recipient, surviving over 23 years.

Between December 1967 and November 1974 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, ten heart transplants were performed, as well as a heart and lung transplant in 1971. Of these ten patients, four lived longer than 18 months, with two of these four becoming long-term survivors. One patient, Dorothy Fischer, lived for over thirteen years and another for over twenty-four years.

Full recovery of donor heart function often takes place over hours or days, during which time considerable damage can occur. Other deaths to patients can occur from preexisting conditions. For example, in pulmonary hypertension the patient&#x27;s right ventricle has often adapted to the higher pressure over time and, although diseased and hypertrophied, is often capable of maintaining circulation to the lungs. Barnard designed the idea of the heterotopic (or &quot;piggy back&quot; transplant) in which the patient&#x27;s diseased heart is left in place while the donor heart is added, essentially forming a &quot;double heart&quot;. Barnard performed the first such heterotopic heart transplant in 1974.

From November 1974 through December 1983, 49 consecutive heterotopic heart transplants on 43 patients were performed at Groote Schuur. The survival rate for patients at one year was over 60%, as compared to less than 40% with standard transplants, and the survival rate at five years was over 36% as compared to less than 20% with standard transplants.

Many surgeons gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to rejection of the transplanted heart by the patient&#x27;s immune system. Barnard persisted until the advent of cyclosporine, an effective immunosuppressive drug, which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He also attempted xenotransplantation in two human patients, utilizing a baboon heart and chimpanzee heart, respectively.

==Public life==
Barnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africa&#x27;s laws of apartheid, and was not afraid to criticise his nation&#x27;s government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent to travel abroad. Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame to campaign for a change in the law. Christiaan&#x27;s brother, Marius Barnard, went into politics, and was elected to the legislature from the Progressive Federal Party. Barnard later stated that the reason he never won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was probably because he was a &quot;white South African&quot;.

Shortly before his visit to Kenya in 1978, the following was written about his views regarding race relations in South Africa;
&quot;While he believes in the participation of Africans in the political process of South Africa, he is opposed to a one-man-one-vote system in South Africa&quot;.

In answering a hypothetical question on how he would solve the race problem were he a &quot;benevolent dictator in South Africa&quot;, Barnard stated the following in a long interview at the Weekly Review:
* While &quot;I would abolish Social discrimination&quot;, political discrimination would continue. 
* He favoured the total division of the country along racial lines. His words were; &quot;I somehow feel ... but we may have to divide South Africa into two equal divisions&quot;. In a follow-up question about where the coloured people would end up in that scenario, he replied that &#x27;I would include them in the white South Africa&quot;.
* That coloured people have &quot;always been accepted&quot; among whites.
* That &quot;the black man will not accept this view&quot; of universal suffrage.
* That &quot;we are still out of the Olympic games&quot; despite the fact that &quot;in the field of sports where we have virtually integrated completely.&quot;
* Regarding the Soweto uprising, he claimed &quot;there was ... a lot of external stirring up of turbulence&quot;. Regarding the anger from the black population when Steve Biko was murdered, he said that &quot;I think that something like $50,000 came in from outside to work up feelings at that funeral.&quot;
* He stated that the National Party members were as upset about Biko&#x27;s murder as were blacks; &quot;The white community was thoroughly upset, let me tell you. The nationalists themselves were very upset.&quot;

The interview ended with the following summary from he himself;
&quot;I often say that, like King Lear, South Africa is a country more sinned against than sinning.&quot;

==Personal life==
Barnard&#x27;s first marriage was to Aletta Gertruida Louw, a nurse, whom he married in 1948 while practising medicine in Ceres. The couple had two children: Deirdre (born 1950) and Andre (1951–1984). International fame took a toll on his family, and in 1969, Barnard and his wife divorced. In 1970, he married heiress Barbara Zoellner when she was 19, the same age as his son, and they had two children: Frederick (born 1972) and Christiaan Jr. (born 1974). He divorced Zoellner in 1982. Barnard married for a third time in 1988 to Karin Setzkorn, a young model. They also had two children, Armin (born 1989) and Lara (born 1997). This last marriage also ended in divorce in 2000.

Barnard described in his autobiography &quot;The Second Life&quot; a one-night extramarital affair with Italian film star Gina Lollobrigida, that occurred in January 1968. During that visit to Rome he received an audience from Pope Paul VI.

In October 2016, US Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster stated that Barnard sexually assaulted her when she was 23 years old. According to Kuster, Barnard attempted to grope her under her skirt while she was seated at a business luncheon with US Representative Pete McCloskey, for whom she worked at the time.

==Retirement==
Barnard retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He had struggled with arthritis since 1956, when it was diagnosed during his postgraduate work in the United States. After retirement, he spent two years as the Scientist-In-Residence at the Oklahoma Transplantation Institute in the United States and as an acting consultant for various institutions.

He had by this time become very interested in anti-aging research, and his reputation suffered in 1986 when he promoted &quot;Glycel&quot;, an expensive &quot;anti-aging&quot; skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter. He also spent time as a research advisor to the Clinique la Prairie, in Switzerland, where the controversial &quot;rejuvenation therapy&quot; was practised.

Barnard divided the remainder of his years between Austria, where he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world, and his game farm in Beaufort West, South Africa. In his later years, he had Basal-cell carcinoma (skin cancer) on his face, for which he was treated in Parow, South Africa.

==Death==
Christiaan Barnard died on 2 September 2001, while on holiday in Paphos, Cyprus. Early reports stated that he had died of a heart attack, but an autopsy showed his death was caused by a severe asthma attack.

==Books==
Barnard wrote two autobiographies. His first book, &quot;One Life&quot;, was published in 1969 () and sold copies worldwide. Some of the proceeds were used to set up the Chris Barnard Fund for research into heart disease and heart transplants in Cape Town. His second autobiography, &quot;The Second Life&quot;, was published in 1993, eight years before his death ().

Apart from his autobiographies, Barnard wrote books including:
*&quot;The Donor&quot;
*&quot;Your Healthy Heart&quot;
*&quot;In the Night Season&quot;
*&quot;The Best Medicine&quot;
*&quot;Arthritis Handbook: How to Live With Arthritis&quot;
*&quot;Good Life Good Death: A Doctor&#x27;s Case for Euthanasia and Suicide&quot;
*&quot;South Africa: Sharp Dissection&quot;
*&quot;50 Ways to a Healthy Heart&quot;
*&quot;Body Machine&quot;

<text>Concubinage is an interpersonal and sexual relationship between two people in which the couple does not want to, or cannot, enter into a full marriage. Concubinage and marriage are often regarded as similar, but mutually exclusive.

During the early stages of European colonialism, administrators often encouraged European men to practice concubinage to discourage them from paying prostitutes for sex (which could spread venereal disease) and from homosexuality. Colonial administrators also believed that having an intimate relationship with a native woman would enhance white men&#x27;s understanding of native culture and would provide them with essential domestic labor. The latter was critical to the colonial project, as it meant white men did not require wives from the metropole, hence did not require a family wage. Colonial administrators eventually discouraged the practice when these liaisions resulted in offspring who threatened colonial rule by producing a mixed race class that might contest white hegemony. This political threat eventually prompted colonial administrators to encourage white women to travel to the colonies, where they contributed to the colonial project, benefitting from their racial privilege, while at the same time contributing to the cult of domesticity, the illusion of separate public and private spheres, and their own oppression via white men.

In China, until the 20th century, concubinage was a formal and institutionalized practice that upheld concubines&#x27; rights and obligations. A concubine could be freeborn or of slave origin, and her experience could vary tremendously according to her master&#x27;s whim. During the Mongol conquests, both foreign royals and captured women were taken as concubines. Concubinage was also common in Meiji Japan as a status symbol.

Many Middle Eastern societies used concubinage for reproduction. The practice of a barren wife giving her husband a slave as a concubine is recorded in the Code of Hammurabi. The children of such relationships would be regarded as legitimate. Such concubinage was also widely practiced in the premodern Muslim world, and many of the rulers of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Ottoman Empire were born out of such relationships. Throughout Africa, from Egypt to South Africa, slave concubinage resulted in racially mixed populations. The practice declined as a result of the abolition of slavery.

In ancient Rome, the practice of &quot;concubinatus&quot; was a monogamous relationship that was an alternative to marriage, usually because of the woman&#x27;s lesser social status. Widowed or divorced men often took a &quot;concubina&quot;, the Latin term from which the English &quot;concubine&quot; is derived, rather than remarrying, so as to avoid complications of inheritance. After the Christianization of the Roman Empire, Christian emperors improved the status of the concubine by granting concubines and their children the sorts of property and inheritance rights usually reserved for wives. In European colonies and American slave plantations, single and married men entered into long-term sexual relationships with local women. In the Dutch East Indies, concubinage created mixed-race Indian-European communities.

In the Judeo-Christian-Islamic world, the term &quot;concubine&quot; has almost exclusively been applied to women, although a cohabiting male may also be called a concubine. In the 21st century, &quot;concubinage&quot; is used in some Western countries as a gender-neutral legal term to refer to cohabitation (including cohabitation between same-sex partners).

==Etymology and usage==

The English terms &quot;concubine&quot; and &quot;concubinage&quot; appeared in the 14th century, deriving from Latin terms in Roman society and law. The term concubine (), meaning &quot;a paramour, a woman who cohabits with a man without being married to him&quot;, comes from the Latin (f.) and (m.), terms that in Roman law meant &quot;one who lives unmarried with a married man or woman&quot;. The Latin terms are derived from the verb from &quot;to lie with, to lie together, to cohabit,&quot; an assimilation of &quot;com&quot;, a prefix meaning &quot;with, together&quot; and &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to lie down&quot;. Concubine is a term used widely in historical and academic literature, and which varies considerably depending on the context. In the twenty-first century, it typically refers explicitly to extramarital affection, &quot;either to a mistress or to a sex slave&quot;, without the same emphasis on the cohabiting aspect of the original meaning.

Concubinage emerged as an English term in the late 14th century to mean the &quot;state of being a concubine; act or practice of cohabiting in intimacy without legal marriage&quot;, and was derived from Latin by means of Old French, where the term may in turn have been derived from the Latin , an institution in ancient Rome that meant &quot;a permanent cohabitation between persons to whose marriage there were no legal obstacles&quot;. It has also been described more plainly as a long-term sexual relationship between a man and a woman who are not legally married. In pre-modern to modern law, concubinage has been used in certain jurisdictions to describe cohabitation, and in France, was formalized in 1999 as the French equivalent of a civil union. The US legal system also used to use the term in reference to cohabitation, but the term never evolved further and is now considered outdated.

==Characteristics==
Forms of concubinage have existed in all cultures, though the prevalence of the practice and the rights and expectations of the persons involved have varied considerably, as have the rights of the offspring born from such relationships, a concubine&#x27;s legal and social status, their role within a household and society&#x27;s perceptions of the institution. A relationship of concubinage could take place voluntarily, with the parties involved agreeing not to enter into marriage, or involuntarily (i.e. through slavery). In slave-owning societies, most concubines were slaves, also called &quot;slave-concubines&quot;. This institutionalization of concubinage with female slaves dates back to Babylonian times, and has been practiced in patriarchal cultures throughout history. Whatever the status and rights of the persons involved, they were typically inferior to those of a legitimate spouse, often with the rights of inheritance being limited or excluded.

Concubinage and marriage are often regarded as similar but mutually exclusive. In the past, a couple may not have been able to marry because of differences in social class, ethnicity or religion, or a man might want to avoid the legal and financial complications of marriage. Practical impediments or social disincentives for a couple to marry could include differences in social rank status, an existing marriage and laws against bigamy, religious or professional prohibitions, or a lack of recognition by the appropriate authorities.

The concubine in a concubinage tended to have a lower social status than the married party or home owner, and this was often the reason why concubinage was preferred to marriage. A concubine could be an &quot;alien&quot; in a society that did not recognize marriages between foreigners and citizens. Alternatively, they might be a slave, or person from a poor family interested in a union with a man from the nobility.
In other cases, some social groups were forbidden to marry, such as Roman soldiers, and concubinage served as a viable alternative to marriage.

In polygynous situations, the number of concubines there were permitted within an individual concubinage arrangement has varied greatly. In Roman law, where monogamy was expected, the relationship was identical (and alternative) to marriage except for the lack of &quot;marital affection&quot; from both or one of the parties, which conferred rights related to property, inheritance and social rank. By contrast, in parts of Asia and the Middle East, powerful men kept as many concubines as they could financially support. Some royal households had thousands of concubines. In such cases concubinage served as a status symbol and for the production of sons. In societies that accepted polygyny, there were advantages to having a concubine over a mistress, as children from a concubine were legitimate, while children from a mistress would be considered &quot;bastards&quot;.

== Categorization ==
Scholars have made attempts to categorize patterns of concubinage practiced in the world.

&quot;The International Encyclopedia of Anthropology&quot; gives four distinct forms of concubinage:
*Royal concubinage, where politics was connected to reproduction. Concubines became consorts to the ruler, fostered diplomatic relations, and perpetuated the royal bloodline. Imperial concubines could be selected from the general population or prisoners of war. Examples of this included imperial China, the Ottoman empire and the Sultanate of Kano.
*Elite concubinage, which offered men the chance to increase social status and satisfy desires. Most such men already had wives. In East Asia this practice was justified by Confucianism. In the Muslim world, this concubinage resembled slavery.
*Concubinage could be a form of common-law relationship that allowed a couple who did not wish to marry to live together. This was prevalent in medieval Europe and colonial Asia. In Europe, some families discouraged younger sons from marriage to prevent division of family wealth among many heirs.
*Concubinage could also function as a form of sexual enslavement of women in a patriarchal system. In such cases the children of the concubine could become permanently inferior to the children of the wife. Examples include Mughal India and Joseon Korea.

Junius P. Rodriguez gives three cultural patterns of concubinage: Asian, Islamic and European.

== Antiquity ==
=== Mesopotamia ===

In Mesopotamia, it was customary for a sterile wife to give her husband a slave as a concubine to bear children. The status of such concubines was ambiguous; they normally could not be sold but they remained the slave of the wife. However, in the late Babylonian period, there are reports that concubines could be sold.
;Old Assyrian Period (20th–18th centuries BC)
In general, marriage was monogamous. &quot;If after two or three years of marriage the wife had not given birth to any children, the husband was allowed to buy a slave (who could also be chosen by the wife) in order to produce heirs. This woman, however, remained a slave and never gained the status of a second wife.&quot;
;Middle Assyrian Period (14th–11th centuries BC)
In the Middle Assyrian Period, the main wife (&quot;assatu&quot;) wore a veil in the street, as could a concubine (&quot;esirtu&quot;) if she were accompanying the main wife, or if she were married. &quot;If a man veils his concubine in public, by declaring &#x27;she is my wife,&#x27; this woman shall be his wife.&quot; It was illegal for unmarried women, prostitutes and slave women to wear a veil in the street. &quot;The children of a concubine were lower in rank than the descendants of a wife, but they could inherit if the marriage of the latter remained childless.&quot;

=== Ancient Egypt ===

While most Ancient Egyptians were monogamous, a male pharaoh would have had other, lesser wives and concubines in addition to the Great Royal Wife. This arrangement would allow the pharaoh to enter into diplomatic marriages with the daughters of allies, as was the custom of ancient kings. Concubinage was a common occupation for women in ancient Egypt, especially for talented women. A request for forty concubines by Amenhotep III (c. 1386–1353 BC) to a man named Milkilu, Prince of Gezer states:&quot;Behold, I have sent you Hanya, the commissioner of the archers, with merchandise in order to have beautiful concubines, i.e. weavers. Silver, gold, garments, all sort of precious stones, chairs of ebony, as well as all good things, worth 160 deben. In total: forty concubines—the price of every concubine is forty of silver. Therefore, send very beautiful concubines without blemish.&quot; – &quot;(Lewis, 146)&quot;Concubines would be kept in the pharaoh&#x27;s harem. Amenhotep III kept his concubines in his palace at Malkata, which was one of the most opulent in the history of Egypt. The king was considered to be deserving of many women as long as he cared for his Great Royal Wife as well.

=== Ancient Greece ===

In Ancient Greece, the practice of keeping a concubine ( &quot;pallakís&quot;) was common among the upper classes, and they were for the most part women who were slaves or foreigners, but occasional free born based on family arrangements (typically from poor families). Children produced by slaves remained slaves and those by non-slave concubines varied over time; sometimes they had the possibility of citizenship. The law prescribed that a man could kill another man caught attempting a relationship with his concubine.

By the mid fourth century, concubines could inherit property, but, like wives, they were treated as sexual property. While references to the sexual exploitation of maidservants appear in literature, it was considered disgraceful for a man to keep such women under the same roof as his wife. Apollodorus of Acharnae said that &quot;hetaera&quot; were concubines when they had a permanent relationship with a single man, but nonetheless used the two terms interchangeably.

=== Ancient Rome ===


&quot;Concubinatus&quot; was a monogamous union recognized socially and to some extent legally as an alternative to marriage in the Roman Empire. Concubinage was practiced most often in couples when one partner, almost always the man, belonged to a higher social rank, especially the senatorial order, who were penalized for marrying below their class. The female partner was a &quot;concubina&quot;; the term &quot;concubinus&quot; is used of men mainly in a same-sex union or to deprecate a relationship in which the woman was dominant.

The use of the term &quot;concubina&quot; in epitaphs for family memorials indicates that the role was socially acceptable. A man was not allowed to have both a &quot;concubina&quot; and a wife &quot;(uxor)&quot; at the same time, but a single tombstone might list multiple wives or &quot;concubinae&quot; serially. By contrast, the pejorative &quot;paelex&quot; referred to a concubine who was a sexual rival to a wife—in early Rome, most often a war captive and hence unwillingly—and by late antiquity was loosely equivalent to &quot;prostitute&quot;. However, in Latin literature &quot;concubinae&quot; are often disparaged as slaves kept as sexual luxuries in the literal sense of &quot;bedmate&quot;. The distinction is that the use of an enslaved woman was not &quot;concubinatus&quot; in the legal sense, which might involve a signed document, though even an informal concubine had some legal protections that placed her among the more privileged slaves of the household.

Concubines occupied an entire chapter, now fragmentary, in the 6th-century compilation of Roman law known as the &quot;Digest&quot;, but &quot;concubinatus&quot; was never a fully realized legal institution. It evolved in ad hoc response to Augustan moral legislation that criminalized some forms of adultery and other consensual sexual behaviors among freeborn people &quot;(ingenui)&quot; outside marriage. Even Roman legal experts had trouble parsing the various forms of marriage, the status of a &quot;concubina&quot;, and whether an extramarital sexual relationship was adultery or permissible pleasure-seeking with a prostitute, professional entertainer, or slave.

Roman emperors not infrequently took a &quot;concubina&quot;, often a freedwoman, rather than remarrying after the death of their wife to avoid the legal complications pertaining to succession and inheritance. Caenis, the freedwoman and secretary of Antonia Minor, was Vespasian&#x27;s wife &quot;in all but name&quot;, according to Suetonius, until her death in AD 74. Roman manumission law also allowed a slave-owner to free the slave and enter into &quot;concubinatus&quot; or a regular marriage. Epitaphs indicate that both partners in &quot;concubinatus&quot; might also be freedpersons, for reasons that are not entirely clear.

A slave lacked the legal personhood to marry under Roman law or to contract &quot;concubinatus&quot;, but the heterosexual union of two slaves, or a freedperson and a slave, might be recognized as an intention to marry when both partners gained the legal status that permitted them to do so. In this quasi-marital union, called &quot;contubernium&quot;, children seem often to have been desired, in contrast to &quot;concubinatus&quot;, in which children more often were viewed as complications and there was no intention to marry.

== Asia ==
Concubinage was highly popular before the early 20th century all over East Asia. The main functions of concubinage for men was for pleasure and producing additional heirs, whereas for women the relationship could provide financial security. Children of concubines had lower rights in account to inheritance, which was regulated by the Dishu system.

In China and the Muslim world, the concubine of a king could achieve power, especially if her son also became a monarch.

=== China ===

In China, successful men often had concubines until the practice was outlawed when the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949. The standard Chinese term translated as &quot;concubine&quot; was &quot;qiè&quot; , a term that has been used since ancient times. Concubinage resembled marriage in that concubines were recognized sexual partners of a man and were expected to bear children for him. Unofficial concubines () were of lower status, and their children were considered illegitimate. The English term concubine is also used for what the Chinese refer to as &quot;pínfēi&quot; (), or &quot;consorts of emperors&quot;, an official position often carrying a very high rank.

In premodern China it was illegal and socially disreputable for a man to have more than one wife at a time, but it was acceptable to have concubines. From the earliest times wealthy men purchased concubines and added them to their household in addition to their wife. The purchase of concubines was similar to the purchase of slaves, but concubines had a higher social status.

In the earliest records a man could have as many concubines as he could afford to purchase. From the Eastern Han period (AD 25–220) onward, the number of concubines a man could have was limited by law. The higher rank and the more noble identity a man possessed, the more concubines he was permitted to have. A concubine&#x27;s treatment and situation was variable and was influenced by the social status of the male to whom she was attached, as well as the attitude of his wife. In the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; chapter on &quot;The Pattern of the Family&quot; () it says, &quot;If there were betrothal rites, she became a wife; and if she went without these, a concubine.&quot; Wives brought a dowry to a relationship, but concubines did not. A concubinage relationship could be entered into without the ceremonies used in marriages, and neither remarriage nor a return to her natal home in widowhood were allowed to a concubine. There are early records of concubines allegedly being buried alive with their masters to &quot;keep them company in the afterlife&quot;.

The position of the concubine was generally inferior to that of the wife. Although a concubine could produce heirs, her children would be inferior in social status to a wife&#x27;s children, although they were of higher status than illegitimate children. The child of a concubine had to show filial duty to two women, their biological mother and their legal mother—the wife of their father. After the death of a concubine, her sons would make an offering to her, but these offerings were not continued by the concubine&#x27;s grandsons, who only made offerings to their grandfather&#x27;s wife.

Until the Song dynasty (960–1276), it was considered a serious breach of social ethics to promote a concubine to a wife. During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), the status of concubines improved. It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the original wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. During this period tablets for concubine-mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars, and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers. Many of the concubines of the emperor of the Qing dynasty were freeborn women from prominent families. Concubines of men of lower social status could be either freeborn or slave.

Imperial concubines, kept by emperors in the Forbidden City, had different ranks and were traditionally guarded by eunuchs to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor. In Ming China (1368–1644) there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor. The age of the candidates ranged mainly from 14 to 16. Virtues, behavior, character, appearance and body condition were the selection criteria.

Despite the limitations imposed on Chinese concubines, there are several examples in history and literature of concubines who achieved great power and influence. Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as Empress Dowager Cixi, was one of the most successful concubines in Chinese history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to Xianfeng Emperor and gave birth to his only surviving son, who later became Tongzhi Emperor. She eventually became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Qing China for 47 years after her husband&#x27;s death.

An examination of concubinage features in one of the Four Great Classical Novels, &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; (believed to be a semi-autobiographical account of author Cao Xueqin&#x27;s family life). Three generations of the Jia family are supported by one notable concubine of the emperor, Jia Yuanchun, the full elder sister of the male protagonist Jia Baoyu. In contrast, their younger half-siblings by concubine Zhao, Jia Tanchun and Jia Huan, develop distorted personalities because they are the children of a concubine.

Emperors&#x27; concubines and harems are emphasized in 21st-century romantic novels written for female readers and set in ancient times. As a plot element, the children of concubines are depicted with a status much inferior to that in actual history. The zhai dou (，residential intrigue) and gong dou (，harem intrigue) genres show concubines and wives, as well as their children, scheming secretly to gain power. Empresses in the Palace, a &quot;gong dou&quot; type novel and TV drama, has had great success in 21st-century China.

Hong Kong officially abolished the Great Qing Legal Code in 1971, thereby making concubinage illegal. Casino magnate Stanley Ho of Macau took his &quot;second wife&quot; as his official concubine in 1957, while his &quot;third and fourth wives&quot; retain no official status.

=== Mongols ===

Polygyny and concubinage were very common in Mongol society, especially for powerful Mongol men. Genghis Khan, Ögedei Khan, Jochi, Tolui, and Kublai Khan (among others) all had many wives and concubines.

Genghis Khan frequently acquired wives and concubines from empires and societies that he had conquered, these women were often princesses or queens that were taken captive or gifted to him. Genghis Khan&#x27;s most famous concubine was Möge Khatun, who, according to the Persian historian Ata-Malik Juvayni, was &quot;given to Chinggis Khan by a chief of the Bakrin tribe, and he loved her very much.&quot; After Genghis Khan died, Möge Khatun became a wife of Ögedei Khan. Ögedei also favored her as a wife, and she frequently accompanied him on his hunting expeditions.

=== Japan ===
Before monogamy was legally imposed in the Meiji period, concubinage was common among the nobility. Its purpose was to ensure male heirs. For example, the son of an Imperial concubine often had a chance of becoming emperor. Yanagihara Naruko, a high-ranking concubine of Emperor Meiji, gave birth to Emperor Taishō, who was later legally adopted by Empress Haruko, Emperor Meiji&#x27;s formal wife. Even among merchant families, concubinage was occasionally used to ensure heirs. Asako Hirooka, an entrepreneur who was the daughter of a concubine, worked hard to help her husband&#x27;s family survive after the Meiji Restoration. She lost her fertility giving birth to her only daughter, Kameko; so her husband—with whom she got along well—took Asako&#x27;s maid-servant as a concubine and fathered three daughters and a son with her. Kameko, as the child of the formal wife, married a noble man and matrilineally carried on the family name.

A samurai could take concubines but their backgrounds were checked by higher-ranked samurai. In many cases, taking a concubine was akin to a marriage. Kidnapping a concubine, although common in fiction, would have been shameful, if not criminal. If the concubine was a commoner, a messenger was sent with betrothal money or a note for exemption of tax to ask for her parents&#x27; acceptance. Even though the woman would not be a legal wife, a situation normally considered a demotion, many wealthy merchants believed that being the concubine of a samurai was superior to being the legal wife of a commoner. When a merchant&#x27;s daughter married a samurai, her family&#x27;s money erased the samurai&#x27;s debts, and the samurai&#x27;s social status improved the standing of the merchant family. If a samurai&#x27;s commoner concubine gave birth to a son, the son could inherit his father&#x27;s social status.

Concubines sometimes wielded significant influence. Nene, wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was known to overrule her husband&#x27;s decisions at times and Yodo-dono, his concubine, became the &quot;de facto&quot; master of Osaka castle and the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi&#x27;s death.

=== Korea ===
Joseon monarchs had a harem which contained concubines of different ranks. Empress Myeongseong managed to have sons, preventing sons of concubines from getting power.

Children of concubines often had lower value in account of marriage. A daughter of concubine could not marry a wife-born son of the same class. For example, Jang Nok-su was a concubine-born daughter of a mayor, who was initially married to a slave-servant, and later became a high-ranking concubine of Yeonsangun.

The Joseon dynasty established in 1392 debated whether the children of a free parent and a slave parent should be considered free or slave. The child of a scholar-official father and a slave-concubine mother was always free, although the child could not occupy government positions.

=== India ===

In Hindu society, concubinage was practiced with women with whom marriage was undesirable, such as a woman from an upper-caste or a Brahmin woman. Children born of concubinage followed the caste categorization of the mother.

Before the Independence of India, in Gujarat, the Bhil women were concubines for the Koli landlords.

In medieval Rajasthan, the ruling Rajput family often had certain women called &quot;paswan&quot;, &quot;khawaas&quot;, &quot;pardayat&quot;. These women were kept by the ruler if their beauty had impressed him, but without formal marriage. Sometimes they were given rights to income collected from a particular village, as queens did. Their children were socially accepted but did not receive a share in the ruling family&#x27;s property and married others of the same status as them.

Concubinage was practiced in elite Rajput households between 16th and 20th centuries.
Female slave-servants or slave-performers could be elevated to the rank of concubine (called &quot;khavas&quot;, &quot;pavas&quot;) if a ruler found them attractive. The entry into concubinage was marked by a ritual; however, this ritual differentiated from rituals marking marriage. Rajputs often took concubines from Jat, Gujjar, Muslim but did not take concubines from the untouchable castes and refrained from taking Charans, Brahmins, and other Rajputs. There are instances of wives eloping with their Rajput lovers and becoming their concubines.

==Europe==

=== Vikings ===
Polygyny occurred among Vikings, and rich and powerful Viking men could have more than one wife as well as concubines. Viking men could capture women and make them into their wives or concubines. Concubinage for Vikings was connected to slavery; the Vikings took both free women and slaves as concubines. Researchers have suggested that Vikings may have originally started sailing and raiding due to a need to seek out women from foreign lands. 
There are theories that polygynous relationships in Viking society could have led to a shortage of eligible women for the average male; polygyny increases male–male competition in society because it creates a pool of unmarried men willing to engage in risky status-elevating and sex-seeking behaviors. Thus, the average Viking man could have been forced to perform riskier actions to gain wealth and power to be able to find suitable women. 
The theory and concept was expressed in the 11th century by historian Dudo of Saint-Quentin in his semi imaginary &quot;History of The Normans&quot;. 
The Annals of Ulster depicts raptio and states that in 821 the Vikings plundered an Irish village and &quot;carried off a great number of women into captivity&quot;. 
People taken captive during the Viking raids in Western Europe, such as Ireland, could be sold to Moorish Spain via the Dublin slave trade or transported to Hedeby or Brännö and from there via the Volga trade route to present day Russia, where slaves and furs were sold to Muslim merchants in exchange for Arab silver &quot;dirham&quot; and silk, which have been found in Birka, Wollin and Dublin; initially this trade route between Europe and the Abbasid Caliphate passed via the Khazar Kaghanate, but from the early 10th-century onward it went via Volga Bulgaria and from there by caravan to Khwarazm, to the Samanid slave market in Central Asia and finally via Iran to the Abbasid Caliphate in the Middle East where there was a great market for slave girls as concubines.

=== Early Christianity and Feudalism ===

The Christian morals developed by Patristic writers largely promoted marriage as the only form of union between men and women. Both Saint Augustine and Saint Jerome strongly condemned the institution of concubinage. Emperor Justinian in his great sixth-century code, the Corpus Iurus Civilis, granted to concubines and their children the sorts of property and inheritance rights usually reserved for wives. He brought the institution of concubinatus closer to marriage, but he also repeated the Christian injunction that concubinage must be permanent and monogamous.

The two views, Christian condemnation and secular continuity with the Roman legal system, continued to be in conflict throughout the entire Middle Ages, until in the 14th and 15th centuries the Church outlawed concubinage in the territories under its control.

==Middle East==


In the historic Muslim Arab world, &quot;concubine&quot; (&quot;surriyya&quot;) referred to the female slave (&quot;jāriya&quot;), whether Muslim or non-Muslim, with whom her master engages in sexual intercourse in addition to household or other services. Such relationships were common in pre-Islamic Arabia and other pre-existing cultures of the wider region. Islam introduced legal restrictions and discipline to the concubinage and encouraged manumission. Islam furthermore endorsed educating (instruction in Islam), freeing or marrying female slaves if they embrace Islam abandoning polytheism or infidelity.

Acknowledged children of concubines are generally declared as legitimate with or without wedlock, and the mother of a free child was considered free upon the death of her male enslaver. There is evidence that concubines had a higher rank than female slaves. Abu Hanifa and others argued for modesty-like practices for the concubine, recommending that the concubine be established in the home and their chastity be protected and not to misuse them for sale or sharing with friends or kins. While scholars exhorted masters to treat their slaves equally, a master was allowed to show favoritism towards a concubine. 
Islamic scholars have disagreed on the exact interpretation. verse 23:6 in the Quran is believed by some Islamic scholars to say that it is allowed to have sexual intercourse with concubines after marrying them, as Islam forbids sexual intercourse outside of marriage. 
Some scholars recommended holding a wedding banquet (&quot;walima&quot;) to celebrate the concubinage relationship; however, this is not required in teachings of Islam and is rather the self-preferred opinions of certain non-liberal Islamic scholars. Even the Arabic term for concubine &quot;surriyya&quot; may have been derived from &quot;sarat&quot; meaning &quot;eminence&quot;, indicating the concubine&#x27;s higher status over other female slaves.

The Qur&#x27;an does not use the word &quot;surriyya&quot;, but instead uses the expression &quot;Ma malakat aymanukum&quot; (that which your right hands own), which occurs 15 times in the book. 
Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi explains that &quot;two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in one&#x27;s possession&quot;.

Some contend that concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practiced under Islam, with Jews and non-Muslim people to marry a concubine after teaching her, instructing her well and then giving her freedom. In the traditions of the Abrahamic religions, Abraham had a concubine named Hagar, who was originally a slave of his wife Sarah. The story of Hagar would affect how concubinage was perceived in early Islamic history.

Sikainiga writes that one rationale for concubinage in Islam was that &quot;it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the Muslim community.&quot; Most Islamic schools of thought restricted concubinage to a relationship where the female slave was required to be monogamous to her master, (though the master&#x27;s monogamy to her is not required), but according to Sikainga, in reality this was not always practiced and female slaves were targeted by other men of the master&#x27;s household. These opinions of Sikaingia are controversial and contested.
In ancient times, two sources for concubines were permitted under an Islamic regime. Primarily, non-Muslim women taken as prisoners of war were made concubines as happened after the Battle of the Trench, or in numerous later Caliphates.
It was encouraged to manumit slave women who rejected their initial faith and converted to Islam, or to bring them into formal marriage.

The expansion of various Muslim dynasties resulted in acquisitions of concubines, through purchase from the slave trade, gifts from other rulers, and captives of war. To have a large number of concubines became a symbol of status. Almost all Abbasid caliphs were born to concubines. The custom to have concubines was common in all Islamic dynasties until the abolition of slavery in the 20th-century. 
Similarly, the sultans of the Ottoman empire were often the son of a concubine. As a result, some individual concubines came to exercise a degree of influence over Ottoman politics. Some concubines developed social networks, and accumulated personal wealth, both of which allowed them to rise on social status. The practice declined with the abolition of slavery, starting in the 19th century and finally abolished in the Arabian Peninsula in the 1960s, with slavery in Saudi Arabia being banned in 1962 and slavery in Oman in 1970.

Ottoman sultans appeared to have preferred concubinage to marriage, and for a time all royal children were born of concubines. The consorts of Ottoman sultans were often neither Turkish, nor Muslim by birth. Leslie Peirce argues that this was because a concubine would not have the political leverage that would be possessed by a princess or a daughter of the local elite. Ottoman sultans also appeared to have only one son with each concubine; that is once a concubine gave birth to a son, the sultan would no longer have intercourse with her. This limited the power of each son.

==New World==
When slavery became institutionalized in Colonial America, white men, whether or not they were married, sometimes took enslaved women as concubines; children of such unions remained slaves.

In the various European colonies in the Caribbean, white planters took black and mulatto concubines, owing to the shortage of white women. The children of such unions were sometimes freed from slavery and even inherited from their father, though this was not the case for the majority of children born of such unions. These relationships appeared to have been socially accepted in the colony of Jamaica and even attracted European emigrants to the island.

=== Brazil ===
In colonial Brazil, men were expected to marry women who were equal to them in status and wealth. Alternatively, some men practiced concubinage, an extra-marital sexual relationship. This sort of relationship was condemned by the Catholic Church and the Council of Trent threatened those who engaged in it with excommunication. Concubines constituted both female slaves and former slaves. One reason for taking non-white women as concubines was that free white men outnumbered free white women, although marriage between races was not illegal.

=== New France ===
Some French settlers in New France were recorded to keep native women as &quot;concubines,&quot; sometimes while being married to a white woman. This was particularly common in Louisiana, but was discouraged by the clergy.

=== United States ===
Relationships with slaves in the United States and the Confederacy were sometimes euphemistically referred to as concubinary. From lifelong to single or serial sexual visitations, these relationships with enslaved people illustrate a radical power imbalance between a human owned as chattel, and the legal owner of same. When personal ownership of slaves was enshrined in the law, an enslaved person had no legal power over their own legal personhood, the legal control to which was held by another entity; therefore, a slave could never give real and legal consent in any aspect of their life. The inability to give any kind of consent when enslaved is in part due to the ability of a slave master to legally coerce acts and declarations including those of affection, attraction, and consent through rewards and punishments. Legally however, the concept of chattel slavery in the United States and Confederate States defined and enforced in the law owning the legal personhood of a slave; meaning that the proxy for legal consent was found with the slave&#x27;s master, who was the sole source of consent in the law to the bodily integrity and all efforts of that slave except as regulated or limited by law. With slavery being recognized as a crime against humanity in the United States law, as well as in international customary law, the legal basis of slavery is repudiated for all time, as are any rights which owner-rapists had had to exercise any proxy consent, sexual or otherwise for their slaves.

Free men in the United States sometimes took female slaves in relationships which they referred to as concubinage, although marriage between the races was prohibited by law in the colonies and the later United States. Many colonies and states also had laws against miscegenation or any interracial relations. From 1662 the Colony of Virginia, followed by others, incorporated into law the principle that children took their mother&#x27;s status, i.e., the principle of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;. This led to generations of multiracial slaves, some of whom were otherwise considered legally white (one-eighth or less African, equivalent to a great-grandparent) before the American Civil War.

In some cases, men had long-term relationships with enslaved women, giving them and their mixed-race children freedom and providing their children with apprenticeships, education and transfer of capital. A relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings is an example of this. Such arrangements were more prevalent in the American South during the antebellum period.

=== Plaçage ===

In Louisiana and former French territories, a formalized system of concubinage called &quot;plaçage&quot; developed. European men took enslaved or free women of color as mistresses after making arrangements to give them a dowry, house or other transfer of property, and sometimes, if they were enslaved, offering freedom and education for their children. A third class of free people of color developed, especially in New Orleans. Many became educated, artisans and property owners. French-speaking and practicing Catholicism, these women combined French and African-American culture and created an elite between those of European descent and the slaves. Today, descendants of the free people of color are generally called Louisiana Creole people.

== In Judaism ==
In Judaism, a concubine is a marital companion of inferior status to a wife. Among the Israelites, men commonly acknowledged their concubines, and such women enjoyed the same rights in the house as legitimate wives.

=== Ancient Judaism ===
The term concubine did not necessarily refer to women after the first wife. A man could have many wives and concubines. Legally, any children born to a concubine were considered to be the children of the wife she was under.
The concubine may not have commanded the exact amount of respect as the wife. In the Levitical rules on sexual relations, the Hebrew word that is commonly translated as &quot;wife&quot; is distinct from the Hebrew word that means &quot;concubine&quot;. However, on at least one other occasion the term is used to refer to a woman who is not a wife specifically, the handmaiden of Jacob&#x27;s wife. In the Levitical code, sexual intercourse between a man and a wife of a different man was forbidden and punishable by death for both persons involved. Since it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, wives often gave their maids to their husbands if they were barren, as in the case of Rachel and Bilhah. The children of the concubine often had equal rights with those of the wife; for example, King Abimelech was the son of Gideon and his concubine. Later biblical figures, such as Gideon and Solomon, had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the Books of Kings say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.
The account of the unnamed Levite in Judges 19–20 shows that the taking of concubines was not the exclusive preserve of kings or patriarchs in Israel during the time of the Judges, and that the rape of a concubine was completely unacceptable to the Israelite nation and led to a civil war. In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe, whose concubine was a woman from Bethlehem in Judah. This woman was unfaithful, and eventually abandoned him to return to her paternal household. However, after four months, the Levite, referred to as her husband, decided to travel to her father&#x27;s house to persuade his concubine to return. She is amenable to returning with him, and the father-in-law is very welcoming. The father-in-law convinces the Levite to remain several additional days, until the party leaves behind schedule in the late evening. The group pass up a nearby non-Israelite town to arrive very late in the city of Gibeah, which is in the land of the Benjaminites. The group sit around the town square, waiting for a local to invite them in for the evening, as was the custom for travelers. A local old man invites them to stay in his home, offering them guest right by washing their feet and offering them food. A band of wicked townsmen attack the house and demand the host send out the Levite man so they can rape him. The host offers to send out his virgin daughter as well as the Levite&#x27;s concubine for them to rape, to avoid breaking guest right towards the Levite. Eventually, to ensure his own safety and that of his host, the Levite gives the men his concubine, who is raped and abused through the night, until she is left collapsed against the front door at dawn. It is important to note that the Levite man chose to save himself from rape at the expense of his wife. In the morning, the Levite finds her when he tries to leave. When she fails to respond to her husband&#x27;s order to get up (possibly because she is dead, although the language is unclear) the Levite places her on his donkey and continues home. Once home, he dismembers her body and distributes the 12 parts throughout the nation of Israel. The Israelites gather to learn why they were sent such grisly gifts, and are told by the Levite of the sadistic rape of his concubine. The crime is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah, as well as the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support the Gibeans, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the 11 tribes in their war against the Benjaminites, and their 400 unmarried daughters given in forced marriage to the 600 Benjamite survivors. Finally, the 200 Benjaminite survivors who still have no wives are granted a mass marriage by abduction by the other tribes.

===Medieval and modern Judaism ===
In Judaism, concubines are referred to by the Hebrew term pilegesh (). The term is a loanword from Ancient Greek , meaning &quot;a mistress staying in house&quot;.

According to the Babylonian Talmud, the difference between a concubine and a legitimate wife was that the latter received a ketubah and her marriage (&quot;nissu&#x27;in&quot;) was preceded by an erusin (&quot;formal betrothal&quot;), which was not the case for a concubine. One opinion in the Jerusalem Talmud argues that the concubine should also receive a &quot;marriage contract&quot;, but without a clause specifying a divorce settlement. According to Rashi, &quot;wives with kiddushin and ketubbah, concubines with kiddushin but without ketubbah&quot;; this reading is from the Jerusalem Talmud,

Certain Jewish thinkers, such as Maimonides, believed that concubines were strictly reserved for royal leadership and thus that a commoner may not have a concubine. Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of sexual relations outside of a marriage. Maimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, Leviticus Rabbah severely condemns the custom. Other Jewish thinkers, such as Nahmanides, Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus, and Jacob Emden, strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden. Despite these prohibitions, concubinage remained widespread among Jewish households of the Ottoman empire and resembled the practice among the Muslim households.

In the Hebrew of the contemporary State of Israel, &quot;pilegesh&quot; is often used as the equivalent of the English word &quot;mistress&quot;—i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations—regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise &quot;pilegesh&quot; as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by Jewish law).

== Concubinage and slavery ==
In some context, the institution of concubinage diverged from a free quasi-marital cohabitation to the extent that it was forbidden to a free woman to be involved in a concubinage and the institution was reserved only to slaves. This type of concubinage was practiced in patriarchal cultures throughout history. Many societies automatically freed the concubine after she had a child. Among societies that did not legally require the manumission of concubines, it was usually done anyway. In slave-owning societies, most concubines were slaves, but not all. The feature of concubinage that made it attractive to certain men was that the concubine was dependent on the man; she could be sold or punished at the master&#x27;s will. According to Orlando Peterson, slaves taken as concubines would have had a higher level of material comfort than the slaves used in agriculture or in mining.

<text>Central Plaza is a 78-storey, skyscraper at 18 Harbour Road, in Wan Chai on Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong. Completed in August 1992, it is the third tallest tower in the city after 2 International Finance Centre (2 IFC) in Central and the International Commerce Centre in West Kowloon. It was the tallest building in Asia from 1992 to 1996, until the Shun Hing Square was built in Shenzhen, a neighbouring city. Central Plaza surpassed the Bank of China Tower as the tallest building in Hong Kong until the completion of 2 IFC.

Central Plaza was also the tallest reinforced concrete building in the world, until it was surpassed by CITIC Plaza, Guangzhou in 1996. The building uses a triangular floor plan. On the top of the tower is a four-bar neon clock that indicates the time by displaying different colours for 15-minute periods, blinking at the change of the quarter.

An anemometer is installed on the tip of the building&#x27;s mast, at above sea level. The mast has a height of . Central Plaza also houses the world&#x27;s highest church inside a skyscraper, Sky City Church.

==History==
The land upon which Central Plaza sits was reclaimed from Victoria Harbour in the 1970s. The site was auctioned off by the Hong Kong Government at City Hall Theatre on 25 January 1989. It was sold for a record HK$3.35 billion to a joint venture called &quot;Cheer City Properties&quot;, owned 50 per cent by Sun Hung Kai Properties and 50 per cent by fellow real estate conglomerate Sino Land and their major shareholder the Ng Teng Fong family. A third developer, Ryoden Development, joined the consortium afterwards. Ryoden Development disposed off its 5% interest for 190,790 square feet of office space in New Kowloon Plaza from Sun Hung Kai in 1995.

The first major tenant to sign a lease was the Provisional Airport Authority, which on 2 August 1991 agreed to lease the 24th to 26th floors. A topping-out ceremony, presided over by Sir David Ford, was held on 9 April 1992.

==Design==

Central Plaza is made up of two principal components: a free standing office tower and a podium block attached to it. The tower is made up of three sections: a tower base forming the main entrance and public circulation spaces; a tower body containing 57 office floors, a sky lobby and five mechanical plant floors; and the tower top consisting of six mechanical plant floors and a tower mast.

The ground level public area along with the public sitting out area form an landscaped garden with a fountain, trees and artificial stone paving. No commercial element is included in the podium. The first level is a public thoroughfare for three pedestrian bridges linking the Mass Transit Railway, the Convention and Exhibition Centre and the China Resources Building. By converting these space for public use, the building gained 20% more plot ratio. The shape of the tower is not truly triangular with its three corners truncated to provide better internal office spaces.

Central Plaza was designed by the Hong Kong architectural firm Ng Chun Man and Associates (since renamed Dennis Lau &amp; Ng Chun Man Architects, or DLN) and engineered by Arup. The main contractor was a joint venture, comprising the contracting firms Sanfield (a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai) and Tat Lee, called Manloze Ltd.

=== Design constraints ===

==== Triangular shaped floor plan ====
The building was designed to be triangular in shape because it would allow 20% more of the office area to enjoy the harbour view as compared to square or rectangular shaped buildings. From an architectural point of view, this arrangement provides better floor area utilisation, offering an internal column-free office area with a clear depth of and an overall usable floor area efficiency of 81%.
Nonetheless, the triangular building plan causes the air handling unit (AHU) room in the internal core to also assume a triangular configuration. With only limited space, this makes the adoption of a standard AHU not feasible. Furthermore, all air-conditioning ducting, electrical trunking and piping gathered inside the core area has to be squeezed into a very narrow and congested corridor ceiling void.

==== Super high-rise building ====
As the building is situated opposite the Hong Kong Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre, the best to maximise the harbour views for the building and to not be obstructed by the neighbouring high-rise buildings was to design it to be tall enough to clear the height of neighbouring buildings. However, designing tall buildings bring several difficulties in structural and building services design. For example, excessive system static pressure in water systems, high line voltage drop, and a long distance of vertical transportation (resulting in long waits for elevators). All these problems can increase the capital cost of the building systems and impair the safety operations of the building.

==== Maximum clear ceiling height ====
As a general practice, achieving a clear height of , and a floor-to-floor height of would be required. However, due to the high Wind load in Hong Kong for such a tall high-rise building, every increase in building height per metre would increase the structural cost by more than HK$1 million (HK$304,800 per ft). Therefore, a comprehensive study was conducted and finally a floor height of was adopted. With this issue alone, an estimated construction cost saving for a total of 58 office floors, would be around HK$30 million. Yet at the same time, a maximum ceiling height of in office area could still be achieved with careful coordination and dedicated integration.

==== Structural constraints ====

*The site was a newly reclaimed area with a maximum water table rise of about below ground level. In the original brief, a 6-storey basement was required, therefore a diaphragm wall design was chosen.
*The diaphragm wall design allowed for the basement to be constructed by the top-down method. It allowed the superstructure to be constructed at the same time as the basement, thereby removing time-consuming basement construction period from the critical path.
*Wind loading was another major design criterion as Hong Kong is often affected by typhoons. Not only must the structure be able to resist the loads generally and the cladding system and its fixings resist higher local loads, but the building must also perform dynamically in an acceptable manner such that predicted movements lie within acceptable standards of occupant comfort criteria. To ensure that all aspects of the building&#x27;s performance in strong winds would be acceptable, a detailed wind tunnel study was carried out by Professor Alan Davenport at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory at the University of Western Ontario.

==== Steel structure vs. reinforced concrete ====
Steel structures are more commonly adopted in high-rise buildings. In the original scheme, an externally cross-braced framed tube was applied with primary/secondary beams carrying metal decking with reinforced concrete slab. The core was also composed of steelwork, designed to carry vertical loads only. Later after a financial review by the developer, they decided to reduce the height of the superstructure by increasing the size of the floor plate so as to reduce the complex architectural requirements of the tower base which means a high strength concrete solution became possible.

In the final scheme, columns at centres and floor edge beams were used to replace the large steel corner columns. As climbing form and table form construction method and efficient construction management are used in this project which make this reinforced concrete structure take no longer construction time than the steel structure. And the most attractive point is that the reinforced concrete scheme can save HK$230 million compared to that of steel structure. Hence the reinforced concrete structure was adopted and Central Plaza is now one of the tallest reinforced concrete buildings in the world.

In the reinforced concrete structure scheme, the core has a similar arrangement to the steel scheme and the wind shear is taken out from the core at the lowest basement level and transferred to the perimeter diaphragm walls. In order to reduce large shear reversals in the core walls in the basement, and at the top of the tower base level, the ground floor, basement levels 1 and 2 and the 5th and 6th floors, the floor slabs and beams are separated horizontally from the core walls.

Another advantage of using reinforced concrete structure is that it is more flexible to cope with changes in structural layout, sizes and height according to the site conditions by using table form system.

==Trivia==

This skyscraper was visited in the seventh leg of the reality TV show &quot;The Amazing Race 2&quot;, which described Central Plaza as &quot;the tallest building in Hong Kong&quot; (despite this being inaccurate). Although contestants were told to reach the top floor, the actual task was performed on the 46th floor.

<text>Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (also Michele Angelo Merigi or Amerighi da Caravaggio; , ; ; 29 September 1571 – 18 July 1610), known mononymously as Caravaggio, was an Italian painter active in Rome for most of his artistic life. During the final four years of his life, he moved between Naples, Malta, and Sicily until his death. His paintings have been characterized by art critics as combining a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, which had a formative influence on Baroque painting.

Caravaggio employed close physical observation with a dramatic use of chiaroscuro that came to be known as tenebrism. He made the technique a dominant stylistic element, transfixing subjects in bright shafts of light and darkening shadows. Caravaggio vividly expressed crucial moments and scenes, often featuring violent struggles, torture, and death. He worked rapidly with live models, preferring to forgo drawings and work directly onto the canvas. His inspiring effect on the new Baroque style that emerged from Mannerism was profound. His influence can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of Peter Paul Rubens, Jusepe de Ribera, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, and Rembrandt. Artists heavily under his influence were called the &quot;Caravaggisti&quot; (or &quot;Caravagesques&quot;), as well as tenebrists or &quot;tenebrosi&quot; (&quot;shadowists&quot;).

Caravaggio trained as a painter in Milan before moving to Rome when he was in his twenties. He developed a considerable name as an artist and as a violent, touchy and provocative man. He killed Ranuccio Tommasoni in a brawl, which led to a death sentence for murder and forced him to flee to Naples. There he again established himself as one of the most prominent Italian painters of his generation. He travelled to Malta and on to Sicily in 1607 and pursued a papal pardon for his sentence. In 1609, he returned to Naples, where he was involved in a violent clash; his face was disfigured, and rumours of his death circulated. Questions about his mental state arose from his erratic and bizarre behavior. He died in 1610 under uncertain circumstances while on his way from Naples to Rome. Reports stated that he died of a fever, but suggestions have been made that he was murdered or that he died of lead poisoning.

Caravaggio&#x27;s innovations inspired Baroque painting, but the latter incorporated the drama of his chiaroscuro without the psychological realism. The style evolved and fashions changed, and Caravaggio fell out of favour. In the 20th century, interest in his work revived, and his importance to the development of Western art was reevaluated. The 20th-century art historian stated: &quot;What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting.&quot;

== Biography ==

=== Early life (1571–1592) ===

Caravaggio (Michelangelo Merisi or Amerighi) was born in Milan, where his father, Fermo (Fermo Merixio), was a household administrator and architect-decorator to the marquess of Caravaggio, a town to the east of Milan and south of Bergamo. In 1576 the family moved to Caravaggio to escape a plague that ravaged Milan, and Caravaggio&#x27;s father and grandfather both died there on the same day in 1577. It is assumed that the artist grew up in Caravaggio, but his family kept up connections with the Sforzas and the powerful Colonna family, who were allied by marriage with the Sforzas and destined to play a major role later in Caravaggio&#x27;s life.

Caravaggio&#x27;s mother had to raise all of her five children in poverty. She died in 1584, the same year he began his four-year apprenticeship to the Milanese painter Simone Peterzano, described in the contract of apprenticeship as a pupil of Titian. Caravaggio appears to have stayed in the Milan-Caravaggio area after his apprenticeship ended, but it is possible that he visited Venice and saw the works of Giorgione, whom Federico Zuccari later accused him of imitating, and Titian. He would also have become familiar with the art treasures of Milan, including Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot;, and with the regional Lombard art, a style that valued simplicity and attention to naturalistic detail and was closer to the naturalism of Germany than to the stylised formality and grandeur of Roman Mannerism.

=== Beginnings in Rome (1592/95–1600) ===

Following his initial training under Simone Peterzano, in 1592, Caravaggio left Milan for Rome in flight after &quot;certain quarrels&quot; and the wounding of a police officer. The young artist arrived in Rome &quot;naked and extremely needy... without fixed address and without provision... short of money.&quot; During this period, he stayed with the miserly Pandolfo Pucci, known as &quot;monsignor Insalata&quot;. A few months later he was performing hack-work for the highly successful Giuseppe Cesari, Pope Clement VIII&#x27;s favourite artist, &quot;painting flowers and fruit&quot; in his factory-like workshop.

In Rome, there was a demand for paintings to fill the many huge new churches and palaces being built at the time. It was also a period when the Church was searching for a stylistic alternative to Mannerism in religious art that was tasked to counter the threat of Protestantism. Caravaggio&#x27;s innovation was a radical naturalism that combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, use of chiaroscuro that came to be known as tenebrism (the shift from light to dark with little intermediate value).

Known works from this period include the small &quot;Boy Peeling a Fruit&quot; (his earliest known painting), &quot;Boy with a Basket of Fruit&quot;, and &quot;Young Sick Bacchus&quot;, supposedly a self-portrait done during convalescence from a serious illness that ended his employment with Cesari. All three demonstrate the physical particularity for which Caravaggio was to become renowned: the fruit-basket-boy&#x27;s produce has been analyzed by a professor of horticulture, who was able to identify individual cultivars right down to &quot;...a large fig leaf with a prominent fungal scorch lesion resembling anthracnose (&quot;Glomerella cingulata&quot;).&quot;

Caravaggio left Cesari, determined to make his own way after a heated argument. At this point he forged some extremely important friendships, with the painter Prospero Orsi, the architect Onorio Longhi, and the sixteen-year-old Sicilian artist Mario Minniti. Orsi, established in the profession, introduced him to influential collectors; Longhi, more balefully, introduced him to the world of Roman street brawls. Minniti served Caravaggio as a model and, years later, would be instrumental in helping him to obtain important commissions in Sicily. Ostensibly, the first archival reference to Caravaggio in a contemporary document from Rome is the listing of his name, with that of Prospero Orsi as his partner, as an &#x27;assistant&#x27; in a procession in October 1594 in honour of St. Luke. The earliest informative account of his life in the city is a court transcript dated 11 July 1597, when Caravaggio and Prospero Orsi were witnesses to a crime near San Luigi de&#x27; Francesi.

&quot;The Fortune Teller&quot;, his first composition with more than one figure, shows a boy, likely Minniti, having his palm read by a Romani girl, who is stealthily removing his ring as she strokes his hand. The theme was quite new for Rome and proved immensely influential over the next century and beyond. However, at the time, Caravaggio sold it for practically nothing. &quot;The Cardsharps&quot;—showing another naïve youth of privilege falling victim to card cheats—is even more psychologically complex and perhaps Caravaggio&#x27;s first true masterpiece. Like &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot;, it was immensely popular, and over 50 copies survived. More importantly, it attracted the patronage of Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte, one of the leading connoisseurs in Rome. For del Monte and his wealthy art-loving circle, Caravaggio executed a number of intimate chamber-pieces—&quot;The Musicians&quot;, &quot;The Lute Player&quot;, a tipsy &quot;Bacchus&quot;, and an allegorical but realistic &quot;Boy Bitten by a Lizard&quot;—featuring Minniti and other adolescent models.
Caravaggio&#x27;s first paintings on religious themes returned to realism and the emergence of remarkable spirituality. The first of these was the &quot;Penitent Magdalene&quot;, showing Mary Magdalene at the moment when she has turned from her life as a courtesan and sits weeping on the floor, her jewels scattered around her. &quot;It seemed not a religious painting at all ... a girl sitting on a low wooden stool drying her hair ... Where was the repentance ... suffering ... promise of salvation?&quot; It was understated, in the Lombard manner, not histrionic in the Roman manner of the time. It was followed by others in the same style: &quot;Saint Catherine&quot;; &quot;Martha and Mary Magdalene&quot;; &quot;Judith Beheading Holofernes&quot;; &quot;Sacrifice of Isaac&quot;; &quot;Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy&quot;; and &quot;Rest on the Flight into Egypt&quot;. These works, while viewed by a comparatively limited circle, increased Caravaggio&#x27;s fame with both connoisseurs and his fellow artists. But a true reputation would depend on public commissions, for which it was necessary to look to the Church.

Already evident was the intense realism or naturalism for which Caravaggio is now famous. He preferred to paint his subjects as the eye sees them, with all their natural flaws and defects, instead of as idealised creations. This allowed a full display of his virtuosic talents. This shift from accepted standard practice and the classical idealism of Michelangelo was very controversial at the time. Caravaggio also dispensed with the lengthy preparations for a painting that were traditional in central Italy at the time. Instead, he preferred the Venetian practice of working in oils directly from the subject—half-length figures and still life. &quot;Supper at Emmaus&quot;, from , is a characteristic work of this period demonstrating his virtuoso talent.

=== &quot;Most famous painter in Rome&quot; (1600–1606) ===

In 1599, presumably through the influence of del Monte, Caravaggio was contracted to decorate the Contarelli Chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi. The two works making up the commission, &quot;The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew&quot; and &quot;The Calling of Saint Matthew&quot;, delivered in 1600, were an immediate sensation. Thereafter he never lacked commissions or patrons.

Caravaggio&#x27;s tenebrism (a heightened chiaroscuro) brought high drama to his subjects, while his acutely observed realism brought a new level of emotional intensity. Opinion among his artist peers was polarized. Some denounced him for various perceived failings, notably his insistence on painting from life, without drawings, but for the most part he was hailed as a great artistic visionary: &quot;The painters then in Rome were greatly taken by this novelty, and the young ones particularly gathered around him, praised him as the unique imitator of nature, and looked on his work as miracles.&quot;

Caravaggio went on to secure a string of prestigious commissions for religious works featuring violent struggles, grotesque decapitations, torture, and death. Most notable and technically masterful among them were &quot;The Incredulity of Saint Thomas&quot; (circa 1601) and &quot;The Taking of Christ&quot; (circa 1602) the latter only rediscovered in the 1990s in Dublin after remaining unrecognized for two centuries. For the most part, each new painting increased his fame, but a few were rejected by the various bodies for whom they were intended, at least in their original forms, and had to be re-painted or find new buyers. The essence of the problem was that while Caravaggio&#x27;s dramatic intensity was appreciated, his realism was seen by some as unacceptably vulgar.

His first version of &quot;Saint Matthew and the Angel&quot;, featuring the saint as a bald peasant with dirty legs attended by a lightly clad over-familiar boy-angel, was rejected and a second version had to be painted as &quot;The Inspiration of Saint Matthew&quot;. Similarly, &quot;The Conversion of Saint Paul&quot; was rejected, and while another version of the same subject, the &quot;Conversion on the Way to Damascus&quot;, was accepted, it featured the saint&#x27;s horse&#x27;s haunches far more prominently than the saint himself, prompting this exchange between the artist and an exasperated official of Santa Maria del Popolo: &quot;Why have you put a horse in the middle, and Saint Paul on the ground?&quot; &quot;Because!&quot; &quot;Is the horse God?&quot; &quot;No, but he stands in God&#x27;s light!&quot;

The aristocratic collector Ciriaco Mattei, brother of Cardinal Girolamo Mattei, who was friends with Cardinal Francesco Maria Bourbon Del Monte, gave &quot;The Supper at Emmaus&quot; to the city palace he shared with his brother, 1601 (National Gallery, London), The Incredulity of Saint Thomas, , &quot;Ecclesiastical Version&quot; (Private Collection, Florence), The Incredulity of Saint Thomas , 1601 &quot;Secular Version&quot; (Sanssouci Palace, Potsdam), John the Baptist with the Ram, 1602 (Capitoline Museums, Rome) and &quot;The Taking of Christ&quot;, 1602 (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin) Caravaggio commissioned.

The second version of &quot;The Taking of Christ&quot;, which was looted from the Odessa Museum in 2008 and recovered in 2010, is believed by some experts to be a contemporary copy.

&quot;The Incredulity of Saint Thomas&quot; is one of the most famous paintings by Caravaggio, circa 1601–1602. It entered the Prussian Royal Collection, survived the Second World War unscathed, and can be viewed in the Palais in Sanssouci, Potsdam. 

The painting depicts the episode that led to the term &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot;—in art history formally known as &quot;The Incredulity of Saint Thomas&quot;—which has been frequently depicted and used to make various theological statements in Christian art since at least the 5th century. According to the Gospel of John, Thomas the Apostle missed one of Jesus&#x27; appearances to the apostles after his resurrection and said, &quot;Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands, and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.&quot; A week later, Jesus appeared and told Thomas to touch him and stop doubting. Then Jesus said, &quot;Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&quot;

The painting shows in a demonstrative gesture how the doubting apostle puts his finger into Christ&#x27;s side wound, the latter guiding his hand. The unbeliever is depicted like a peasant, dressed in a robe torn at the shoulder and with dirt under his fingernails. The composition of the picture is designed in such a way that the viewer is directly involved in the event and feels the intensity of the event.

Other works included &quot;Entombment&quot;, the &quot;Madonna di Loreto&quot; (&quot;Madonna of the Pilgrims&quot;), the &quot;Grooms&#x27; Madonna&quot;, and &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot;. The history of these last two paintings illustrates the reception given to some of Caravaggio&#x27;s art and the times in which he lived. The &quot;Grooms&#x27; Madonna&quot;, also known as &quot;Madonna dei palafrenieri&quot;, painted for a small altar in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, remained there for just two days and was then removed. A cardinal&#x27;s secretary wrote: &quot;In this painting, there are but vulgarity, sacrilege, impiousness and disgust...One would say it is a work made by a painter that can paint well, but of a dark spirit, and who has been for a lot of time far from God, from His adoration, and from any good thought...&quot;

&quot;Death of the Virgin&quot;, commissioned in 1601 by a wealthy jurist for his private chapel in the new Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala, was rejected by the Carmelites in 1606. Caravaggio&#x27;s contemporary Giulio Mancini records that it was rejected because Caravaggio had used a well-known prostitute as his model for the Virgin. Giovanni Baglione, another contemporary, tells that it was due to Mary&#x27;s bare legs—a matter of decorum in either case. Caravaggio scholar John Gash suggests that the problem for the Carmelites may have been theological rather than aesthetic, in that Caravaggio&#x27;s version fails to assert the doctrine of the Assumption of Mary, the idea that the Mother of God did not die in any ordinary sense but was assumed into Heaven. The replacement altarpiece commissioned (from one of Caravaggio&#x27;s most able followers, Carlo Saraceni), showed the Virgin not dead, as Caravaggio had painted her, but seated and dying; and even this was rejected, and replaced with a work showing the Virgin not dying, but ascending into Heaven with choirs of angels. In any case, the rejection did not mean that Caravaggio or his paintings were out of favour. &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot; was no sooner taken out of the church than it was purchased by the Duke of Mantua, on the advice of Rubens, and later acquired by Charles I of England before entering the French royal collection in 1671.

One secular piece from these years is &quot;Amor Vincit Omnia&quot;, in English also called &quot;Amor Victorious&quot;, painted in 1602 for Vincenzo Giustiniani, a member of del Monte&#x27;s circle. The model was named in a memoir of the early 17th century as &quot;Cecco&quot;, the diminutive for Francesco. He is possibly Francesco Boneri, identified with an artist active in the period 1610–1625 and known as Cecco del Caravaggio (&#x27;Caravaggio&#x27;s Cecco&#x27;), carrying a bow and arrows and trampling symbols of the warlike and peaceful arts and sciences underfoot. He is unclothed, and it is difficult to accept this grinning urchin as the Roman god Cupid—as difficult as it was to accept Caravaggio&#x27;s other semi-clad adolescents as the various angels he painted in his canvases, wearing much the same stage-prop wings. The point, however, is the intense yet ambiguous reality of the work: it is simultaneously Cupid and Cecco, as Caravaggio&#x27;s Virgins were simultaneously the Mother of Christ and the Roman courtesans who modeled for them.

=== Legal problems and flight from Rome (1606) ===

Caravaggio led a tumultuous life. He was notorious for brawling, even in a time and place when such behavior was commonplace, and the transcripts of his police records and trial proceedings fill many pages.

Bellori claims that around 1590–1592, Caravaggio, already well known for brawling with gangs of young men, committed a murder which forced him to flee from Milan, first to Venice and then to Rome.

On 28 November 1600, while living at the Palazzo Madama with his patron Cardinal Del Monte, Caravaggio beat nobleman Girolamo Stampa da Montepulciano, a guest of the cardinal, with a club, resulting in an official complaint to the police. Episodes of brawling, violence, and tumult grew more and more frequent. Caravaggio was often arrested and jailed at Tor di Nona.

After his release from jail in 1601, Caravaggio returned to paint first &quot;The Taking of Christ&quot; and then &quot;Amor Vincit Omnia&quot;. In 1603, he was arrested again, this time for the defamation of another painter, Giovanni Baglione, who sued Caravaggio and his followers Orazio Gentileschi and Onorio Longhi for writing offensive poems about him. The French ambassador intervened, and Caravaggio was transferred to house arrest after a month in jail in Tor di Nona.

Between May and October 1604, Caravaggio was arrested several times for possession of illegal weapons and for insulting the city guards. He was also sued by a tavern waiter for having thrown a plate of artichokes in his face.

An early published notice on Caravaggio, dating from 1604 and describing his lifestyle three years previously, recounts that &quot;after a fortnight&#x27;s work he will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him, from one ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument, so that it is most awkward to get along with him.&quot;

In 1605, Caravaggio was forced to flee to Genoa for three weeks after seriously injuring Mariano Pasqualone di Accumoli, a notary, in a dispute over Lena, Caravaggio&#x27;s model and lover. The notary reported having been attacked on 29 July with a sword, causing a severe head injury. Caravaggio&#x27;s patrons intervened and managed to cover up the incident.

Upon his return to Rome, Caravaggio was sued by his landlady Prudenzia Bruni for not having paid his rent. Out of spite, Caravaggio threw rocks through her window at night and was sued again.

In November, Caravaggio was hospitalized for an injury which he claimed he had caused himself by falling on his own sword.

On 29 May 1606, Caravaggio killed a young man, possibly unintentionally, resulting in his fleeing Rome with a death sentence hanging over him. Ranuccio Tomassoni was a gangster from a wealthy family. The two had argued many times, often ending in blows. The circumstances are unclear, whether a brawl or a duel with swords at Campo Marzio, but the killing may have been unintentional.

Many rumours circulated at the time as to the cause of the fight. Several contemporary &quot;avvisi&quot; referred to a quarrel over a gambling debt and a pallacorda game, a sort of tennis, and this explanation has become established in the popular imagination. Other rumours, however, claimed that the duel stemmed from jealousy over Fillide Melandroni, a well-known Roman prostitute who had modeled for him in several important paintings; Tomassoni was her pimp. According to such rumours, Caravaggio castrated Tomassoni with his sword before deliberately killing him, with other versions claiming that Tomassoni&#x27;s death had been caused accidentally during the castration. The duel may have had a political dimension, as Tomassoni&#x27;s family was notoriously pro-Spanish, whereas Caravaggio was a client of the French ambassador.

Caravaggio&#x27;s patrons had hitherto been able to shield him from any serious consequences of his frequent duels and brawling, but Tomassoni&#x27;s wealthy family was outraged by his death and demanded justice. Caravaggio&#x27;s patrons were unable to protect him. Caravaggio was sentenced to beheading for murder, and an open bounty was decreed, enabling anyone who recognized him to carry out the sentence legally. Caravaggio&#x27;s paintings began, obsessively, to depict severed heads, often his own, at this time.

Good modern accounts are to be found in Peter Robb&#x27;s &quot;M&quot; and Helen Langdon&#x27;s &quot;Caravaggio: A Life&quot;. A theory relating the death to Renaissance notions of honour and symbolic wounding has been advanced by art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon. Whatever the details, it was a serious matter.
Caravaggio was forced to flee Rome. He moved just south of the city, then to Naples, Malta, and Sicily.

=== Exile and death (1606–1610) ===

==== Naples ====
Following the death of Tomassoni, Caravaggio fled first to the estates of the Colonna family south of Rome and then on to Naples, where Costanza Colonna Sforza, widow of Francesco Sforza, in whose husband&#x27;s household Caravaggio&#x27;s father had held a position, maintained a palace. In Naples, outside the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities and protected by the Colonna family, the most famous painter in Rome became the most famous in Naples.
His connections with the Colonnas led to a stream of important church commissions, including the &quot;Madonna of the Rosary&quot;, and &quot;The Seven Works of Mercy&quot;. &quot;The Seven Works of Mercy&quot; depicts the seven corporal works of mercy as a set of compassionate acts concerning the material needs of others. The painting was made for and is still housed in the church of Pio Monte della Misericordia in Naples. Caravaggio combined all seven works of mercy in one composition, which became the church&#x27;s altarpiece. Alessandro Giardino has also established the connection between the iconography of &quot;The Seven Works of Mercy&quot; and the cultural, scientific and philosophical circles of the painting&#x27;s commissioners.

==== Malta ====
Despite his success in Naples, after only a few months in the city Caravaggio left for Hospitaller Malta, the headquarters of the Knights of Malta. Fabrizio Sforza Colonna, Costanza&#x27;s son, was a Knight of Malta and general of the Order&#x27;s galleys. He appears to have facilitated Caravaggio&#x27;s arrival on the island in 1607 (and his escape the next year). Caravaggio presumably hoped that the patronage of Alof de Wignacourt, Grand Master of the Knights of Saint John, could help him secure a pardon for Tomassoni&#x27;s death. Wignacourt was so impressed at having the artist as official painter to the Order that he inducted him as a Knight, and the early biographer Bellori records that the artist was well pleased with his success. Wignacourt reportedly gifted some slaves to Caravaggio in recognition for his services.

Major works from his Malta period include the &quot;Beheading of Saint John the Baptist&quot;, his largest ever work, and the only painting to which he put his signature, &quot;Saint Jerome Writing&quot; (both housed in Saint John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral, Valletta, Malta) and a &quot;Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page&quot;, as well as portraits of other leading Knights. According to Andrea Pomella, &quot;The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist&quot; is widely considered &quot;one of the most important works in Western painting.&quot; Completed in 1608, the painting had been commissioned by the Knights of Malta as an altarpiece and measuring was the largest altarpiece Caravaggio painted. It still hangs in St. John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral, for which it was commissioned and where Caravaggio himself was inducted and briefly served as a knight.

Yet, by late August 1608, he was arrested and imprisoned, likely the result of yet another brawl, this time with an aristocratic knight, during which the door of a house was battered down and the knight seriously wounded. Caravaggio was imprisoned by the Knights at Valletta, but he managed to escape. By December, he had been expelled from the Order &quot;as a foul and rotten member&quot;, a formal phrase used in all such cases.

==== Sicily ====

Caravaggio made his way to Sicily where he met his old friend Mario Minniti, who was now married and living in Syracuse. Together they set off on what amounted to a triumphal tour from Syracuse to Messina and, maybe, on to the island capital, Palermo. In Syracuse and Messina Caravaggio continued to win prestigious and well-paid commissions. Among other works from this period are &quot;Burial of St. Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Raising of Lazarus&quot;, and &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot;. His style continued to evolve, showing now friezes of figures isolated against vast empty backgrounds. &quot;His great Sicilian altarpieces isolate their shadowy, pitifully poor figures in vast areas of darkness; they suggest the desperate fears and frailty of man, and at the same time convey, with a new yet desolate tenderness, the beauty of humility and of the meek, who shall inherit the earth.&quot; Contemporary reports depict a man whose behaviour was becoming increasingly bizarre, which included sleeping fully armed and in his clothes, ripping up a painting at a slight word of criticism, and mocking local painters.

Caravaggio displayed bizarre behaviour from very early in his career. Mancini describes him as &quot;extremely crazy&quot;, a letter from Del Monte notes his strangeness, and Minniti&#x27;s 1724 biographer says that Mario left Caravaggio because of his behaviour. The strangeness seems to have increased after Malta. Susinno&#x27;s early-18th-century &quot;Le vite de&#x27; pittori Messinesi&quot; (&quot;Lives of the Painters of Messina&quot;) provides several colourful anecdotes of Caravaggio&#x27;s erratic behaviour in Sicily, and these are reproduced in modern full-length biographies such as Langdon and Robb. Bellori writes of Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;fear&quot; driving him from city to city across the island and finally, &quot;feeling that it was no longer safe to remain&quot;, back to Naples. Baglione says Caravaggio was being &quot;chased by his enemy&quot;, but like Bellori does not say who this enemy was.

==== Return to Naples ====

After only nine months in Sicily, Caravaggio returned to Naples in the late summer of 1609. According to his earliest biographer, he was being pursued by enemies while in Sicily and felt it safest to place himself under the protection of the Colonnas until he could secure his pardon from the pope (now Paul V) and return to Rome. In Naples he painted &quot;The Denial of Saint Peter&quot;, a final &quot;John the Baptist (Borghese)&quot;, and his last picture, &quot;The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula&quot;. His style continued to evolve—Saint Ursula is caught in a moment of highest action and drama, as the arrow fired by the king of the Huns strikes her in the breast, unlike earlier paintings that had all the immobility of the posed models. The brushwork was also much freer and more impressionistic.
In October 1609, he was involved in a violent clash, an attempt on his life, perhaps ambushed by men in the pay of the knight he had wounded in Malta or some other faction of the Order. His face was seriously disfigured and rumours circulated in Rome that he was dead. He painted a &quot;Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid)&quot;, showing his own head on a platter, and sent it to Wignacourt as a plea for forgiveness. Perhaps at this time, he also painted a &quot;David with the Head of Goliath&quot;, showing the young David with a strangely sorrowful expression gazing at the severed head of the giant, which is again Caravaggio. This painting he may have sent to his patron, the unscrupulous art-loving Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of the pope, who had the power to grant or withhold pardons. Caravaggio hoped Borghese could mediate a pardon in exchange for works by the artist.

News from Rome encouraged Caravaggio, and in the summer of 1610, he took a boat northwards to receive the pardon, which seemed imminent thanks to his powerful Roman friends. With him were three last paintings, the gifts for Cardinal Scipione. What happened next is the subject of much confusion and conjecture, shrouded in much mystery.

The bare facts seem to be that on 28 July, an anonymous &quot;avviso&quot; (private newsletter) from Rome to the ducal court of Urbino reported that Caravaggio was dead. Three days later, another &quot;avviso&quot; said that he had died of fever on his way from Naples to Rome. A poet friend of the artist later gave 18 July as the date of death, and a recent researcher claims to have discovered a death notice showing that the artist died on that day of a fever in Porto Ercole, near Grosseto in Tuscany.

=== Death ===

Caravaggio had a fever at the time of his death, and what killed him was a matter of controversy and rumour at the time and has been a matter of historical debate and study since. Contemporary rumours held that either the Tomassoni family or the Knights had him killed in revenge. Traditionally historians have long thought he died of syphilis. Some have said he had malaria, or possibly brucellosis from unpasteurised dairy. Some scholars have argued that Caravaggio was actually attacked and killed by the same &quot;enemies&quot; that had been pursuing him since he fled Malta, possibly Wignacourt or factions of the Knights.

Caravaggio&#x27;s remains were buried in Porto Ercole&#x27;s San Sebastiano cemetery, which closed in 1956, and then moved to St. Erasmus cemetery, where, in 2010, archaeologists conducted a year-long investigation of remains found in three crypts and after using DNA, carbon dating, and other methods. They believe with a high degree of confidence that they have identified those of Caravaggio. Initial tests suggested Caravaggio might have died of lead poisoning—paints used at the time contained high amounts of lead salts, and Caravaggio is known to have indulged in violent behavior, as caused by lead poisoning. Later research concluded he died as the result of a wound sustained in a brawl in Naples, specifically from sepsis caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

Vatican documents released in 2002 support the theory that the wealthy Tomassoni family had him hunted down and killed as a vendetta for Caravaggio&#x27;s murder of gangster Ranuccio Tomassoni, in a botched attempt at castration after a duel over the affections of model Fillide Melandroni.

== Sexuality ==
Since the 1970s art scholars and historians have debated the inferences of homoeroticism in Caravaggio&#x27;s works as a way to better understand the man. Caravaggio never married and had no known children, and Howard Hibbard observed the absence of erotic female figures in the artist&#x27;s oeuvre: &quot;In his entire career he did not paint a single female nude&quot;, and the cabinet-pieces from the Del Monte period are replete with &quot;full-lipped, languorous boys ... who seem to solicit the onlooker with their offers of fruit, wine, flowers—and themselves&quot; suggesting an erotic interest in the male form. The model of &quot;Amor vincit omnia&quot;, Cecco del Caravaggio, lived with the artist in Rome and stayed with him even after he was obliged to leave the city in 1606. The two may have been lovers.

A connection with a certain Lena is mentioned in a 1605 court deposition by Pasqualone, where she is described as &quot;Michelangelo&#x27;s girl&quot;. According to G. B. Passeri, this &#x27;Lena&#x27; was Caravaggio&#x27;s model for the &quot;Madonna di Loreto&quot;; and according to Catherine Puglisi, &#x27;Lena&#x27; may have been the same person as the courtesan Maddalena di Paolo Antognetti, who named Caravaggio as an &quot;intimate friend&quot; by her own testimony in 1604. Caravaggio was also rumoured to be madly in love with Fillide Melandroni, a well known Roman prostitute who modeled for him in several important paintings.

Caravaggio&#x27;s sexuality also received early speculation due to claims about the artist by Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau. Writing in 1783, Mirabeau contrasted the personal life of Caravaggio directly with the writings of St Paul in the Book of Romans, arguing that &quot;Romans&quot; excessively practice sodomy or homosexuality. &quot;The Holy Mother Catholic Church teachings on morality&quot; (and so on; short book title) contains the Latin phrase &quot;Et fœminæ eorum immutaverunt naturalem usum in eum usum qui est contra naturam.&quot; (&quot;and their women changed their natural habit to that which is against nature&quot;). The phrase, according to Mirabeau, entered Caravaggio&#x27;s thoughts, and he claimed that such an &quot;abomination&quot; could be witnessed through a particular painting housed at the Museum of the Grand Duke of Tuscany—featuring a rosary of a blasphemous nature, in which a circle of thirty men (&quot;turpiter ligati&quot;) are intertwined in embrace and presented in unbridled composition. Mirabeau notes the affectionate nature of Caravaggio&#x27;s depiction reflects the voluptuous glow of the artist&#x27;s sexuality. By the late nineteenth century, Sir Richard Francis Burton identified the painting as Caravaggio&#x27;s painting of St. Rosario. Burton also identifies both St. Rosario and this painting with the practices of Tiberius mentioned by Seneca the Younger. The survival status and location of Caravaggio&#x27;s painting is unknown. No such painting appears in his or his school&#x27;s catalogues.

Aside from the paintings, evidence also comes from the libel trial brought against Caravaggio by Giovanni Baglione in 1603. Baglione accused Caravaggio and his friends of writing and distributing scurrilous doggerel attacking him; the pamphlets, according to Baglione&#x27;s friend and witness Mao Salini, had been distributed by a certain Giovanni Battista, a &quot;bardassa&quot;, or boy prostitute, shared by Caravaggio and his friend Onorio Longhi. Caravaggio denied knowing any young boy of that name, and the allegation was not followed up.

Baglione&#x27;s painting of &quot;Divine Love&quot; has also been seen as a visual accusation of sodomy against Caravaggio. Such accusations were damaging and dangerous as sodomy was a capital crime at the time. Even though the authorities were unlikely to investigate such a well-connected person as Caravaggio, &quot;Once an artist had been smeared as a pederast, his work was smeared too.&quot; Francesco Susino in his later biography additionally relates the story of how the artist was chased by a schoolmaster in Sicily for spending too long gazing at the boys in his care. Susino presents it as a misunderstanding, but some authors have speculated that Caravaggio may indeed have been seeking sex with the boys, using the incident to explain some of his paintings which they believe to be homoerotic.

The art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon has summarised the debate:
A lot has been made of Caravaggio&#x27;s presumed homosexuality, which has in more than one previous account of his life been presented as the single key that explains everything, both the power of his art and the misfortunes of his life. There is no absolute proof of it, only strong circumstantial evidence and much rumour. The balance of probability suggests that Caravaggio did indeed have sexual relations with men. But he certainly had female lovers. Throughout the years that he spent in Rome, he kept close company with a number of prostitutes. The truth is that Caravaggio was as uneasy in his relationships as he was in most other aspects of life. He likely slept with men. He did sleep with women. He settled with no one... [but] the idea that he was an early martyr to the drives of an unconventional sexuality is an anachronistic fiction.

&quot;Washington Post&quot; art critic Philip Kennicott has taken issue with what he regarded as Graham-Dixon&#x27;s minimizing of Caravaggio&#x27;s homosexuality:
There was a fussiness to the tone whenever a scholar or curator was forced to grapple with transgressive sexuality, and you can still find it even in relatively recent histories, including Andrew Graham-Dixon&#x27;s 2010 biography of Caravaggio, which acknowledges only that &quot;he likely slept with men&quot;. The author notes the artist&#x27;s fluid sexual desires but gives some of Caravaggio&#x27;s most explicitly homoerotic paintings tortured readings to keep them safely in the category of mere &quot;ambiguity&quot;.

== As an artist ==

=== The birth of Baroque ===
Caravaggio &quot;put the oscuro (shadows) into chiaroscuro&quot;. Chiaroscuro was practised long before he came on the scene, but it was Caravaggio who made the technique a dominant stylistic element, darkening the shadows and transfixing the subject in a blinding shaft of light. With this came the acute observation of physical and psychological reality that formed the ground both for his immense popularity and for his frequent problems with his religious commissions.

He worked at great speed, from live models, scoring basic guides directly onto the canvas with the end of the brush handle; very few of Caravaggio&#x27;s drawings appear to have survived, and it is likely that he preferred to work directly on the canvas, an unusual approach at the time. His models were basic to his realism; some have been identified, including Mario Minniti and Francesco Boneri, both fellow artists, Minniti appearing as various figures in the early secular works, the young Boneri as a succession of angels, Baptists and Davids in the later canvasses. His female models include Fillide Melandroni, Anna Bianchini, and Maddalena Antognetti (the &quot;Lena&quot; mentioned in court documents of the &quot;artichoke&quot; case as Caravaggio&#x27;s concubine), all well-known prostitutes, who appear as female religious figures including the Virgin and various saints. Caravaggio himself appears in several paintings, his final self-portrait being as the witness on the far right to the &quot;Martyrdom of Saint Ursula&quot;.
Caravaggio had a noteworthy ability to express in one scene of unsurpassed vividness the passing of a crucial moment. &quot;The Supper at Emmaus&quot; depicts the recognition of Christ by his disciples: a moment before he is a fellow traveller, mourning the passing of the Messiah, as he never ceases to be to the innkeeper&#x27;s eyes; the second after, he is the Saviour. In &quot;The Calling of St Matthew&quot;, the hand of the Saint points to himself as if he were saying, &quot;who, me?&quot;, while his eyes, fixed upon the figure of Christ, have already said, &quot;Yes, I will follow you&quot;. With &quot;The Resurrection of Lazarus&quot;, he goes a step further, giving a glimpse of the actual physical process of resurrection. The body of Lazarus is still in the throes of rigor mortis, but his hand, facing and recognising that of Christ, is alive. Other major Baroque artists would travel the same path, for example Bernini, fascinated with themes from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

=== The Caravaggisti ===
The installation of the St. Matthew paintings in the Contarelli Chapel had an immediate impact among the younger artists in Rome, and Caravaggism became the cutting edge for every ambitious young painter. The first Caravaggisti included Orazio Gentileschi and Giovanni Baglione. Baglione&#x27;s Caravaggio phase was short-lived; Caravaggio later accused him of plagiarism and the two were involved in a long feud. Baglione went on to write the first biography of Caravaggio. In the next generation of Caravaggisti, there were Carlo Saraceni, Bartolomeo Manfredi and Orazio Borgianni. Gentileschi, despite being considerably older, was the only one of these artists to live much beyond 1620 and ended up as a court painter to Charles I of England. His daughter Artemisia Gentileschi was also stylistically close to Caravaggio and one of the most gifted of the movement. However, in Rome and Italy, it was not Caravaggio, but the influence of his rival Annibale Carracci, blending elements from the High Renaissance and Lombard realism, that ultimately triumphed.

Caravaggio&#x27;s brief stay in Naples produced a notable school of Neapolitan Caravaggisti, including Battistello Caracciolo and Carlo Sellitto. The Caravaggisti movement there ended with a terrible outbreak of plague in 1656, but the Spanish connection—Naples was a possession of Spain—was instrumental in forming the important Spanish branch of his influence.

Rubens was likely one of the first Flemish artists to be influenced by Caravaggio whose work he got to know during his stay in Rome in 1601. He later painted a copy (or rather an interpretation) of Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;Entombment of Christ&quot; and recommended his patron, the Duke of Mantua, purchase &quot;Death of the Virgin&quot; (Louvre). Although some of this interest in Caravaggio is reflected in his drawings during his Italian residence, it was only after his return to Antwerp in 1608 that Rubens&#x27; works show openly Caravaggesque traits such as in the &quot;Cain slaying Abel&quot; (1608–1609) (Courtauld Institute of Art) and the &quot;Old Woman and Boy with Candles&quot; (1618–1619) (Mauritshuis). However, the influence of Caravaggio on Rubens&#x27; work would be less important than that of Raphael, Correggio, Barocci and the Venetians. Flemish artists, who were influenced by Rubens, such as Jacob Jordaens, Pieter van Mol, Gaspar de Crayer and Willem Jacob Herreyns, also used certain stark realism and strong contrasts of light and shadow, common to the Caravaggesque style.

A number of Catholic artists from Utrecht, including Hendrick ter Brugghen, Gerrit van Honthorst and Dirck van Baburen travelled in the first decades of the 17th century to Rome. Here they became profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio and his followers. On their return to Utrecht, their Caravaggesque works inspired a short-lived but influential flowering of artworks inspired indirectly in style and subject matter by the works of Caravaggio and the Italian followers of Caravaggio. This style of painting was later referred to as Utrecht Caravaggism. In the following generation of Dutch artists the effects of Caravaggio, although attenuated, are to be seen in the work of Vermeer and Rembrandt, neither of whom visited Italy.

=== Death and rebirth of a reputation ===
Caravaggio&#x27;s innovations inspired the Baroque, but the Baroque took the drama of his chiaroscuro without the psychological realism. While he directly influenced the style of the artists mentioned above, and, at a distance, the Frenchmen Georges de La Tour and Simon Vouet, and the Spaniard Giuseppe Ribera, within a few decades his works were being ascribed to less scandalous artists, or simply overlooked. The Baroque, to which he contributed so much, had evolved, and fashions had changed, but perhaps more pertinently, Caravaggio never established a workshop as the Carracci did and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism that may only be deduced from his surviving work.

Thus his reputation was doubly vulnerable to the unsympathetic critiques of his earliest biographers, Giovanni Baglione, a rival painter with a vendetta, and the influential 17th-century critic Gian Pietro Bellori, who had not known him but was under the influence of the earlier Giovanni Battista Agucchi and Bellori&#x27;s friend Poussin, in preferring the &quot;classical-idealistic&quot; tradition of the Bolognese school led by the Carracci. Baglione, his first biographer, played a considerable part in creating the legend of Caravaggio&#x27;s unstable and violent character, as well as his inability to draw.

In the 1920s, art critic Roberto Longhi brought Caravaggio&#x27;s name once more to the foreground and placed him in the European tradition: &quot;Ribera, Vermeer, La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of Delacroix, Courbet and Manet would have been utterly different&quot;. The influential Bernard Berenson agreed: &quot;With the exception of Michelangelo, no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence.&quot;

=== Epitaph ===

Caravaggio&#x27;s epitaph was composed by his friend Marzio Milesi. It reads:

He was commemorated on the front of the &quot;Banca d&#x27;Italia&quot; 100,000-lire banknote in the 1980s and &#x27;90s (before Italy switched to the euro), with the back showing his &quot;Basket of Fruit&quot;.

== Oeuvre ==

There is disagreement as to the size of Caravaggio&#x27;s oeuvre, with counts as low as 40 and as high as 80. In his monograph of 1983, the Caravaggio scholar Alfred Moir wrote, &quot;The forty-eight color plates in this book include almost all of the surviving works accepted by every Caravaggio expert as autograph, and even the least demanding would add fewer than a dozen more&quot;, but there have been some generally accepted additions since then. One, &quot;The Calling of Saints Peter and Andrew&quot;, was in 2006 authenticated and restored; it had been in storage in Hampton Court, mislabeled as a copy. Richard Francis Burton writes of a &quot;picture of St. Rosario (in the museum of the Grand Duke of Tuscany), showing a circle of thirty men &quot;turpiter ligati&quot;&quot; (&quot;lewdly banded&quot;), which is not known to have survived. The rejected version of &quot;Saint Matthew and the Angel&quot;, intended for the Contarelli Chapel in San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, was destroyed during the bombing of Dresden, though black and white photographs of the work exist. In June 2011 it was announced that a previously unknown Caravaggio painting of Saint Augustine dating to about 1600 had been discovered in a private collection in Britain. Called a &quot;significant discovery&quot;, the painting had never been published and is thought to have been commissioned by Vincenzo Giustiniani, a patron of the painter in Rome.
A painting depicting &quot;Judith Beheading Holofernes&quot; was allegedly discovered in an attic in Toulouse in 2014. In April 2016 the expert and art dealer to whom the work was shown announced that this was a long-lost painting by the hand of Caravaggio himself. That lost Caravaggio painting was only known up to that date by a presumed copy of it by the Flemish painter Louis Finson, who had shared a studio with Caravaggio in Naples. The French government imposed an export ban on the newly discovered painting while tests were carried out to establish whether it was an authentic painting by Caravaggio. In February 2019 it was announced that the painting would be sold at auction after the Louvre had turned down the opportunity to purchase it for €100 million. After an auction was considered, the painting was finally sold in a private sale to the American billionaire hedge fund manager J. Tomilson Hill. The art historical world is not united over the attribution of the work, with the art dealer who sold the work promoting its authenticity with the support of art historians who were given privileged access to the work, while other art historians remain unconvinced mainly based on stylistic and quality considerations. Some art historians believe it may be a work by Louis Finson himself.

In April 2021 a minor work believed to be from the circle of a Spanish follower of Caravaggio, Jusepe de Ribera, was withdrawn from sale at the Madrid auction house Ansorena when the Museo del Prado alerted the Ministry of Culture, which placed a preemptive export ban on the painting. The by painting has been in the Pérez de Castro family since 1823, when it was exchanged for another work from the Real Academia of San Fernando. It had been listed as &quot;Ecce-Hommo con dos saiones de Carabaggio&quot; before the attribution was later lost or changed to the circle of Ribera. Stylistic evidence, as well as the similarity of the models to those in other Caravaggio works, has convinced some experts that the painting is the original Caravaggio &#x27;Ecce Homo&#x27; for the 1605 Massimo Massimi commission. The attribution to Caravaggio is disputed by other experts. The painting is now undergoing restoration by Colnaghis, who will also be handling the future sale of the work.
== Theft ==
In October 1969, two thieves entered the Oratory of Saint Lawrence in Palermo, Sicily, and stole Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence&quot; from its frame. Experts estimated its value at $20 million.

Following the theft, Italian police set up an art theft task force with the specific aim of re-acquiring lost and stolen artworks. Since the creation of this task force, many leads have been followed regarding the &quot;Nativity&quot;. Former Italian mafia members have stated that &quot;Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence&quot; was stolen by the Sicilian Mafia and displayed at important mafia gatherings. Former mafia members have said that the &quot;Nativity&quot; was damaged and has since been destroyed.

The whereabouts of the painting are still unknown. A reproduction currently hangs in its place in the Oratory of San Lorenzo.

In December 1984, &quot;Saint Jerome Writing&quot; (Caravaggio, Valletta) was stolen from the St. John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral, Malta. The canvas was cut out of the frame. The painting was recovered two years later, following negotiations between the thieves and Fr. Marius J. Zerafa, then the Director of Museums in Malta. A full account of the theft and successful recovery had been recorded by Fr. Marius J. Zerafa in his book &quot;Caravaggio Diaries&quot;.

== Cultural legacy ==
Caravaggio&#x27;s work has been widely influential in late-20th-century American gay culture, with frequent references to male sexual imagery in paintings such as &quot;The Musicians&quot; and &quot;Amor Victorious&quot;. British filmmaker Derek Jarman made a critically applauded biopic entitled &quot;Caravaggio&quot; in 1986. Several poems written by Thom Gunn were responses to specific Caravaggio paintings.

In 2013, a touring Caravaggio exhibition called &quot;Burst of Light: Caravaggio and His Legacy&quot; opened in the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Connecticut. The show included five paintings by the master artist that included &quot;Saint John the Baptist in the Wilderness&quot; (1604–1605) and &quot;Martha and Mary Magdalene&quot; (1589). The whole travelled to France and also to Los Angeles, California. Other Baroque artists like Georges de La Tour, Orazio Gentileschi, and the Spanish trio of Diego Velazquez, Francisco de Zurbarán, and Carlo Saraceni were also included in the exhibitions.

In 2022 a new biopic about Caravaggio was released: &quot;L&#x27;Ombra di Caravaggio&quot;, an Italian-French movie directed by Michele Placido.

Caravaggio was prominently featured as motif in Steven Zaillian&#x27;s Netflix series &quot;Ripley&quot;, based on Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s book &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley.&quot; The murder of Rannucchio is also depicted. Caravaggio is portrayed by Daniele Rienzo.

<text>Jean Siméon Chardin (; November 2, 1699 – December 6, 1779) was an 18th-century French painter. He is considered a master of still life, and is also noted for his genre paintings which depict kitchen maids, children, and domestic activities. Carefully balanced composition, soft diffusion of light, and granular impasto characterize his work.

==Life==
Chardin was born in Paris, the son of a cabinetmaker, and rarely left the city. He lived on the Left Bank near Saint-Sulpice until 1757, when Louis XV granted him a studio and living quarters in the Louvre.

Chardin entered into a marriage contract with Marguerite Saintard in 1723, whom he did not marry until 1731. He served apprenticeships with the history painters Pierre-Jacques Cazes and Noël-Nicolas Coypel, and in 1724 became a master in the Académie de Saint-Luc.

According to one nineteenth-century writer, at a time when it was hard for unknown painters to come to the attention of the Royal Academy, he first found notice by displaying a painting at the &quot;small Corpus Christi&quot; (held eight days after the regular one) on the Place Dauphine (by the Pont Neuf). Van Loo, passing by in 1720, bought it and later assisted the young painter.

Upon presentation of &quot;The Ray&quot; and &quot;The Buffet&quot; in 1728, he was admitted to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. The following year he ceded his position in the Académie de Saint-Luc. He made a modest living by &quot;produc[ing] paintings in the various genres at whatever price his customers chose to pay him&quot;, and by such work as the restoration of the frescoes at the Galerie François I at Fontainebleau in 1731.
In November 1731 his son Jean-Pierre was baptized, and a daughter, Marguerite-Agnès, was baptized in 1733. In 1735 his wife Marguerite died, and within two years Marguerite-Agnès had died as well.

Beginning in 1737 Chardin exhibited regularly at the Salon. He would prove to be a &quot;dedicated academician&quot;, regularly attending meetings for fifty years, and functioning successively as counsellor, treasurer, and secretary, overseeing in 1761 the installation of Salon exhibitions.

Chardin&#x27;s work gained popularity through reproductive engravings of his genre paintings (made by artists such as François-Bernard Lépicié and P.-L. Sugurue), which brought Chardin income in the form of &quot;what would now be called royalties&quot;. In 1744 he entered his second marriage, this time to Françoise-Marguerite Pouget. The union brought a substantial improvement in Chardin&#x27;s financial circumstances. In 1745 a daughter, Angélique-Françoise, was born, but she died in 1746.

In 1752 Chardin was granted a pension of 500 livres by Louis XV. In 1756 Chardin returned to the subject of the still life. At the Salon of 1759 he exhibited nine paintings; it was the first Salon to be commented upon by Denis Diderot, who would prove to be a great admirer and public champion of Chardin&#x27;s work. Beginning in 1761, his responsibilities on behalf of the Salon, simultaneously arranging the exhibitions and acting as treasurer, resulted in a diminution of productivity in painting, and the showing of &#x27;replicas&#x27; of previous works. In 1763 his services to the Académie were acknowledged with an extra 200 livres in pension. In 1765 he was unanimously elected associate member of the Académie des Sciences, Belles-Lettres et Arts of Rouen, but there is no evidence that he left Paris to accept the honor. By 1770 Chardin was the &#x27;Premier peintre du roi&#x27;, and his pension of 1,400 livres was the highest in the academy. In the 1770s his eyesight weakened and he took to painting in pastels, a medium in which he executed portraits of his wife and himself (see &quot;Self-portrait&quot; at top right). His works in pastels are now highly valued.

In 1772 Chardin&#x27;s son, also a painter, drowned in Venice, a probable suicide. The artist&#x27;s last known oil painting was dated 1776; his final Salon participation was in 1779, and featured several pastel studies. Gravely ill by November of that year, he died in Paris on December 6, at the age of 80.

==Work==

Chardin worked very slowly and painted only slightly more than 200 pictures (about four a year) in total.

Chardin&#x27;s work had little in common with the Rococo painting that dominated French art in the 18th century. At a time when history painting was considered the supreme classification for public art, Chardin&#x27;s subjects of choice were viewed as minor categories. He favored simple yet beautifully textured still lifes, and sensitively handled domestic interiors and genre paintings. Simple, even stark, paintings of common household items (&quot;Still Life with a Smoker&#x27;s Box&quot;) and an uncanny ability to portray children&#x27;s innocence in an unsentimental manner (&quot;Boy with a Top&quot; [right]) nevertheless found an appreciative audience in his time, and account for his timeless appeal.

Largely self-taught, Chardin was greatly influenced by the realism and subject matter of the 17th-century Low Country masters. Despite his unconventional portrayal of the ascendant bourgeoisie, early support came from patrons in the French aristocracy, including Louis XV. Though his popularity rested initially on paintings of animals and fruit, by the 1730s he introduced kitchen utensils into his work (&quot;The Copper Cistern&quot;, , Louvre). Soon figures populated his scenes as well, supposedly in response to a portrait painter who challenged him to take up the genre. &quot;Woman Sealing a Letter&quot; (ca. 1733), which may have been his first attempt, was followed by half-length compositions of children saying grace, as in &quot;Le Bénédicité&quot;, and kitchen maids in moments of reflection. These humble scenes deal with simple, everyday activities, yet they also have functioned as a source of documentary information about a level of French society not hitherto considered a worthy subject for painting. The pictures are noteworthy for their formal structure and pictorial harmony. Chardin said about painting, &quot;Who said one paints with colors? One &quot;employs&quot; colors, but one paints with &quot;feeling&quot;.&quot;

A child playing was a favourite subject of Chardin. He depicted an adolescent building a house of cards on at least four occasions. The version at Waddesdon Manor is the most elaborate. Scenes such as these derived from 17th-century Netherlandish vanitas works, which bore messages about the transitory nature of human life and the worthlessness of material ambitions, but Chardin&#x27;s also display a delight in the ephemeral phases of childhood for their own sake.

Chardin frequently painted replicas of his compositions—especially his genre paintings, nearly all of which exist in multiple versions which in many cases are virtually indistinguishable. Beginning with &quot;The Governess&quot; (1739, in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa), Chardin shifted his attention from working-class subjects to slightly more spacious scenes of bourgeois life. Chardin&#x27;s extant paintings, which number about 200, are in many major museums, including the Louvre.

==Influence==

Chardin&#x27;s influence on the art of the modern era was wide-ranging and has been well-documented. Édouard Manet&#x27;s half-length &quot;Boy Blowing Bubbles&quot; and the still lifes of Paul Cézanne are equally indebted to their predecessor. He was one of Henri Matisse&#x27;s most admired painters; as an art student Matisse made copies of four Chardin paintings in the Louvre. Chaïm Soutine&#x27;s still lifes looked to Chardin for inspiration, as did the paintings of Georges Braque, and later, Giorgio Morandi. In 1999 Lucian Freud painted and etched several copies after &quot;The Young Schoolmistress&quot; (National Gallery, London).

Marcel Proust, in the chapter &quot;How to open your eyes?&quot; from &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; (&quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot;), describes a melancholic young man sitting at his simple breakfast table. The only comfort he finds is in the imaginary ideas of beauty depicted in the great masterpieces of the Louvre, materializing fancy palaces, rich princes, and the like. The author tells the young man to follow him to another section of the Louvre where the pictures of Chardin are. There he would see the beauty in still life at home and in everyday activities like peeling turnips.

<text>The Crookes radiometer (also known as a light mill) consists of an airtight glass bulb containing a partial vacuum, with a set of vanes which are mounted on a spindle inside. The vanes rotate when exposed to light, with faster rotation for more intense light, providing a quantitative measurement of electromagnetic radiation intensity.

The reason for the rotation was a cause of much scientific debate in the ten years following the invention of the device, but in 1879 the currently accepted explanation for the rotation was published. Today the device is mainly used in physics education as a demonstration of a heat engine run by light energy.

It was invented in 1873 by the chemist Sir William Crookes as the by-product of some chemical research. In the course of very accurate quantitative chemical work, he was weighing samples in a partially evacuated chamber to reduce the effect of air currents, and noticed the weighings were disturbed when sunlight shone on the balance. Investigating this effect, he created the device named after him.

It is still manufactured and sold as an educational aid or for curiosity.

==General description==

The radiometer is made from a glass bulb from which much of the air has been removed to form a partial vacuum. Inside the bulb, on a low-friction spindle, is a rotor with several (usually four) vertical lightweight vanes spaced equally around the axis. The vanes are polished or white on one side and black on the other.

When exposed to sunlight, artificial light, or infrared radiation (even the heat of a hand nearby can be enough), the vanes turn with no apparent motive power, the dark sides retreating from the radiation source and the light sides advancing.

Cooling the outside of the radiometer rapidly causes rotation in the opposite direction.

=== Effect observations ===
The effect begins to be observed at partial vacuum pressures of several hundred pascals (or several torrs), reaches a peak at around and has disappeared by the time the vacuum reaches (see explanations note 1). At these very high vacuums the effect of photon radiation pressure on the vanes can be observed in very sensitive apparatus (see Nichols radiometer), but this is insufficient to cause rotation.

===Origin of the name===
The prefix &quot;&quot; in the title originates from the combining form of Latin &quot;radius&quot;, a ray: here it refers to electromagnetic radiation. A Crookes radiometer, consistent with the suffix &quot;&quot; in its title, can provide a quantitative measurement of electromagnetic radiation intensity. This can be done, for example, by visual means (e.g., a spinning slotted disk, which functions as a simple stroboscope) without interfering with the measurement itself.

Radiometers are now commonly sold worldwide as a novelty ornament; needing no batteries, but only light to get the vanes to turn. They come in various forms, such as the one pictured, and are often used in science museums to illustrate &quot;radiation pressure&quot; – a scientific principle that they do not in fact demonstrate.

==Thermodynamic explanation==
===Movement with absorption===
When a radiant energy source is directed at a Crookes radiometer, the radiometer becomes a heat engine. The operation of a heat engine is based on a difference in temperature that is converted to a mechanical output. In this case, the black side of the vane becomes hotter than the other side, as radiant energy from a light source warms the black side by absorption faster than the silver or white side. The internal air molecules are heated up when they touch the black side of the vane. The warmer side of the vane is subjected to a force which moves it forward.

The internal temperature rises as the black vanes impart heat to the air molecules, but the molecules are cooled again when they touch the bulb&#x27;s glass surface, which is at ambient temperature. This heat loss through the glass keeps the internal bulb temperature steady with the result that the two sides of the vanes develop a temperature difference. The white or silver side of the vanes are slightly warmer than the internal air temperature but cooler than the black side, as some heat conducts through the vane from the black side. The two sides of each vane must be thermally insulated to some degree so that the polished or white side does not immediately reach the temperature of the black side. If the vanes are made of metal, then the black or white paint can be the insulation. The glass stays much closer to ambient temperature than the temperature reached by the black side of the vanes. The external air helps conduct heat away from the glass.

The air pressure inside the bulb needs to strike a balance between too low and too high. A strong vacuum inside the bulb does not permit motion, because there are not enough air molecules to cause the air currents that propel the vanes and transfer heat to the outside before both sides of each vane reach thermal equilibrium by heat conduction through the vane material. High inside pressure inhibits motion because the temperature differences are not enough to push the vanes through the higher concentration of air: there is too much air resistance for &quot;eddy currents&quot; to occur, and any slight air movement caused by the temperature difference is damped by the higher pressure before the currents can &quot;wrap around&quot; to the other side.

===Movement with radiation===
When the radiometer is heated in the absence of a light source, it turns in the forward direction (i.e. black sides trailing). If a person&#x27;s hands are placed around the glass without touching it, the vanes will turn slowly or not at all, but if the glass is touched to warm it quickly, they will turn more noticeably. Directly heated glass gives off enough infrared radiation to turn the vanes, but glass blocks much of the far-infrared radiation from a source of warmth not in contact with it. However, near-infrared and visible light more easily penetrate the glass.

If the glass is cooled quickly in the absence of a strong light source by putting ice on the glass or placing it in the freezer with the door almost closed, it turns backwards (i.e. the silver sides trail). This demonstrates radiation from the black sides of the vanes rather than absorption. The wheel turns backwards because the net exchange of heat between the black sides and the environment initially cools the black sides faster than the white sides. Upon reaching equilibrium, typically after a minute or two, reverse rotation ceases. This contrasts with sunlight, with which forward rotation can be maintained all day.

==Explanations for the force on the vanes ==
Over the years, there have been many attempts to explain how a Crookes radiometer works:

===Incorrect theories===
Crookes incorrectly suggested that the force was due to the pressure of light. This theory was originally supported by James Clerk Maxwell, who had predicted this force. This explanation is still often seen in leaflets packaged with the device. The first experiment to test this theory was done by Arthur Schuster in 1876, who observed that there was a force on the glass bulb of the Crookes radiometer that was in the opposite direction to the rotation of the vanes. This showed that the force turning the vanes was generated inside the radiometer. If light pressure were the cause of the rotation, then the better the vacuum in the bulb, the less air resistance to movement, and the faster the vanes should spin. In 1901, with a better vacuum pump, Pyotr Lebedev showed that in fact, the radiometer only works when there is low-pressure gas in the bulb, and the vanes stay motionless in a hard vacuum. Finally, if light pressure were the motive force, the radiometer would spin in the opposite direction, as the photons on the shiny side being reflected would deposit more momentum than on the black side, where the photons are absorbed. This results from conservation of momentum – the momentum of the reflected photon exiting on the light side must be matched by a reaction on the vane that reflected it. The actual pressure exerted by light is far too small to move these vanes, but can be measured with devices such as the Nichols radiometer. It is in fact possible to make the radiometer spin in the opposite direction by either heating it or putting it in a cold environment (like a freezer) in absence of light, when black sides become cooler than the white ones due to the thermal radiation.

Another incorrect theory was that the heat on the dark side was causing the material to outgas, which pushed the radiometer around. This was later effectively disproved by both Schuster&#x27;s experiments (1876) and Lebedev&#x27;s (1901)

===Partially correct theory===
A partial explanation is that gas molecules hitting the warmer side of the vane will pick up some of the heat, bouncing off the vane with increased speed. Giving the molecule this extra boost effectively means that a minute pressure is exerted on the vane. The imbalance of this effect between the warmer black side and the cooler silver side means the net pressure on the vane is equivalent to a push on the black side and as a result the vanes spin round with the black side trailing. The problem with this idea is that while the faster moving molecules produce more force, they also do a better job of stopping other molecules from reaching the vane, so the net force on the vane should be the same. The greater temperature causes a decrease in local density which results in the same force on both sides. Years after this explanation was dismissed, Albert Einstein showed that the two pressures do not cancel out exactly at the edges of the vanes because of the temperature difference there. The force predicted by Einstein would be enough to move the vanes, but not fast enough.

===Currently accepted theory===
The currently accepted theory was formulated by Osborne Reynolds, who theorized that thermal transpiration was the cause of the motion. Reynolds found that if a porous plate is kept hotter on one side than the other, the interactions between gas molecules and the plates are such that gas will flow through from the cooler to the hotter side. The vanes of a typical Crookes radiometer are not porous, but the space past their edges behaves like the pores in Reynolds&#x27;s plate. As gas moves from the cooler to the hotter side, the pressure on the hotter side increases. When the plate is fixed, the pressure on the hotter side increases until the ratio of pressures between the sides equals the square root of the ratio of absolute temperatures. Because the plates in a radiometer are not fixed, the pressure difference from cooler to hotter side causes the vane to move. The cooler (white) side moves forward, pushed by the higher pressure behind it. From a molecular point of view, the vane moves due to the tangential force of the rarefied gas colliding differently with the edges of the vane between the hot and cold sides.

The Reynolds paper went unpublished for a while because it was refereed by Maxwell, who then published a paper of his own, which contained a critique of the mathematics in Reynolds&#x27;s unpublished paper. Maxwell died that year and the Royal Society refused to publish Reynolds&#x27;s critique of Maxwell&#x27;s rebuttal to Reynolds&#x27;s unpublished paper, as it was felt that this would be an inappropriate argument when one of the people involved had already died.

==All-black light mill==
To rotate, a light mill does not have to be coated with different colors across each vane. In 2009, researchers at the University of Texas, Austin created a monocolored light mill which has four curved vanes; each vane forms a convex and a concave surface. The light mill is uniformly coated by gold nanocrystals, which are a strong light absorber. Upon exposure, due to geometric effect, the convex side of the vane receives more photon energy than the concave side does, and subsequently the gas molecules receive more heat from the convex side than from the concave side. At rough vacuum, this asymmetric heating effect generates a net gas movement across each vane, from the concave side to the convex side, as shown by the researchers&#x27; direct simulation Monte Carlo modeling. The gas movement causes the light mill to rotate with the concave side moving forward, due to Newton&#x27;s third law. This monocolored design promotes the fabrication of micrometer- or nanometer-scaled light mills, as it is difficult to pattern materials of distinct optical properties within a very narrow, three-dimensional space.

== Horizontal vane light mill ==
The thermal creep from the hot side of a vane to the cold side has been demonstrated in a mill with horizontal vanes that have a two-tone surface with a black half and a white half. This design is called a Hettner radiometer. This radiometer&#x27;s angular speed was found to be limited by the behavior of the drag force due to the gas in the vessel more than by the behavior of the thermal creep force. This design does not experience the Einstein effect because the faces are parallel to the temperature gradient.

==Nanoscale light mill==
In 2010 researchers at the University of California, Berkeley succeeded in building a nanoscale light mill that works on an entirely different principle to the Crookes radiometer. A gold light mill, only 100 nanometers in diameter, was built and illuminated by laser light that had been tuned. The possibility of doing this had been suggested by the Princeton physicist Richard Beth in 1936. The torque was greatly enhanced by the resonant coupling of the incident light to plasmonic waves in the gold structure.

== Practical applications ==
The radiometric effect has not been often used for practical applications. Marcel Bétrisey made in 2001 two different clocks (Le Chronolithe and Conti) powered by the light. Their pendulums had bulb lamps located outside the glass dôme and pointing against 4 mica vanes. One meter pendulum gives one second, two lamps placed in either side light up alternately, thus “pushing” the 4 kilos pendulum each time. As there was vacuum inside, its accuracy was of the order of 2 seconds per month.

<doc id="7022" wikidata="Q1107765" url="?curid=7022" title="Cold Chisel">
<text>Cold Chisel are an Australian pub rock band, which formed in Adelaide in 1973 by mainstay members Ian Moss on guitar and vocals, Steve Prestwich on drums, Les Kaczmarek on bass and Don Walker on piano and keyboards. They were soon joined by Jimmy Barnes on lead vocals and, in 1975, Phil Small became their bass guitarist. The group disbanded in late 1983 but subsequently re-formed several times. Musicologist Ian McFarlane wrote that they became &quot;one of Australia&#x27;s best-loved groups&quot; as well as &quot;one of the best live bands&quot;, fusing &quot;a combination of rockabilly, hard rock and rough-house soul&#x27;n&#x27;blues that was defiantly Australian in outlook.&quot;

Eight of their studio albums have reached the Australian top five, &quot;Breakfast at Sweethearts&quot; (February 1979), &quot;East&quot; (June 1980), &quot;Circus Animals&quot; (March 1982, No. 1), &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; (April 1984, No. 1), &quot;The Last Wave of Summer&quot; (October 1998, No. 1), &quot;No Plans&quot; (April 2012), &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot; (October 2015) and &quot;Blood Moon&quot; (December 2019, No. 1). They have achieved six number-one albums on the ARIA Charts, the latest being their 2024 compilation &quot;50 Years – The Best Of&quot;. Their top-10 singles are &quot;Cheap Wine&quot; (1980), &quot;Forever Now&quot; (1982), &quot;Hands Out of My Pocket&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Things I Love in You&quot; (1998).

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993 they were inducted into the Hall of Fame. In 2001 Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) listed their single &quot;Khe Sanh&quot; (May 1978) at No. 8 of the all-time best Australian songs. &quot;Circus Animals&quot; was listed at No. 4 in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (October 2010), while &quot;East&quot; appeared at No. 53. They won The Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music at the APRA Music Awards of 2016. Cold Chisel&#x27;s popularity is almost entirely confined to Australia and New Zealand, with their songs and musicianship highlighting working class life. Their early bass guitarist (1973–75), Les Kaczmarek, died in December 2008; Steve Prestwich died of a brain tumour in January 2011.

==History==
===1973–1978: Beginnings ===
Cold Chisel originally formed as Orange in Adelaide in 1973 as a heavy metal band with Ted Broniecki on keyboards, Les Kaczmarek on bass guitar, Ian Moss on guitar and vocals, Steve Prestwich on drums and Don Walker on piano. Their early material included cover versions of Free and Deep Purple material. Broniecki left by September 1973 and seventeen-year-old singer Jimmy Barnes – called Jim Barnes during their initial career – joined in December.

The group changed its name several times, often for every live performance, before choosing “Cold Chisel” after an early Don Walker song of that title, and that name stuck. Barnes&#x27; relationship with the others was volatile: he often came to blows with Prestwich and left the band several times. During these periods Moss would handle vocals until Barnes returned. Walker emerged as the group&#x27;s primary songwriter and spent 1974 in Armidale, completing his studies in quantum mechanics. Barnes&#x27; older brother, John Swan, was a member of Cold Chisel around this time, providing backing vocals and percussion. After several violent incidents, including beating up a roadie, he was fired. In mid-1975 Barnes left to join Fraternity as Bon Scott&#x27;s replacement on lead vocals, alongside Swan on drums and vocals.

Kaczmarek left Cold Chisel during 1975 and was replaced by Phil Small on bass guitar. In November of that year, without Barnes, they recorded their early demos.

In May 1976 Cold Chisel relocated to Melbourne, but &quot;frustrated by their lack of progress,&quot; they moved on to Sydney in early 1977. In May 1977, Barnes told his fellow members that he would leave again. From July he joined Feather for a few weeks, on co-lead vocals with Swan – they were a Sydney-based hard rock group, which had evolved from Blackfeather. A farewell performance for Cold Chisel, with Barnes aboard, went so well that the singer changed his mind and returned. In the following month the Warner Music Group signed the group.

===1978–1979: &quot;Cold Chisel&quot; and &quot;Breakfast at Sweethearts&quot;===
In the early months of 1978 Cold Chisel recorded their self-titled debut album with their manager and producer, Peter Walker (ex-Bakery). All tracks were written by Don Walker, except &quot;Juliet&quot;, where Barnes composed its melody and Walker the lyrics. &quot;Cold Chisel&quot; was released in April and included guest studio musicians: Dave Blight on harmonica (who became a regular on-stage guest) and saxophonists Joe Camilleri and Wilbur Wilde (from Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons). Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described how, &quot;[it] failed to capture the band&#x27;s renowned live firepower, despite the presence of such crowd favourites as &#x27;Khe Sanh&#x27;, &#x27;Home and Broken Hearted&#x27; and &#x27;One Long Day&#x27;.&quot; It reached the top 40 on the Kent Music Report and was certified gold.

In May 1978, &quot;Khe Sanh&quot; was released as their debut single but it was declared too offensive for commercial radio due to the sexual implication of the lyrics, e.g. &quot;Their legs were often open/But their minds were always closed.&quot; However, it was played regularly on Sydney youth radio station Double J, which was not subject to the restrictions as it was part of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Another ABC program, &quot;Countdown&quot;″s producers asked them to change the lyric but they refused. Despite such setbacks, &quot;Khe Sanh&quot; reached No. 41 on the Kent Music Report singles chart. It became Cold Chisel&#x27;s signature tune and was popular among their fans. They later remixed the track, with re-recorded vocals, for inclusion on the international version of their third album, &quot;East&quot; (June 1980).

The band&#x27;s next release was a live five-track extended play, &quot;You&#x27;re Thirteen, You&#x27;re Beautiful, and You&#x27;re Mine&quot;, in November 1978. McFarlane observed, &quot;It captured the band in its favoured element, fired by raucous versions of Walker&#x27;s &#x27;Merry-Go-Round&#x27; and Chip Taylor&#x27;s &#x27;Wild Thing&#x27;.&quot; It was recorded at the Regent Theatre, Sydney in 1977, when they had Midnight Oil as one of the support acts. Australian writer Ed Nimmervoll described a typical performance by Cold Chisel: &quot;Everybody was talking about them anyway, drawn by the songs, and Jim Barnes&#x27; presence on stage, crouched, sweating, as he roared his vocals into the microphone at the top of his lungs.&quot; The EP peaked at No. 35 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart.

&quot;Merry Go Round&quot; was re-recorded for their second studio album, &quot;Breakfast at Sweethearts&quot; (February 1979). This was recorded between July 1978 and January 1979 with producer Richard Batchens, who had previously worked with Richard Clapton, Sherbet and Blackfeather. Batchens smoothed out the band&#x27;s rough edges and attempted to give their songs a sophisticated sound. With regards to this approach, the band were unsatisfied with the finished product. It peaked at No. 4 and was the top-selling album in Australia by a locally based artist for that year; it was certified platinum. The majority of its tracks were written by Walker, with Barnes and Walker on the lead single, &quot;Goodbye (Astrid, Goodbye)&quot; (September 1978), and Moss contributed to &quot;Dresden&quot;. &quot;Goodbye (Astrid, Goodbye)&quot; became a live favourite, and was covered by U2 during Australian tours in the 1980s.

===1979-1980: &quot;East&quot;===
Cold Chisel had gained national chart success and increased popularity of their fans without significant commercial radio airplay. The members developed reputations for wild behaviour, particularly Barnes, who claimed to have had sex with over 1000 women and who consumed more than a bottle of vodka each night while performing. In late 1979, severing their relationship with Batchens, Cold Chisel chose Mark Opitz to produce the next single, &quot;Choirgirl&quot; (November). It is a Walker composition dealing with a young woman&#x27;s experience with abortion. Despite the subject matter it reached No. 14.

&quot;Choirgirl&quot; paved the way for the group&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;East&quot; (June 1980), with Opitz producing. Recorded over two months in early 1980, &quot;East&quot;, reached No. 2 and is the second highest selling album by an Australian artist for that year. &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;″s Gregg Flynn noticed, &quot;[they are] one of the few Australian bands in which each member is capable of writing hit songs.&quot; Despite the continued dominance of Walker, the other members contributed more tracks to their play list, and this was their first album to have songs written by each one. McFarlane described it as, &quot;a confident, fully realised work of tremendous scope.&quot; Nimmervoll explained how, &quot;This time everything fell into place, the sound, the songs, the playing... &quot;East&quot; was a triumph. [The group] were now the undisputed No. 1 rock band in Australia.&quot;

The album varied from straight-ahead rock tracks &quot;Standing on the Outside&quot; and &quot;My Turn to Cry&quot; to rockabilly-flavoured work-outs (&quot;Rising Sun&quot;, written about Barnes&#x27; relationship with his then-girlfriend Jane Mahoney) and pop-laced love songs (&quot;My Baby&quot; by Phil Small, featuring Joe Camilleri on saxophone) to a poignant piano ballad about prison life, &quot;Four Walls&quot;. The cover art showed Barnes reclined in a bathtub wearing a kamikaze bandanna in a room littered with junk and was inspired by Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s 1793 painting &quot;The Death of Marat&quot;. The Ian Moss-penned &quot;Never Before&quot; was chosen as the first song to air on the ABC&#x27;s youth radio station, Triple J, when it switched to the FM band that year. Supporting the release of &quot;East&quot;, Cold Chisel embarked on the Youth in Asia Tour from May 1980, which took its name from a lyric in &quot;Star Hotel&quot;.

In late 1980, the Aboriginal rock reggae band No Fixed Address supported the band on its Summer Offensive tour to the east coast, with the final concert on 20 December at the University of Adelaide.

===1981-1982: &quot;Swingshift&quot; to &quot;Circus Animals&quot;===
The Youth in Asia Tour performances were used for Cold Chisel&#x27;s double live album, &quot;Swingshift&quot; (March 1981). Nimmervoll declared, &quot;[the group] rammed what they were all about with [this album].&quot; In March 1981 the band won seven categories: Best Australian Album, Most Outstanding Achievement, Best Recorded Song Writer, Best Australian Producer, Best Australian Record Cover Design, Most Popular Group and Most Popular Record, at the &quot;Countdown&quot;/&quot;TV Week&quot; pop music awards for 1980. They attended the ceremony at the Sydney Entertainment Centre and were due to perform: however, as a protest against a TV magazine&#x27;s involvement, they refused to accept any trophy and finished the night with &quot;My Turn to Cry&quot;. After one verse and chorus, they smashed up the set and left the stage.

&quot;Swingshift&quot; debuted at No 1, which demonstrated their status as the highest-selling local act. With a slightly different track listing, &quot;East&quot; was issued in the United States and they undertook their first US tour in mid-1981. Ahead of the tour they had issued &quot;My Baby&quot; for the North America market and it reached the top 40 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s chart, Mainstream Rock. They were generally popular as a live act there, but the US branch of their label did little to promote the album. According to Barnes&#x27; biographer, Toby Creswell, at one point they were ushered into an office to listen to the US master tape to find it had substantial hiss and other ambient noise, which made it almost unable to be released. Nevertheless, the album reached the lower region of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in July. The group were booed off stage after a lacklustre performance in Dayton, Ohio in May 1981 opening for Ted Nugent. Other support slots they took were for Cheap Trick, Joe Walsh, Heart and the Marshall Tucker Band. European audiences were more accepting of the Australian band and they developed a fan base in Germany.

In August 1981 Cold Chisel began work on a fourth studio album, &quot;Circus Animals&quot; (March 1982), again with Opitz producing. To launch the album, the band performed under a circus tent at Wentworth Park in Sydney and toured heavily once more, including a show in Darwin that attracted more than 10 percent of the city&#x27;s population. It peaked at No. 1 in both Australia and on the Official New Zealand Music Chart. In October 2010 it was listed at No. 4 in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; by music journalists Creswell, Craig Mathieson and John O&#x27;Donnell.

Its lead single, &quot;You Got Nothing I Want&quot; (November 1981), is an aggressive Barnes-penned hard rock track, which attacked the US industry for its handling of the band on their recent tour. The song caused problems for Barnes when he later attempted to break into the US market as a solo performer; senior music executives there continued to hold it against him. Like its predecessor, &quot;Circus Animals&quot; contained songs of contrasting styles, with harder-edged tracks like &quot;Bow River&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; beside more expansive ballads such as the next two singles, &quot;Forever Now&quot; (March 1982) and &quot;When the War Is Over&quot; (August), both written by Prestwich. &quot;Forever Now&quot; is their highest-charting single in two Australasian markets: No. 4 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart and No. 2 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart.

&quot;When the War Is Over&quot; is the most-covered Cold Chisel track – Uriah Heep included a version on their 1989 album, &quot;Raging Silence&quot;; John Farnham recorded it while he and Prestwich were members of Little River Band in the mid-1980s and again for his 1990 solo album, &quot;Age of Reason&quot;. The song was also a No. 1 hit for former &quot;Australian Idol&quot; contestant Cosima De Vito in 2004 and was performed by Bobby Flynn during that show&#x27;s 2006 season. &quot;Forever Now&quot; was covered, as a country waltz, by Australian band the Reels.

===1983: Break-up===
Success outside Australasia continued to elude Cold Chisel and friction occurred between the members. According to McFarlane, &quot;[the] failed attempts to break into the American market represented a major blow... [their] earthy, high-energy rock was overlooked.&quot; In early 1983 they toured Germany but the shows went so badly that in the middle of the tour Walker up-ended his keyboard and stormed off stage during one show. After returning to Australia, Prestwich was fired and replaced by Ray Arnott, formerly of the 1970s progressive rockers Spectrum and country rockers the Dingoes.

After this, Barnes requested a large advance from management. Now married with a young child, reckless spending had left him almost broke. His request was refused as there was a standing arrangement that any advance to one band member had to be paid to all the others. After a meeting on 17 August during which Barnes quit the band it was decided that the group would split up. A farewell concert series, The Last Stand, was planned and a final studio album, &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; (February 1984), was recorded. Prestwich returned for that tour, which began in October. Before the last four scheduled shows in Sydney, Barnes lost his voice and those dates were postponed to mid-December.

The band&#x27;s final performances were at the Sydney Entertainment Centre from 12 to 15 December 1983 – ten years since their first live appearance as Cold Chisel in Adelaide – and the group then disbanded. The Sydney shows formed the basis of a concert film, &quot;The Last Stand&quot; (July 1984), which became the biggest-selling cinema-released concert documentary by an Australian band to that time. Other recordings from the tour were used on a live album, &quot;The Barking Spiders Live: 1983&quot; (1984); the title is a reference to the pseudonym the group occasionally used when playing warm-up shows before tours. Some were also used as B-sides for a three-CD singles package, &quot;Three Big XXX Hits&quot;, issued ahead of the release of their 1994 compilation album, &quot;Teenage Love&quot;.

During breaks in the tour, &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; was recorded. It was a fragmentary process, spread across various studios and sessions as the individual members often refused to work together – both Arnott (on ten tracks) and Prestwich (on three tracks) are recorded as drummers. The album reached No. 1 and provided the singles &quot;Saturday Night&quot; (March 1984) and &quot;Flame Trees&quot; (August), both of which remain radio staples. &quot;Flame Trees&quot;, co-written by Prestwich and Walker, took its title from the BBC series &quot;The Flame Trees of Thika&quot;, although it was lyrically inspired by Walker&#x27;s hometown of Grafton. Barnes later recorded an acoustic version for his 1993 solo album, &quot;Flesh and Wood&quot;, and it was also covered by Sarah Blasko in 2006.

===1984-1996: Aftermath and ARIA Hall of Fame===
Barnes launched his solo career in January 1984, which has provided nine Australian number-one studio albums and an array of hit singles, including &quot;Too Much Ain&#x27;t Enough Love&quot;, which peaked at No. 1. He has recorded with INXS, Tina Turner, Joe Cocker and John Farnham to become one of the country&#x27;s most popular male rock singers. Prestwich joined Little River Band in 1984 and appeared on the albums &quot;Playing to Win&quot; and &quot;No Reins&quot;, before departing in 1986 to join Farnham&#x27;s touring band. Moss, Small and Walker took extended breaks from music.

Small maintained a low profile as a member in a variety of minor groups Pound, the Earls of Duke and the Outsiders. Walker formed Catfish in 1988, ostensibly a solo band with a variable membership, which included Moss, Charlie Owen and Dave Blight at times. Catfish&#x27;s recordings during this phase attracted little commercial success. During 1988 and 1989 Walker wrote several tracks for Moss including the singles &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (November 1988) and &quot;Telephone Booth&quot; (June 1989), which appeared on Moss&#x27; debut solo album, &quot;Matchbook&quot; (August 1989). Both the album and &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Daughter&quot; peaked at No. 1. Moss won five trophies at the ARIA Music Awards of 1990. His other solo albums met with less chart or award success.

Throughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s, Cold Chisel were courted to re-form but refused, at one point reportedly turning down a $5 million offer to play a sole show in each of the major Australian state capitals. Moss and Walker often collaborated on projects; neither worked with Barnes until Walker wrote &quot;Stone Cold&quot; for the singer&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Heat&quot; (October 1993). The pair recorded an acoustic version for &quot;Flesh and Wood&quot; (December). Thanks primarily to continued radio airplay and Barnes&#x27; solo success, Cold Chisel&#x27;s legacy remained solidly intact. By the early 1990s the group had surpassed 3 million album sales, most sold since 1983. The 1991 compilation album, &quot;Chisel&quot;, was re-issued and re-packaged several times, once with the long-deleted 1978 EP as a bonus disc and a second time in 2001 as a double album. The &quot;Last Stand&quot; soundtrack album was finally released in 1992. In 1994 a complete album of previously unreleased demo and rare live recordings, &quot;Teenage Love&quot;, was released, which provided three singles.

===1997–2010: Reunited===
Cold Chisel reunited in October 1997, with the line-up of Barnes, Moss, Prestwich, Small and Walker. They recorded their sixth studio album, &quot;The Last Wave of Summer&quot; (October 1998), from February to July with the band members co-producing. They supported it with a national tour. The album debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart. In 2003 they re-grouped for the Ringside Tour and in 2005 again to perform at a benefit for the victims of the Boxing Day tsunami at the Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne. Founding bass guitarist, Les Kaczmarek, died of liver failure on 5 December 2008, aged 53. Walker described him as &quot;a wonderful and beguiling man in every respect.&quot;

On 10 September 2009 Cold Chisel announced they would re-form for a one-off performance at the Sydney 500 V8 Supercars event on 5 December. The band performed at Stadium Australia to the largest crowd of its career, with more than 45,000 fans in attendance. They played a single live show in 2010: at the Deniliquin ute muster in October. In December Moss confirmed that Cold Chisel were working on new material for an album.

===2011–2019: Death of Steve Prestwich &amp; &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot;===

In January 2011 Steve Prestwich was diagnosed with a brain tumour; he underwent surgery on 14 January but never regained consciousness and died two days later, aged 56. All six of Cold Chisel&#x27;s studio albums were re-released in digital and CD formats in mid-2011. Three digital-only albums were released – &quot;Never Before&quot;, &quot;Besides&quot; and &quot;Covered&quot; – as well as a new compilation album, &quot;The Best of Cold Chisel: All for You&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Charts. The thirty-date Light the Nitro Tour was announced in July along with the news that former Divinyls and Catfish drummer Charley Drayton had replaced Prestwich. Most shows on the tour sold out within days and new dates were later announced for early 2012.

&quot;No Plans&quot;, their seventh studio album, was released in April 2012, with Kevin Shirley producing, which peaked at No. 2. &quot;The Australian&quot;″s Stephen Fitzpatrick rated it as four-and-a-half out of five and found its lead track, &quot;All for You&quot;, &quot;speaks of redemption; of a man&#x27;s ability to make something of himself through love.&quot; The track &quot;I Got Things to Do&quot; was written and sung by Prestwich, which Fitzpatrick described as &quot;the bittersweet finale&quot;, a song that had &quot;a vocal track the other band members did not know existed until after [Prestwich&#x27;s] death.&quot; Midway through 2012 they embarked on a short UK tour and played with Soundgarden and Mars Volta at Hard Rock Calling at London&#x27;s Hyde Park.

The group&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot;, appeared in October 2015, again with Shirley producing, which peaked at No. 2. Martin Boulton of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; rated it at four out of five stars and explained that the album does what Cold Chisel always does: &quot;work incredibly hard, not take any shortcuts and play the hell out of the songs.&quot; The album, Boulton writes, &quot;delves further back to their rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll roots with chief songwriter [Walker] carving up the keys, guitarist [Moss] both gritty and sublime and the [Small/Drayton] engine room firing on every cylinder. Barnes&#x27; voice sounds worn, wonderful and better than ever.&quot;

The band&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Blood Moon&quot;, was released in December 2019. The album debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Album Chart, the band&#x27;s fifth to reach the top. Half of the songs had lyrics written by Barnes and music by Walker, a new combination for Cold Chisel, with Barnes noting his increased confidence after writing two autobiographies.

===2024: 50th Anniversary Tour===
On 29 May 2024, Cold Chisel announced &#x27;The 50th Anniversary Tour&#x27;, beginning in Armidale on 5 October 2024 and ending in the band&#x27;s hometown of Adelaide on 17 November 2024. However, Jimmy Barnes&#x27; wife Jane subsequently posted on X.com that further tour dates including New Zealand would be announced later.

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
McFarlane described Cold Chisel&#x27;s early career in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop&quot; (1999): &quot;after ten years on the road, [they] called it a day. Not that the band split up for want of success; by that stage [they] had built up a reputation previously uncharted in Australian rock history. By virtue of the profound effect the band&#x27;s music had on the many thousands of fans who witnessed its awesome power, Cold Chisel remains one of Australia&#x27;s best-loved groups. As one of the best live bands of its day, [they] fused a combination of rockabilly, hard rock and rough-house soul&#x27;n&#x27;blues that was defiantly Australian in outlook.&quot; &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ Luis Feliu, in July 1978, observed, &quot;This is not just another Australian rock band, no mediocrity here, and their honest, hard-working approach looks like paying off.&quot; He further wrote, &quot;the range of styles tackled and done convincingly, from hard rock to blues, boogie, rhythm and blues, is where the appeal lies.&quot;

Influences from blues and early rock n&#x27; roll was broadly apparent, fostered by the love of those styles by Moss, Barnes and Walker. Small and Prestwich contributed strong pop sensibilities. This allowed volatile rock songs like &quot;You Got Nothing I Want&quot; and &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; to stand beside thoughtful ballads like &quot;Choirgirl&quot;, pop-flavoured love songs like &quot;My Baby&quot; and caustic political statements like &quot;Star Hotel&quot;, an attack on the late-1970s government of Malcolm Fraser, inspired by the Star Hotel riot in Newcastle.

The songs were not overtly political but rather observations of everyday life within Australian society and culture, in which the members with their various backgrounds (Moss was from Alice Springs, Walker grew up in rural New South Wales, Barnes and Prestwich were working-class immigrants from the UK) were quite well able to provide.

Cold Chisel&#x27;s songs were about distinctly Australian experiences, a factor often cited as a major reason for the band&#x27;s lack of international appeal. &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Breakfast at Sweethearts&quot; were observations of the urban experience of Sydney&#x27;s Kings Cross district where Walker lived for many years. &quot;Misfits&quot;, which featured on the B-side to &quot;My Baby&quot;, was about homeless kids in the suburbs surrounding Sydney. Songs like &quot;Shipping Steel&quot; and &quot;Standing on The Outside&quot; were working-class anthems and many others featured characters trapped in mundane, everyday existences, yearning for the good times of the past (&quot;Flame Trees&quot;) or for something better from life (&quot;Bow River&quot;).

==Recognition==

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993 they were inducted into the Hall of Fame. While repackages and compilations accounted for much of these sales, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Love&quot; provided two of its singles, which were top-ten hits. When the group finally re-formed in 1998 the resultant album was also a major hit and the follow-up tour sold out almost immediately. In 2001 Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) listed their single &quot;Khe Sanh&quot; (May 1978) at No. 8 of the all-time best Australian songs.

Cold Chisel were one of the first Australian acts to have become the subject of a major tribute album. In 2007, &quot;Standing on the Outside: The Songs of Cold Chisel&quot; was released, featuring a collection of the band&#x27;s songs as performed by artists including The Living End, Evermore, Something for Kate, Pete Murray, Katie Noonan, You Am I, Paul Kelly, Alex Lloyd, Thirsty Merc and Ben Lee, many of whom were children when Cold Chisel first disbanded and some, like the members of Evermore, had not even been born. &quot;Circus Animals&quot; was listed at No. 4 in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (October 2010), while &quot;East&quot; appeared at No. 53. They won The Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music at the APRA Music Awards of 2016.

In March 2021, a previously unnamed lane off Burnett Street (off Currie Street) in the Adelaide central business district, near where the band had its first residency in the 1970s, was officially named Cold Chisel Lane. On one of its walls, there is a mural by Adelaide artist James Dodd, inspired by the band.
