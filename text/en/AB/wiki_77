<text>In finance, a derivative is a contract between a buyer and a seller. The derivative can take various forms, depending on the transaction, but every derivative has the following four elements: 
# an item (the &quot;underlier&quot;) that can or must be bought or sold,
# a future act which must occur (such as a sale or purchase of the underlier),
# a price at which the future transaction must take place, and
# a future date by which the act (such as a purchase or sale) must take place.

A derivative&#x27;s value depends on the performance of the underlier, which can be a commodity (for example, corn or oil), a financial instrument (e.g. a stock or a bond), a price index, a currency, or an interest rate. 

Derivatives can be used to insure against price movements (hedging), increase exposure to price movements for speculation, or get access to otherwise hard-to-trade assets or markets. Most derivatives are price guarantees. But some are based on an event or performance of an act rather than a price. Agriculture, natural gas, electricity and oil businesses use derivatives to mitigate risk from adverse weather. Derivatives can be used to protect lenders against the risk of borrowers defaulting on an obligation. 

Some of the more common derivatives include forwards, futures, options, swaps, and variations of these such as synthetic collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. Most derivatives are traded over-the-counter (off-exchange) or on an exchange such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while most insurance contracts have developed into a separate industry. In the United States, after the 2007–2008 financial crisis, there has been increased pressure to move derivatives to trade on exchanges.

Derivatives are one of the three main categories of financial instruments, the other two being equity (i.e., stocks or shares) and debt (i.e., bonds and mortgages). The oldest example of a derivative in history, attested to by Aristotle, is thought to be a contract transaction of olives, entered into by ancient Greek philosopher Thales, who made a profit in the exchange. However, Aristotle did not define this arrangement as a derivative but as a monopoly (Aristotle&#x27;s Politics, Book I, Chapter XI). Bucket shops, outlawed in 1936 in the US, are a more recent historical example.

==Basics==
Derivatives are contracts between two parties that specify conditions (especially the dates, resulting values and definitions of the underlying variables, the parties&#x27; contractual obligations, and the notional amount) under which payments are to be made between the parties. The assets include commodities, stocks, bonds, interest rates and currencies, but they can also be other derivatives, which adds another layer of complexity to proper valuation. The components of a firm&#x27;s capital structure, e.g., bonds and stock, can also be considered derivatives, more precisely options, with the underlying being the firm&#x27;s assets, but this is unusual outside of technical contexts.

From the economic point of view, financial derivatives are cash flows that are conditioned stochastically and discounted to present value. The market risk inherent in the underlying asset is attached to the financial derivative through contractual agreements and hence can be traded separately. The underlying asset does not have to be acquired. Derivatives therefore allow the breakup of ownership and participation in the market value of an asset. This also provides a considerable amount of freedom regarding the contract design. That contractual freedom allows derivative designers to modify the participation in the performance of the underlying asset almost arbitrarily. Thus, the participation in the market value of the underlying can be effectively weaker, stronger (leverage effect), or implemented as inverse. Hence, specifically the market price risk of the underlying asset can be controlled in almost every situation.

There are two groups of derivative contracts: the privately traded over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives such as swaps that do not go through an exchange or other intermediary, and exchange-traded derivatives (ETD) that are traded through specialized derivatives exchanges or other exchanges.

Derivatives are more common in the modern era, but their origins trace back several centuries. One of the oldest derivatives is rice futures, which have been traded on the Dojima Rice Exchange since the eighteenth century. Derivatives are broadly categorized by the relationship between the underlying asset and the derivative (such as forward, option, swap); the type of underlying asset (such as equity derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives, interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives, or credit derivatives); the market in which they trade (such as exchange-traded or over-the-counter); and their pay-off profile.

Derivatives may broadly be categorized as &quot;lock&quot; or &quot;option&quot; products. Lock products (such as swaps, futures, or forwards) obligate the contractual parties to the terms over the life of the contract. Option products (such as interest rate swaps) provide the buyer the right, but not the obligation to enter the contract under the terms specified.

Derivatives can be used either for risk management (i.e. to &quot;hedge&quot; by providing offsetting compensation in case of an undesired event, a kind of &quot;insurance&quot;) or for speculation (i.e. making a financial &quot;bet&quot;). This distinction is important because the former is a prudent aspect of operations and financial management for many firms across many industries; the latter offers managers and investors a risky opportunity to increase profit, which may not be properly disclosed to stakeholders.

Along with many other financial products and services, derivatives reform is an element of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Act delegated many rule-making details of regulatory oversight to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and those details are not finalized nor fully implemented as of late 2012.

==Size of market==
To give an idea of the size of the derivative market, &quot;The Economist&quot; has reported that as of June 2011, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market amounted to approximately $700 trillion, and the size of the market traded on exchanges totaled an additional $83 trillion. For the fourth quarter 2017 the European Securities Market Authority estimated the size of European derivatives market at a size of €660 trillion with 74 million outstanding contracts.

However, these are &quot;notional&quot; values, and some economists say that these aggregated values greatly exaggerate the market value and the true credit risk faced by the parties involved. For example, in 2010, while the aggregate of OTC derivatives exceeded $600 trillion, the value of the market was estimated to be much lower, at $21 trillion. The credit-risk equivalent of the derivative contracts was estimated at $3.3 trillion.

Still, even these scaled-down figures represent huge amounts of money. For perspective, the budget for total expenditure of the United States government during 2012 was $3.5 trillion, and the total current value of the U.S. stock market is an estimated $23 trillion. Meanwhile, the global annual Gross Domestic Product is about $65 trillion.

At least for one type of derivative, credit default swaps (CDS), for which the inherent risk is considered high , the higher, nominal value remains relevant. It was this type of derivative that investment magnate Warren Buffett referred to in his famous 2002 speech in which he warned against &quot;financial weapons of mass destruction&quot;. CDS notional value in early 2012 amounted to $25.5 trillion, down from $55 trillion in 2008.

==Usage==
Derivatives are used for the following:
* Hedge or to mitigate risk in the underlying, by entering into a derivative contract whose value moves in the opposite direction to their underlying position and cancels part or all of it out
* Create option ability where the value of the derivative is linked to a specific condition or event (e.g., the underlying reaching a specific price level)
* Obtain exposure to the underlying where it is not possible to trade in the underlying (e.g., weather derivatives)
* Provide leverage (or gearing), such that a small movement in the underlying value can cause a large difference in the value of the derivative
*Speculate and make a profit if the value of the underlying asset moves the way they expect (e.g. moves in a given direction, stays in or out of a specified range, reaches a certain level)
* Switch asset allocations between different asset classes without disturbing the underlying assets, as part of transition management
* Avoid paying taxes. For example, an equity swap allows an investor to receive steady payments, e.g. based on SONIA rate, while avoiding paying capital gains tax and keeping the stock.
* For arbitraging purpose, allowing a riskless profit by simultaneously entering into transactions into two or more markets.

===Mechanics and valuation===

Lock products are theoretically valued at zero at the time of execution and thus do not typically require an up-front exchange between the parties. Based upon movements in the underlying asset over time, however, the value of the contract will fluctuate, and the derivative may be either an asset (i.e., &quot;in the money&quot;) or a liability (i.e., &quot;out of the money&quot;) at different points throughout its life. Importantly, either party is therefore exposed to the credit quality of its counterparty and is interested in protecting itself in an event of default.

Option products have immediate value at the outset because they provide specified protection (intrinsic value) over a given time period (time value). One common form of option product familiar to many consumers is insurance for homes and automobiles. The insured would pay more for a policy with greater liability protections (intrinsic value) and one that extends for a year rather than six months (time value). Because of the immediate option value, the option purchaser typically pays an up front premium. Just like for lock products, movements in the underlying asset will cause the option&#x27;s intrinsic value to change over time while its time value deteriorates steadily until the contract expires. An important difference between a lock product is that, after the initial exchange, the option purchaser has no further liability to its counterparty; upon maturity, the purchaser will execute the option if it has positive value (i.e., if it is &quot;in the money&quot;) or expire at no cost (other than to the initial premium) (i.e., if the option is &quot;out of the money&quot;).

===Hedging===
Derivatives allow risk related to the price of the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another. For example, a wheat farmer and a miller could sign a futures contract to exchange a specified amount of cash for a specified amount of wheat in the future. Both parties have reduced a future risk: for the wheat farmer, the uncertainty of the price, and for the miller, the availability of wheat. However, there is still the risk that no wheat will be available because of events unspecified by the contract, such as the weather, or that one party will renege on the contract. Although a third party, called a clearing house, insures a futures contract, not all derivatives are insured against counter-party risk.

From another perspective, the farmer and the miller both reduce a risk and acquire a risk when they sign the futures contract: the farmer reduces the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract and acquires the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract (thereby losing additional income that he could have earned). The miller, on the other hand, acquires the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract (thereby paying more in the future than he otherwise would have) and reduces the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract. In this sense, one party is the insurer (risk taker) for one type of risk, and the counter-party is the insurer (risk taker) for another type of risk.

Hedging also occurs when an individual or institution buys an asset (such as a commodity, a bond that has coupon payments, a stock that pays dividends, and so on) and sells it using a futures contract. The individual or institution has access to the asset for a specified amount of time, and can then sell it in the future at a specified price according to the futures contract. Of course, this allows the individual or institution the benefit of holding the asset, while reducing the risk that the future selling price will deviate unexpectedly from the market&#x27;s current assessment of the future value of the asset.
Derivatives trading of this kind may serve the financial interests of certain particular businesses. For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a specific interest rate. The interest rate on the loan reprices every six months. The corporation is concerned that the rate of interest may be much higher in six months. The corporation could buy a forward rate agreement (FRA), which is a contract to pay a fixed rate of interest six months after purchases on a notional amount of money. If the interest rate after six months is above the contract rate, the seller will pay the difference to the corporation, or FRA buyer. If the rate is lower, the corporation will pay the difference to the seller. The purchase of the FRA serves to reduce the uncertainty concerning the rate increase and stabilize earnings.

===Speculation===
Derivatives can be used to acquire risk, rather than to hedge against risk. Thus, some individuals and institutions will enter into a derivative contract to speculate on the value of the underlying asset. Speculators look to buy an asset in the future at a low price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is high, or to sell an asset in the future at a high price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is less.

Speculative trading in derivatives gained a great deal of notoriety in 1995 when Nick Leeson, a trader at Barings Bank, made poor and unauthorized investments in futures contracts. Through a combination of poor judgment, lack of oversight by the bank&#x27;s management and regulators, and unfortunate events like the Kobe earthquake, Leeson incurred a $1.3 billion loss that bankrupted the centuries-old institution.

===Arbitrage===

Individuals and institutions may also look for arbitrage opportunities, as when the current buying price of an asset falls below the price specified in a futures contract to sell the asset.

===Proportion used for hedging and speculation===
The true proportion of derivatives contracts used for hedging purposes is unknown, but it appears to be relatively small. Also, derivatives contracts account for only 3–6% of the median firms&#x27; total currency and interest rate exposure. Nonetheless, we know that many firms&#x27; derivatives activities have at least some speculative component for a variety of reasons.

==Types==
In broad terms, there are two groups of derivative contracts, which are distinguished by the way they are traded in the market:

===Over-the-counter derivatives===
Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are contracts that are traded (and privately negotiated) directly between two parties, without going through an exchange or other intermediary. Products such as swaps, forward rate agreements, exotic options – and other exotic derivatives – are almost always traded in this way. The OTC derivative market is the largest market for derivatives, and is largely unregulated with respect to disclosure of information between the parties, since the OTC market is made up of banks and other highly sophisticated parties, such as hedge funds. Reporting of OTC amounts is difficult because trades can occur in private, without activity being visible on any exchanges

According to the Bank for International Settlements, who first surveyed OTC derivatives in 1995, reported that the &quot;gross market value, which represent the cost of replacing all open contracts at the prevailing market prices, ... increased by 74% since 2004, to $11 trillion at the end of June 2007 (BIS 2007:24).&quot; Positions in the OTC derivatives market increased to $516 trillion at the end of June 2007, 135% higher than the level recorded in 2004. The total outstanding notional amount is US$708 trillion (as of June 2011). Of this total notional amount, 67% are interest rate contracts, 8% are credit default swaps (CDS), 9% are foreign exchange contracts, 2% are commodity contracts, 1% are equity contracts, and 12% are other. Because OTC derivatives are not traded on an exchange, there is no central counter-party. Therefore, they are subject to counterparty risk, like an ordinary contract, since each counter-party relies on the other to perform.

===Exchange-traded derivatives===
Exchange-traded derivatives (ETD) are those derivatives instruments that are traded via specialized derivatives exchanges or other exchanges. A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange. A derivatives exchange acts as an intermediary to all related transactions, and takes initial margin from both sides of the trade to act as a guarantee. The world&#x27;s largest derivatives exchanges (by number of transactions) are the Korea Exchange (which lists KOSPI Index Futures &amp; Options), Eurex (which lists a wide range of European products such as interest rate &amp; index products), and CME Group (made up of the 2007 merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade and the 2008 acquisition of the New York Mercantile Exchange). According to BIS, the combined turnover in the world&#x27;s derivatives exchanges totaled US$344 trillion during Q4 2005. By December 2007 the Bank for International Settlements reported that &quot;derivatives traded on exchanges surged 27% to a record $681 trillion.&quot;

===Inverse ETFs and leveraged ETFs===

Inverse exchange-traded funds (IETFs) and leveraged exchange-traded funds (LETFs) are two special types of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that are available to common traders and investors on major exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq. To maintain these products&#x27; net asset value, these funds&#x27; administrators must employ more sophisticated financial engineering methods than what&#x27;s usually required for maintenance of traditional ETFs. These instruments must also be regularly rebalanced and re-indexed each day.

===Common derivative contract===
Some of the common variants of derivative contracts are as follows:
# Forwards: tailored contract between two parties, where payment takes place at a specific time in the future at today&#x27;s pre-determined price.
# Futures: contracts to buy or sell an asset on a future date at a price specified today. A futures contract differs from a forward contract in that the futures contract is a standardized contract written by a clearing house that operates an exchange where the contract can be bought and sold; the forward contract is a non-standardized contract written by the parties themselves.
# Options: contracts that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the strike price, and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. In the case of a European option, the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; in the case of an American option, the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction. Options are of two types: call option and put option.
# Binary options: contracts that provide the owner with an all-or-nothing profit profile.
# Warrants: apart from the commonly used short-dated options which have a maximum maturity period of one year, there exist certain long-dated options as well, known as warrants. These are generally traded over the counter.
# Swaps: contracts to exchange cash (flows) on or before a specified future date based on the underlying value of currencies exchange rates, bonds/interest rates, commodities exchange, stocks or other assets.
::Swaps can basically be categorized into Interest rate swap and Currency swap.
Some common examples of these derivatives are the following:

===Collateralized debt obligation===
A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS). An &quot;asset-backed security&quot; is used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assetsincluding collateralized debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) (Example: &quot;The capital market in which asset-backed securities are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs&quot;.)and sometimes for a particular type of that securityone backed by consumer loans (example: &quot;As a rule of thumb, securitization issues backed by mortgages are called MBS, and securitization issues backed by debt obligations are called CDO, [and] Securitization issues backed by consumer-backed productscar loans, consumer loans and credit cards, among othersare called ABS.) Originally developed for the corporate debt markets, over time CDOs evolved to encompass the mortgage and mortgage-backed security (MBS) markets.

Like other private-label securities backed by assets, a CDO can be thought of as a promise to pay investors in a prescribed sequence, based on the cash flow the CDO collects from the pool of bonds or other assets it owns. The CDO is &quot;sliced&quot; into &quot;tranches&quot;, which &quot;catch&quot; the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority. If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, those in the lowest, most &quot;junior&quot; tranches suffer losses first. The last to lose payment from default are the safest, most senior tranches. Consequently, coupon payments (and interest rates) vary by tranche with the safest/most senior tranches paying the lowest and the lowest tranches paying the highest rates to compensate for higher default risk. As an example, a CDO might issue the following tranches in order of safeness: Senior AAA (sometimes known as &quot;super senior&quot;); Junior AAA; AA; A; BBB; Residual.

Separate special-purpose entitiesrather than the parent investment bankissue the CDOs and pay interest to investors. As CDOs developed, some sponsors repackaged tranches into yet another iteration called &quot;CDO-Squared&quot; or the &quot;CDOs of CDOs&quot;. 
In the early 2000s, CDOs were generally diversified, but by 2006–2007when the CDO market grew to hundreds of billions of dollarsthis changed. CDO collateral became dominated not by loans, but by lower level (BBB or A) tranches recycled from other asset-backed securities, whose assets were usually non-prime mortgages. These CDOs have been called &quot;the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain&quot; for nonprime mortgages, and are credited with giving lenders greater incentive to make non-prime loans leading up to the 2007–09 subprime mortgage crisis.

===Credit default swap===
A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial swap agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer (the creditor of the reference loan) in the event of a loan default (by the debtor) or other credit event. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS &quot;fee&quot; or &quot;spread&quot;) to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults. It was invented by Blythe Masters from JP Morgan in 1994.
In the event of default the buyer of the CDS receives compensation (usually the face value of the loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan. However, anyone with sufficient collateral to trade with a bank or hedge fund can purchase a CDS, even buyers who do not hold the loan instrument and who have no direct insurable interest in the loan (these are called &quot;naked&quot; CDSs). If there are more CDS contracts outstanding than bonds in existence, a protocol exists to hold a credit event auction; the payment received is usually substantially less than the face value of the loan.
Credit default swaps have existed since the early 1990s, and increased in use after 2003. By the end of 2007, the outstanding CDS amount was $62.2 trillion, falling to $26.3 trillion by mid-year 2010 but reportedly $25.5 trillion in early 2012. CDSs are not traded on an exchange and there is no required reporting of transactions to a government agency. During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the lack of transparency in this large market became a concern to regulators as it could pose a systemic risk.

 In March 2010, the [DTCC] Trade Information Warehouse announced it would give regulators greater access to its credit default swaps database.
CDS data can be used by financial professionals, regulators, and the media to monitor how the market views credit risk of any entity on which a CDS is available, which can be compared to that provided by credit rating agencies. U.S. courts may soon be following suit.
Most CDSs are documented using standard forms drafted by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), although there are many variants. In addition to the basic, single-name swaps, there are basket default swaps (BDSs), index CDSs, funded CDSs (also called credit-linked notes), as well as loan-only credit default swaps (LCDS). In addition to corporations and governments, the reference entity can include a special-purpose vehicle issuing asset-backed securities.
Some claim that derivatives such as CDS are potentially dangerous in that they combine priority in bankruptcy with a lack of transparency. A CDS can be unsecured (without collateral) and be at higher risk for a default.

===Forwards===
In finance, a forward contract or simply a forward is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or to sell an asset at a specified future time at an amount agreed upon today, making it a type of derivative instrument. This is in contrast to a spot contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on its spot date, which may vary depending on the instrument, for example most of the FX contracts have Spot Date two business days from today. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a long position, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position. The price agreed upon is called the delivery price, which is equal to the forward price at the time the contract is entered into.
The price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This is one of the many forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the value date where the securities themselves are exchanged.

The forward price of such a contract is commonly contrasted with the spot price, which is the price at which the asset changes hands on the spot date. The difference between the spot and the forward price is the forward premium or forward discount, generally considered in the form of a profit, or loss, by the purchasing party. Forwards, like other derivative securities, can be used to hedge risk (typically currency or exchange rate risk), as a means of speculation, or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the underlying instrument which is time-sensitive.

A closely related contract is a futures contract; they differ in certain respects. Forward contracts are very similar to futures contracts, except they are not exchange-traded, or defined on standardized assets. Forwards also typically have no interim partial settlements or &quot;true-ups&quot; in margin requirements like futuressuch that the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. However, being traded over the counter (OTC), forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark-to-market and daily margin calls. Hence, a forward contract arrangement might call for the loss party to pledge collateral or additional collateral to better secure the party at gain. In other words, the terms of the forward contract will determine the collateral calls based upon certain &quot;trigger&quot; events relevant to a particular counterparty such as among other things, credit ratings, value of assets under management or redemptions over a specific time frame (e.g., quarterly, annually).

===Futures===
In finance, a &#x27;futures contract&#x27; (more colloquially, futures) is a standardized contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified asset of standardized quantity and quality for a price agreed upon today (the &quot;futures price&quot;) with delivery and payment occurring at a specified future date, the &quot;delivery date&quot;, making it a derivative product (i.e. a financial product that is derived from an underlying asset). The contracts are negotiated at a futures exchange, which acts as an intermediary between buyer and seller. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future, the &quot;buyer&quot; of the contract, is said to be &quot;long&quot;, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future, the &quot;seller&quot; of the contract, is said to be &quot;short&quot;.

While the futures contract specifies a trade taking place in the future, the purpose of the futures exchange is to act as intermediary and mitigate the risk of default by either party in the intervening period. For this reason, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up an initial amount of cash (performance bond), the margin. Margins, sometimes set as a percentage of the value of the futures contract, need to be proportionally maintained at all times during the life of the contract to underpin this mitigation because the price of the contract will vary in keeping with supply and demand and will change daily and thus one party or the other will theoretically be making or losing money. To mitigate risk and the possibility of default by either party, the product is marked to market on a daily basis whereby the difference between the prior agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is settled on a daily basis. This is sometimes known as the variation margin where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party&#x27;s margin account and put it into the other party&#x27;s thus ensuring that the correct daily loss or profit is reflected in the respective account. If the margin account goes below a certain value set by the Exchange, then a margin call is made and the account owner must replenish the margin account. This process is known as &quot;marking to market&quot;. Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the spot value (i.e., the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by marking to market). Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates much income for the &quot;caller&quot;.

A closely related contract is a forward contract. A forward is like a futures in that it specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified future date. However, a forward is not traded on an exchange and thus does not have the interim partial payments due to marking to market. Nor is the contract standardized, as on the exchange.
Unlike an option, both parties of a futures contract must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying asset to the buyer, or, if it is a cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures position can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss.

===Mortgage-backed securities===
A mortgage-backed security (MBS) is an asset-backed security that is secured by a mortgage, or more commonly a collection (&quot;pool&quot;) of sometimes hundreds of mortgages. The mortgages are sold to a group of individuals (a government agency or investment bank) that &quot;securitizes&quot;, or packages, the loans together into a security that can be sold to investors. The mortgages of an MBS may be residential or commercial, depending on whether it is an Agency MBS or a Non-Agency MBS; in the United States they may be issued by structures set up by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or they can be &quot;private-label&quot;, issued by structures set up by investment banks. The structure of the MBS may be known as &quot;pass-through&quot;, where the interest and principal payments from the borrower or homebuyer pass through it to the MBS holder, or it may be more complex, made up of a pool of other MBSs. Other types of MBS include collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs, often structured as real estate mortgage investment conduits) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).

The shares of subprime MBSs issued by various structures, such as CMOs, are not identical but rather issued as tranches (French for &quot;slices&quot;), each with a different level of priority in the debt repayment stream, giving them different levels of risk and reward. Tranchesespecially the lower-priority, higher-interest tranchesof an MBS are/were often further repackaged and resold as collaterized debt obligations. These subprime MBSs issued by investment banks were a major issue in the subprime mortgage crisis of 2006–2008
The total face value of an MBS decreases over time, because like mortgages, and unlike bonds, and most other fixed-income securities, the principal in an MBS is not paid back as a single payment to the bond holder at maturity but rather is paid along with the interest in each periodic payment (monthly, quarterly, etc.). This decrease in face value is measured by the MBS&#x27;s &quot;factor&quot;, the percentage of the original &quot;face&quot; that remains to be repaid.

===Options===
In finance, an option is a contract which gives the &quot;buyer&quot; (the owner) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified strike price on or before a specified date. The &quot;seller&quot; has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transactionthat is to sell or buyif the buyer (owner) &quot;exercises&quot; the option. The buyer pays a premium to the seller for this right. An option that conveys to the owner the right to buy something at a certain price is a &quot;call option&quot;; an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell something at a certain price is a &quot;put option&quot;. Both are commonly traded, but for clarity, the call option is more frequently discussed.
Options valuation is a topic of ongoing research in academic and practical finance. In basic terms, the value of an option is commonly decomposed into two parts:
* The first part is the &quot;intrinsic value&quot;, defined as the difference between the market value of the underlying and the strike price of the given option.
* The second part is the &quot;time value&quot;, which depends on a set of other factors which, through a multivariable, non-linear interrelationship, reflect the discounted expected value of that difference at expiration.

Although options valuation has been studied since the 19th century, the contemporary approach is based on the Black–Scholes model, which was first published in 1973.

Options contracts have been known for many centuries. However, both trading activity and academic interest increased when, as from 1973, options were issued with standardized terms and traded through a guaranteed clearing house at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Today, many options are created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated options exchanges, while other over-the-counter options are written as bilateral, customized contracts between a single buyer and seller, one or both of which may be a dealer or market-maker. Options are part of a larger class of financial instruments known as derivative products or simply derivatives.

===Swaps===
A swap is a derivative in which two counterparties exchange cash flows of one party&#x27;s financial instrument for those of the other party&#x27;s financial instrument. The benefits in question depend on the type of financial instruments involved. For example, in the case of a swap involving two bonds, the benefits in question can be the periodic interest (coupon) payments associated with such bonds. Specifically, two counterparties agree to the exchange one stream of cash flows against another stream. These streams are called the swap&#x27;s &quot;legs&quot;. The swap agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way they are accrued and calculated. Usually at the time when the contract is initiated, at least one of these series of cash flows is determined by an uncertain variable such as a floating interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity price, or commodity price.

The cash flows are calculated over a notional principal amount. Contrary to a future, a forward or an option, the notional amount is usually not exchanged between counterparties. Consequently, swaps can be in cash or collateral.
Swaps can be used to hedge certain risks such as interest rate risk, or to speculate on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.

Swaps were first introduced to the public in 1981 when IBM and the World Bank entered into a swap agreement. Today, swaps are among the most heavily traded financial contracts in the world: the total amount of interest rates and currency swaps outstanding is more than $348 trillion in 2010, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The five generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: interest rate swaps, currency swaps, credit swaps, commodity swaps and equity swaps (there are many other types).

==Economic function of the derivative market==
Some of the salient economic functions of the derivative market include:
# Prices in a structured derivative market not only replicate the discernment of the market participants about the future but also lead the prices of underlying to the professed future level. On the expiration of the derivative contract, the prices of derivatives congregate with the prices of the underlying. Therefore, derivatives are essential tools to determine both current and future prices.
# The derivatives market reallocates risk from the people who prefer risk aversion to the people who have an appetite for risk.
# The intrinsic nature of derivatives market associates them to the underlying spot market. Due to derivatives there is a considerable increase in trade volumes of the underlying spot market. The dominant factor behind such an escalation is increased participation by additional players who would not have otherwise participated due to absence of any procedure to transfer risk.
# As supervision, reconnaissance of the activities of various participants becomes tremendously difficult in assorted markets; the establishment of an organized form of market becomes all the more imperative. Therefore, in the presence of an organized derivatives market, speculation can be controlled, resulting in a more meticulous environment.
# Third parties can use publicly available derivative prices as educated predictions of uncertain future outcomes, for example, the likelihood that a corporation will default on its debts.
In a nutshell, there is a substantial increase in savings and investment in the long run due to augmented activities by derivative market participant.

==Valuation==
===Market and arbitrage-free prices===
Two common measures of value are:
* Market price, i.e. the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell the contract
* Arbitrage-free price, meaning that no risk-free profits can be made by trading in these contracts (see &quot;rational pricing&quot;)

===Determining the market price===
For exchange-traded derivatives, market price is usually transparent (often published in real time by the exchange, based on all the current bids and offers placed on that particular contract at any one time). Complications can arise with OTC or floor-traded contracts though, as trading is handled manually, making it difficult to automatically broadcast prices. In particular with OTC contracts, there is no central exchange to collate and disseminate prices.

===Determining the arbitrage-free price===

The arbitrage-free price for a derivatives contract can be complex, and there are many different variables to consider. Arbitrage-free pricing is a central topic of financial mathematics. For futures/forwards the arbitrage free price is relatively straightforward, involving the price of the underlying together with the cost of carry (income received less interest costs), although there can be complexities.

However, for options and more complex derivatives, pricing involves developing a complex pricing model: understanding the stochastic process of the price of the underlying asset is often crucial. A key equation for the theoretical valuation of options is the Black–Scholes formula, which is based on the assumption that the cash flows from a European stock option can be replicated by a continuous buying and selling strategy using only the stock. A simplified version of this valuation technique is the binomial options model.

OTC represents the biggest challenge in using models to price derivatives. Since these contracts are not publicly traded, no market price is available to validate the theoretical valuation. Most of the model&#x27;s results are input-dependent (meaning the final price depends heavily on how we derive the pricing inputs).
Therefore, it is common that OTC derivatives are priced by Independent Agents that both counterparties involved in the deal designate upfront (when signing the contract).

==Risks==
Derivatives are often subject to the following criticisms; particularly since the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the discipline of Risk management has developed attempting to address the below and other risks – see .

=== Hidden tail risk ===
According to Raghuram Rajan, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), &quot;... it may well be that the managers of these firms [investment funds] have figured out the correlations between the various instruments they hold and believe they are hedged. Yet as Chan and others (2005) point out, the lessons of summer 1998 following the default on Russian government debt is that correlations that are zero or negative in normal times can turn overnight to one – a phenomenon they term &quot;phase lock-in&quot;. A hedged position &quot;can become unhedged at the worst times, inflicting substantial losses on those who mistakenly believe they are protected&quot;.
See the FRTB framework, which seeks to address this to some extent.

===Leverage===
The use of derivatives can result in large losses because of the use of leverage, or borrowing. Derivatives allow investors to earn large returns from small movements in the underlying asset&#x27;s price. However, investors could lose large amounts if the price of the underlying moves against them significantly. There have been several instances of massive losses in derivative markets, such as the following:

:* American International Group (AIG) lost more than US$18 billion through a subsidiary over the preceding three quarters on credit default swaps (CDSs). The United States Federal Reserve Bank announced the creation of a secured credit facility of up to US$85 billion, to prevent the company&#x27;s collapse by enabling AIG to meet its obligations to deliver additional collateral to its credit default swap trading partners.
:* The loss of US$7.2 Billion by Société Générale in January 2008 through mis-use of futures contracts.
:* The loss of US$6.4 billion in the failed fund Amaranth Advisors, which was long natural gas in September 2006 when the price plummeted.
:* The loss of US$4.6 billion in the failed fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.
:* The loss of US$1.3 billion equivalent in oil derivatives in 1993 and 1994 by Metallgesellschaft AG.
:* The loss of US$1.2 billion equivalent in equity derivatives in 1995 by Barings Bank.
:*UBS AG, Switzerland&#x27;s biggest bank, suffered a $2 billion loss through unauthorized trading discovered in September 2011.

Derivatives typically have a large notional value. As such, there is the danger that their use could result in losses for which the investor would be unable to compensate. The possibility that this could lead to a chain reaction ensuing in an economic crisis was pointed out by famed investor Warren Buffett in Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s 2002 annual report. Buffett called them &#x27;financial weapons of mass destruction.&#x27; A potential problem with derivatives is that they comprise an increasingly larger notional amount of assets which may lead to distortions in the underlying capital and equities markets themselves. Investors begin to look at the derivatives markets to make a decision to buy or sell securities and so what was originally meant to be a market to transfer risk now becomes a leading indicator.(See Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report for 2002)

===Counterparty risk===
Some derivatives (especially swaps) expose investors to counterparty risk, or risk arising from the other party in a financial transaction. Counterparty risk results from the differences in the current price versus the expected future settlement price. Different types of derivatives have different levels of counter party risk. For example, standardized stock options by law require the party at risk to have a certain amount deposited with the exchange, showing that they can pay for any losses; banks that help businesses swap variable for fixed rates on loans may do credit checks on both parties. However, in private agreements between two companies, for example, there may not be benchmarks for performing due diligence and risk analysis.

==Financial reform and government regulation==
Under US law and the laws of most other developed countries, derivatives have special legal exemptions that make them a particularly attractive legal form to extend credit. The strong creditor protections afforded to derivatives counterparties, in combination with their complexity and lack of transparency however, can cause capital markets to underprice credit risk. This can contribute to credit booms, and increase systemic risks. Indeed, the use of derivatives to conceal credit risk from third parties while protecting derivative counterparties contributed to the 2007–2008 financial crisis in the United States.

In the context of a 2010 examination of the ICE Trust, an industry self-regulatory body, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission which regulates most derivatives, was quoted saying that the derivatives marketplace as it functions now &quot;adds up to higher costs to all Americans&quot;. More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he also said. Additionally, the report said, &quot;[t]he Department of Justice is looking into derivatives, too. The department&#x27;s antitrust unit is actively investigating &#x27;the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries&#x27;, according to a department spokeswoman.&quot;

For legislators and committees responsible for financial reform related to derivatives in the United States and elsewhere, distinguishing between hedging and speculative derivatives activities has been a nontrivial challenge. The distinction is critical because regulation should help to isolate and curtail speculation with derivatives, especially for &quot;systemically significant&quot; institutions whose default could be large enough to threaten the entire financial system. At the same time, the legislation should allow for responsible parties to hedge risk without unduly tying up working capital as collateral that firms may better employ elsewhere in their operations and investment. 
In this regard, it is important to distinguish between financial (e.g. banks) and non-financial end-users of derivatives (e.g. real estate development companies) because these firms&#x27; derivatives usage is inherently different. More importantly, the reasonable collateral that secures these different counterparties can be very different. The distinction between these firms is not always straight forward (e.g., hedge funds or even some private equity firms do not neatly fit either category). Finally, even financial users must be differentiated, as &#x27;large&#x27; banks may classified as &quot;systemically significant&quot; whose derivatives activities must be more tightly monitored and restricted than those of smaller, local and regional banks.

Over-the-counter dealing will be less common as the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act comes into effect. The law mandated the clearing of certain swaps at registered exchanges and imposed various restrictions on derivatives. To implement Dodd-Frank, the CFTC developed new rules in at least 30 areas. The Commission determines which swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and whether a derivatives exchange is eligible to clear a certain type of swap contract.

Nonetheless, the above and other challenges of the rule-making process have delayed full enactment of aspects of the legislation relating to derivatives. The challenges are further complicated by the necessity to orchestrate globalized financial reform among the nations that comprise the world&#x27;s major financial markets, a primary responsibility of the Financial Stability Board whose progress is ongoing.

In the U.S., by February 2012 the combined effort of the SEC and CFTC had produced over 70 proposed and final derivatives rules. However, both of them had delayed adoption of a number of derivatives regulations because of the burden of other rule-making, litigation and opposition to the rules, and many core definitions (such as the terms &quot;swap&quot;, &quot;security-based swap&quot;, &quot;swap dealer&quot;, &quot;security-based swap dealer&quot;, &quot;major swap participant&quot; and &quot;major security-based swap participant&quot;) had still not been adopted. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro opined: &quot;At the end of the day, it probably does not make sense to harmonize everything [between the SEC and CFTC rules] because some of these products are quite different and certainly the market structures are quite different.&quot; On February 11, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released two final rules toward establishing a reporting and public disclosure framework for security-based swap transaction data. The two rules are not completely harmonized with the requirements with CFTC requirements.
In November 2012, the SEC and regulators from Australia, Brazil, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Ontario, Quebec, Singapore, and Switzerland met to discuss reforming the OTC derivatives market, as had been agreed by leaders at the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit in September 2009. In December 2012, they released a joint statement to the effect that they recognized that the market is a global one and &quot;firmly support the adoption and enforcement of robust and consistent standards in and across jurisdictions&quot;, with the goals of mitigating risk, improving transparency, protecting against market abuse, preventing regulatory gaps, reducing the potential for arbitrage opportunities, and fostering a level playing field for market participants. They also agreed on the need to reduce regulatory uncertainty and provide market participants with sufficient clarity on laws and regulations by avoiding, to the extent possible, the application of conflicting rules to the same entities and transactions, and minimizing the application of inconsistent and duplicative rules. At the same time, they noted that &quot;complete harmonization – perfect alignment of rules across jurisdictions&quot; would be difficult, because of jurisdictions&#x27; differences in law, policy, markets, implementation timing, and legislative and regulatory processes.

On December 20, 2013, the CFTC provided information on its swaps regulation &quot;comparability&quot; determinations. The release addressed the CFTC&#x27;s cross-border compliance exceptions. Specifically it addressed which entity level and in some cases transaction-level requirements in six jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, and Switzerland) it found comparable to its own rules, thus permitting non-US swap dealers, major swap participants, and the foreign branches of US Swap Dealers and major swap participants in these jurisdictions to comply with local rules in lieu of Commission rules.

===Reporting===
Mandatory reporting regulations are being finalized in a number of countries, such as Dodd Frank Act in the US, the European Market Infrastructure Regulations (EMIR) in Europe, as well as regulations in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Canada, and other countries. The OTC Derivatives Regulators Forum (ODRF), a group of over 40 worldwide regulators, provided trade repositories with a set of guidelines regarding data access to regulators, and the Financial Stability Board and CPSS IOSCO also made recommendations in with regard to reporting.

DTCC, through its &quot;Global Trade Repository&quot; (GTR) service, manages global trade repositories for interest rates, and commodities, foreign exchange, credit, and equity derivatives. It makes global trade reports to the CFTC in the U.S., and plans to do the same for ESMA in Europe and for regulators in Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. It covers cleared and uncleared OTC derivatives products, whether or not a trade is electronically processed or bespoke.

==Glossary==
* Bilateral netting: A legally enforceable arrangement between a bank and a counter-party that creates a single legal obligation covering all included individual contracts. This means that a bank&#x27;s obligation, in the event of the default or insolvency of one of the parties, would be the net sum of all positive and negative fair values of contracts included in the bilateral netting arrangement.
* Counterparty: The legal and financial term for the other party in a financial transaction.
* Credit derivative: A contract that transfers credit risk from a protection buyer to a credit protection seller. Credit derivative products can take many forms, such as credit default swaps, credit linked notes and total return swaps.
* Derivative: A financial contract whose value is derived from the performance of assets, interest rates, currency exchange rates, or indexes. Derivative transactions include a wide assortment of financial contracts including structured debt obligations and deposits, swaps, futures, options, caps, floors, collars, forwards and various combinations thereof.
* Exchange-traded derivative contracts: Standardized derivative contracts (e.g., futures contracts and options) that are transacted on an organized futures exchange.
* Gross negative fair value: The sum of the fair values of contracts where the bank owes money to its counter-parties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses the bank&#x27;s counter-parties would incur if the bank defaults and there is no netting of contracts, and no bank collateral was held by the counter-parties.
* Gross positive fair value: The sum total of the fair values of contracts where the bank is owed money by its counter-parties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses a bank could incur if all its counter-parties default and there is no netting of contracts, and the bank holds no counter-party collateral.
* High-risk mortgage securities: Securities where the price or expected average life is highly sensitive to interest rate changes, as determined by the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council policy statement on high-risk mortgage securities.
* Notional amount: The nominal or face amount that is used to calculate payments made on swaps and other risk management products. This amount generally does not change hands and is thus referred to as notional.
* Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts: Privately negotiated derivative contracts that are transacted off organized futures exchanges.
* Structured notes: Non-mortgage-backed debt securities, whose cash flow characteristics depend on one or more indices and / or have embedded forwards or options.
* Total risk-based capital: The sum of tier 1 plus tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders equity, perpetual preferred shareholders equity with noncumulative dividends, retained earnings, and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 2 capital consists of subordinated debt, intermediate-term preferred stock, cumulative and long-term preferred stock, and a portion of a bank&#x27;s allowance for loan and lease losses.

<doc id="9137" wikidata="Q839452" url="?curid=9137" title="Divine right of kings">
<text>Divine right of kings, divine right, or God&#x27;s mandation, is a political and religious doctrine of political legitimacy of a monarchy in Western Christianity up until the Enlightenment. It is also known as the divine-right theory of kingship.

The doctrine asserts that a monarch is not accountable to any earthly authority (such as a parliament or the Pope) because their right to rule is derived from divine authority. Thus, the monarch is not subject to the will of the people, of the aristocracy, or of any other estate of the realm. It follows that only divine authority can judge a monarch, and that any attempt to depose, dethrone, resist or restrict their powers runs contrary to God&#x27;s will and may constitute a sacrilegious act. It does not imply that their power is absolute.

In its full-fledged form, the Divine Right of Kings is associated with Henry VIII of England (and the Acts of Supremacy), James VI and I of Scotland and England, Louis XIV of France, and their successors. 

In contrast, the conception of human rights started being developed during the Middle Ages by scholars such as St. Thomas Aquinas (see Natural Law) and were systematised by the thinkers of the Age of Enlightenment, e.g. John Locke. Liberty, dignity, freedom and equality are examples of important human rights.

== Concept ==
Divine right has been a key element of the self-legitimization of many absolute monarchies, connected with their authority and right to rule. Related but distinct notions include Caesaropapism (the complete subordination of bishops etc. to the secular power), Supremacy (the legal sovereignty of the civil laws over the laws of the Church), Absolutism (a form of monarchical or despotic power that is unrestrained by all other institutions, such as churches, legislatures, or social elites) or Tyranny (an absolute ruler who is unrestrained even by moral law). 

Historically, many notions of rights have been authoritarian and hierarchical, with different people granted different rights and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to receive respect from his son did not indicate a right for the son to receive a return from that respect. Analogously, the divine right of kings, which permitted absolute power over subjects, provided few rights for the subjects themselves.

It is sometimes signified by the phrase &quot;by the Grace of God&quot; or its Latin equivalent, &quot;Dei Gratia&quot;, which has historically been attached to the titles of certain reigning monarchs. Note, however, that such accountability only to God does not &quot;per se&quot; make the monarch a sacred king.

== Religious traditions ==

=== Hinduism ===

The Hindu text Mahabharata contains several concepts of kingship, especially underscoring its divine origins. The king is considered an embodiment of Indra, and fealty to him is considered as submitting to divine authority. In the Rajadharmanusasana Parva, Bhishma talks of the period before men had kings, and there was chaos all around - 

The Mahabharata also mentions that in a land without king or royal authority, Vedic rituals are ineffectual and Agni does not convey sacrificial libations to the gods.
=== Zoroastrianism (Iranian world) ===

Khvarenah (also spelled &quot;khwarenah&quot; or &quot;xwarra(h)&quot;: &quot;&quot;; ) is an Iranian and Zoroastrian concept, which literally means &quot;glory&quot;, about divine right of the kings. This may stem from early Mesopotamian culture, where kings were often regarded as deities after their death. Shulgi of Ur was among the first Mesopotamian rulers to declare himself to be divine. In the Iranian view, kings would never rule, unless Khvarenah is with them, and they will never fall unless Khvarenah leaves them. For example, according to the &quot;Kar-namag of Ardashir,&quot; when Ardashir I of Persia and Artabanus V of Parthia fought for the throne of Iran, on the road Artabanus and his contingent are overtaken by an enormous ram, which is also following Ardashir. Artabanus&#x27;s religious advisors explain to him that the ram is the manifestation of the &quot;khwarrah&quot; of the ancient Iranian kings, which is leaving Artabanus to join Ardashir.

=== Judaism ===
While the earliest references to kingship among Israel in the Hebrew Bible proclaim that 14.When you come to the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and you possess it and dwell in it and then say, &#x27;I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me&#x27;. 

15. You may indeed set a king over you whom the Lord your God will choose. One from among your brothers you shall set as king over you. You may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother.(Deut 17:14-15). Significant debate on the legitimacy of kingship has persisted in Rabbinical Judaism until Maimonides, though many mainstream currents continue to reject the notion. 

The controversy is highlighted by the instructions to the Israelites in the above-quoted passage, as well as the passages in 1 Samuel 8 and 12, concerning the dispute over kingship; and &quot;Perashat Shoftim.&quot; It is from 1 Samuel 8 that the people of Israel receive &quot;mishpat ha-melech,&quot; the &quot;ius regium&quot;, or the law of kingship, and from this passage that Maimonides finally concludes that Judaism supports the institution of monarchy, stating that the Israelites had been given three commandments upon entering the Promised Land - to designate a king for themselves, to wipe out the memory of Amalek, and to build the Temple. 

The debate has primarily centered around the problem of being told to &quot;designate&quot; a king, which some rabbinical sources have argued is an invocation &quot;against&quot; a divine right of kings, and a call to elect a leader, in opposition to a notion of a divine right. Other rabbinical arguments have put forward an idea that it is through the collective decision of the people that God&#x27;s will is made manifest, and that the king does therefore have a divine right - once appointed by the nation, he is God&#x27;s emissary. 

Jewish law requires one to recite a special blessing upon seeing a monarch: &quot;Blessed are You, L‑rd our G‑d, King of the universe, Who has given from His glory to flesh and blood&quot;.

===Christianity ===
The Christian notion of a divine right of kings is traced to a story found in 1 Samuel, where the prophet Samuel anoints Saul and then David as &quot;Messiah&quot; (&quot;anointed one&quot;)—king over Israel. In Jewish traditions, the lack of a divine leadership represented by an anointed king, beginning shortly after the death of Joshua, left the people of Israel vulnerable, and the promise of the &quot;promised land&quot; was not fully fulfilled until a king was anointed by a prophet on behalf of God.

The effect of anointing was seen to be that the monarch became inviolable, so that even when Saul sought to kill David, David would not raise his hand against him because &quot;he was the Lord&#x27;s anointed&quot;. Raising a hand to a king was therefore considered to be as sacrilegious as raising a hand against God and stood on equal footing as blasphemy. In essence, the king stood in place of God and was never to be challenged &quot;without the challenger being accused of blasphemy&quot; – except by a prophet, which under Christianity was replaced by the church.

== Pre-Modern history ==

With the rise of firearms, nation-states and the Protestant Reformation in the late 16th century, the theory of divine right justified the king&#x27;s absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters. Henry VIII of England declared himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England and exerted the power of the throne more than any of his predecessors. 

As a political theory, it was further developed by James VI of Scotland (1567–1625) and came to the fore in England under his reign as James I of England (1603–1625). Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) strongly promoted the theory as well.

Historian J. P. Sommerville stresses the theory was polemic: &quot;Absolutists magnified royal power. They did this to protect the state against anarchy and to refute the ideas of resistance theorists&quot;, those being in Britain Catholic and Presbyterian theorists.

The concept of divine right incorporates, but exaggerates, the ancient Christian concept of &quot;royal God-given rights&quot;, which teach that &quot;the right to rule is anointed by God&quot;, although this idea is found in many other cultures, including Aryan and Egyptian traditions. 

=== Medieval Era ===

Outside of Christianity, kings were often seen as ruling with the backing of heavenly powers. 

====Early Middle Ages====

Although the later Roman Empire had developed the European concept of a divine regent in Late Antiquity, Adomnan of Iona provides one of the earliest written examples of a Western medieval concept of kings ruling with divine right. He wrote of the Irish King Diarmait mac Cerbaill&#x27;s assassination and claimed that divine punishment fell on his assassin for the act of violating the monarch. 

Adomnan also recorded a story about Saint Columba supposedly being visited by an angel carrying a glass book, who told him to ordain Aedan mac Gabrain as King of Dal Riata. Columba initially refused, and the angel answered by whipping him and demanding that he perform the ordination because God had commanded it. The same angel visited Columba on three successive nights. Columba finally agreed, and Aedan came to receive ordination. At the ordination, Columba told Aedan that so long as he obeyed God&#x27;s laws, then none of his enemies would prevail against him, but the moment he broke them, this protection would end, and the same whip with which Columba had been struck would be turned against the king. 

Adomnan&#x27;s writings most likely influenced other Irish writers, who in turn influenced continental ideas as well. Pepin the Short&#x27;s coronation may have also come from the same influence. The Byzantine Empire can be seen as the progenitor of this concept (which began with Constantine I). This in turn inspired the Carolingian dynasty and the Holy Roman Emperors, whose lasting impact on Western and Central Europe further inspired all subsequent Western ideas of kingship.

====High Middle Ages====
In the Middle Ages, the idea that God had granted certain earthly powers to the monarch, just as he had given spiritual authority and power to the church, especially to the Pope, was already a well-known concept long before later writers coined the term &quot;divine right of kings&quot; and employed it as a theory in political science. 

However, the dividing line for the authority and power was a subject of frequent contention: notably in England with the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett (1170). For example, Richard I of England declared at his trial during the diet at Speyer in 1193: &quot;&quot;, and it was Richard who first used the motto &quot;&quot; (&quot;God and my right&quot;) which is still the motto of the Monarch of the United Kingdom.

Thomas Aquinas condoned extra-legal tyrannicide in the worst of circumstances:
On the other hand, Aquinas forbade the overthrow of any morally, Christianly and spiritually legitimate king by his subjects. The only human power capable of deposing the king was the pope. The reasoning was that if a subject may overthrow his superior for some bad law, who was to be the judge of whether the law was bad? If the subject could so judge his own superior, then all lawful superior authority could lawfully be overthrown by the arbitrary judgement of an inferior, and thus all law was under constant threat.

According to John of Paris, kings had their jurisdictions and bishops (and the pope) had theirs, but kings derived their supreme, non-absolute temporal jurisdiction from popular consent.

====Late Middle Ages and Renaissance====

The Church was the final guarantor that Christian kings would follow the laws and constitutional traditions of their ancestors and the laws of God and of justice.

Radical English theologian John Wycliffe&#x27;s theory of Dominium meant that injuries inflicted on someone personally by a king should be born by them submissively, a conventional idea, but that injuries by a king against God should be patiently resisted even to death; gravely sinful kings and popes forfeited their (divine) right to obedience and ownership, though the political order should be maintained. More aggressive versions of this were taken up by Lollards and Hussites.

For Erasmus of Rotterdam it was the consent of the people which gives and takes away &quot;the purple&quot;, not an unchangeable divine mandate.

===Catholic limits===
Catholic jurisprudence holds that the monarch is always subject to natural and divine law, which are regarded as superior to the monarch. 

The possibility of monarchy declining morally, overturning natural law, and degenerating into a tyranny oppressive of the general welfare was answered theologically with the Catholic concept of the spiritual superiority of the Pope (there is no &quot;Catholic concept of extra-legal tyrannicide&quot;, as some falsely suppose, the same being expressly condemned by St Thomas Aquinas in chapter 7 of his &quot;De Regno&quot;). 

Catholic thought justified limited submission to the monarchy by reference to the following:
# The Old Testament, in which God chose kings to rule over Israel, beginning with Saul who was then rejected by God in favour of David, whose dynasty continued (at least in the southern kingdom) until the Babylonian captivity.
# The New Testament, in which the first pope, Peter, commands that all Christians shall honour the Roman Emperor, even though, at that time, he was still a pagan emperor. Paul agreed with Peter that subjects should be obedient to the powers that be because they are appointed by God, as he wrote in his Epistle to the Romans. Likewise, Jesus Christ proclaims in the Gospel of Matthew that one should &quot;Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar&#x27;s&quot;; that is at first, literally, the payment of taxes as binding those who use the imperial currency. Jesus told Pontius Pilate that his authority as Roman governor of Judaea came from heaven according to John 19:10–11.
# The endorsement by the popes and the church of the line of emperors beginning with the Emperors Constantine and Theodosius, later the Eastern Roman emperors, and finally the Western Roman emperor, Charlemagne and his successors, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperors.

== Conceptions in the early modern period ==

=== Reformation Era ===

The divine right of kings, or divine-right theory of kingship, is a political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy. It asserts that a monarch is subject to no earthly authority, deriving his right to rule directly from the will of God. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or any other estate of the realm, including (in the view of some, especially in Protestant countries) the church.

A weaker or more moderate form of this political theory does hold, however, that the king is subject to the church and the pope, although completely irreproachable in other ways; but according to this doctrine in its strong form, only God can judge an unjust king. 

The doctrine implies that any attempt to depose the king or to restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act.

Before the Reformation the anointed king was, within his realm, the accredited vicar of God for secular purposes (see the Investiture Controversy); after the Reformation he (or she if queen regnant) became this in Protestant states for religious purposes also.

==== Kingdom of Scotland ====

The Scots textbooks of the divine right of kings were written in 1597–1598 by James VI of Scotland. His &quot;Basilikon Doron&quot;, a manual on the powers of a king, was written to edify his four-year-old son Henry Frederick that a king &quot;acknowledgeth himself ordained for his people, having received from God a burden of government, whereof he must be countable&quot;. 

The conception of ordination brought with it largely unspoken parallels with the Anglican and Catholic priesthood, but the overriding metaphor in James VI&#x27;s &#x27;Basilikon Doron&#x27; was that of a father&#x27;s relation to his children. &quot;Just as no misconduct on the part of a father can free his children from obedience to the fifth commandment.&quot;

====Kingdom of England====
James, after becoming James I of England, also had printed his &quot;Defense of the Right of Kings&quot; in the face of English theories of inalienable popular and clerical rights. 

He based his theories in part on his understanding of the Bible, as noted by the following quote from a speech to parliament delivered in 1610 as James I of England:

James&#x27;s reference to &quot;God&#x27;s lieutenants&quot; is apparently a reference to the text in Romans 13 where Paul refers to &quot;God&#x27;s ministers&quot;.

=====Ceremonial conflation=====
Some of the symbolism within the coronation ceremony for British monarchs, in which they are anointed with holy oils by the Archbishop of Canterbury, thereby &quot;ordaining&quot; them to monarchy, perpetuates the ancient Roman Catholic monarchical ideas and ceremonial (although few Protestants realize this, the ceremony is nearly entirely based upon that of the Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor). However, in the UK, the symbolism ends there since the real governing authority of the monarch was all but extinguished by the Whig revolution of 1688–89 (see Glorious Revolution). The king or queen of the United Kingdom is one of the last monarchs still to be crowned in the traditional Christian ceremonial, which in most other countries has been replaced by an inauguration or other declaration.

In England, it is not without significance that the sacerdotal vestments, generally discarded by the clergy – dalmatic, alb and stole – continued to be among the insignia of the sovereign (see Coronation of the British monarch). Moreover, this sacrosanct character he acquired not by virtue of his &quot;sacring&quot;, but by hereditary right; the coronation, anointing and vesting were but the outward and visible symbol of a divine grace adherent in the sovereign by virtue of his title. Even Roman Catholic monarchs, like Louis XIV, would never have admitted that their coronation by the archbishop constituted any part of their title to reign; it was no more than the consecration of their title.

====Kingdom of France====

The French prelate Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet made a classic statement of the doctrine of divine right in a sermon preached before King Louis XIV:


The French Huguenot nobles and clergy, having rejected the pope and the Catholic Church, were left only with the supreme power of the king who, they taught, could not be gainsaid or judged by anyone. Since there was no longer the countervailing power of the papacy and since the Church of England was a creature of the state and had become subservient to it, this meant that there was nothing to regulate the powers of the king, and he became an absolute power. In theory, divine, natural, customary, and constitutional law still held sway over the king, but, absent a superior spiritual power, it was difficult to see how they could be enforced since the king could not be tried by any of his own courts.

====Holy Roman Empire====
One passage in scripture supporting the idea of the divine right of kings was used by Martin Luther, when urging the secular authorities to crush the Peasant Rebellion of 1525 in Germany in his &quot;Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants&quot;, basing his argument on Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans.

It is related to the ancient Catholic philosophies regarding monarchy, in which the monarch is God&#x27;s vicegerent upon the earth and therefore subject to no inferior power.

=== Religious Opposition ===
In the sixteenth century, both Catholic and Protestant political thinkers alike challenged the idea of a monarch&#x27;s &quot;divine right&quot;.

====Catholic====
The Spanish Catholic historian Juan de Mariana put forward the argument in his book &quot;De rege et regis institutione&quot; (1598) that since society was formed by a &quot;pact&quot; among all its members, &quot;there can be no doubt that they are able to call a king to account&quot;. Mariana thus challenged divine right theories by stating in certain circumstances, tyrannicide could be justified. 

Cardinal Robert Bellarmine also &quot;did not believe that the institute of monarchy had any divine sanction&quot; and shared Mariana&#x27;s belief that there were times where Catholics could lawfully remove a monarch.

====Protestant====
Among groups of English Protestant exiles fleeing from Queen Mary I, some of the earliest anti-monarchist publications emerged. &quot;Weaned off uncritical royalism by the actions of Queen Mary ... The political thinking of men like Ponet, Knox, Goodman and Hales.&quot;

In 1553, Mary I, a Roman Catholic, succeeded her Protestant half-brother, Edward VI, to the English throne. Mary set about trying to restore Roman Catholicism by making sure that: Edward&#x27;s religious laws were abolished in the Statute of Repeal Act (1553); the Protestant religious laws passed in the time of Henry VIII were repealed; and the Revival of the Heresy Acts were passed in late 1554. 

When Thomas Wyatt the Younger instigated what became known as Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion in early 1554, John Ponet, the highest-ranking ecclesiastic among the exiles, allegedly participated in the uprising. He escaped to Strasbourg after the Rebellion&#x27;s defeat and, the following year, he published &quot;A Shorte Treatise of Politike Power&quot;, in which he put forward a theory of justified opposition to secular rulers.


Ponet&#x27;s pamphlet was republished on the eve of King Charles I&#x27;s execution.

== Peak and decline ==
=== Pre-Enlightenment ===

In England the doctrine of the divine right of kings was developed to its most extreme logical conclusions during the political controversies of the 17th century; its most famous exponent was Sir Robert Filmer. It was the main issue to be decided by the English Civil War, the Royalists holding that &quot;all Christian kings, princes and governors&quot; derive their authority direct from God, the Parliamentarians that this authority is the outcome of a contract, actual or implied, between sovereign and people.

In one case the king&#x27;s power would be unlimited, according to the famous saying misattributed to Louis XIV: &quot;L&#x27; état, c&#x27;est moi&quot;, or limited only by his own free act; in the other his actions would be governed by the advice and consent of the people, to whom he would be ultimately responsible. The victory of this latter principle was proclaimed to all the world by the execution of Charles I. 

The doctrine of divine right, indeed, for a while drew nourishment from the blood of the royal &quot;martyr&quot;; it was the guiding principle of the Anglican Church of the Restoration; but it suffered a rude blow when James II of England made it impossible for the clergy to obey both their conscience and their king. 

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 made an end of it as a great political force. This has led to the constitutional development of the Crown in Britain, as held by descent modified and modifiable by parliamentary action.

=== Enlightenment era ===

U.S. Founding Father John Adams considered John Ponet&#x27;s work to have contained &quot;all the essential principles of liberty, which were afterward dilated on by Sidney and Locke&quot;, including the idea of a three-branched government.

Over time, opposition to the divine right of kings came from a number of sources, including poet John Milton in his pamphlet &quot;The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates&quot;, and Thomas Paine in his pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot;. By 1700 an Anglican 
Archbishop was prepared to assert that Kings hold their Crowns by 
law alone, and the law may forfeit them. 

Probably the two most famous declarations of a right to revolution against tyranny in the English language are John Locke&#x27;s &quot;Essay concerning The True Original, Extent, and End of Civil-Government&quot; and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s formulation in the United States Declaration of Independence that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;.

<doc id="9138" wikidata="Q3019183" url="?curid=9138" title="Davros">
<text>Davros () is a fictional character from the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He was created by screenwriter Terry Nation, originally for the 1975 serial &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;. Davros is a major enemy of the series&#x27; protagonist, the Doctor, and is the creator of the Doctor&#x27;s deadliest enemies, the Daleks. Davros is a genius who has mastered many areas of science, but also a who believes that through his creations he can become the supreme being and ruler of the Universe. The character has been compared to the infamous dictator Adolf Hitler several times, including by the actor Terry Molloy, while Julian Bleach defined him as a cross between Hitler and the renowned scientist Stephen Hawking.

Davros is from the planet Skaro, whose people, the Kaleds, were engaged in a bitter thousand-year war of attrition with their enemies, the Thals. He is horribly scarred and disabled, a condition that various spin-off media attribute to his laboratory being attacked by a Thal shell. He has one functioning hand and one cybernetic eye mounted on his forehead to take the place of his real eyes, which he is not able to open for long; for much of his existence he depends completely upon a self-designed mobile life-support chair in place of his lower body. It would become an obvious inspiration for his eventual design of the Dalek. The lower half of his body is absent and he is physically incapable of leaving the chair for more than a few minutes without dying. Davros&#x27; voice, like those of the Daleks, is electronically distorted. His manner of speech is generally soft and contemplative, but when angered or excited he is prone to ranting outbursts that resemble the hysterical, staccatissimo speech of the Daleks.

==Concept==

Davros first appeared in the 1975 serial &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, written by Terry Nation. Nation, creator of the Dalek concept, had deliberately modelled elements of the Daleks&#x27; character on Nazi ideology, and conceived of their creator as a scientist with strong fascist tendencies. The physical appearance of Davros was developed by visual effects designer Peter Day and sculptor John Friedlander, who based Davros&#x27; chair on the lower half of a Dalek. Producer Philip Hinchcliffe told Friedlander to consider a design similar to the Mekon from the &quot;Eagle&quot; comic &quot;Dan Dare&quot;, with a large dome-like head and a withered body.

Cast in the role of Davros was Michael Wisher, who had previously appeared in several different roles on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and had provided Dalek voices in the serials &quot;Frontier in Space&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Death to the Daleks&quot;. Wisher based his performance as Davros on the philosopher Bertrand Russell. In order to prepare for filming under the heavy mask, Wisher rehearsed wearing a paper bag over his head. Friedlander&#x27;s mask was cast in hard latex, with only the mouth revealing Wisher&#x27;s features; make-up artist Sylvia James shaded the mask&#x27;s tones and blackened Wisher&#x27;s lips and teeth to hide the transition.

In the serial &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;, Davros is played by David Gooderson using the mask Friedlander made for Wisher after it was split into intersecting sections to get as good a fit as possible. When Terry Molloy took over the role in &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;, a new mask was designed by Stan Mitchell.

In 2023, Julian Bleach, who played the character in four episodes of the revived series, reprised the role of Davros for a minisode aired during &quot;Children in Need&quot;, informally titled &quot;Destination: Skaro&quot;, in which Davros is depicted as non-disabled and without scarring. In an interview for &quot;Doctor Who: Unleashed&quot;, executive producer Russell T. Davies said that this is how Davros will be depicted in future appearances, to avoid contributing to harmful tropes of disabled villains in media.

The decision to portray Davros as an able-bodied character received a divisive reception from fans.

==Character history==

===Encounters with the Fourth Doctor===

The Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) first encountered Davros (Michael Wisher) in &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; when he and his companions were sent to Skaro to avert the creation of the Daleks. As chief scientist of the Kaleds and leader of their elite scientific division, Davros devised new military strategies in order to win his people&#x27;s thousand-year war against the Thal race that also occupies Skaro. When Davros learned his people were evolving from exposure to nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and biological weapons used in the war, he artificially accelerates the process to his design and stores the resulting tentacled creatures in tank-like &quot;Mark III travel machines&quot; partly based on the design of his wheelchair. He later names these creatures &quot;Daleks&quot;, an anagram of Kaleds.

Davros quickly becomes obsessed with his creations, considering them to be the ultimate form of life compared to others. When other Kaleds attempted to thwart his project, Davros arranges the extinction of his own people by using the Thals, whom he mostly killed with the Daleks later. Davros then weeds out those in elite scientific division who are loyal to him so he can have the Daleks eliminate the rest. However, the Daleks ultimately turn on Davros, killing his supporters before shooting him when he tries to halt the Dalek production line.

In &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;, it is revealed that Davros (now played by David Gooderson) was not killed, but placed in suspended animation and buried underground in the destruction of his bunker. The Daleks unearth their creator to help them break a logical impasse in their war against the android Movellans. However, the Dalek force is destroyed by the Doctor, and Davros is captured and imprisoned in suspended animation by the humans, before being taken to Earth to face trial.

===The Dalek Civil War===

In the Fifth Doctor story &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;, Davros (Terry Molloy) is released from his space station prison by a small Dalek force aided by human mercenaries and Dalek duplicates. The Daleks require Davros to find an antidote for a Movellan-created virus that has all but wiped them out. Believing his creations to be treacherous, Davros begins using a syringe-like mind control device hidden in a secret compartment in his wheelchair on Daleks and humans; he ultimately releases a sample of the virus to kill off the Daleks before they can exterminate him. Davros expresses a desire to build a new and improved race of Daleks, but he apparently succumbs to the virus himself, his physiology being close enough to that of the Daleks for the virus to affect him.

In the Sixth Doctor story &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;, it is revealed that Davros managed to escape at the end of &quot;Resurrection&quot; and has gone into hiding as &quot;The Great Healer&quot; of the funeral and cryogenic preservation centre Tranquil Repose on the planet Necros. There, creating a clone of his head to serve as a decoy while modifying his body so that it can fire electric bolts and his chair is able to hover, Davros uses the more intelligent frozen bodies to engineer a new variety of white armoured Daleks loyal to him (while using the lesser intellects as food for the galaxy, ending a galaxy-wide famine), but he is captured by the original Daleks and taken to Skaro to face trial.

Davros&#x27; final classic appearance is as the Emperor Dalek in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;, with his white and gold Daleks now based on Skaro and termed &quot;Imperial Daleks&quot;, fighting against the grey &quot;Renegade Dalek&quot; faction, who answer to the Dalek Supreme. By this time, Davros has been physically transplanted into a customised Dalek casing. He is only revealed to be the Emperor in the final episode. Both Skaro and the Imperial Dalek mothership are apparently destroyed (in the future) when the Seventh Doctor tricks Davros into using the Time Lord artefact known as the Hand of Omega, which makes Skaro&#x27;s Sun go supernova, before homing in on their mothership. Davros flees into an escape pod as the ship explodes.

===The Time War and the Reality Bomb ===
During the revived series, Davros was referred to in the episode &quot;Dalek&quot; (2005) by the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), who explains to Henry Van Statten that the Daleks were created by &quot;a genius... a man who was king of his own little world&quot;, and again by the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) in the episode &quot;Evolution of the Daleks&quot; (2007), where he refers to the Daleks&#x27; creator as believing that &quot;removing emotions makes you stronger&quot;. Davros makes his first physical appearance in the episode &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; (2008), portrayed by Julian Bleach. The episode reveals that Davros was thought to have died during the first year of the Time War, when his command ship &quot;flew into the jaws of the Nightmare Child&quot; at the Gates of Elysium, despite the Doctor&#x27;s failed efforts to save him. But Davros was pulled out of the time lock of the war by Dalek Caan (voiced by Nicholas Briggs), using his own flesh to create a &quot;new empire&quot; of Daleks who place him in the Vault as their prisoner to make use of his knowledge. Under Davros&#x27; guidance, the Daleks steal 27 planets, including Earth, and hide them in the Medusa Cascade, one second out of sync with the rest of the universe.

In the follow-up episode &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (2008), it is revealed that the stolen planets are required as a power source for Davros&#x27; ideal final solution: the Reality Bomb, which produces a wavelength that would cancel out the electrical field binding atoms to reduce all life outside the Crucible into nothingness in both his universe and countless other realities. But Davros learns too late that Dalek Caan, who came to the realisation of his race&#x27;s atrocities as a consequence of saving his creator, used his prophecies and influence to ensure the Daleks&#x27; destruction while manipulating events to bring the Tenth Doctor and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) together for the role the latter would play. Though the Doctor attempts to save him, having earlier taunted the Doctor for turning his companions into killers and being the cause of the deaths of countless people during his travels, Davros furiously refuses the Doctor&#x27;s help and accuses him of being responsible for the destruction while screaming: &quot;Never forget, Doctor, you did this! I name you forever: &quot;You&quot; are the Destroyer of Worlds!&quot; Thus the Doctor is forced to leave Davros to his supposed fate as the Crucible self-destructs.

=== Remembering the Twelfth Doctor ===
Davros returns in the two-part Series 9 opening &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; (2015), having escaped the Crucible&#x27;s destruction and ending up on a restored Skaro with his life being prolonged by the Daleks. But when the aged Davros&#x27; health begins to fail, he remembers his childhood self, played by Joey Price, meeting the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) during the Kaleds&#x27; thousand-year war prior to &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;. The young Davros finds himself lost on the battlefield and surrounded by handmines, with the Doctor throwing his sonic screwdriver to the boy with the intent to save him before learning his name and leaving the child to his fate. Davros, seeking a final revenge on the Doctor, employs the snake-like Colony Sarff (Jami Reid-Quarrell) to bring him to Skaro. When it appears that the Doctor has lost his companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) to the Daleks, Davros manages to trick the Doctor into using his regeneration energy to heal him, extending his own life while infusing every Dalek on Skaro with the energy. But the Doctor reveals Davros&#x27; scheme has also revitalised the decomposing-yet-still-alive Daleks left to rot in Skaro&#x27;s sewers, causing them to revolt and destroy the city. The Doctor then discovers the Daleks have a concept of mercy and are allowed to have the word in their vocabulary when he encounters Clara, having been placed in a Dalek casing by Missy (Michelle Gomez). The Doctor and Clara escape, the former having an epiphany as to how Davros somehow put a sliver of compassion into the Daleks. He then returns to the battlefield in Davros&#x27; childhood, using a Dalek gun to destroy the handmines with the one bit of compassion in Davros&#x27; life instilled in the Daleks&#x27; design to ensure Clara being saved.

===The Fourteenth Doctor===
In the &quot;Children in Need&quot; sketch &quot;&quot; (2023) (which takes place during an earlier time in the Kaled-Thal war), Davros (Julian Bleach) (who has not yet become disfigured or received the cybernetic eye) is seen presenting a Dalek prototype featuring a robotic claw to his assistant, Castavillian. When he briefly departs to attend to an urgent matter, the Fourteenth Doctor lands in the TARDIS, accidentally destroying the robotic claw. He inadvertently suggests the name &quot;Dalek&quot; for the prototype, mentions its catchphrase of &quot;exterminate&quot; and gives Castavillian a plunger-tipped arm as a replacement for the broken claw. Once he realises that he has accidentally assisted with the creation of his greatest enemy, he quickly departs saying that he was &quot;never here&quot;. Davros returns and approves of the new plunger arm.

==Other appearances==

===Comic strips===
&quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; printed several comics stories involving Davros. The first, &quot;Nemesis of the Daleks&quot; (#152–155), with the Seventh Doctor, features an appearance of a Dalek Emperor. Speaking with the Emperor, the Doctor addresses him as Davros, but the Emperor responds &quot;Who is Davros?&quot; The Doctor initially assumes Davros&#x27; personality has been totally subsumed, but in the later strip &quot;Emperor of the Daleks&quot; (#197–202) this Emperor is shown as a different entity from Davros. Set prior to &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; in Davros&#x27; timeline, but after in the timeline of the Doctor, the latter, accompanied by Bernice Summerfield, together with help from the Sixth Doctor, ensures that Davros will survive the wrath of the Daleks so that he can assume the title of Emperor, allowing history to take its course. &quot;Up Above the Gods&quot; (#227), a vignette following up on this, features the Sixth Doctor and Davros having a conversation in the TARDIS.

===Audio plays===
Terry Molloy has reprised his role as Davros in the spin-off audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions, mostly notably &quot;Davros&quot; (taking place during the Sixth Doctor&#x27;s era), which, through flashbacks, explored the scientist&#x27;s life prior to his crippling injury, which is attributed to a Thal nuclear attack (an idea that first appeared in Terrance Dicks&#x27; novelisation of &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;).

&quot;Davros&quot;, which does not feature the Daleks, apparently fills in the gaps between &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;, and has the scientist trying to manipulate the galaxy&#x27;s economy into a war footing similar to Skaro&#x27;s. The Sixth Doctor manages to defeat his plans, and Davros is last heard when his ship explodes, an event obliquely mentioned in &quot;Revelation&quot;. However the Doctor thinks he has survived. Davros also mentions he will work on a plan to combat famine, tying into &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;.

&quot;The Davros Mission&quot; is an original audio adventure (without the Doctor) available on &quot;The Complete Davros Collection&quot; DVD box set. It takes place directly after the television story &quot;Revelation&quot;, while leaving the planet Necros and beginning Davros&#x27; trial. At the end of &quot;Davros Mission&quot;, he turns the tables on the Daleks, forcing them to do his bidding. The Big Finish miniseries &quot;I, Davros&quot;, also features trial scenes, but mostly explores his early life. In those four stories, his journey is seen from his boyhood, to just before &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;.

&quot;The Curse of Davros&quot; begins with Davros and the Daleks working together to try and alter the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo using technology that Davros has created that allows him to swap peoples&#x27; minds, allowing him to switch various soldiers in Napoleon&#x27;s army with his own Daleks, ultimately intending to replace Napoleon with a Dalek after Waterloo is won so that he can change history and lead humanity in a direction where they may ally with the Daleks. The plan is complicated when the Sixth Doctor arrives and uses the device to swap bodies with Davros in an attempt to subvert the Daleks&#x27; plans from the inside, but Davros-in-the-Doctor is eventually able to convince the Daleks of his true identity, planning to remain in the Doctor&#x27;s healthy body while leaving the Doctor trapped in his original form. At the end, Davros and the Doctor are returned to their original bodies with the aid of the Doctor&#x27;s new companion Flip Jackson, the Doctor exposes Davros&#x27;s true agenda to Napoleon, and Davros is left with an army of Daleks who have had their minds wiped. These Daleks presumably become the &quot;Imperial Daleks&quot;, first seen in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;.

In &quot;The Juggernauts&quot;, Davros is on the run from the original Daleks. He hatches a plan to add human tissue to robotic Mechanoids, using them, along with his own Daleks, to destroy the originals, but the Doctor learns the truth about this plan, and his companion Mel Bush—who unwittingly assisted in the programming of the new Mechanoids—uses a backdoor she installed in their programming to turn them against Davros. At the end of the story, the self-destruct mechanism of Davros&#x27; life-support chair explodes after he is attacked by the Mechanoids, destroying an entire human colony. It is not clear how Davros survives to become the Dalek Emperor as seen in &quot;Remembrance&quot;. However, in the DVD documentary &quot;Davros Connections&quot;, director Gary Russell points out that the explosion of Davros&#x27; life-support chair leaves the listener to believe there is little of Davros left. This fits chronologically the fact that &quot;Remembrance&quot; depicts Davros as just a head inside the Emperor Dalek.

In &quot;Daleks Among Us&quot;, set after &quot;Remembrance&quot;, Davros returns to Azimuth, a planet that was invaded by the Daleks long ago, presenting himself as a victim of Dalek enslavement to infiltrate an underground movement against the repressive government- so desperate to prevent riots about individual actions during the Dalek occupation that official policy is now that the Dalek invasion never happened- seeking the remnants of an old experiment he carried out on the planet. This experiment is revealed to be Falkus, a clone of Davros&#x27;s original body that was intended to be a new host for his mind, with Falkus having evolved an independent personality since the Daleks left Azimuth. Falkus attempts to acquire the Persuasion Machine, a dangerous device that the Seventh Doctor has been tracking with his companions Elizabeth Elizabeth Klein and Will Arrowsmith, but the Doctor is able to trick Falkus into using the reprogrammed Persuasion Machine to destroy himself and his Daleks, while Davros flees in an escape pod. Davros is last shown trapped on the planet Lamuria, faced with the spectral former residents of the planet who sought to punish all criminals in the universe.

By the time of the Eighth Doctor audio play &quot;Terror Firma&quot; (set after &quot;Remembrance&quot;), Davros is commanding a Dalek army which has successfully conquered the Earth. His mental instability has grown to the point where &quot;Davros&quot; and &quot;the Emperor&quot; exist within him as different personalities. His Daleks recognise this instability and rebel against Davros. By the story&#x27;s end the Emperor personality is dominant, and the Daleks agree to follow him and leave Earth.

In the fourth volume of the &quot;Time War&quot; series, looking at the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s role in the Time War, after The Valeyard uses a Dalek weapon to erase the Daleks from history, the Dalek Time Strategist escapes the erasure by travelling into a parallel universe where the Kaleds and Thals have been at peace for centuries, with Davros still fully human and married to a Thal woman. The Dalek Time Strategist manipulates this alternate Davros into using his dimensional portal technology to merge various alternate Skaros together to recreate the Daleks in the prime universe, convincing Davros that the Doctor is an enemy of the &quot;Kaleds&quot; rather than the Thals. Reference is made to the &#x27;prime&#x27; Davros having been killed in the first year of the War (as mentioned in &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;). The process of merging with his alternate selves causes the alternate Davros to gain the injuries and memories of his counterparts, to the extent that he forgets his wife and the peace with the Thals. Eventually his presence restores the Daleks in the prime universe, but the Dalek Emperor has Davros put into stasis to prevent his influence causing another civil war by causing the Daleks to become divided between loyalty to the Emperor and Davros.

===Novels===
&quot;Terror Firma&quot; may contradict the events of the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;War of the Daleks&quot; by John Peel, in which an unmerged Davros is placed on trial by the Dalek Prime, a combination of the Dalek Emperor and the Dalek Supreme. In the novel the Dalek Prime claimed that the planet Antalin had been terraformed to resemble Skaro and was destroyed in its place. A subterfuge to destroy Daleks aligned to Davros; both on Skaro (Antalin) and those that remained hidden within Dalek ranks on Skaro (original). Despite finding evidence of threat to Skaro via evidence found on 22nd century earth of Davros&#x27; mission to 1960s Earth and seeing the event via time-tracking equipment, the Dalek Prime allowed the destruction of Skaro to destroy Daleks allied to Davros. Dalek Prime also claimed that the Dalek/Movellan war (and indeed most of Dalek history before the destruction of &quot;Skaro&quot;) was actually faked for Davros&#x27; benefit; in fact another ruse designed to bait Davros into giving evidence against himself (as he does in his trial.) Skaro is later seen to be intact and undamaged, and one character notes that it is quite possible the Dalek Prime is lying in order to weaken Davros&#x27; claim to leadership of the Daleks, while using foreknowledge of events to destroy and entrap Davros and his allies.

At the conclusion of &quot;War&quot;, Davros was seemingly disintegrated by a Spider Dalek on the order of the Dalek Prime. However, Davros had previously recruited one of the Spider Daleks as a sleeper agent for just such an eventuality, and even he was not certain in the end if he was being disintegrated or being teleported away to safety, leaving the possibility open for his return.

===Short fiction===
Paul Cornell&#x27;s dark vignette in the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; Brief Encounters series, &quot;An Incident Concerning the Bombardment of the Phobos Colony&quot; occurs sometime between &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; and his assumption of the role of Emperor.

===Theatre===
In 1993, Michael Wisher, the original Davros, with Peter Miles, who had played his confederate, Nyder, reprised the role in an unlicensed one-off amateur stage production, &quot;The Trial of Davros&quot;. The plot of the play involved the Time Lords putting Davros on trial, with Nyder as a witness.

Terry Molloy played Davros in the remounting of the play, again with Miles, for another one-off production in 2005. During the production, specially shot footage portrayed Dalek atrocities.

In 2008, Julian Bleach appeared live as Davros at the Doctor Who Prom, announcing that the Royal Albert Hall would become his new palace, and the audience his &quot;obedient slaves&quot;.

===Unofficial BBC representation===
BBC staff have traditionally created parodies of its own programming to be shown to colleagues at Christmas events and parties. The BBC&#x27;s 1993 Christmas tape parodied the allegedly robotic, dictatorial and ruthless management style of its then Director-General, John Birt, by portraying him as Davros taking over the BBC, carrying out bizarre mergers of departments, awarding himself a bonus and singing a song to the tune of &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)&quot; describing his plans.

<text>The Daleks ( ) are a fictional extraterrestrial race of extremely xenophobic mutants principally portrayed in the British science fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. They were conceived by writer Terry Nation and first appeared in the 1963 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Daleks&quot;, in casings designed by Raymond Cusick.

Drawing inspiration from the Nazis, Nation portrayed the Daleks as violent, merciless and pitiless cyborg aliens, completely absent of any emotion other than hate, who demand total conformity to the will of the Dalek with the highest authority, and are bent on the conquest of the universe and the extermination of any other forms of life, including other &quot;impure&quot; Daleks which are deemed inferior for being different to them. Collectively, they are the greatest enemies of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s protagonist, the Time Lord known as &quot;the Doctor&quot;. During the second year of the original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; programme (1963–1989), the Daleks developed their own form of time travel. At the beginning of the second &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV series that debuted in 2005, it was established that the Daleks had engaged in a Time War against the Time Lords that affected much of the universe and altered parts of history.

In the programme&#x27;s narrative, the planet Skaro suffered a thousand-year war between two societies: the Kaleds and the Thals. During this time-period, many natives of Skaro became badly mutated by fallout from nuclear weapons and chemical warfare. The Kaled government believed in genetic purity and swore to &quot;exterminate the Thals&quot; for being inferior. Believing his own society was becoming weak and that it was his duty to create a new master race from the ashes of his people, the Kaled scientist Davros genetically modified several Kaleds into squid-like life-forms he called Daleks, removing &quot;weaknesses&quot; such as mercy and sympathy while increasing aggression and survival-instinct. He then integrated them with tank-like robotic shells equipped with advanced technology based on the same life-support system he himself had used since being burned and blinded by a nuclear attack. His creations became intent on dominating the universe by enslaving or purging all &quot;inferior&quot; non-Dalek life.

The Daleks are the series&#x27; most popular and famous villains and their returns to television over the decades have often gained media attention. Their battle cry, a staccato &quot;Exterminate!&quot; has entered common usage as a popular catchphrase.

==Creation and development==
The Daleks were created by Terry Nation and designed by the BBC designer Raymond Cusick. They were introduced in December 1963 in the second &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial, &quot;The Daleks&quot;.

Wishing to create an alien creature that did not look like a &quot;man in a suit&quot;, Terry Nation stated in his script for the first Dalek serial that they should have no legs. He was also inspired by a performance by the Georgian National Ballet, in which dancers in long skirts appeared to glide across the stage. For many of the shows the Daleks were operated by retired ballet dancers wearing black socks while sitting inside the Dalek. Raymond Cusick was given the task of designing the Daleks when Ridley Scott, then a designer for the BBC, proved unavailable after having been initially assigned to their debut serial. According to Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who—The Early Years&quot; (1986), after Nation wrote the script, Cusick was given only an hour to come up with the design for the Daleks and was inspired in his initial sketches by a pepper pot on a table. Cusick himself, however, states that he based it on a man seated in a chair, and used the pepper pot only to demonstrate how it might move.

In 1964, Nation told a &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reporter that the Dalek name came from a dictionary or encyclopaedia volume, the spine of which read &quot;Dal – Lek&quot; (or, according to another version, &quot;Dal – Eks&quot;). He later admitted that this book and the associated origin of the Dalek name were completely fictitious, and that anyone bothering to check out his story would have found him out. The name had simply rolled off his typewriter. Later, Nation was pleasantly surprised to discover that in Serbo-Croatian the word &quot;dalek&quot; means &quot;far&quot; or &quot;distant&quot;.

Nation grew up during the Second World War and remembered the fear caused by German bombings. He consciously based the Daleks on the Nazis, conceiving the species as faceless, authoritarian figures dedicated to conquest, racial purity and complete conformity. The allusion is most obvious in the Dalek stories written by Nation, in particular &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; (1964) and &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (1975).

Before he wrote the first Dalek serial, Nation was a scriptwriter for the comedian Tony Hancock. The two men had a falling out and Nation either resigned or was fired. Hancock worked on several series proposals, one of which was called &quot;From Plip to Plop&quot;, a comedic history of the world that would have ended with a nuclear apocalypse, the survivors being reduced to living in dustbin-like robot casings and eating radiation to stay alive. According to Hancock&#x27;s biographer Cliff Goodwin, when Hancock saw the Daleks he allegedly shouted at the screen, &quot;That bloody Nation — he&#x27;s stolen my robots!&quot;

The titling of early &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories is complex and sometimes controversial. The first Dalek serial is called, variously, &quot;The Survivors&quot; (the pre-production title and on-screen title used for the serial&#x27;s second episode), &quot;The Mutants&quot; (its official title at the time of production and broadcast, later taken by another unrelated story), &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; (used on some production documentation), &quot;The Dead Planet&quot; (the on-screen title of the serial&#x27;s first episode), or simply &quot;The Daleks&quot;.

The instant appeal of the Daleks caught the BBC off-guard, and transformed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; into a national phenomenon. Children were both frightened and fascinated by the alien look of the monsters, and the idea of &quot;hiding behind the sofa&quot; became a popular, if inaccurate or exaggerated, meme. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; production office was inundated with letters and calls asking about the creatures. Newspaper articles focused attention on the series and the Daleks, further enhancing their popularity.

Nation jointly owned the intellectual property rights to the Daleks with the BBC, and the money-making concept proved nearly impossible to sell to anyone else, so he was dependent on the BBC wanting to produce stories featuring the creatures. Several attempts to market the Daleks outside the series were unsuccessful. Since Nation&#x27;s death in 1997, his share of the rights is now administered by his former agent, Tim Hancock.

Early plans for what eventually became the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie included radically redesigned Daleks whose cases unfolded like spiders&#x27; legs. The concept for these &quot;Spider Daleks&quot; was abandoned, but it was picked up again in several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-offs.

When the new series was announced, many fans hoped that the Daleks would return once more to the programme. The Nation estate, however, demanded levels of creative control over the Daleks&#x27; appearances and scripts that were unacceptable to the BBC. Eventually the Daleks were cleared to appear in the first series. In 2014, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; showrunner Steven Moffat denied that their numerous appearances since were a result of a contractual obligation.

==Physical characteristics==
Externally, Daleks resemble human-sized pepper pots with a single mechanical eyestalk mounted on a rotating dome, a gun-mount containing an energy-weapon (&quot;gunstick&quot; or &quot;death ray&quot;) resembling an egg-whisk, and a telescopic manipulator arm usually tipped by an appendage resembling a sink-plunger. Daleks have been known to use their plungers to interface with technology, crush a man&#x27;s skull by suction, measure the intelligence of a subject, and extract information from a man&#x27;s mind. Dalek casings are made of a bonded polycarbide material called &quot;Dalekanium&quot; by a member of the human resistance in &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; and the Dalek comics, as well as by the Cult of Skaro in &quot;Daleks in Manhattan&quot;.

The lower half of a Dalek&#x27;s shell is covered with hemispherical protrusions, or &#x27;Dalek-bumps&#x27;, which are shown in the episode &quot;Dalek&quot; to be spheres embedded in the casing. Both the BBC-licensed &quot;Dalek Book&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Doctor Who Technical Manual&quot; (1983) describe these items as being part of a sensory array, while in the 2005 series episode &quot;Dalek&quot; they are integral to a Dalek&#x27;s forcefield mechanism, which evaporates most bullets and resists most types of energy weapons. The forcefield seems to be concentrated around the Dalek&#x27;s midsection (where the mutant is located), as normally ineffective firepower can be concentrated on the eyestalk to blind a Dalek. In 2019 episode &quot;Resolution&quot; the bumps give way to reveal missile launchers capable of wiping out a military tank with ease. Daleks have a very limited visual field, with no peripheral sight at all, and are relatively easy to hide from in fairly exposed places. Their own energy weapons are capable of destroying them. Their weapons fire a beam that has electrical tendencies, is capable of propagating through water, and may be a form of plasma or electrolaser. The eyepiece is a Dalek&#x27;s most vulnerable spot; impairing its vision often leads to a blind, panicked firing of its weapon while exclaiming &quot;My vision is impaired; I cannot see!&quot; Russell T Davies subverted the catchphrase in his 2008 episode &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;, in which a Dalek vaporises a paintball that has blocked its vision while proclaiming, &quot;My vision is &quot;not&quot; impaired!&quot;

The creature inside the mechanical casing is soft and repulsive in appearance, and vicious in temperament. The first-ever glimpse of a Dalek mutant, in &quot;The Daleks&quot;, was a claw peeking out from under a Thal cloak after it had been removed from its casing. The mutants&#x27; actual appearance has varied, but often adheres to the Doctor&#x27;s description of the species in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; as &quot;little green blobs in bonded polycarbide armour&quot;. In &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; a Dalek creature, separated from its casing, attacks and severely injures a human soldier; in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; there are two Dalek factions (Imperial and Renegade), and the creatures inside have a different appearance in each case, one resembling the amorphous creature from &quot;Resurrection&quot;, the other the crab-like creature from the original Dalek serial. As the creature inside is rarely seen on screen there is a common misconception that Daleks are wholly mechanical robots. In the new series Daleks are retconned to be squid-like in appearance, with small tentacles, one or two eyes, and an exposed brain. In the new series, a Dalek creature separated from its casing is shown capable of inserting a tentacle into the back of a human&#x27;s neck and controlling them.

Daleks&#x27; voices are electronic; when out of its casing the mutant is only able to squeak. Once the mutant is removed the casing itself can be entered and operated by humanoids; for example, in &quot;The Daleks&quot;, Ian Chesterton (William Russell) enters a Dalek shell to masquerade as a guard as part of an escape plan.

For many years it was assumed that, due to their design and gliding motion, Daleks were unable to climb stairs, and that this provided a simple way of escaping them. A cartoon from &quot;Punch&quot; pictured a group of Daleks at the foot of a flight of stairs with the caption, &quot;Well, this certainly buggers our plan to conquer the Universe&quot;. In a scene from the serial &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;, the Doctor and companions escape from Dalek pursuers by climbing into a ceiling duct. The Fourth Doctor calls down, &quot;If you&#x27;re supposed to be the superior race of the universe, why don&#x27;t you try climbing after us?&quot; The Daleks generally make up for their lack of mobility with overwhelming firepower; a joke among &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans is that &quot;Real Daleks don&#x27;t climb stairs; they level the building.&quot; Dalek mobility has improved over the history of the series: in their first appearance, in &quot;The Daleks&quot;, they were capable of movement only on the conductive metal floors of their city; in &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; a Dalek emerges from the waters of the River Thames, indicating not only that they had become freely mobile, but that they are amphibious; &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; showed that they could ascend a vertical shaft by means of an external anti-gravity mat placed on the floor; &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; showed Davros in his life-support chair and one of his Daleks hovering and &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; depicted them as capable of hovering up a flight of stairs. Despite this, journalists covering the series frequently refer to the Daleks&#x27; supposed inability to climb stairs; characters escaping up a flight of stairs in the 2005 episode &quot;Dalek&quot; made the same joke and were shocked when the Dalek began to hover up the stairs after uttering the phrase &quot;ELEVATE&quot;, in a similar manner to their normal phrase &quot;EXTERMINATE&quot;. The new series depicts the Daleks as fully capable of flight, even space flight.

===Prop details===
====Overview====

The non-humanoid shape of the Dalek did much to enhance the creatures&#x27; sense of menace. A lack of familiar reference points differentiated them from the traditional &quot;bug-eyed monster&quot; of science fiction, which &quot;Doctor Who&quot; creator Sydney Newman had wanted the show to avoid. The unsettling Dalek form, coupled with their alien voices, made many believe that the props were wholly mechanical and operated by remote control.

The Daleks were actually controlled from inside by short operators, who had to manipulate their eyestalks, domes, and arms; as well as flashing the lights on their heads in-sync with the actors supplying their voices. The Dalek cases were built in two pieces; an operator would step into the lower section, and then the top would be secured. The operators looked out between the cylindrical louvres just beneath the dome, which were lined with mesh to conceal their faces.

In addition to being hot and cramped, the Dalek casings also muffled external sounds, making it difficult for operators to hear the director or dialogue. John Scott Martin, a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: &quot;You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the sink plunger. If you were related to an octopus then it helped.&quot;

For &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s 21st-century revival the Dalek casings retain the same overall shape and dimensional proportions of previous Daleks, although many details have been redesigned to give the Dalek a heavier and more solid look. Changes include a larger, more pointed base; a glowing eyepiece; an all-over metallic-brass finish (specified by Davies); thicker, nailed strips on the &quot;neck&quot; section; a housing for the eyestalk pivot; and significantly larger dome-lights. The new prop made its on-screen debut in the 2005 episode &quot;Dalek&quot;. These Dalek casings use a short operator inside the housing while the &#x27;head&#x27; and eyestalk are operated via remote control. A third person, Nicholas Briggs, supplies the voice in their various appearances. A new, larger model appeared during the 2010 series in several colours; each representing different parts of the Dalek command hierarchy.

====Movement====
Terry Nation&#x27;s original plan was for the Daleks to glide across the floor. Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon castors, propelled by the operator&#x27;s feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks&#x27; debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC&#x27;s Lime Grove Studios, for &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature tricycles with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base. The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop&#x27;s casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on static electricity drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.

Later versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators&#x27; feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop&#x27;s parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky Dalek movements. This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the &quot;new series&quot; version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.

====Voices====
The staccato delivery, harsh tone and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by two voice actors, Peter Hawkins and David Graham, who varied the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by Brian Hodgson at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The sound-processing devices used have varied over the decades. In 1963 Hodgson and his colleagues used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor&#x27;s voice, then subjected it to ring modulation with a 30 Hz sine wave. The distinctive harsh, grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;, for which the director, Graeme Harper, deliberately used less distortion).

Besides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included Roy Skelton, who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot;, and for the one-off anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. Michael Wisher, the actor who originated the role of Dalek creator Davros in &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, provided Dalek voices for that same story, as well as for &quot;Frontier in Space&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot;, and &quot;Death to the Daleks&quot;. Other Dalek voice actors include Royce Mills (three stories), Brian Miller (two stories), and Oliver Gilbert and Peter Messaline (one story). John Leeson, who performed the voice of K9 in several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories, and Davros actors Terry Molloy and David Gooderson also contributed supporting voices for various Dalek serials.

Since 2005 the Dalek voice in the television series has been provided by Nicholas Briggs, speaking into a microphone connected to a voice modulator. Briggs had previously provided Dalek and other alien voices for Big Finish Productions audio plays, and continues to do so. In a 2006 BBC Radio interview, Briggs said that when the BBC asked him to do the voice for the new television series, they instructed him to bring his own analogue ring modulator that he had used in the audio plays. The BBC&#x27;s sound department had changed to a digital platform and could not adequately create the distinctive Dalek sound with their modern equipment. Briggs went as far as to bring the voice modulator to the actors&#x27; readings of the scripts.

====Construction====

Manufacturing the props was expensive. In scenes where many Daleks had to appear, some of them would be represented by wooden replicas (&quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;) or life-size photographic enlargements in the early black-and-white episodes (&quot;The Daleks&quot;, &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;, and &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot;). In stories involving armies of Daleks, the BBC effects team even turned to using commercially available toy Daleks, manufactured by Louis Marx &amp; Co and Herts Plastic Moulders Ltd. Examples of this can be observed in the serials &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot;, &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;, and &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot;. Judicious editing techniques also gave the impression that there were more Daleks than were actually available, such as using a split screen in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;.

Four fully functioning props were commissioned for the first serial &quot;The Daleks&quot; in 1963, and were constructed from BBC plans by Shawcraft Engineering. These became known in fan circles as &quot;Mk I Daleks&quot;. Shawcraft were also commissioned to construct approximately 20 Daleks for the two Dalek movies in 1965 and 1966 (see below). Some of these movie props filtered back to the BBC and were seen in the televised serials, notably &quot;The Chase&quot;, which was aired before the first movie&#x27;s debut. The remaining props not bought by the BBC were either donated to charity or given away as prizes in competitions.

The BBC&#x27;s own Dalek props were reused many times, with components of the original Shawcraft &quot;Mk I Daleks&quot; surviving right through to their final classic series appearance in 1988. But years of storage and repainting took their toll. By the time of the Sixth Doctor&#x27;s &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; new props were being manufactured out of fibreglass. These models were lighter and more affordable to construct than their predecessors. These newer models were slightly bulkier in appearance around the mid-shoulder section, and also had a redesigned skirt section which was more vertical at the back. Other minor changes were made to the design due to these new construction methods, including altering the fender and incorporating the arm boxes, collars, and slats into a single fibreglass moulding. These props were repainted in grey for the Seventh Doctor serial &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; and designated as &quot;Renegade Daleks&quot;; another redesign, painted in cream and gold, became the &quot;Imperial Dalek&quot; faction.

New Dalek props were built for the 21st-century version of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The first, which appeared alone in the 2005 episode &quot;Dalek&quot;, was built by modelmaker Mike Tucker. Additional Dalek props based on Tucker&#x27;s master were subsequently built out of fibreglass by Cardiff-based Specialist Models.

==Entry into popular culture==
The Daleks became an immediate hit with viewers, returning for subsequent appearances throughout the 1960s. As early as one year after first appearing on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the Daleks had become popular enough to be recognized even by non-viewers. In December 1964 editorial cartoonist Leslie Gilbert Illingworth published a cartoon in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; captioned &quot;THE DEGAULLEK&quot;, caricaturing French President Charles de Gaulle arriving at a NATO meeting as a Dalek with de Gaulle&#x27;s prominent nose.

The Daleks have become as synonymous with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the Doctor himself, and their behaviour and catchphrases are now part of British popular culture. &quot;Hiding behind the sofa whenever the Daleks appear&quot; has been cited as an element of British cultural identity, and a 2008 survey indicated that nine out of ten British children were able to identify a Dalek correctly. In 1999 a Dalek photographed by Lord Snowdon appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture. In 2010, readers of science fiction magazine &quot;SFX&quot; voted the Dalek as the all-time greatest monster, beating competition including Japanese movie monster Godzilla and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Gollum, of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

The word &quot;Dalek&quot; has entered major dictionaries, including the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, which defines &quot;Dalek&quot; as &quot;In the BBC television science-fiction series Doctor Who: a member of a race of aggressive alien mutants in mobile armoured casings. Frequently in extended, allusive, or similative use.&quot; English-speakers sometimes use the term metaphorically to describe people, usually authority figures, who act like robots unable to break from their programming. For example, John Birt, the Director-General of the BBC from 1992 to 2000, was called a &quot;croak-voiced Dalek&quot; by playwright Dennis Potter in the MacTaggart Lecture at the 1993 Edinburgh Television Festival.

==Fictional history==
Dalek in-universe history has seen many retroactive changes, which have caused continuity problems. When the Daleks first appeared, they were presented as the descendants of the Dals, mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and Thal races 500 years ago. This race of Daleks is destroyed when their power supply is wrecked. However, when they reappear in &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;, they have conquered Earth in the 22nd century. Later stories saw them develop time travel and a space empire. In 1975, Terry Nation revised the Daleks&#x27; origins in &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, where the Dals were now called Kaleds (of which &quot;Daleks&quot; is an anagram), and the Dalek design was attributed to one man, the paralyzed Kaled chief scientist and evil genius, Davros. Later Big Finish Productions audio plays attempted to explain this retcon by saying that the Skaro word &quot;dal&quot; simply means warrior, which is how the Kaleds described themselves, while &quot;dal-ek&quot; means &quot;god.&quot; According to &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, instead of a short nuclear exchange, the Kaled-Thal war was a thousand-year-long war of attrition, fought with nuclear, biological and chemical weapons which caused widespread mutations among the life forms of Skaro. Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species, believing his own people had become weak and needed to be replaced by a greater life form. He placed his new Dalek creations in tank-like &quot;travel machines&quot; of advanced technology whose design was based on his own life-support chair.

&quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; marked a new era for the depiction of the species, with most of their previous history either forgotten or barely referred to again. Future stories in the original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series, which followed a rough story arc, would also focus more on Davros, much to the dissatisfaction of some fans who felt that the Daleks should take centre stage rather than merely becoming minions of their creator. Davros made his last televised appearance for 20 years in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;, which depicted a civil war between two factions of Daleks. One faction, the &quot;Imperial Daleks&quot;, were loyal to Davros, who had become their Emperor, whilst the other, the &quot;Renegade Daleks&quot;, followed a black Supreme Dalek. By the end of the story, armies of both factions have been wiped out and the Doctor has tricked them into destroying Skaro. However, Davros escapes and based on the fact that Daleks possess time travel and were spread throughout the universe, there was still a possibility that many had survived these events.

The original &quot;classic&quot; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series ended in 1989. In the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV-movie (which introduced the Eighth Doctor), Skaro has seemingly been recreated and the Daleks are shown to still rule it. Though the aliens are never seen on-screen, the story shows the Time Lord villain the Master being executed on Skaro as Dalek voices chant &quot;Exterminate.&quot; In Eighth Doctor audio plays produced by Big Finish from 2000 to 2005, Paul McGann reprised his role. The audio play &quot;The Time of the Daleks&quot; featured the Daleks without Davros and nearly removing William Shakespeare from history. In &quot;Terror Firma&quot;, the Eighth Doctor met a Dalek faction led by Davros who was devolving more into a Dalek-like life form himself while attempting to create new Daleks from mutated humans of Earth. The audio dramas &quot;The Apocalypse Element&quot; and &quot;Dalek Empire&quot; also depicted the alien villains invading Gallifrey and then creating their own version of the Time Lord power source known as the Eye of Harmony, allowing the Daleks to rebuild an empire and become a greater threat against the Time Lords and other races that possess time travel.
A new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series premiered in 2005, introducing the Ninth Doctor and revealing that the &quot;Last Great Time War&quot; had just ended, resulting in the seeming destruction of the Time Lord society. The episode &quot;Dalek&quot;, written by Robert Shearman, was broadcast on BBC One on 30 April 2005 and confirmed that the Time War had mainly involved the Daleks fighting the Time Lords, with the Doctor ending the conflict by seemingly destroying both sides, remarking that his own survival was &quot;not by choice.&quot; The episode featured a single Dalek who appeared to be the sole survivor of his race from the Time War. Later audio plays by Big Finish Productions expanded on the Time War in different audio drama series such as &quot;Gallifrey: Time War, The Eighth Doctor: Time War, The War Doctor,&quot; and &quot;The War Master.&quot;

A Dalek Emperor returned at the end of the 2005 series, having survived the Time War and then rebuilt the Dalek race with genetic material harvested from human subjects. It saw itself as a god, and the new human-based Daleks were shown worshipping it. The Emperor and this Dalek fleet were destroyed in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;. The 2006 season finale &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot;/&quot;Doomsday&quot; featured a squad of four pure-bred Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the Cult of Skaro, composed of Daleks who were tasked with developing imagination to better predict and combat enemies. These Daleks took on names: Jast, Thay, Caan, and their black Dalek leader Sec. The Cult had survived the Time War by escaping into the Void between dimensions. They emerged along with the Genesis Ark, a Time Lord prison vessel containing millions of pure Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the Torchwood Institute and Cybermen from a parallel world. This resulted in a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London, which was resolved when the Tenth Doctor caused both groups to be suckedunprotectedinto the Void. The Cult of Skaro survived by utilising an &quot;emergency temporal shift&quot; to escape.

The four-Dalek Cult of Skaro returned in the two-part story &quot;Daleks in Manhattan&quot;/&quot;Evolution of the Daleks&quot;, in which whilst stranded in 1930s New York, they set up a base in the partially built Empire State Building and attempt to rebuild the Dalek race. To this end, Dalek Sec merges with a human being to become a Human/Dalek hybrid. The Cult then set about creating &quot;Human Daleks&quot; by &quot;formatting&quot; the brains of a few thousand captured humans so they can have Dalek minds. Dalek Sec, however, becomes more human in personality and alters the plan so the hybrids will be more human like him. The rest of the Cult mutinies. Sec is killed, while Thay and Jast are later wiped out with the hybrids. Dalek Caan, believing it may be the last of its kind now, escapes once more via an emergency temporal shift.

The Daleks returned in the 2008 season&#x27;s two-part finale, &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;/&quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, accompanied once again by their creator Davros. The story reveals that Caan&#x27;s temporal shift sent him into the Time War, despite the War being &quot;Time-Locked&quot;. The experience of piercing the Time-Lock resulted in Caan seeing parts of several futures, destroying his sanity in the process. Caan rescued many pure-bred Time War era Daleks and Davros, who created new pure Dalek troops using his own body&#x27;s cells (his Kaled DNA, as all pure Daleks were originally Kaleds). A red Supreme Dalek leads the new army while keeping Caan and Davros imprisoned on the Dalek flagship, the &quot;Crucible&quot;. Davros and the Daleks plan to destroy reality itself with a &quot;reality bomb&quot;. The plan fails due to the interference of Donna Noble, a companion of the Doctor, and Caan, who has been manipulating events to destroy the Daleks after realising the severity of the atrocities they have committed.

The Daleks returned in the 2010 episode &quot;Victory of the Daleks&quot;, wherein it is revealed that some Daleks survived the destruction of their army in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; and retrieved the &quot;Progenitor&quot;, a tiny apparatus containing &#x27;original&#x27; Dalek DNA. The activation of the Progenitor results in the creation of New Paradigm Daleks who deem the Time War era Daleks to be inferior. The new Daleks are organised into different roles (drone, scientist, strategists, supreme and eternal), which are identifiable with colour-coded armour instead of the identification plates under the eyestalk used by their predecessors. They escape the Doctor at the end of the episode via time travel with the intent to rebuild their Empire.

The Daleks appeared, only briefly, in subsequent finales &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot;/&quot;The Big Bang&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot; (2011) as Steven Moffat decided to &quot;give them a rest&quot; and stated, &quot;There&#x27;s a problem with the Daleks. They are the most famous of the Doctor&#x27;s adversaries and the most frequent, which means they are the most reliably defeatable enemies in the universe.&quot; These episodes also reveal that Skaro has been recreated yet again. They next appear in &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot; (2012), where the Daleks are shown to have greatly increased numbers and now have a Parliament; in addition to the traditional &quot;modern&quot; Daleks, several designs from both the original and new series appear, all co-existing rather than judging each other as inferior or outdated (except for those Daleks whose personalities deem them &quot;insane&quot; or can no longer battle). All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode.

The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013), where they are seen being defeated in the Time War. The same special reveals that many Time Lords survived the war since the Doctor found a way to transfer planet Gallifrey out of phase with reality and into a pocket dimension. In &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; (2013), the Daleks are one of the races that besieges Trenzalore in an attempt to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords from the pocket dimension. After converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor.

The Twelfth Doctor&#x27;s first encounter with the Daleks is in his second full episode, &quot;Into the Dalek&quot; (2014), where he encounters a damaged Dalek he names &#x27;Rusty.&#x27; Connecting to the Doctor&#x27;s love of the universe and his hatred of the Daleks, Rusty assumes a mission to destroy other Daleks. In &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;/&quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; (2015), the Doctor is summoned to Skaro where he learns Davros has rebuilt the Dalek Empire. In &quot;The Pilot&quot; (2017), the Doctor briefly visits a battle during the Dalek-Movellan war.

The Thirteenth Doctor encountered a Dalek in a New Year&#x27;s Day episode, &quot;Resolution&quot; (2019), when a Dalek mutant, separated from its armoured casing, takes control of a human in order to build a new travel device for itself and summon more Daleks to conquer Earth. This Dalek is cloned by a scientist in &quot;Revolution of the Daleks&quot; (2021), and attempts to take over Earth using further clones, but they are killed by other Daleks for perceived genetic impurity. The Dalek army is later sent by the Doctor into the &quot;void&quot; between worlds to be destroyed, using a spare TARDIS she recently acquired on Gallifrey. After cameo appearances depicting them as one of several villains trying to take advantage of &quot;the Flux&quot; event tearing through space-time in series 13, the Daleks returned in the first 2022 special, &quot;Eve of the Daleks&quot;. In the episode, a team of Dalek Executioners are dispatched by High Command to avenge the Dalek War Fleet destroyed by the Doctor in the series 13 finale &quot;The Vanquishers&quot;, only for a time loop established by the TARDIS to save the Doctor&#x27;s life and give her a chance to destroy the executioners instead. The Daleks later appeared alongside the Cybermen as allies to the Master in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; as part of a plot to finally destroy their nemesis, but the alliance is defeated by the Doctor and new and old companions.

In a video short for the 2023 &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon, the origin of the iconic plunger-like appendages used by Daleks was retroactively established as being from the Fourteenth Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS, while also establishing an unintentional hint by that Doctor, given to a Kaled military officer, for the creation of the name &quot;Dalek&quot;.

==Dalek culture==
Daleks have little, if any, individual personality, ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger, and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors&#x27; orders without question. Dalek speech is characterised by repeated phrases, and by orders given to themselves and to others. Unlike the stereotypical emotionless robots often found in science fiction, Daleks are often angry; author Kim Newman has described the Daleks as behaving &quot;like toddlers in perpetual hissy fits&quot;, gloating when in power and flying into a rage when thwarted. They tend to be excitable and will repeat the same word or phrase over and over again in heightened emotional states, most famously &quot;Exterminate! Exterminate!&quot;

Daleks are extremely aggressive, and seem driven by an instinct to attack. This instinct is so strong that Daleks have been depicted fighting the urge to kill or even attacking when unarmed. The Fifth Doctor characterises this impulse by saying, &quot;However you respond [to Daleks] is seen as an act of provocation.&quot; The fundamental feature of Dalek culture and psychology is an unquestioned belief in the superiority of the Dalek race, and their default directive is to destroy all non-Dalek life-forms. Other species are either to be exterminated immediately or enslaved and then exterminated once they are no longer useful.

The Dalek obsession with their own superiority is illustrated by the schism between the Renegade and Imperial Daleks seen in &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;: the two factions each consider the other to be a perversion despite the relatively minor differences between them. This intolerance of any &quot;contamination&quot; within themselves is also shown in &quot;Dalek&quot;, &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; and in the Big Finish Productions audio play &quot;The Mutant Phase&quot;. This superiority complex is the basis of the Daleks&#x27; ruthlessness and lack of compassion. This is shown in extreme in &quot;Victory of the Daleks&quot;, where the new, pure Daleks destroy their creators, impure Daleks, with the latter&#x27;s consent. It is nearly impossible to negotiate or reason with a Dalek, a single-mindedness that makes them dangerous and not to be underestimated. The Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) is later puzzled in the &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot; as to why the Daleks don&#x27;t just kill the sequestered ones that have &quot;gone wrong&quot;. Although the Asylum is subsequently obliterated, the Prime Minister of the Daleks explains that &quot;it is offensive to us to destroy such divine hatred&quot;, and the Doctor is sickened at the revelation that hatred is actually considered beautiful by the Daleks.

Dalek society is depicted as one of extreme scientific and technological advancement; the Third Doctor states that &quot;it was their inventive genius that made them one of the greatest powers in the universe.&quot; However, their reliance on logic and machinery is also a strategic weakness which they recognise, and thus use more emotion-driven species as agents to compensate for these shortcomings.

Although the Daleks are not known for their regard for due process, they have taken at least two enemies back to Skaro for a &quot;trial&quot;, rather than killing them immediately. The first was their creator, Davros, in &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;, and the second was the renegade Time Lord known as the Master in the 1996 television movie. The reasons for the Master&#x27;s trial, and why the Doctor would be allowed to retrieve the Master&#x27;s remains, have never been explained on screen. The &quot;Doctor Who Annual 2006&quot; implies that the trial may have been due to a treaty signed between the Time Lords and the Daleks. The framing device for the &quot;I, Davros&quot; audio plays is a Dalek trial to determine if Davros should be the Daleks&#x27; leader once more.

Spin-off novels contain several tongue-in-cheek mentions of Dalek poetry, and an anecdote about an opera based upon it, which was lost to posterity when the entire cast was exterminated on the opening night. Two stanzas are given in the novel &quot;The Also People&quot; by Ben Aaronovitch. In an alternative timeline portrayed in the Big Finish Productions audio adventure &quot;The Time of the Daleks&quot;, the Daleks show a fondness for the works of Shakespeare. A similar idea was satirised by comedian Frankie Boyle in the BBC comedy quiz programme &quot;Mock the Week&quot;; he gave the fictional Dalek poem &quot;Daffodils; EXTERMINATE DAFFODILS!&quot; as an &quot;unlikely line to hear in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&quot;.

Because the Doctor has defeated the Daleks so often, he has become their collective arch-enemy and they have standing orders to capture or exterminate him on sight. In later fiction, the Daleks know the Doctor as &quot;Ka Faraq Gatri&quot; (&quot;Bringer of Darkness&quot; or &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot;), and &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot;. Both the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) suggest that the Doctor is one of the few beings the Daleks fear. In &quot;Doomsday&quot;, Rose notes that while the Daleks see the extermination of five million Cybermen as &quot;pest control&quot;, &quot;one Doctor&quot; visibly un-nerves them (to the point they physically recoil). To his indignant surprise, in &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) learns that the Daleks have designated him as &quot;The Predator&quot;.

==Licensing==
Copyright for the Daleks was maintained by Terry Nation rather than the BBC and has passed to his estate after his death. A number of licensed usages have been made over the years.

Two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; movies starring Peter Cushing featured the Daleks as the main villains: &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot;, and &quot;Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD&quot;, based on the television serials &quot;The Daleks&quot; and &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;, respectively. The movies were not direct remakes; for example, the Doctor in the Cushing films was a human inventor called &quot;Dr. Who&quot; who built a time-travelling device named &quot;Tardis&quot;, instead of a mysterious alien who stole a device called &quot;the TARDIS&quot;.

Four books focusing on the Daleks were published in the 1960s. &quot;The Dalek Book&quot; (1964, written by Terry Nation and David Whitaker), &quot;The Dalek World&quot; (1965, written by Nation and Whitaker) and &quot;The Dalek Outer Space Book&quot; (1966, by Nation and Brad Ashton) were all hardcover books formatted like annuals, containing text stories and comics about the Daleks, along with fictional information (sometimes based on the television serials, other times made up for the books). Nation also published &quot;The Dalek Pocketbook and Space-Travellers Guide&quot;, which collected articles and features treating the Daleks as if they were real. Four more annuals were published in the 1970s by World Distributors under the title &quot;Terry Nation&#x27;s Dalek Annual&quot; (with cover dates 1976–1979, but published 1975–1978). Two original novels by John Peel, &quot;War of the Daleks&quot; (1997) and &quot;Legacy of the Daleks&quot; (1998), were released as part of the Eighth Doctor Adventures series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels. A novella, &quot;The Dalek Factor&quot; by Simon Clark, was published in 2004, and two books featuring the Daleks and the Tenth Doctor (&quot;I am a Dalek&quot; by Gareth Roberts, 2006, and &quot;Prisoner of the Daleks&quot; by Trevor Baxendale, 2009) have been released as part of the New Series Adventures.

Nation authorised the publication of the comic strip &quot;The Daleks&quot; in the comic &quot;TV Century 21&quot; in 1965. The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and &quot;heroes&quot;, and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for Earth, which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips was directly contradicted by what was later shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the Dalek Emperor did show up later on in the programme.

At the same time, a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; strip was also being published in &quot;TV Comic&quot;. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the First Doctor battled the &quot;Trods&quot; instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the Second Doctor appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in &quot;The Trodos Ambush&quot; (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the Third Doctor-era &quot;Dr. Who&quot; comic strip that featured in the combined &quot;Countdown/TV Action&quot; comic during the early 1970s.

An animated series called &quot;Daleks!&quot;, which consists of five 10-minute long episodes, was released on the official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; YouTube channel in 2020.

Other licensed appearances have included a number of stage plays (see Stage plays below) and television adverts for Wall&#x27;s &quot;Sky Ray&quot; ice lollies (1966), Weetabix breakfast cereal (1977), Kit Kat chocolate bars (2001), and the ANZ Bank (2005). In 2003, Daleks also appeared in UK billboard ads for Energizer batteries, alongside the slogan &quot;Are You Power Mad?&quot;

==Merchandising==
The BBC approached Walter Tuckwell, a New Zealand-born entrepreneur who was handling product merchandising for other BBC shows, and asked him to do the same for the Daleks and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Tuckwell created a glossy sales brochure that sparked off a Dalek craze, dubbed &quot;Dalekmania&quot; by the press, which peaked in 1965.

===Toys and models===
The first Dalek toys were released in 1965 as part of the &quot;Dalekmania&quot; craze. These included battery-operated, friction drive and &quot;Rolykins&quot; Daleks from Louis Marx &amp; Co., as well as models from Cherilea, Herts Plastic Moulders Ltd and Cowan, de Groot Ltd, and &quot;Bendy&quot; Daleks made by Newfeld Ltd. At the height of the Daleks&#x27; popularity, in addition to toy replicas, there were Dalek board games and activity sets, slide projectors for children and even Dalek playsuits made from PVC. Collectible cards, stickers, toy guns, music singles, punching bags and many other items were also produced in this period. Dalek toys released in the 1970s included a new version of Louis Marx&#x27;s battery-operated Dalek (1974), a &quot;talking Dalek&quot; from Palitoy (1975) and a Dalek board game (1975) and Dalek action figure (1977), both from Denys Fisher. From 1988 to 2002, Dapol released a line of Dalek toys in conjunction with its &quot;Doctor Who&quot; action figure series.

Beginning in 2000, Product Enterprise (who later operated under the names &quot;Iconic Replicas&quot; and &quot;Sixteen 12 Collectibles&quot;) produced various Dalek toys. These included Dalek &quot;Rolykins&quot; (based on the Louis Marx toy from 1965); push-along &quot;talking&quot; Daleks; Dalek &quot;Rollamatics&quot; with a pull back and release mechanism; and a remote control Dalek.

In 2005 Character Options was granted the &quot;Master Toy License&quot; for the revived &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series, including the Daleks. Their product lines have included static/push-along and radio controlled Daleks, radio controlled versions and radio controlled / 1:3 scale variants. The 12-inch remote control Dalek won the 2005 award for Best Electronic Toy of the Year from the Toy Retailers Association. Some versions of the 18-inch model included semi-autonomous and voice command-features. In 2008, the company acquired a license to produce Daleks of the various &quot;classic series&quot; variants.

===Full-size reproductions===
Dalek fans have been building life-size reproduction Daleks for many years. The BBC and Terry Nation estate officially disapprove of self-built Daleks, but usually intervene only if attempts are made to trade unlicensed Daleks and Dalek components commercially, or if it is considered that actual or intended use may damage the BBC&#x27;s reputation or the Doctor Who/Dalek brand. The Crewe-based company &quot;This Planet Earth&quot; is the only business which has been licensed by the BBC and the Terry Nation Estate to produce full-size TV Dalek replicas, and by Canal+ Image UK Ltd. to produce full size Movie Dalek replicas commercially.

==Other appearances==
===Non–&quot;Doctor Who&quot; television and film===
Daleks have made cameo appearances in television programmes and films unrelated to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from the 1960s to the present day.
* Two to three purple toy Daleks are also seen in the background of an episode of the American children&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Rugrats&quot;.
* A toy Dalek appears in the opening sequence of the seventh episode of the British comedy series &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; (titled &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean&quot;), when Mr. Bean plays an &quot;alternative nativity play&quot; with several modern day toys like tanks and a plastic dinosaur.
* In the television special &quot;The Red Dwarf A–Z&quot;, two Daleks are shown (under &quot;E&quot; for &quot;Exterminate&quot;) arguing that all Earth television is human propaganda, and the works more commonly attributed to William Shakespeare and Ludwig van Beethoven were actually written by Daleks, although they deny having written &quot;Mandy&quot; by Barry Manilow; subsequently, one of them remarks that the &quot;change the bulb&quot; joke from the episode &quot;Legion&quot; was funny, and is promptly exterminated by the other for the crime of &quot;not behaving like a true Dalek&quot;.
* In the 2004 series of &quot;Coupling&quot;, written by Steven Moffat (who was later to write for and produce &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), a Dalek appears in the second episode of season 4. This was voiced by Nicholas Briggs, who later went on to provide Dalek voices for the series proper from 2005 onwards. (Terry Nation&#x27;s original Dalek rights deal with the BBC had been negotiated by his then agent Beryl Vertue, later Moffat&#x27;s mother-in-law.)
* In the film &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, the secret military base, Area 52, detains a number of monsters and robots from old sci-fi films; among those are two Daleks, who upon release by Marvin the Martian, proceed to attack while spouting their catchphrases.
* A Dalek appeared alongside Darth Vader, Ming the Merciless, a Klingon, the Sixth Doctor and a 1980s Cyberman in a 2003 episode of the British motoring programme &quot;Top Gear&quot;, to see who was &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; with a lap around their test track in a racing modified Honda Civic. The Dalek could not get into the car, so it exterminated the other drivers (with the exception of the Klingon and the Doctor; who had apparently fled beforehand as they were not present); the Cyberman was eventually declared the winner by the hosts.
* In a 2009 episode of the American sitcom &quot;Better Off Ted&quot;, a deactivated Dalek is spotted in the sub-basement where the supposed &quot;Robot Farm&quot; is located.
* In the 2017 film &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;, the Daleks, in what appears to be a Lego adaptation of their 2010 designs, make an appearance as escaped prisoners from the Phantom Zone.
* &quot;It&#x27;s A Sin&quot; (written by former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; show runner Russell T Davies), in scenes where series lead Ritchie Tozer (Olly Alexander) is cast in a fictional &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story called &quot;Regression of the Daleks&quot;.

===Comic books===
* In the graphic novel &quot;Abslom Daak: Dalek Killer&quot;, the titular protagonist, a sentenced criminal with a death wish and an insatiable hatred of the Daleks, hunts his nemeses who have recently invaded the planet Mazar, homeworld of princess Taiyin.

===Music===
Daleks have been referred to or associated in many musical compositions.

* The first known musical reference to Daleks is the 1964 novelty single &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Spend My Christmas with a Dalek&quot; by the Go-Go&#x27;s, released during the 1960s&#x27; &quot;Dalekmania&quot; fad.
* Dalek voices were sampled and recreated in the 1988 novelty single &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot; by The Timelords (who later performed as the KLF),

===Video games===
Licensed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; games featuring Daleks include 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Key to Time&quot;, a text adventure game for the ZX Spectrum. The first graphical game to feature daleks was the eponymous, turn-based title released by Johan Strandberg for the Macintosh in the same year. Daleks also appeared in minor roles or as thinly disguised versions in other, minor games throughout the 80s, but did not feature as central adversaries in a licensed game until 1992, when Admiral Software published &quot;Dalek Attack&quot;. The game allowed the player to play various Doctors or companions, running them through several environments to defeat the Daleks. In 1997 the BBC released a PC game entitled &quot;Destiny of the Doctors&quot; which also featured the Daleks, among other adversaries.

One authorised online game is &quot;The Last Dalek&quot;, a Flash game created by New Media Collective for the BBC. It is based on the 2005 episode &quot;Dalek&quot; and can be played at the official BBC &quot;Doctor Who&quot; website. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; website also features another game, &quot;Daleks vs Cybermen&quot; (also known as &quot;Cyber Troop Control Interface&quot;), based on the 2006 episode &quot;Doomsday&quot;; in this game, the player controls troops of Cybermen which must fight Daleks as well as Torchwood Institute members.

On 5 June 2010, the BBC released the first of four official computer games on its website, &quot;Doctor Who: The Adventure Games&quot;, which are intended as part of the official TV series adventures. In the first of these, &#x27;The City of the Daleks&#x27;, the Doctor in his 11th incarnation and Amy Pond must stop the Daleks re-writing time and reviving Skaro, their homeland.

They also appear in the Nintendo DS and Wii games &quot;Doctor Who: Evacuation Earth&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who: Return to Earth&quot;.

The Daleks also appear in &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; where they ally themselves with Lord Vortech and possess the size-altering scale keystone. When Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle encounter them, they assume that they are allies of the Doctor and attack the trio. The main characters continue to fight the Daleks until they call the Doctor to save them. A Dalek saucer also appears in the level based on Metropolis, in which the top of it serves as the stage for the boss battle against Sauron and includes Daleks among the various enemies summoned to attack the player. A Dalek is also among the elements summoned by the player to deal with the obstacles in the &quot;Portal 2&quot; story level of Lego Dimensions.

The Daleks also appear in &quot;Doctor Who: The Edge of Time&quot;, a Virtual Reality Game for the PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, and Vive Cosmos, which was released in September 2019.

The Daleks are a licensed costume in &quot;Fall Guys&quot;.

===Politics===
At the 1966 Conservative Party conference in Blackpool, delegate Hugh Dykes publicly compared the Labour government&#x27;s Defence Secretary Denis Healey to the creatures. &quot;Mr. Healey is the Dalek of defence, pointing a metal finger at the armed forces and saying &#x27;I will eliminate you&#x27;.&quot;

In a British Government Parliamentary Debate in the House of Commons on 12 February 1968, the then Minister of Technology Tony Benn mentioned the Daleks during a reply to a question from the Labour MP Hugh Jenkins concerning the Concorde aircraft project. In the context of the dangers of solar flares, he said, &quot;Because we are exploring the frontiers of technology, some people think Concorde will be avoiding solar flares like Dr. Who avoiding Daleks. It is not like this at all.&quot;

Australian Labor Party luminary Robert Ray described his right wing Labor Unity faction successor, Victorian Senator Stephen Conroy, and his Socialist Left faction counterpart, Kim Carr, as &quot;factional Daleks&quot; during a 2006 Australian Fabian Society lunch in Sydney.

During a 2021 House of Commons debate about the retention of dentists in rural areas of the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic, the voice of Conservative MP Scott Mann of North Cornwall, while on a video link, became distorted due to a malfunction with his audio feed. Deputy Speaker of the House Nigel Evans interrupted his broadcast, amidst the chuckles from other MPs; by saying, &quot;Scott, you sound like a Dalek and I don&#x27;t mean that unkindly. There&#x27;s clearly a communications problem.&quot; Mann later returned to apologise.

Daleks have been used in political cartoons to caricature: Douglas Hurd, as the &#x27;Douglek&#x27;, in Private Eye&#x27;s Dan Dire – Pilot of the Future; Tony Benn, John Birt, Tony Blair, Alec Douglas-Home, Charles de Gaulle, Mark Thompson.

===Magazine covers===
Daleks have appeared on magazine covers promoting &quot;Doctor Who&quot; since the &quot;Dalekmania&quot; fad of the 1960s. &quot;Radio Times&quot; has featured the Daleks on its cover several times, beginning with the 21–27 November 1964 issue which promoted &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;. Other magazines also used Daleks to attract readers&#x27; attention, including &quot;Girl Illustrated&quot;.

In April 2005, &quot;Radio Times&quot; created a special cover to commemorate both the return of the Daleks to the screen in &quot;Dalek&quot; and the forthcoming general election. This cover recreated a scene from &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; in which the Daleks were seen crossing Westminster Bridge, with the Houses of Parliament in the background. The cover text read &quot;VOTE DALEK!&quot; In a 2008 contest sponsored by the Periodical Publishers Association, this cover was voted the best British magazine cover of all time. In 2013 it was voted &quot;Cover of the century&quot; by the Professional Publishers Association. The 2010 United Kingdom general election campaign also prompted a collector&#x27;s set of three near-identical covers of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; on 17 April with exactly the same headline but with the newly redesigned Daleks in their primary colours representing the three main political parties, Red being Labour, Blue as Conservative and Yellow as Liberal Democrats.

===Parodies===

Daleks have been the subject of many parodies, including Spike Milligan&#x27;s &quot;Pakistani Dalek&quot; sketch in his comedy series &quot;Q&quot;, and Victor Lewis-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Gay Daleks&quot;. Occasionally the BBC has used the Daleks to parody other subjects: in 2002, BBC Worldwide published the &quot;Dalek Survival Guide&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbooks&quot;. Comedian Eddie Izzard has an extended stand-up routine about Daleks, which was included in her 1993 stand-up show &quot;Live at the Ambassadors&quot;. The Daleks made two brief appearances in a pantomime version of &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the Birmingham Hippodrome which starred &quot;Torchwood&quot; star John Barrowman in the lead role. A joke-telling robot, possessing a Dalek-like boom, and loosely modelled after the Dalek, also appeared in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Funnybot&quot;, even spouting out &quot;exterminate&quot;. A Dalek can also be seen in the background at timepoints 1:13 and 1:17 in the Sam &amp; Max animated series episode &quot;The Trouble with Gary&quot;. In the &quot;Community&quot; parody of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; called &quot;Inspector Spacetime&quot;, they are referred to as Blorgons.

<text>David Thomas Jones (30 December 1945 – 29 February 2012) was an English actor, singer, and songwriter. Best known as a member of the band the Monkees and a co-star of the TV series &quot;The Monkees&quot; (1966–1968), Jones was considered a teen idol.

Aside from his work on &quot;The Monkees&quot; TV show, Jones&#x27;s acting credits include a Tony-nominated performance as the Artful Dodger in the original London and Broadway productions of &quot;Oliver!&quot; and a guest-starring role in a notable episode of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; television show and a later reprised parody film.

==Early life==
David Thomas Jones was born on 30 December 1945 in Longsight, England, to Harry and Doris Jones. He had three sisters: Hazel, Lynda and Beryl. Jones&#x27; mother died from emphysema when he was 14 years of age.

==Career as actor and singer==

=== Early days (1961–1965) ===

Jones&#x27; television acting debut was in the British television soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, in which he appeared as Colin Lomax, grandson of the regular character Ena Sharples, for one episode on 6 March 1961. He also appeared in the BBC police series &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. Following the death of his mother, Jones rejected acting in favour of becoming a jockey, commencing an apprenticeship with Newmarket trainer Basil Foster. He dropped out of secondary school to begin working in that field, but this career was short-lived. Even though Foster believed Jones would be successful as a jockey, he encouraged his young protégé to take a role as the Artful Dodger in a production of &quot;Oliver!&quot; in London&#x27;s West End. When approached by a friend who worked in a West End theatre during the show&#x27;s casting, Foster replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve got the kid.&quot; Jones&#x27;s portrayal brought him great acclaim. He played the role in London and then on Broadway, and was nominated for a Tony Award.

On 9 February 1964, Jones appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; with Georgia Brown, who was playing Nancy in the Broadway production of &quot;Oliver!&quot;. It was the episode of the show in which the Beatles made their first appearance on U.S. television. Jones said of that night, &quot;I watched the Beatles from the side of the stage, I saw the girls going crazy, and I said to myself, this is it, I want a piece of that.&quot; Jones also appeared with Georgia Brown on the Merv Griffin Show around the same time.

Following his &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot; appearance, Jones signed a contract with Ward Sylvester of Screen Gems (at that time the television division of Columbia Pictures). A pair of U.S. television appearances followed, as Jones received screen time in episodes of &quot;Ben Casey&quot; and &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Jones debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in the week of 14 August 1965, with the single &quot;What Are We Going To Do?&quot;, which peaked at number 93. The 19-year-old singer was signed to Colpix Records, a label owned by Columbia. His debut album, &quot;David Jones&quot;, on the same label, followed soon afterward (CP493).

=== The Monkees (1966–1970) ===

From 1966 to 1970, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock band formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet the standards of producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees&#x27; recordings, including &quot;I Wanna Be Free&quot; and &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;. The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In Peter Tork&#x27;s commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance line-up been based solely on playing ability, it ought to have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Like Peter Tork, Jones, despite playing mostly tambourine or maracas, was a multi-instrumentalist and would fill in for Tork on bass when he played keyboards and vice versa and for Dolenz on drums when the Monkees performed live concerts.
The Monkees officially disbanded in 1970. The NBC television series &quot;The Monkees&quot; was popular and remained in syndication.

===Post-Monkees career (1970–2012)===

Bell Records, then having a string of hits with &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, signed Jones to a somewhat inflexible solo record contract in 1971. Jones was not allowed to choose his songs or producer, resulting in several lacklustre and aimless records. His second solo album, &quot;Davy Jones&quot; (1971) was notable for the song &quot;Rainy Jane&quot;, which reached No. 52 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. To promote the album, Jones performed &quot;Girl&quot; on an episode of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; entitled &quot;Getting Davy Jones&quot;. Although the single sold poorly, the popularity of Jones&#x27; appearance on the show resulted in &quot;Girl&quot; becoming his best-remembered solo hit, even though it was not included in the album. The final single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Believe In You&quot;/&quot;Road to Love&quot;, was poorly received.

====Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart (1976)====

Thanks in part to reruns of &quot;The Monkees&quot; on Saturday mornings and in syndication, &quot;The Monkees Greatest Hits&quot; charted in 1976. The LP, issued by Arista (a subsidiary of Screen Gems), was actually a repackaging of a 1972 compilation LP called &quot;Refocus&quot; that had been issued by Arista&#x27;s previous label imprint, Bell Records, also owned by Screen Gems.

Dolenz and Jones took advantage of this, joining ex-Monkees songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart to tour the United States. From 1975 to 1977, as the &quot;Golden Hits of The Monkees&quot; show (&quot;The Guys who Wrote &#x27;Em and the Guys who Sang &#x27;Em!&quot;), they successfully performed in smaller venues such as state fairs and amusement parks as well as making stops in Japan, Thailand, and Singapore (although they were forbidden from using the &quot;Monkees&quot; name, as it was owned by Screen Gems at the time). They also released an album of new material appropriately as &quot;Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart&quot;; a live album entitled &quot;Concert in Japan&quot; was also recorded in 1976, but was not released until 1996.

====Further stage and screen appearances (1977–1999)====

Despite his initial high-profile after the Monkees disbanded, Jones struggled to establish himself as a solo music artist. Glenn A. Baker, author of &quot;Monkeemania: The True Story of the Monkees&quot;, commented in 1986 that &quot;for an artist as versatile and confident as (Davy) Jones, the relative failure of his post-Monkees activities is puzzling. For all his cocky predictions to the press about his future plans, Davy fell into a directionless heap when left to his own devices.&quot;

Jones returned to theatre several times after the Monkees disbanded. In 1977, he performed with former bandmate Micky Dolenz in a stage production of the Harry Nilsson musical &quot;The Point!&quot; in London at the Mermaid Theatre, playing and singing the starring role of &quot;Oblio&quot; to Dolenz&#x27; roles as the &quot;Count&#x27;s Kid&quot; and the &quot;Leafman&quot;, (according to the CD booklet). An original cast recording was made and released. The comedic chemistry of Jones and Dolenz proved so strong that the show was revived in 1978 with Nilsson inserting additional comedy for the two, plus two more songs, with one of them (&quot;Gotta Get Up&quot;) being sung by Jones and Dolenz. The show was considered so good that it was planned to be revived again in 1979 but it proved cost prohibitive (source CD booklet &quot;Harry Nilsson&#x27;s The Point&quot;). Jones also appeared in several productions of &quot;Oliver!&quot; as the Artful Dodger, and in 1989 toured the US portraying &quot;Fagin&quot;.

Jones appeared in two episodes each of &quot;Love, American Style&quot; and &quot;My Two Dads&quot;. Jones also appeared in animated form as himself in 1972 in an hour-long episode of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;.

A &quot;Monkees&quot; television show marathon (&quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot;) broadcast on 23 February 1986 by MTV resulted in a wave of Monkeemania not seen since the band&#x27;s heyday. Jones reunited with Dolenz and Peter Tork from 1986 to 1989 to celebrate the band&#x27;s renewed success and promote the 20th anniversary of the band. A new top 20 hit, &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot; was released (though Jones did not perform on the song) as well as an album, &quot;Pool It!&quot;

In 1996, Jones reunited with Dolenz, Tork and Michael Nesmith to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Monkees. The band released a new album entitled &quot;Justus&quot;, the first album since 1967&#x27;s &quot;Headquarters&quot; that featured the band members performing all instrumental duties. It was the last time all four Monkees performed together.

Other television appearances include &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, &quot;The Single Guy&quot; (where he is mistaken for Dudley Moore) and &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; in which he sang &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; to Sabrina Spellman (played by Melissa Joan Hart) as well as (I&#x27;ll) Love You Forever.
In 1995, Jones acted in a notable episode of the sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;.

The continued popularity of Jones&#x27; 1971 &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; appearance led to his being cast as himself in &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot; (1995). Jones sang his signature solo hit &quot;Girl&quot;, with a grunge band providing backing, this time with middle-aged women swooning over him. Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork also appeared alongside Jones as judges.

On 2 August 1996, while The Monkees were on their 30th-anniversary tour in New England, Jones was interviewed on the &quot;Sports Break&quot; radio show on WBPS 890-AM in Boston by host Roland Regan about his early days as a jockey and amateur boxer back in England as a youth, and now how he stays in shape by jogging and playing in celebrity tennis tournaments.

On 21 June 1997, during a concert at the Los Angeles Coliseum, Jones joined U2&#x27;s The Edge onstage for a karaoke performance of &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;, which had become a fixture of the band&#x27;s set during that year&#x27;s PopMart Tour.

====Later career (2000–2012)====
In 2001, Jones released &quot;Just Me&quot;, an album of his own songs, some written for the album and others originally on Monkees releases. In the early 2000s he was performing in the Flower Power Concert Series during Epcot&#x27;s Flower and Garden Festival, a yearly gig he would continue until his death.

In April 2006, Jones recorded the single &quot;Your Personal Penguin&quot;, written by children&#x27;s author Sandra Boynton, as a companion piece to her new board book of the same title.

In 2007, Jones performed the theme song for the film &quot;Sexina: Popstar P.I.&quot;. On 1 November 2007, the Boynton book and CD titled &quot;Blue Moo&quot; was released and Jones is featured in both the book and CD, singing &quot;Your Personal Penguin&quot;. In 2009, Jones released a collection of classics and standards from the 1940s through the 1970s entitled &quot;She&quot;.

In December 2008, &quot;Yahoo! Music&quot; named Jones the &quot;Number 1 teen idol of all time&quot;. In 2009, Jones was rated second in a list of 10 best teen idols compiled by Fox News.

In 2009, Jones made a cameo appearance as himself in the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One&quot; (his appearance was meant as a pun on the phrase &quot;Davy Jones&#x27; Locker&quot;).

In February 2011, Jones confirmed rumours of another Monkees reunion. &quot;There&#x27;s even talk of putting the Monkees back together again in the next year or so for a U.S. and UK tour,&quot; he told Disney&#x27;s Backstage Pass newsletter. &quot;You&#x27;re always hearing all those great songs on the radio, in commercials, movies, almost everywhere.&quot; The tour (Jones&#x27; last) came to fruition and was entitled An Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour&quot;.&quot;

==Other ventures==
In 1967, Jones opened his first store, called Zilch, at 217 Thompson Street in the Greenwich Village section of New York City. The store sold &quot;hip&quot; clothing and accessories, and also allowed customers to design their own clothes.

After the Monkees disbanded in 1970, Jones kept himself busy by establishing a New York City-style street market in Los Angeles, called &quot;The Street&quot;, which cost approximately $40,000. He also collaborated with musical director Doug Trevor on a one-hour ABC television special titled &quot;Pop Goes Davy Jones&quot;, which featured new artists The Jackson 5 and the Osmonds.

===Horse racing===
In addition to his career as an entertainer, Jones&#x27; other great love was horses. Having trained as a jockey in his teens in the UK, he had at first intended to pursue a career as a professional race jockey. He held an amateur rider&#x27;s licence, and rode in his first race at Newbury in Berkshire for renowned trainer Toby Balding.

On 1 February 1996, Jones won his first race, on Digpast, in the one-mile Ontario Amateur Riders Handicap at Lingfield in Surrey. Jones also had horse ownership interests in both the US and the UK, and served as a commercial spokesman for Colonial Downs racetrack in Virginia. Following Jones&#x27; death, Lingfield announced that the first two races on the racecard for 3 March 2012 would be renamed the &quot;Hey Hey We&#x27;re The Monkees Handicap&quot; and the &quot;In Memory of Davy Jones Selling Stakes&quot;, with successful horses in those races accompanied into the winners&#x27; enclosure by some of the Monkees&#x27; biggest hits. Plans were also announced to erect a plaque to commemorate Jones next to a Monkey Puzzle tree on the course.

==Personal life==
Jones was married three times and had four children. In December 1967, he married Dixie Linda Haines, with whom he had been living. Their relationship had been kept out of the public eye until after the birth of their first child in October 1968. It caused a considerable backlash for Jones from his fans when it was finally made public. Jones later stated in &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; magazine, &quot;I kept my marriage a secret because I believe stars should be allowed a private life.&quot; Jones and Haines had two daughters, Talia Elizabeth Jones (2 October 1968) and Sarah Lee Jones (3 July 1971). The marriage ended in 1975.

Jones married his second wife, Anita Pollinger, on 24 January 1981, and also had two daughters. Jessica Lillian Jones (4 September 1981) and Annabel Charlotte Jones (26 June 1988). The couple divorced in 1996 during the Monkees&#x27; 30th-anniversary reunion tour.

Jones married Jessica Pacheco in 2009. Jones and his wife appeared on the &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; show in April 2011. On 28 July 2011, Pacheco filed to divorce Jones in Miami-Dade County, Florida, but dropped the suit in October. They were still married when he died in February 2012. Pacheco was omitted from Jones&#x27; will, which he had made before their marriage. His oldest daughter, whom he named his executrix, was granted by the court the unusual request that her father&#x27;s will be sealed, on the basis that &quot;planning documents and financial affairs as public opinion could have a material effect on his copyrights, royalties and ongoing goodwill&quot;.&quot;

==Death==
On the morning of 29 February 2012, Jones went to tend his 14 horses at a farm in Indiantown, Florida. After riding one of his favorite horses around the track, he complained of chest pains and difficulty breathing and was given antacid pills. He got in his car to go home. Just after 8:00 a.m., a ranch-hand found him unconscious and an ambulance was called but Jones could not be revived. He was taken to Martin Memorial South Hospital in Stuart, Florida, where he died of a heart attack resulting from arteriosclerosis. He was 66.

On 7 March, a private funeral service was held at Holy Cross Catholic parish church in Indiantown. To avoid drawing attention to the grieving family, the three surviving Monkees did not attend. Instead, the bandmates attended memorial services in New York City and organised their own private memorial in Los Angeles along with Jones&#x27; family and close friends. A public memorial service was held on 10 March in Beavertown, Pennsylvania, near a church Jones had purchased for future renovation.

On 12 March, a private memorial service was held in Jones&#x27; hometown of Openshaw, Manchester, at Lees Street Congregational Church, where Jones performed as a child in church plays. Jones&#x27; wife and daughters travelled to England to join his relatives based there for the service, and placed his ashes on his parents&#x27; graves for a time.

===Reaction===

The news of Jones&#x27; death triggered a surge of Internet traffic, causing sales of the Monkees&#x27; music to increase dramatically.

Guitarist Michael Nesmith stated that Jones&#x27; &quot;spirit and soul live well in my heart, among all the lovely people, who remember with me the good times, and the healing times, that were created for so many, including us. I have fond memories. I wish him safe travels.&quot; In an 8 March 2012 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Nesmith commented, &quot;For me, David was the Monkees. They were his band. We were his side men.&quot; Bassist Peter Tork said, &quot;Adios to the Manchester Cowboy&quot;, and speaking to CNN, drummer/singer Micky Dolenz said, &quot;He was the brother I never had and this leaves a gigantic hole in my heart.&quot; Dolenz claimed that he knew that something bad was about to happen and said &quot;Can&#x27;t believe it.. Still in shock.. had bad dreams all night long.&quot; Dolenz was gratified by the public affection expressed for both Jones and the Monkees in the wake of his bandmate&#x27;s death. &quot;He was a very well-known and well-loved character and person. There are a lot of people who are grieving pretty hard. The Monkees obviously had a following, and so did (Jones) on his own. So I&#x27;m not surprised, but I was flattered and honored to be considered one of his friends and a cohort in Monkee business.&quot;

&quot;The Monkees&quot; co-creator Bob Rafelson commented that Jones &quot;deserves a lot of credit, let me tell you. He may not have lived as long as we wanted him to, but he survived about seven lifetimes, including being perhaps the biggest rock star of his time.&quot;

&quot;Brady Bunch&quot; co-star Maureen McCormick commented that &quot;Davy was a beautiful soul,&quot; and that he &quot;spread love and goodness around the world. He filled our lives with happiness, music, and joy. He will live on in our hearts forever. May he rest in peace.&quot;

Yahoo Music commented that Jones&#x27; death &quot;hit so many people so hard&quot; because &quot;Monkees nostalgia cuts across generations: from the people who discovered the band during their original 1960s run; to the kids who came of age watching 1970s reruns; to the 20- and 30-somethings who discovered the Monkees when MTV (a network that owes much to the Monkees&#x27; influence) began airing old episodes in 1986.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; contributor James Poniewozik praised the Monkees&#x27; classic sitcom, and Jones in particular, saying, &quot;even if the show never meant to be more than entertainment and a hit-single generator, we shouldn&#x27;t sell &quot;The Monkees&quot; short. It was far better television than it had to be; during an era of formulaic domestic sitcoms and wacky comedies, it was a stylistically ambitious show, with a distinctive visual style, absurdist sense of humor and unusual story structure. Whatever Jones and the Monkees were meant to be, they became creative artists in their own right, and Jones&#x27; chipper Brit-pop presence was a big reason they were able to produce work that was commercial, wholesome, and yet impressively weird.&quot;

Mediaite columnist Paul Levinson noted, &quot;The Monkees were the first example of something created in a medium – in this case, a rock band on television – that jumped off the screen to have big impact in the real world.&quot;

<doc id="9146" wikidata="Q171433" url="?curid=9146" title="Dolly (sheep)">
<text>Dolly (5 July 1996 – 14 February 2003) was a female Finn-Dorset sheep and the first mammal that was cloned from an adult somatic cell. She was cloned by associates of the Roslin Institute in Scotland, using the process of nuclear transfer from a cell taken from a mammary gland. Her cloning proved that a cloned organism could be produced from a mature cell from a specific body part. Contrary to popular belief, she was not the first animal to be cloned.

The employment of adult somatic cells in lieu of embryonic stem cells for cloning emerged from the foundational work of John Gurdon, who cloned African clawed frogs in 1958 with this approach. The successful cloning of Dolly led to widespread advancements within stem cell research, including the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells.

Dolly lived at the Roslin Institute throughout her life and produced several lambs. She was euthanized at the age of six years due to a progressive lung disease. No cause which linked the disease to her cloning was found.

Dolly&#x27;s body was preserved and donated by the Roslin Institute in Scotland to the National Museum of Scotland, where it has been regularly exhibited since 2003.

== Genesis ==
Dolly was cloned by Keith Campbell, Ian Wilmut and colleagues at the Roslin Institute, part of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, and the biotechnology company PPL Therapeutics, based near Edinburgh. The funding for Dolly&#x27;s cloning was provided by PPL Therapeutics and the Ministry of Agriculture. She was born on 5 July 1996. She has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s most famous sheep&quot; by sources including BBC News and &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

The cell used as the donor for the cloning of Dolly was taken from a mammary gland, and the production of a healthy clone, therefore, proved that a cell taken from a specific part of the body could recreate a whole individual. On Dolly&#x27;s name, Wilmut stated &quot;Dolly is derived from a mammary gland cell and we couldn&#x27;t think of a more impressive pair of glands than Dolly Parton&#x27;s.&quot;

== Birth ==
Dolly was born on 5 July 1996 and had three mothers: one provided the egg, another the DNA, and a third carried the cloned embryo to term. She was created using the technique of somatic cell nuclear transfer, where the cell nucleus from an adult cell is transferred into an unfertilized oocyte (developing egg cell) that has had its cell nucleus removed. The hybrid cell is then stimulated to divide by an electric shock, and when it develops into a blastocyst it is implanted in a surrogate mother. Dolly was the first clone produced from a cell taken from an adult mammal. The production of Dolly showed that genes in the nucleus of such a mature differentiated somatic cell are still capable of reverting to an embryonic totipotent state, creating a cell that can then go on to develop into any part of an animal.

Dolly&#x27;s existence was announced to the public on 22 February 1997. It gained much attention in the media. A commercial with Scottish scientists playing with sheep was aired on TV, and a special report in &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured Dolly. &quot;Science&quot; featured Dolly as the breakthrough of the year. Even though Dolly was not the first animal cloned, she received media attention because she was the first cloned from an adult cell.

== Life ==

Dolly lived her entire life at the Roslin Institute in Midlothian. There she was bred with a Welsh Mountain ram and produced six lambs in total. Her first lamb, named Bonnie, was born in April 1998. The next year, Dolly produced twin lambs Sally and Rosie; further, she gave birth to triplets Lucy, Darcy and Cotton in 2000. In late 2001, at the age of four, Dolly developed arthritis and started to have difficulty walking. This was treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.

== Death ==
On 14 February 2003, Dolly was euthanised because she had a progressive lung disease and severe arthritis. A Finn Dorset such as Dolly has a life expectancy of around 11 to 12 years, but Dolly lived 6.5 years. A post-mortem examination showed she had a form of lung cancer called ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma, also known as Jaagsiekte, which is a fairly common disease of sheep and is caused by the retrovirus JSRV. Roslin scientists stated that they did not think there was a connection with Dolly being a clone, and that other sheep in the same flock had died of the same disease. Such lung diseases are a particular danger for sheep kept indoors, and Dolly had to sleep inside for security reasons.

Some in the press speculated that a contributing factor to Dolly&#x27;s death was that she could have been born with a genetic age of six years, the same age as the sheep from which she was cloned. One basis for this idea was the finding that Dolly&#x27;s telomeres were short, which is typically a result of the aging process. The Roslin Institute stated that intensive health screening did not reveal any abnormalities in Dolly that could have come from advanced aging.

In 2016, scientists reported no defects in thirteen cloned sheep, including four from the same cell line as Dolly. The first study to review the long-term health outcomes of cloning, the authors found no evidence of late-onset, non-communicable diseases other than some minor examples of osteoarthritis and concluded &quot;We could find no evidence, therefore, of a detrimental long-term effect of cloning by SCNT on the health of aged offspring among our cohort.&quot;

After her death Dolly&#x27;s body was preserved via taxidermy and is currently on display at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.

== Legacy ==
After cloning was successfully demonstrated through the production of Dolly, many other large mammals were cloned, including pigs, deer, horses and bulls. The attempt to clone argali (mountain sheep) did not produce viable embryos. The attempt to clone a banteng bull was more successful, as were the attempts to clone mouflon (a form of wild sheep), both resulting in viable offspring. The reprogramming process that cells need to go through during cloning is not perfect and embryos produced by nuclear transfer often show abnormal development. Making cloned mammals was highly inefficientin 1996, Dolly was the only lamb that survived to adulthood from 277 attempts. By 2014, Chinese scientists were reported to have 70–80% success rates cloning pigs, and in 2016, a Korean company, Sooam Biotech, was producing 500 cloned embryos a day. Wilmut, who led the team that created Dolly, announced in 2007 that the nuclear transfer technique may never be sufficiently efficient for use in humans.

Cloning may have uses in preserving endangered species, and may become a viable tool for reviving extinct species. In January 2009, scientists from the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon in northern Spain announced the cloning of the Pyrenean ibex, a form of wild mountain goat, which was officially declared extinct in 2000. Although the newborn ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs, it is the first time an extinct animal has been cloned, and may open doors for saving endangered and newly extinct species by resurrecting them from frozen tissue.

In July 2016, four identical clones of Dolly (Daisy, Debbie, Dianna, and Denise) were alive and healthy at nine years old.

&quot;Scientific American&quot; concluded in 2016 that the main legacy of Dolly has not been cloning of animals but in advances into stem cell research. Gene targeting was added in 2000, when researchers cloned female lamb Diana from sheep DNA altered to contain the human gene for alpha 1-antitrypsin. The human gene was specifically activated in the ewe’s mammary gland, so Diana produced milk containing human alpha 1-antitrypsin. After Dolly, researchers realised that ordinary cells could be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be grown into any tissue.

The first successful cloning of a primate species was reported in January 2018, using the same method which produced Dolly. Two identical clones of a macaque monkey, Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, were created by researchers in China and were born in late 2017.

In January 2019, scientists in China reported the creation of five identical cloned gene-edited monkeys, again using this method, and the gene-editing CRISPR-Cas9 technique allegedly used by He Jiankui in creating the first ever gene-modified human babies Lulu and Nana. The monkey clones were made in order to study several medical diseases.

== Dolly in popular culture ==
In 2003, the Belgian artist Dominique Goblet published a short comic strip about Dolly the cloned sheep with the title: “2004 Apparition de Dolly dans la campagne anglaise”

&quot;Dolly The Sheep&quot; was initially released on November 13, 2012, as a flash game developed by the small game development company Pozirk Games, in which Dolly the cloned sheep is being chased by evil scientists. For some time the game was available to play online as well as on mobile devices. As of June 14, 2023, it is only available online for desktop/laptop computers.

<text>Dolores Agnes Fuller ( Eble, later Chamberlin; March 10, 1923 – May 9, 2011) was an American actress and songwriter known as the one-time girlfriend of the low-budget film director Ed Wood. She played the protagonist&#x27;s girlfriend in &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;, co-starred in Wood&#x27;s &quot;Jail Bait&quot;, and had a minor role in his &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;. After she broke up with Wood in 1955, she relocated to New York and had a very successful career there as a songwriter. Elvis Presley recorded a number of her songs written for his films.

== Film career ==
Her first screen appearance was at the age of 10, when she appeared briefly in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;. According to Fuller, the female lead in &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; was written for her but Wood gave it to Loretta King instead.

In August 1954, Fuller was cast in Wood&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, intended to star Bela Lugosi. Frank Yaconelli was named as her co-star and &#x27;comic killer&#x27;. The film was never made. She ended up making an appearance in &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; (1956), also with Lugosi. Fuller hosted a benefit for Lugosi which preceded the showing of &quot;Bride of the Atom&quot; (early working title of &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot;) on May 11, 1955. A cocktail party was held at the Gardens Restaurant at 4311 Magnolia Avenue in Burbank, California. Vampira attended and was escorted by Paul Marco. A single screening of the film was presented at the Hollywood Paramount.

According to Fuller, as quoted in Wood biography &quot;Nightmare of Ecstasy&quot; (1992), she first met Ed Wood when she attended a casting call with a friend for a movie he was supposed to direct called &quot;Behind Locked Doors&quot; (which he did not go on to direct); it has also been stated that they met in a restaurant.

She became his girlfriend shortly thereafter and began acting in his films. Her movie career included a bit part in &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934) and roles in &quot;Outlaw Women&quot; (1952), &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; (1953), &quot;Body Beautiful&quot; (1953), &quot;The Blue Gardenia&quot; (1953), &quot;Count the Hours&quot; (1953), &quot;Mesa of Lost Women&quot; (1953), &quot;College Capers&quot; (1954), &quot;Jail Bait&quot; (1954), &quot;The Raid&quot; (1954), &quot;This Is My Love&quot; (1954), &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; (1956), and many years later appearances in &quot;The Ironbound Vampire&quot; (1997) and &quot;Dimensions in Fear&quot; (1998).

== Television performer and songwriter ==
Fuller had already had earlier experience on television in &quot;Queen for a Day&quot; and &quot;The Dinah Shore Show&quot;.

She also appeared on an episode of &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot; as &quot;the blonde in the mink coat.&quot;

Fuller&#x27;s ability as a songwriter manifested itself through the intervention of her friend, producer Hal Wallis; Fuller had wanted to get an acting role in the Elvis Presley movie &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, which Wallis was producing, but instead he put her in touch with Hill &amp; Range, the publisher that provided Presley with songs. Fuller went into a collaborative partnership with composer Ben Weisman and co-wrote one song, &quot;Rock-A-Hula Baby&quot;, for the film. Over time, this led to Presley recording a dozen of her songs, including &quot;I Got Lucky&quot; and &quot;Spinout&quot;, primarily for his film soundtracks, though he also recorded &quot;Cindy, Cindy&quot; for his 1971 album &quot;Love Letters From Elvis&quot;. Fuller&#x27;s music was also recorded by Nat &#x27;King&#x27; Cole, Peggy Lee, and other leading talents of the time. Toward the end of her life, Dolores helped edit and score a short western film Ed Wood had begun, but never completed, in the 1940s called &quot;Crossroads of Laredo&quot;

== Private life ==
Dolores married Donald Fuller in 1941, with whom she had two children. At the time she met Ed Wood, she was in the process of divorcing her husband (they finally divorced in 1955). She and Wood shared an apartment together for several years. Wood biographer Rudolph Grey quotes Fuller as saying of the period before her success, He [Ed Wood] begged me to marry him. I loved him in a way, but I couldn&#x27;t handle the transvestism. I&#x27;m a very normal person. It&#x27;s hard for me to deviate! I wanted a man that was all man… After we broke up, he would stand outside my home in Burbank and cry. &quot;Let me in, I love you!&quot; What good would I have done if I had married him? We would have starved together… I bettered myself. I had to uplift myself. She has also been quoted as saying that &quot;His dressing up didn&#x27;t bother me—we all have our little queer habits&quot; and giving Wood&#x27;s drinking as the reason for their breakup.

Dolores remarried in 1988 at age 65, to Philip Chamberlin, and they remained married until her death in 2011. Fuller&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Fuller Life: Hollywood, Ed Wood and Me&quot;, co-authored by Stone Wallace and Philip Chamberlin, was published in 2008.

== Portrayal in &quot;Ed Wood&quot; ==
Fuller was portrayed by Sarah Jessica Parker in Tim Burton&#x27;s 1994 Wood biographical film &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, a portrayal of which she disapproved due to the fact that she was depicted smoking in the film, while Fuller said she herself was a lifelong non-smoker. She also complained that she was only portrayed as &quot;sort of as an actress&quot; and did not feel she was given credit for her other accomplishments and contributions towards Wood&#x27;s career. However, she stated that she liked the film overall, praising Johnny Depp&#x27;s performance in the title role.

<text>In law and government, de jure (; ; ) describes practices that are officially recognized by laws or other formal norms, regardless of whether the practice exists in reality. The phrase is often used in contrast with &quot;de facto&quot; (&#x27;in fact&#x27;), which describes situations that exist in reality, even if not formally recognized.

==Definition==
&quot;De jure&quot; is a Latin expression composed of the words &quot;de&quot; (from) and &quot;jure&quot; (adjective form of &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;law&#x27;).

==Usage==
===Jurisprudence and &quot;de jure&quot; law===
In U.S. law, particularly after &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), the difference between &quot;de facto&quot; segregation (that existed because of voluntary associations and neighborhoods) and &quot;de jure&quot; segregation (that existed because of local laws) became important distinctions for court-mandated remedial purposes.

===Government and culture===
Between 1805 and 1914, the ruling dynasty of Egypt was subject to the rulers of the Ottoman Empire but acted as &quot;de facto&quot; independent rulers who maintained the polite fiction of Ottoman suzerainty. However, starting from around 1882, the rulers had only &quot;de jure&quot; rule over Egypt, as it had by then become a British puppet state. Thus, by Ottoman law, Egypt was &quot;de jure&quot; a province of the Ottoman Empire, but &quot;de facto&quot; was part of the British Empire.

===Borders===
The &quot;de jure&quot; borders of a country are defined by the area its government claims, but not necessarily controls. Modern examples include Taiwan (claimed but not controlled by China) and Kashmir (claimed by multiple countries).

<text>Des Moines ( ) is the capital and most populous city in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is the county seat of Polk County with parts extending into Warren County. It was incorporated on September 22, 1851, as Fort Des Moines, which was shortened to &quot;Des Moines&quot; in 1857. It is located on, and named after, the Des Moines River, which likely was adapted from the early French name, &quot;Rivière des Moines,&quot; meaning &quot;River of the Monks&quot;. The city&#x27;s population was 214,133 as of the 2020 census. The six-county metropolitan area is ranked 81st in terms of population in the United States, with 709,466 residents according to the 2020 census by the United States Census Bureau, and is the largest metropolitan area fully located within the state.

Des Moines is a major center of the United States insurance industry and has a sizable financial-services and publishing business base. The city is the headquarters for the Principal Financial Group and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other major corporations such as Wells Fargo, Cognizant, Voya Financial, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, ACE Limited, Bayer, and Corteva have large operations in or near the metropolitan area. In recent years, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, and Facebook have built data-processing and logistical facilities in the Des Moines area.

Des Moines is an important city in U.S. presidential politics; as the state&#x27;s capital, it is the site of the first caucuses of the presidential primary cycle. Many presidential candidates set up campaign headquarters in Des Moines. A 2007 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;If you have any desire to witness presidential candidates in the most close-up and intimate of settings, there is arguably no better place to go than Des Moines.&quot;

==History==
===Etymology===
Des Moines takes its name from Fort Des Moines (1843–46), which was named for the Des Moines River. This was adopted from the name given by French colonists. &quot;Des Moines&quot; (; formerly ) translates literally to either &quot;from the monks&quot; or &quot;of the monks&quot;.

One popular interpretation of &quot;Des Moines&quot; concludes that it refers to a group of French Trappist monks, who in the 17th century lived in huts built on top of what is now known as the ancient Monks Mound at Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture, which developed in what is present-day Illinois, east of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis. This was some from the Des Moines River.

===Prehistoric inhabitants of early Des Moines===

Based on archaeological evidence, the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers has attracted humans for at least 7,000 years. Several prehistoric occupation areas have been identified by archaeologists in downtown Des Moines. Discovered in December 2010, the &quot;Palace&quot; is an expansive 7,000-year-old site found during excavations prior to construction of the new wastewater treatment plant in southeast Des Moines. It contains well-preserved house deposits and numerous graves. More than 6,000 artifacts were found at this site. State of Iowa archaeologist John Doershuk was assisted by University of Iowa archaeologists at this dig.

At least three villages, dating from about AD 1300 to 1700, stood in or near what developed later as downtown Des Moines. In addition, 15 to 18 prehistoric Native American mounds were observed in the area by early settlers. All have been destroyed during development of the city.

===Origin of Fort Des Moines===

Des Moines traces its origins to May 1843, when Captain James Allen supervised the construction of a fort on the site where the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers merge. Allen wanted to use the name Fort Raccoon; however, the U.S. War Department preferred Fort Des Moines. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki peoples, whom the government had moved to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. The fort was abandoned in 1846 after the Sauk and Meskwaki were removed from the state and shifted to the Indian Territory.

The Sauk and Meskwaki did not fare well in Des Moines. The illegal whiskey trade, combined with the destruction of traditional lifeways, led to severe problems for their society. One newspaper reported:
&quot;It is a fact that the location of Fort Des Moines among the Sac and Fox Indians (under its present commander) for the last two years, had corrupted them more and lowered them deeper in the scale of vice and degradation, than all their intercourse with the whites for the ten years previous&quot;.After official removal, the Meskwaki continued to return to Des Moines until around 1857.

Archaeological excavations have shown that many fort-related features survived under what is now Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway and First Street. Soldiers stationed at Fort Des Moines opened the first coal mines in the area, mining coal from the riverbank for the fort&#x27;s blacksmith.

===Early settlement===

Settlers occupied the abandoned fort and nearby areas. On May 25, 1846, the state legislature designated Fort Des Moines as the seat of Polk County. Arozina Perkins, a school teacher who spent the winter of 1850–1851 in the town of Fort Des Moines, was not favorably impressed:

This is one of the strangest looking &quot;cities&quot; I ever saw... This town is at the juncture of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers. It is mostly a level prairie with a few swells or hills around it. We have a court house of &quot;brick&quot; and one church, a plain, framed building belonging to the Methodists. There are two taverns here, one of which has a most important little bell that rings together some fifty boarders. I cannot tell you how many dwellings there are, for I have not counted them; some are of logs, some of brick, some framed, and some are the remains of the old dragoon houses... The people support two papers and there are several dry goods shops. I have been into but four of them... Society is as varied as the buildings are. There are people from nearly every state, and Dutch, Swedes, etc.

In May 1851, much of the town was destroyed during the Flood of 1851. &quot;The Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers rose to an unprecedented height, inundating the entire country east of the Des Moines River. Crops were utterly destroyed, houses and fences swept away.&quot; The city started to rebuild from scratch.

===Era of growth===
On September 22, 1851, Des Moines was incorporated as a city; the charter was approved by voters on October 18. In 1857, the name &quot;Fort Des Moines&quot; was shortened to &quot;Des Moines&quot;, and it was designated as the second state capital, previously at Iowa City. Growth was slow during the Civil War period, but the city exploded in size and importance after a railroad link was completed in 1866.

In 1864, the Des Moines Coal Company was organized to begin the first systematic mining in the region. Its first mine, north of town on the river&#x27;s west side, was exhausted by 1873. The Black Diamond mine, near the south end of the West Seventh Street Bridge, sank a mine shaft to reach a coal bed. By 1876, this mine employed 150 men and shipped 20 carloads of coal per day. By 1885, numerous mine shafts were within the city limits, and mining began to spread into the surrounding countryside. By 1893, 23 mines were in the region. By 1908, Des Moines&#x27; coal resources were largely exhausted. In 1912, Des Moines still had eight locals of the United Mine Workers union, representing 1,410 miners. This was about 1.7% of the city&#x27;s population in 1910.

By 1880, Des Moines had a population of 22,408, making it Iowa&#x27;s largest city. It displaced the three Mississippi River ports: Burlington, Dubuque, and Davenport, that had alternated holding the position since the territorial period. Des Moines has remained Iowa&#x27;s most populous city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Des Moines&#x27; population as 97.3% white and 2.7% black, reflecting its early settlement pattern primarily by ethnic Europeans.

===&quot;City Beautiful&quot; project, decline and rebirth===


At the turn of the 20th century, encouraged by the Civic Committee of the Des Moines Women&#x27;s Club, Des Moines undertook a &quot;City Beautiful&quot; project in which large Beaux Arts public buildings and fountains were constructed along the Des Moines River. The former Des Moines Public Library building (now the home of the World Food Prize); the United States central Post Office, built by the federal government (now the Polk County Administrative Building, with a newer addition); and the City Hall are surviving examples of the 1900–1910 buildings. They form the Civic Center Historic District.

The ornate riverfront balustrades that line the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers were built by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a project to provide local employment and improve infrastructure. The ornamental fountains that stood along the riverbank were buried in the 1950s when the city began a postindustrial decline that lasted until the late 1980s. The city has since rebounded, transforming from a blue-collar industrial city to a white-collar professional city.
In 1907, the city adopted a city commission government known as the Des Moines Plan, comprising an elected mayor and four commissioners, all elected at-large, who were responsible for public works, public property, public safety, and finance. Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command a majority to elect a candidate of their choice.

That form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a council-manager government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from single-member districts or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled a broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city. The population was 198,682 in 2000 and grew slightly to 200,538 in 2009. The growth of the outlying suburbs has continued, and the overall metropolitan-area population is over 700,000 today.

During the Great Flood of 1993, heavy rains throughout June and early July caused the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to rise above flood stage levels. The Des Moines Water Works was submerged by floodwaters during the early morning hours of July 11, 1993, leaving an estimated 250,000 people without running water for 12 days and without drinking water for 20 days. Des Moines suffered major flooding again in June 2008 with a major levee breach. The Des Moines River is controlled upstream by Saylorville Reservoir. In both 1993 and 2008, the flooding river overtopped the reservoir spillway.

Today, Des Moines is a member of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Through ICLEI, Des Moines has implemented &quot;The Tomorrow Plan&quot;, a regional plan focused on developing central Iowa in a sustainable fashion, centrally-planned growth, and resource consumption to manage the local population.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is covered by water. It is above sea level at the confluence of the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.

In November 2005, Des Moines voters approved a measure that allowed the city to annex parcels of land in the northeast, southeast, and southern corners of Des Moines without agreement by local residents, particularly areas bordering the Iowa Highway 5/U.S. 65 bypass. The annexations became official on June 26, 2009, as and around 868 new residents were added to the city of Des Moines. An additional were voluntarily annexed to the city over that same period.

===Metropolitan area===
===Cityscape===

The skyline of Des Moines changed in the 1970s and the 1980s, when several new skyscrapers were built. Additional skyscrapers were built in the 1990s, including Iowa&#x27;s tallest. Before then, the 19-story Equitable Building, from 1924, was the tallest building in the city and the tallest building in Iowa. The 25-story Financial Center was completed in 1973 and the 36-story Ruan Center was completed in 1974. They were later joined by the 33-story Des Moines Marriott Hotel (1981), the 25-story HUB Tower and 25-story Plaza Building (1985). Iowa&#x27;s tallest building, Principal Financial Group&#x27;s 45-story tower at 801 Grand was built in 1991, and the 19-story EMC Insurance Building was erected in 1997.

During this time period, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines (1979) was developed; it hosts Broadway shows and special events. Also constructed were the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden (1979), a large city botanical garden/greenhouse on the east side of the river; the Polk County Convention Complex (1985), and the State of Iowa Historical Museum (1987). The Des Moines skywalk also began to take shape during the 1980s. The skywalk system is long and connects many downtown buildings.

In the early 21st century, the city has had more major construction in the downtown area. The new Science Center of Iowa and Blank IMAX Dome Theater and the Iowa Events Center opened in 2005. The new central branch of the Des Moines Public Library, designed by renowned architect David Chipperfield of London, opened on April 8, 2006.

The World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Des Moines, completed adaptation and restoration of the former Des Moines Public Library building in October 2011. The former library now serves as the home and headquarters of the Norman Borlaug/World Food Prize Hall of Laureates.

===Climate===
At the center of North America and far removed from large bodies of water, the Des Moines area has a hot summer type humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Summer temperatures can often climb into the range, occasionally reaching . Humidity can be high in spring and summer, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Fall brings pleasant temperatures and colorful fall foliage. Winters vary from moderately cold to bitterly cold, with low temperatures venturing below quite often. Snowfall averages per season, and annual precipitation averages , with a peak in the warmer months. Winters are slightly colder than Chicago, but still warmer than Minneapolis, with summer temperatures being very similar between the Upper Midwest metropolitan areas.

==Demographics==

==Economy==
Many insurance companies are headquartered in Des Moines, including the Principal Financial Group, Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life, Allied Insurance, GuideOne Insurance, Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Iowa and FBL Financial Group. Iowa has one of the lowest insurance premium taxes in the nation at 1%, and does not charge any premium taxes on qualified life insurance plans, making the state attractive to insurance business. Des Moines has been referred to as the &quot;Hartford of the West&quot; and &quot;Insurance Capital&quot; because of this. Principal is one of two Fortune 500 companies with headquarters in Iowa (the other being Casey&#x27;s General Stores), ranking 201st on the magazine&#x27;s list in 2020.

As a center of financial and insurance services, other major corporations headquartered outside of Iowa have a presence in the Des Moines Metro area, including Wells Fargo, Voya Financial, and Electronic Data Systems (EDS). The Meredith Corporation, a leading publishing and marketing company, was also based in Des Moines prior to its acquisition by IAC and merger with Dotdash in 2021.

<text>Donald Malcolm Campbell, (23 March 1921 – 4 January 1967) was a British speed record breaker who broke eight absolute world speed records on water and on land in the 1950s and 1960s. He remains the only person to set both world land and water speed records in the same year (1964). He died during a water speed record attempt at Coniston Water in the Lake District, England.

== Family and personal life ==
Donald Malcolm Campbell was born at Canbury House, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, the son of Malcolm, later Sir Malcolm Campbell, holder of 13 world speed records in the 1920s and 1930s in the &quot;Bluebird&quot; cars and boats, and his second wife, Dorothy Evelyn (née Whittall).

Campbell attended St Peter&#x27;s School, Seaford in East Sussex, and Uppingham School in Rutland. At the outbreak of the Second World War he volunteered for the Royal Air Force, but was unable to serve because of a case of childhood rheumatic fever. He joined Briggs Motor Bodies Ltd in West Thurrock, where he became a maintenance engineer. Subsequently, he was a shareholder in a small engineering company called Kine Engineering, producing machine tools. Following his father&#x27;s death on 31 December 1948 and aided by Malcolm&#x27;s chief engineer, Leo Villa, the younger Campbell strove to set speed records first on water and then land.

He married three times — to Daphne Harvey in 1945, producing daughter Georgina (Gina) Campbell, born on 19 September 1946; to Dorothy McKegg (1928–2008) in 1952; and to Tonia Bern (1928–2021) in December 1958, which union lasted until his death in 1967. Campbell was intensely superstitious, hating the colour green, the number thirteen and believing nothing good ever happened on a Friday. He also had some interest in the paranormal, which he nurtured as a member of the Ghost Club.

== Water speed records ==
Campbell began his speed record attempts in the summer of 1949, using his father&#x27;s old boat, &quot;Blue Bird K4&quot;, which he renamed &quot;Bluebird K4&quot;. His initial attempts that summer were unsuccessful, although he did come close to raising his father&#x27;s existing record. The team returned to Coniston Water, Lancashire in 1950 for further trials. While there, they heard that an American, Stanley Sayres, had raised the record from , beyond K4&#x27;s capabilities without substantial modification.

In late 1950 and 1951, &quot;Bluebird K4&quot; was modified to make it a &quot;prop-rider&quot; as opposed to her original immersed propeller configuration. This greatly reduced hydrodynamic drag: The third planing point would now be the propeller hub, meaning one of the two propeller blades was always out of the water at high speed. She now sported two cockpits, the second one being for Leo Villa.

&quot;Bluebird K4&quot; now had a chance of exceeding Sayres&#x27; record and also enjoyed success as a circuit racer, winning the Oltranza Cup in Italy in the spring of that year. Returning to Coniston in September, they finally got &quot;Bluebird&quot; up to 170 mph after further trials, only to suffer a structural failure at which wrecked the boat. Sayres raised the record the following year to in Slo-Mo-Shun IV.

Along with Campbell, Britain had another potential contender for water speed record honours — John Cobb. He had commissioned the world&#x27;s first purpose-built turbojet Hydroplane, &quot;Crusader&quot;, with a target speed of over , and began trials on Loch Ness in autumn 1952. Cobb was killed later that year, when Crusader broke up, during an attempt on the record. Campbell was devastated at Cobb&#x27;s loss, but he resolved to build a new &quot;Bluebird&quot; boat to bring the water speed record back to Britain.

In early 1953, Campbell began development of his own advanced all-metal jet-powered &quot;Bluebird K7&quot; hydroplane to challenge the record, by now held by the American prop rider hydroplane Slo-Mo-Shun IV.[1] Designed by Ken and Lew Norris, the K7 was a steel-framed, aluminium-bodied, three-point hydroplane with a Metropolitan-Vickers Beryl axial-flow turbojet engine, producing 3,500-pound-force (16 kN) of thrust.

Like Slo-Mo-Shun, but unlike Cobb&#x27;s tricycle Crusader, the three planing points were arranged with two forward, on outrigged sponsons and one aft, in a &quot;pickle-fork&quot; layout, prompting &quot;Bluebird&quot;″s early comparison to a blue lobster. K7 was of very advanced design and construction, and its load bearing steel space frame ultra rigid and stressed to 25 g (exceeding contemporary military jet aircraft). It had a design speed of and remained the only successful jet-boat in the world until the late 1960s.

The designation &quot;K7&quot; was derived from its Lloyd&#x27;s unlimited rating registration. It was carried on a prominent white roundel on each sponson, underneath an infinity symbol. &quot;Bluebird K7&quot; was the seventh boat registered at Lloyds in the &quot;Unlimited&quot; series.

Campbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between July 1955 and December 1964. The first of these marks was set at Ullswater on 23 July 1955, where he achieved a speed of but only after many months of trials and a major redesign of &quot;Bluebird&quot;″s forward sponson attachments points. Campbell achieved a steady series of subsequent speed-record increases with the boat during the rest of the decade, beginning with a mark of in 1955 on Lake Mead in Nevada. Subsequently, four new marks were registered on Coniston Water, where Campbell and &quot;Bluebird&quot; became an annual fixture in the latter half of the 1950s, enjoying significant sponsorship from the Mobil oil company and then subsequently BP.

Campbell also made an attempt in the summer of 1957 at Canandaigua, New York, which failed due to lack of suitable calm water conditions. &quot;Bluebird K7&quot; became a well known and popular attraction, and as well as her annual Coniston appearances, &quot;K7&quot; was displayed extensively in the UK, United States, Canada and Europe, and then subsequently in Australia during Campbell&#x27;s prolonged attempt on the land speed record in 1963–1964.

To extract more speed, and endow the boat with greater high-speed stability, in both pitch and yaw, &quot;K7&quot; was subtly modified in the second half of the 1950s to incorporate more effective streamlining with a blown Perspex cockpit canopy and fluting to the lower part of the main hull. In 1958, a small wedge shaped tail fin, housing an arrester parachute, modified sponson fairings, that gave a significant reduction in forward aerodynamic lift, and a fixed hydrodynamic stabilising fin, attached to the transom to aid directional stability, and exert a marginal down-force on the nose were incorporated into the design to increase the safe operating envelope of the hydroplane. Thus she reached in 1956, where an unprecedented peak speed of was achieved on one run, in 1957, in 1958 and in 1959.

Campbell was named as a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1957 for his water speed record breaking, and in particular his record at Lake Mead in the United States which earned him and Britain very positive acclaim.

On 23 November 1964, Campbell achieved the Australian water speed record of on Lake Bonney Riverland in South Australia, although he was unable to break the world record on that attempt.

== Land speed record attempt ==

It was after the Lake Mead water speed record success in 1955 that the seeds of Campbell&#x27;s ambition to hold the land speed record as well were planted. The following year, the serious planning was under way — to build a car to break the land speed record, which then stood at set by John Cobb in 1947. The Norris brothers designed &quot;Bluebird-Proteus CN7&quot; with in mind.

The British motor industry, in the guise of Dunlop, BP, Smiths Industries, Lucas Automotive, Rubery Owen as well as many others, became heavily involved in the project to build the most advanced car the world had yet seen. CN7 was powered by a specially modified Bristol-Siddeley Proteus free-turbine engine of driving all four wheels. &quot;Bluebird CN7&quot; was designed to achieve 475–500 mph and was completed by the spring of 1960.

Following low-speed tests conducted at the Goodwood motor racing circuit in Sussex, in July, the &quot;CN7&quot; was taken to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, United States, scene of his father&#x27;s last land speed record triumph, some 25 years earlier in September 1935. The trials initially went well, and various adjustments were made to the car. On the sixth run in CN7, Campbell lost control at over 360 mph and crashed. It was the car&#x27;s tremendous structural integrity that saved his life. He was hospitalised with a fractured skull and a burst eardrum, as well as minor cuts and bruises, but &quot;CN7&quot; was a write-off. Almost immediately, Campbell announced he was determined to have another go. Sir Alfred Owen, whose Rubery Owen industrial group had built CN7, offered to rebuild it for him. That single decision was to have a profound influence on the rest of Campbell&#x27;s life. His original plan had been to break the land speed record at over 400 mph in 1960, return to Bonneville the following year to really bump up the speed to something near to 500 mph, get his seventh water speed record with K7 and then retire.

Campbell decided not to go back to Utah for the new trials. He felt the Bonneville course was too short at and the salt surface was in poor condition. BP offered to find another venue and eventually after a long search, Lake Eyre, in South Australia, was chosen. It hadn&#x27;t rained there for nine years and the vast dry bed of the salt lake offered a course of up to . By the summer of 1962, &quot;Bluebird CN7&quot; was rebuilt, some nine months later than Campbell had hoped. It was essentially the same car, but with the addition of a large stabilising tail fin and a reinforced fibreglass cockpit cover. At the end of 1962, &quot;CN7&quot; was shipped out to Australia ready for the new attempt. Low-speed runs had just started when the rains came. The course was compromised and further rain meant, that by May 1963, Lake Eyre was flooded to a depth of 3 inches, causing the attempt to be abandoned. Campbell was heavily criticised in the press for alleged time wasting and mismanagement of the project, despite the fact that he could hardly be held responsible for the unprecedented weather.

To make matters worse for Campbell, American Craig Breedlove drove his pure thrust jet car &quot;Spirit of America&quot; to a speed of at Bonneville in July 1963. Although the &quot;car&quot; did not conform to FIA (Federation Internationale de L&#x27;Automobile) regulations, that stipulated it had to be wheel-driven and have a minimum of four wheels, in the eyes of the world, Breedlove was now the fastest man on Earth.

Campbell returned to Australia in March 1964, but the Lake Eyre course failed to fulfil the early promise it had shown in 1962 and there were further spells of rain. BP pulled out as his main sponsor after a dispute, but he was able to secure backing from Australian oil company Ampol.

The track never properly dried out and Campbell was forced to make the best of the conditions. Finally, in July 1964, he was able to post some speeds that approached the record. On the 17th of that month, he took advantage of a break in the weather and made two courageous runs along the shortened and still damp track, posting a new land speed record of . The surreal moment was captured in a number of well-known images by photographers, including Australia&#x27;s Jeff Carter.

Campbell was bitterly disappointed with the record as the vehicle had been designed for much higher speeds. &quot;CN7&quot; covered the final third of the measured mile at an average of , peaking as it left the measured distance at over . He resented the fact that it had all been so difficult. &quot;We&#x27;ve made it — we got the bastard at last,&quot; was his reaction to the success. Campbell&#x27;s 403.1 mph represented the official land speed record.

In 1969, after Campbell&#x27;s fatal accident, his widow, Tonia Bern-Campbell negotiated a deal with Lynn Garrison, president of Craig Breedlove and Associates, that would see Craig Breedlove run &quot;Bluebird&quot; on Bonneville&#x27;s Salt Flats. This concept was cancelled when the parallel Spirit of America supersonic car project failed to find support.

== Double records ==

Campbell now planned to go after the water speed record one more time with &quot;Bluebird K7&quot; — to do what he had aimed for so many years earlier, during the initial planning stages of CN7 — break both records in the same year. After more delays, he finally achieved his seventh water speed record at Lake Dumbleyung near Perth, Western Australia, on the last day of 1964, at a speed of . He had become the first, and so far only, person to set both land and water speed records in the same year.

Campbell&#x27;s land speed record was short-lived, because FIA rule changes meant that pure jet cars would be eligible to set records from October 1964. Campbell&#x27;s speed on his final Lake Eyre run remained the highest speed achieved by a wheel-driven car until 2001; &quot;Bluebird CN7&quot; is now on display at the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu in Hampshire, England, its potential only partly realised.

==Rocket car plans and final water speed record attempt==
===Bluebird Mach 1.1===
Campbell decided a massive jump in speed was called for following his successful 1964 land speed record attempt in &quot;Bluebird CN7&quot;. His vision was of a supersonic rocket car with a potential maximum speed of . Norris Brothers were requested to undertake a design study. &quot;Bluebird Mach 1.1&quot; was a design for a rocket-powered supersonic land speed record car. Campbell chose a lucky date to hold a press conference at the Charing Cross Hotel on 7 July 1965 to announce his future record breaking plans:

&quot;Bluebird Mach 1.1&quot; was to be rocket-powered. Ken Norris had calculated using rocket motors would result in a vehicle with very low frontal area, greater density, and lighter weight than if he were to employ a jet engine. &quot;Bluebird Mach 1.1&quot; would also be a relatively compact and simple design. Norris specified two off-the-shelf Bristol Siddeley BS.605 rocket engines. The 605 had been developed as a rocket-assisted take-off engine for military aircraft and was fuelled with kerosene, using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidiser. Each engine was rated at thrust. In &quot;Bluebird Mach 1.1&quot; application, the combined thrust would be equivalent of 36,000 bhp (27,000 kW; 36,000 PS) at .

===Final record attempt===
To increase publicity for his rocket car venture, in the spring of 1966, Campbell decided to try once more for a water speed record. This time the target was . &quot;Bluebird K7&quot; was fitted with a lighter and more powerful Bristol Orpheus engine, taken from a Folland Gnat jet aircraft, which developed of thrust. The modified boat was taken back to Coniston in the first week of November 1966. The trials did not go well. The weather was very poor, and &quot;K7&quot; suffered an engine failure when her air intakes collapsed and debris was drawn into the engine. By the middle of December, some high-speed runs were made, in excess of but still well below Campbell&#x27;s existing record. Problems with &quot;Bluebird&quot;″s fuel system meant that the engine could not reach full speed, and so would not develop maximum power. Eventually, by the end of December, after further modifications to her fuel system, and the replacement of a fuel pump, the fuel starvation problem was fixed, and Campbell awaited better weather to mount an attempt.

==Death==

On 4 January 1967, weather conditions were finally suitable for an attempt. Campbell commenced the first run of his last record attempt at just after 8:45 am. &quot;Bluebird&quot; moved slowly out towards the middle of the lake, where she paused briefly as Campbell lined her up. With a deafening blast of power, Campbell now applied full throttle and &quot;Bluebird&quot; began to surge forward. Clouds of spray issued from the jet-pipe, water poured over the rear spar and after a few hundred yards, at , &quot;Bluebird&quot; unstuck from the surface and rocketed off towards the southern end of the lake, producing her characteristic comet&#x27;s tail of spray. She entered the measured kilometre at 8:46 am. Leo Villa witnessed her passing the first marker buoy at about in perfect steady planing trim, her nose slightly down, still accelerating. 7.525 seconds later, Keith Harrison saw her leave the measured kilometre at a speed of over .

The average speed for the first run was . Campbell lifted his foot from the throttle about 3/10 of a second before passing the southern kilometre marker. As &quot;Bluebird&quot; left the measured kilometre, Keith Harrison and Eric Shaw in a course boat at the southern end of the measured kilometre both noticed that she was very light around the bows, riding on her front stabilising fins. Her planing trim was no worse than she had exhibited when equipped with the Beryl engine, but it was markedly different from that observed by Leo Villa at the northern end of the kilometre, when she was under full acceleration. Campbell had made his usual commentary throughout the run.

Campbell&#x27;s words on his first run were, via radio intercom:
Instead of refuelling and waiting for the wash of this run to subside, Campbell decided to make the return run immediately. This was not an unprecedented diversion from normal practice, as Campbell had used the advantage presented; i.e., no encroachment of water disturbances on the measured kilometre by the quick turnaround in many previous runs. The second run was even faster once severe tramping subsided on the run-up from Peel Island (caused by the water-brake disturbance). Once smooth water was reached some or so from the start of the kilometre, K7 demonstrated cycles of ground effect hovering before accelerating hard at 0.63 g to a peak speed of some 200 metres or so from the southern marker buoy. &quot;Bluebird&quot; was now experiencing bouncing episodes of the starboard sponson with increasing ferocity.

At the peak speed, the most intense and long-lasting bounce precipitated a severe decelerating episode — to , -1.86g — as &quot;K7&quot; dropped back onto the water. Engine flame-out then occurred and, shorn of thrust nose-down momentum, K7 experienced a gliding episode in strong ground effect with increasing angle-of-attack, before completely leaving the water at her static stability pitch-up limit of 5.2°. &quot;Bluebird&quot; then executed an almost complete backflip (~ 320° and slightly off-axis) before plunging into the water (port sponson marginally in advance of the starboard), approximately 230 metres from the end of the measured kilometre. The boat then cartwheeled across the water before coming to rest. The impact killed Campbell instantly and broke &quot;K7&quot; forward of the air intakes (where Campbell was sitting), and the main hull sank shortly afterwards.

Mr Whoppit, Campbell&#x27;s teddy bear mascot, was found among the floating debris and the pilot&#x27;s helmet was recovered. Royal Navy divers made efforts to find and recover the body but, although the wreck of &quot;K7&quot; was found, they called off the search, after two weeks, without locating his body. Campbell&#x27;s body was finally located in 2001.

Campbell&#x27;s last words, during a 31-second transmission, on his final run were, via radio intercom:

The cause of the crash has been variously attributed to several possible causes (or a combination of these causes):
* Campbell did not wait to refuel after doing a first run of and hence the boat was lighter and travelled through the wash caused by his first run, a wash made much worse by the use of the water brake. These factors have since been found to be not particularly important: The water brake was used well to the south of the measured distance, and only from approx. . The area in the centre of the course where &quot;Bluebird&quot; was travelling at peak speed on her return run was flat calm, and not disturbed by the wash from the first run, which had not had time to be reflected back on the course. Campbell knew this and, as discussed previously, adopted his well-practised, &quot;quick turn-around&quot; strategy.
* &quot;Bluebird&quot; may have exceeded its aerodynamic static stability limit, complicated by the additional destabilising influences of loss of engine thrust. There is also evidence to point to the fact that K7&#x27;s dynamic stability limit had been exceeded. The cause(s) of the engine flame-out cannot be established unequivocally. It could have been due to fuel starvation, damage to some ancillary structural element associated with engine function (following the worst bouncing episode), disturbance of the airstream into the intakes during the pitching episodes, or indeed a combination of all three. Further evidence of lost engine thrust may be seen in both cinematographic and still film recordings of the latter part of the run — as &quot;Bluebird&quot; left the water, jet exhaust from a functioning engine would have severely disturbed the water surface; no such disturbance or accompanying spray is evident. Also, close examination of such records show no evidence to the effect that the water brake was deployed.
* Analysis of film footage suggests that &quot;Bluebird&quot; may have hit a duck during test runs, which may have affected the aerodynamic shape of the boat, making it harder to control at extreme speeds.

On 28 January 1967, Campbell was posthumously awarded the Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct &quot;for courage and determination in attacking the world water speed record.&quot;

==Recovery of &quot;Bluebird K7&quot; and Campbell&#x27;s body==
From 1996 to 2001, Bill Smith, an underwater surveyor and amateur diver, rediscovered the crash site and as a result of discussions with Gina Campbell, the daughter of Donald Campbell, and the wider Campbell family, a decision was taken to raise K7 to the surface. The wreckage of Campbell&#x27;s craft was recovered by a diving team led by Bill Smith in association with Gilgeous Diving Services (GDS Extreme Engineering, Liverpool) Lifting K7 was run with GDS Extreme Engineering under Smith&#x27;s team&#x27;s lead. The main section/hull first raised in March 2001 and later in May 2001, when Campbell&#x27;s body was recovered. The largest section, comprising approximately two-thirds of the centre hull, was raised on 8 March 2001. The project began when Smith was inspired to look for the wreck after hearing the Marillion song &quot;Out of This World&quot; (from the album &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot;), which was written about Campbell and &quot;Bluebird&quot;.

The remains of Campbell&#x27;s body were located just over two months later and recovered from the lake on 28 May 2001, still wearing his blue nylon overalls. On the night before his death, while playing cards he had drawn the queen and the ace of spades. Reflecting upon the fact that Mary, Queen of Scots had drawn the same two cards the night before she was beheaded, he told his mechanics, who were playing cards with him, that he had a fearful premonition that he was going to &quot;get the chop&quot;. It was not possible to determine the cause of Campbell&#x27;s death, though a consultant engineer giving evidence to the inquest said that the force of the impact could have caused him to be decapitated.

Campbell was buried in Coniston Cemetery on 12 September 2001 after his coffin was carried down the lake, and through the measured kilometre, on a launch, one last time. A funeral service was then held at St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Coniston, after an earlier, and positive DNA examination had been carried out. The funeral was attended by his widow, Tonia, daughter Gina, other members of his family, members of his former team and admirers. The funeral was overshadowed in the media by coverage of the 9/11 attacks in the United States.

Campbell&#x27;s sister, Jean Wales, had been against the recovery of her brother&#x27;s body out of respect for his stated wish that, in the event of something going wrong, &quot;Skipper and boat stay together&quot;.

When Campbell was buried in Coniston Cemetery on 12 September 2001 she did not attend the service. Steve Hogarth, lead singer for Marillion, was present at the funeral and performed the song &quot;Out of This World&quot; solo.

==Legacy==

Between them, Campbell and his father had set 11 speed records on water and 10 on land.

The story of Campbell&#x27;s last attempt at the water speed record on Coniston Water was told in the BBC television film &quot;Across the Lake&quot; in 1988, with Anthony Hopkins as Campbell. Nine years earlier, Robert Hardy had played Campbell&#x27;s father, Sir Malcolm Campbell, in the &quot;BBC2 Playhouse&quot; television drama &quot;Speed King&quot;; both were written by Roger Milner and produced by Innes Lloyd. In 2003, the BBC showed a documentary reconstruction of Campbell&#x27;s fateful water-speed record attempt in an episode of &quot;Days That Shook the World&quot;. It featured a mixture of modern reconstruction and original film footage. All of the original colour clips were taken from a film capturing the event, &quot;Campbell at Coniston&quot; by John Lomax, a local amateur filmmaker from Wallasey, England. Lomax&#x27;s film won awards worldwide in the late 1960s for recording the final weeks of Campbell&#x27;s life.

In 1956, Campbell was surprised by Eamonn Andrews for the seventh episode of the new television show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

An English Heritage blue plaque commemorates Campbell and his father at Canbury School, Kingston Hill, Kingston upon Thames, where they lived.

In the village of Coniston, the Ruskin Museum has a display of Campbell memorabilia, and the Bristol Orpheus engine recovered in 2001 is also displayed. The engine&#x27;s casing is mostly missing, having acted as a sacrificial anode in its time underwater, but the internals are preserved. Campbell&#x27;s helmet from the ill-fated run is also on display.

Campbell&#x27;s legendary BLUEBIRD K7 is now also on display at the Coniston Ruskin Museum.

<doc id="9165" wikidata="Q1513048" url="?curid=9165" title="Directed set">
<text>In mathematics, a directed set (or a directed preorder or a filtered set) is a nonempty set formula_1 together with a reflexive and transitive binary relation formula_2 (that is, a preorder), with the additional property that every pair of elements has an upper bound. In other words, for any formula_3 and formula_4 in formula_1 there must exist formula_6 in formula_1 with formula_8 and formula_9 A directed set&#x27;s preorder is called a direction.

The notion defined above is sometimes called an &#x27;. A &#x27; is defined analogously, meaning that every pair of elements is bounded below. 
Some authors (and this article) assume that a directed set is directed upward, unless otherwise stated. Other authors call a set directed if and only if it is directed both upward and downward.

Directed sets are a generalization of nonempty totally ordered sets. That is, all totally ordered sets are directed sets (contrast ordered sets, which need not be directed). Join-semilattices (which are partially ordered sets) are directed sets as well, but not conversely. Likewise, lattices are directed sets both upward and downward.

In topology, directed sets are used to define nets, which generalize sequences and unite the various notions of limit used in analysis. Directed sets also give rise to direct limits in abstract algebra and (more generally) category theory.

==Equivalent definition==

In addition to the definition above, there is an equivalent definition. A directed set is a set formula_1 with a preorder such that every finite subset of formula_1 has an upper bound. In this definition, the existence of an upper bound of the empty subset implies that formula_1 is nonempty.

==Examples==

The set of natural numbers formula_13 with the ordinary order formula_2 is one of the most important examples of a directed set. Every totally ordered set is a directed set, including formula_15 formula_16 formula_17 and formula_18

A (trivial) example of a partially ordered set that is directed is the set formula_19 in which the only order relations are formula_20 and formula_21 A less trivial example is like the following example of the &quot;reals directed towards formula_22&quot; but in which the ordering rule only applies to pairs of elements on the same side of formula_22 (that is, if one takes an element formula_3 to the left of formula_25 and formula_4 to its right, then formula_3 and formula_4 are not comparable, and the subset formula_29 has no upper bound).

===Product of directed sets===

Let formula_30 and formula_31 be directed sets. Then the Cartesian product set formula_32 can be made into a directed set by defining formula_33 if and only if formula_34 and formula_35 In analogy to the product order this is the product direction on the Cartesian product. For example, the set formula_36 of pairs of natural numbers can be made into a directed set by defining formula_37 if and only if formula_38 and formula_39

===Directed towards a point===

If formula_22 is a real number then the set formula_41 can be turned into a directed set by defining formula_42 if formula_43 (so &quot;greater&quot; elements are closer to formula_22). We then say that the reals have been directed towards formula_45 This is an example of a directed set that is partially ordered nor totally ordered. This is because antisymmetry breaks down for every pair formula_3 and formula_4 equidistant from formula_25 where formula_3 and formula_4 are on opposite sides of formula_45 Explicitly, this happens when formula_52 for some real formula_53 in which case formula_42 and formula_55 even though formula_56 Had this preorder been defined on formula_57 instead of formula_58 then it would still form a directed set but it would now have a (unique) greatest element, specifically formula_22; however, it still wouldn&#x27;t be partially ordered. This example can be generalized to a metric space formula_60 by defining on formula_61 or formula_62 the preorder formula_63 if and only if formula_64

===Maximal and greatest elements===

An element formula_65 of a preordered set formula_66 is a &quot;maximal element&quot; if for every formula_67 formula_68 implies formula_69
It is a &quot;greatest element&quot; if for every formula_67 formula_69

Any preordered set with a greatest element is a directed set with the same preorder. 
For instance, in a poset formula_72 every lower closure of an element; that is, every subset of the form formula_73 where formula_74 is a fixed element from formula_72 is directed.

Every maximal element of a directed preordered set is a greatest element. Indeed, a directed preordered set is characterized by equality of the (possibly empty) sets of maximal and of greatest elements.

===Subset inclusion===

The subset inclusion relation formula_76 along with its dual formula_77 define partial orders on any given family of sets. 
A non-empty family of sets is a directed set with respect to the partial order formula_78 (respectively, formula_79) if and only if the intersection (respectively, union) of any two of its members contains as a subset (respectively, is contained as a subset of) some third member. 
In symbols, a family formula_80 of sets is directed with respect to formula_78 (respectively, formula_79) if and only if 
:for all formula_83 there exists some formula_84 such that formula_85 and formula_86 (respectively, formula_87 and formula_88) 
or equivalently, 
:for all formula_83 there exists some formula_84 such that formula_91 (respectively, formula_92).

Many important examples of directed sets can be defined using these partial orders. 
For example, by definition, a  or is a non-empty family of sets that is a directed set with respect to the partial order formula_78 and that also does not contain the empty set (this condition prevents triviality because otherwise, the empty set would then be a greatest element with respect to formula_78). 
Every -system, which is a non-empty family of sets that is closed under the intersection of any two of its members, is a directed set with respect to formula_95 Every λ-system is a directed set with respect to formula_96 Every filter, topology, and σ-algebra is a directed set with respect to both formula_78 and formula_96

====Tails of nets====

By definition, a is a function from a directed set and a sequence is a function from the natural numbers formula_99 Every sequence canonically becomes a net by endowing formula_13 with formula_101

If formula_102 is any net from a directed set formula_66 then for any index formula_104 the set formula_105 is called the tail of formula_66 starting at formula_107 The family formula_108 of all tails is a directed set with respect to formula_109 in fact, it is even a prefilter.

====Neighborhoods====

If formula_110 is a topological space and formula_22 is a point in formula_112 the set of all neighbourhoods of formula_22 can be turned into a directed set by writing formula_114 if and only if formula_115 contains formula_116 For every formula_117 formula_118 and formula_119:
* formula_120 since formula_115 contains itself.
* if formula_114 and formula_123 then formula_124 and formula_125 which implies formula_126 Thus formula_127
* because formula_128 and since both formula_129 and formula_130 we have formula_131 and formula_132

====Finite subsets====

The set formula_133 of all finite subsets of a set formula_80 is directed with respect to formula_79 since given any two formula_136 their union formula_137 is an upper bound of formula_1 and formula_139 in formula_140 This particular directed set is used to define the sum formula_141 of a generalized series of an formula_80-indexed collection of numbers formula_143 (or more generally, the sum of elements in an abelian topological group, such as vectors in a topological vector space) as the limit of the net of partial sums formula_144 that is:
formula_145

===Logic===

Let formula_146 be a formal theory, which is a set of sentences with certain properties (details of which can be found in the article on the subject). For instance, formula_146 could be a first-order theory (like Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory) or a simpler zeroth-order theory. The preordered set formula_148 is a directed set because if formula_149 and if formula_150 denotes the sentence formed by logical conjunction formula_151 then formula_152 and formula_153 where formula_154 
If formula_155 is the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra associated with formula_146 then formula_157 is a partially ordered set that is also a directed set.

==Contrast with semilattices==
Directed set is a more general concept than (join) semilattice: every join semilattice is a directed set, as the join or least upper bound of two elements is the desired formula_158 The converse does not hold however, witness the directed set {1000,0001,1101,1011,1111} ordered bitwise (e.g. formula_159 holds, but formula_160 does not, since in the last bit 1 &gt; 0), where {1000,0001} has three upper bounds but no upper bound, cf. picture. (Also note that without 1111, the set is not directed.)

==Directed subsets==
The order relation in a directed set is not required to be antisymmetric, and therefore directed sets are not always partial orders. However, the term is also used frequently in the context of posets. In this setting, a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_162 is called a directed subset if it is a directed set according to the same partial order: in other words, it is not the empty set, and every pair of elements has an upper bound. Here the order relation on the elements of formula_1 is inherited from formula_164; for this reason, reflexivity and transitivity need not be required explicitly.

A directed subset of a poset is not required to be downward closed; a subset of a poset is directed if and only if its downward closure is an ideal. While the definition of a directed set is for an &quot;upward-directed&quot; set (every pair of elements has an upper bound), it is also possible to define a downward-directed set in which every pair of elements has a common lower bound. A subset of a poset is downward-directed if and only if its upper closure is a filter.

Directed subsets are used in domain theory, which studies directed-complete partial orders. These are posets in which every upward-directed set is required to have a least upper bound. In this context, directed subsets again provide a generalization of convergent sequences.

<text>Edward Bellamy (March 26, 1850 – May 22, 1898) was an American author, journalist, and political activist most famous for his utopian novel &quot;Looking Backward&quot;. Bellamy&#x27;s vision of a harmonious future world inspired the formation of numerous &quot;Nationalist Clubs&quot; dedicated to the propagation of his political ideas.

After working as a journalist and writing several novels, Bellamy published &quot;Looking Backward&quot; in 1888. It was the third best-selling novel of the 19th century in the United States, and it especially appealed to a generation of intellectuals alienated from the alleged dark side of the Gilded Age. In the early 1890s, Bellamy established a newspaper known as &quot;The New Nation&quot; and began to promote united action between the various Nationalist Clubs and the emerging Populist Party. He published &quot;Equality&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, in 1897, and died the following year.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Edward Bellamy was born in Chicopee, Massachusetts. His father was Rufus King Bellamy (1816–1886), a Baptist minister and a descendant of Joseph Bellamy. His mother, Maria Louisa Putnam Bellamy, was a Calvinist. She was the daughter of a Baptist minister named Benjamin Putnam, who was forced to withdraw from the ministry in Salem, Massachusetts, following objections to his becoming a Freemason.

Bellamy attended public school at Chicopee Falls before leaving for Union College of Schenectady, New York, where he studied for just two semesters. Upon leaving school, he made his way to Europe for a year, spending extensive time in Germany. He briefly studied law but abandoned that field without ever having practiced as a lawyer, instead entering the world of journalism. In this capacity Bellamy briefly served on the staff of the &quot;New York Post&quot; before returning to his native Massachusetts to take a position at the &quot;Springfield Union&quot;.

At the age of 25, Bellamy developed tuberculosis, the disease that would ultimately kill him. He suffered with its effects throughout his adult life. In an effort to regain his health, Bellamy spent a year in the Hawaiian Islands (1877 to 1878). Returning to the United States, he decided to abandon the daily grind of journalism in favor of literary work, which put fewer demands upon his time and his health.

Bellamy married Emma Augusta Sanderson in 1882. The couple had two children.

===Literary career===

Bellamy&#x27;s early novels, including &quot;Six to One&quot; (1878), &quot;Dr. Heidenhoff&#x27;s Process&quot; (1880), and &quot;Miss Ludington&#x27;s Sister&quot; (1885), were unremarkable works, making use of standard psychological plots.

A turn to utopian science fiction with &quot;Looking Backward, 2000–1887,&quot; published in January 1888, captured the public imagination and catapulted Bellamy to literary fame. Its publisher could scarcely keep up with demand. Within a year it had sold some 200,000 copies, and by the end of the 19th century had sold more copies than any other book published in America up to that time except for &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; by Harriet Beecher Stowe and &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot; by Lew Wallace. The book gained an extensive readership in the United Kingdom as well, more than 235,000 copies being sold there between 1890 and 1935.

In &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, a non-violent revolution had transformed the American economy and thereby society; private property had been abolished in favor of state ownership of capital and the elimination of social classes and the ills of society that he thought inevitably followed from them. In the new world of the year 2000, there was no longer war, poverty, crime, prostitution, corruption, money, or taxes. Neither did there exist such occupations seen by Bellamy as of dubious worth to society, such as politicians, lawyers, merchants, or soldiers. Instead, Bellamy&#x27;s utopian society of the future was based upon the voluntary employment of all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45, after which time all would retire. Work was simple, aided by machine production, working hours short and vacation time long. The new economic basis of society effectively remade human nature itself in Bellamy&#x27;s idyllic vision, with greed, maliciousness, untruthfulness, and insanity all relegated to the past.

==Bellamyite movement==

Bellamy&#x27;s book inspired legions of readers to establish so-called Nationalist Clubs, beginning in Boston late in 1888. His vision of a country relieved of its social ills through abandonment of the principle of competition and establishment of state ownership of industry proved an appealing panacea to a generation of intellectuals alienated from the dark side of Gilded Age America. By 1891 it was reported that no fewer than 162 Nationalist Clubs were in existence.

Bellamy&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Nationalism&quot; rather than &quot;socialism&quot; as a descriptor of his governmental vision was calculated, as he did not want to limit either sales of his novel or the potential influence of its political ideas. In an 1888 letter to literary critic William Dean Howells, Bellamy wrote:

Bellamy himself came to actively participate in the political movement which emerged around his book, particularly after 1891 when he founded his own magazine, &quot;The New Nation,&quot; and began to promote united action between the various Nationalist Clubs and the emerging People&#x27;s Party. For the next three and a half years, Bellamy gave his all to politics, publishing his magazine, working to influence the platform of the People&#x27;s Party, and publicizing the Nationalist movement in the popular press. This phase of his life came to an end in 1894, when &quot;The New Nation&quot; was forced to suspend publication owing to financial difficulties.

With the key activists of the Nationalist Clubs largely absorbed into the apparatus of the People&#x27;s Party (although a Nationalist Party did run three candidates for office in Wisconsin as late as 1896), Bellamy abandoned politics for a return to literature. He set to work on a sequel to &quot;Looking Backward&quot; titled &quot;Equality,&quot; attempting to deal with the ideal society of the post-revolutionary future in greater detail. In this final work, he addressed the question of feminism, dealing with the taboo subject of female reproductive rights in a future, post-revolutionary America. Other subjects overlooked in &quot;Looking Backward,&quot; such as animal rights and wilderness preservation, were dealt with in a similar context. The book saw print in 1897 and would prove to be Bellamy&#x27;s final creation.

Several short stories of Bellamy&#x27;s were published in 1898, and &quot;The Duke of Stockbridge; a Romance of Shays&#x27; Rebellion&quot; was published in 1900.

===Death and legacy===

Edward Bellamy died of tuberculosis in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts ten years after the publication of his most famous book. He was 48 years old.

His lifelong home in Chicopee Falls, built by his father, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971.

Bellamy was the cousin of Francis Bellamy, famous for writing the original version of the Pledge of Allegiance.

Bellamy Road, a residential road in Toronto, is named for the author.

<text>E, or e, is the fifth letter and the second vowel letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is &quot;e&quot; (pronounced ); plural &quot;es&quot;, &quot;Es&quot;, or &quot;E&#x27;s&quot;.

It is the most commonly used letter in many languages, including Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Latin, Latvian, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.

==Name==
In English, the name of the letter is the &quot;long E&quot; sound, pronounced . In most other languages, its name matches the letter&#x27;s pronunciation in open syllables.
==History==
The Latin letter &#x27;E&#x27; differs little from its source, the Greek letter epsilon, &#x27;Ε&#x27;. This in turn comes from the Semitic letter &quot;hê&quot;, which has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (&quot;hillul&quot;, &#x27;jubilation&#x27;), and was most likely based on a similar Egyptian hieroglyph that indicated a different pronunciation.

In Semitic, the letter represented (and in foreign words); in Greek, &quot;hê&quot; became the letter epsilon, used to represent . The various forms of the Old Italic script and the Latin alphabet followed this usage.

==Use in writing systems==
===English===
Although Middle English spelling used to represent long and short , the Great Vowel Shift changed long (as in &quot;me&quot; or &quot;bee&quot;) to while short (as in &quot;met&quot; or &quot;bed&quot;) remained a mid vowel. In unstressed syllables, this letter is usually pronounced either as or . In other cases, the letter is silent, generally at the end of words like &quot;queue&quot;.

===Other languages===
In the orthography of many languages, it represents either , , , or some variation (such as a nasalized version) of these sounds, often with diacritics (as: ) to indicate contrasts. Less commonly, as in French, German, or Saanich, represents a mid-central vowel . Digraphs with are common to indicate either diphthongs or monophthongs, such as or for or in English, for in German, and for in French or in German.

===Other systems===
The International Phonetic Alphabet uses for the close-mid front unrounded vowel or the mid front unrounded vowel.

===Frequency===
E is the most common (or highest-frequency) letter in the English language alphabet and several other European languages, which has implications in both cryptography and data compression. This makes it a harder letter to use when writing lipograms.

==Other uses==
* In the hexadecimal (base 16) numbering system, &quot;E&quot; corresponds to the number 14 in decimal (base 10) counting.
* &quot;e&quot; is also commonly used to denote Euler&#x27;s number.

<text>Economics () is a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.

Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. Microeconomics analyses what is viewed as basic elements within economies, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyses economies as systems where production, distribution, consumption, savings, and investment expenditure interact; and the factors of production affecting them, such as: labour, capital, land, and enterprise, inflation, economic growth, and public policies that impact these elements. It also seeks to analyse and describe the global economy.

Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing &quot;what is&quot;, and normative economics, advocating &quot;what ought to be&quot;; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics.

Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, including business, finance, cybersecurity, health care, engineering and government. It is also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, feminism, law, philosophy, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, and the environment.

== Definitions of economics ==
The earlier term for the discipline was &quot;political economy&quot;, but since the late 19th century, it has commonly been called &quot;economics&quot;. The term is ultimately derived from Ancient Greek (&quot;oikonomia&quot;) which is a term for the &quot;way (nomos) to run a household (oikos)&quot;, or in other words the know-how of an (&quot;oikonomikos&quot;), or &quot;household or homestead manager&quot;. Derived terms such as &quot;economy&quot; can therefore often mean &quot;frugal&quot; or &quot;thrifty&quot;. By extension then, &quot;political economy&quot; was the way to manage a polis or state.

There are a variety of modern definitions of economics; some reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists. Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1776) defined what was then called political economy as &quot;an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations&quot;, in particular as:

Jean-Baptiste Say (1803), distinguishing the subject matter from its public-policy uses, defined it as the science &quot;of&quot; production, distribution, and consumption of wealth. On the satirical side, Thomas Carlyle (1849) coined &quot;the dismal science&quot; as an epithet for classical economics, in this context, commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of Malthus (1798). John Stuart Mill (1844) delimited the subject matter further:

Alfred Marshall provided a still widely cited definition in his textbook &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; (1890) that extended analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level:

Lionel Robbins (1932) developed implications of what has been termed &quot;[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject&quot;:

Robbins described the definition as not &quot;classificatory&quot; in &quot;pick[ing] out certain &quot;kinds&quot; of behaviour&quot; but rather &quot;analytical&quot; in &quot;focus[ing] attention on a particular &quot;aspect&quot; of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity.&quot; He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the analysis of wealth: how wealth is created (production), distributed, and consumed; and how wealth can grow. But he said that economics can be used to study other things, such as war, that are outside its usual focus. This is because war has as the goal winning it (as a sought-after &quot;end&quot;), generates both cost and benefits; and, &quot;resources&quot; (human life and other costs) are used to attain the goal. If the war is not winnable or if the expected costs outweigh the benefits, the deciding &quot;actors&quot; (assuming they are rational) may never go to war (a &quot;decision&quot;) but rather explore other alternatives. Economics cannot be defined as the science that studies wealth, war, crime, education, and any other field economic analysis can be applied to; but, as the science that studies a particular common aspect of each of those subjects (they all use scarce resources to attain a sought-after end).

Some subsequent comments criticised the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets. From the 1960s, however, such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behaviour and rational-choice modelling expanded the domain of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields. There are other criticisms as well, such as in scarcity not accounting for the macroeconomics of high unemployment.

Gary Becker, a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas, described the approach he favoured as &quot;combin[ing the] assumptions of maximizing behaviour, stable preferences, and market equilibrium, used relentlessly and unflinchingly.&quot; One commentary characterises the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the &quot;choice process and the type of social interaction that [such] analysis involves.&quot; The same source reviews a range of definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subject-matter that the texts treat. Among economists more generally, it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving, or should evolve.

Many economists including nobel prize winners James M. Buchanan and Ronald Coase reject the method-based definition of Robbins and continue to prefer definitions like those of Say, in terms of its subject matter. Ha-Joon Chang has for example argued that the definition of Robbins would make economics very peculiar because all other sciences define themselves in terms of the area of inquiry or object of inquiry rather than the methodology. In the biology department, it is not said that all biology should be studied with DNA analysis. People study living organisms in many different ways, so some people will perform DNA analysis, others might analyse anatomy, and still others might build game theoretic models of animal behaviour. But they are all called biology because they all study living organisms. According to Ha Joon Chang, this view that the economy can and should be studied in only one way (for example by studying only rational choices), and going even one step further and basically redefining economics as a theory of everything, is peculiar.

== History of economic thought ==

=== From antiquity through the physiocrats ===

Questions regarding distribution of resources are found throughout the writings of the Boeotian poet Hesiod and several economic historians have described Hesiod as the &quot;first economist&quot;. However, the word Oikos, the Greek word from which the word economy derives, was used for issues regarding how to manage a household (which was understood to be the landowner, his family, and his slaves) rather than to refer to some normative societal system of distribution of resources, which is a more recent phenomenon. Xenophon, the author of the Oeconomicus, is credited by philologues for being the source of the word economy. Joseph Schumpeter described 16th and 17th century scholastic writers, including Tomás de Mercado, Luis de Molina, and Juan de Lugo, as &quot;coming nearer than any other group to being the &#x27;founders&#x27; of scientific economics&quot; as to monetary, interest, and value theory within a natural-law perspective.

Two groups, who later were called &quot;mercantilists&quot; and &quot;physiocrats&quot;, more directly influenced the subsequent development of the subject. Both groups were associated with the rise of economic nationalism and modern capitalism in Europe. Mercantilism was an economic doctrine that flourished from the 16th to 18th century in a prolific pamphlet literature, whether of merchants or statesmen. It held that a nation&#x27;s wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver. The doctrine called for importing inexpensive raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods, which could be exported, and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies.

Physiocrats, a group of 18th-century French thinkers and writers, developed the idea of the economy as a circular flow of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, which called for minimal government intervention in the economy.

Adam Smith (1723–1790) was an early economic theorist. Smith was harshly critical of the mercantilists but described the physiocratic system &quot;with all its imperfections&quot; as &quot;perhaps the purest approximation to the truth that has yet been published&quot; on the subject.

=== Classical political economy ===
The publication of Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; in 1776, has been described as &quot;the effective birth of economics as a separate discipline.&quot; The book identified land, labour, and capital as the three factors of production and the major contributors to a nation&#x27;s wealth, as distinct from the physiocratic idea that only agriculture was productive.

Smith discusses potential benefits of specialisation by division of labour, including increased labour productivity and gains from trade, whether between town and country or across countries. His &quot;theorem&quot; that &quot;the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market&quot; has been described as the &quot;core of a theory of the functions of firm and industry&quot; and a &quot;fundamental principle of economic organization.&quot; To Smith has also been ascribed &quot;the most important substantive proposition in all of economics&quot; and foundation of resource-allocation theory—that, under competition, resource owners (of labour, land, and capital) seek their most profitable uses, resulting in an equal rate of return for all uses in equilibrium (adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training and unemployment).

In an argument that includes &quot;one of the most famous passages in all economics,&quot; Smith represents every individual as trying to employ any capital they might command for their own advantage, not that of the society, and for the sake of profit, which is necessary at some level for employing capital in domestic industry, and positively related to the value of produce. In this:

The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus (1798) used the concept of diminishing returns to explain low living standards. Human population, he argued, tended to increase geometrically, outstripping the production of food, which increased arithmetically. The force of a rapidly growing population against a limited amount of land meant diminishing returns to labour. The result, he claimed, was chronically low wages, which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level. Economist Julian Simon has criticised Malthus&#x27;s conclusions.

While Adam Smith emphasised production and income, David Ricardo (1817) focused on the distribution of income among landowners, workers, and capitalists. Ricardo saw an inherent conflict between landowners on the one hand and labour and capital on the other. He posited that the growth of population and capital, pressing against a fixed supply of land, pushes up rents and holds down wages and profits. Ricardo was also the first to state and prove the principle of comparative advantage, according to which each country should specialise in producing and exporting goods in that it has a lower &quot;relative&quot; cost of production, rather relying only on its own production. It has been termed a &quot;fundamental analytical explanation&quot; for gains from trade.

Coming at the end of the classical tradition, John Stuart Mill (1848) parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system. Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the market&#x27;s two roles: allocation of resources and distribution of income. The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene.

Value theory was important in classical theory. Smith wrote that the &quot;real price of every thing ... is the toil and trouble of acquiring it&quot;. Smith maintained that, with rent and profit, other costs besides wages also enter the price of a commodity. Other classical economists presented variations on Smith, termed the &#x27;labour theory of value&#x27;. Classical economics focused on the tendency of any market economy to settle in a final stationary state made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size.

=== Marxian economics ===
Marxist (later, Marxian) economics descends from classical economics and it derives from the work of Karl Marx. The first volume of Marx&#x27;s major work, , was published in 1867. Marx focused on the labour theory of value and theory of surplus value. Marx wrote that they were mechanisms used by capital to exploit labour. The labour theory of value held that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production, and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how workers were only paid a proportion of the value their work had created.

Marxian economics was further developed by Karl Kautsky (1854–1938)&#x27;s &quot;The Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx&quot; and &quot;The Class Struggle (Erfurt Program)&quot;, Rudolf Hilferding&#x27;s (1877–1941) &quot;Finance Capital&quot;, Vladimir Lenin (1870–1924)&#x27;s &quot;The Development of Capitalism in Russia&quot; and &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot;, and Rosa Luxemburg (1871–1919)&#x27;s &quot;The Accumulation of Capital&quot;.

=== Neoclassical economics ===
At its inception as a social science, &quot;economics&quot; was defined and discussed at length as the study of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth by Jean-Baptiste Say in his &quot;Treatise on Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth&quot; (1803). These three items were considered only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution. Say&#x27;s definition has survived in part up to the present, modified by substituting the word &quot;wealth&quot; for &quot;goods and services&quot; meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, Lionel Robbins noticed that this definition no longer sufficed, because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his &quot;Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science&quot;, he proposed a definition of economics as a study of human behaviour, subject to and constrained by scarcity, which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economise (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). According to Robbins: &quot;Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses&quot;. Robbins&#x27; definition eventually became widely accepted by mainstream economists, and found its way into current textbooks. Although far from unanimous, most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins&#x27; definition, even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics, emanating from that definition.

A body of theory later termed &quot;neoclassical economics&quot; formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term &quot;economics&quot; was popularised by such neoclassical economists as Alfred Marshall and Mary Paley Marshall as a concise synonym for &quot;economic science&quot; and a substitute for the earlier &quot;political economy&quot;. This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences.

Neoclassical economics systematically integrated supply and demand as joint determinants of both price and quantity in market equilibrium, influencing the allocation of output and income distribution. It rejected the classical economics&#x27; labour theory of value in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more comprehensive theory of costs on the supply side. In the 20th century, neoclassical theorists departed from an earlier idea that suggested measuring total utility for a society, opting instead for ordinal utility, which posits behaviour-based relations across individuals.

In microeconomics, neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping decision making. An immediate example of this is the consumer theory of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded. In macroeconomics it is reflected in an early and lasting neoclassical synthesis with Keynesian macroeconomics.

Neoclassical economics is occasionally referred as &quot;orthodox economics&quot; whether by its critics or sympathisers. Modern mainstream economics builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalise earlier analysis, such as econometrics, game theory, analysis of market failure and imperfect competition, and the neoclassical model of economic growth for analysing long-run variables affecting national income.

Neoclassical economics studies the behaviour of individuals, households, and organisations (called economic actors, players, or agents), when they manage or use scarce resources, which have alternative uses, to achieve desired ends. Agents are assumed to act rationally, have multiple desirable ends in sight, limited resources to obtain these ends, a set of stable preferences, a definite overall guiding objective, and the capability of making a choice. There exists an economic problem, subject to study by economic science, when a decision (choice) is made by one or more players to attain the best possible outcome.

=== Keynesian economics ===
Keynesian economics derives from John Maynard Keynes, in particular his book &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; (1936), which ushered in contemporary macroeconomics as a distinct field. The book focused on determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible. Keynes attempted to explain in broad theoretical detail why high labour-market unemployment might not be self-correcting due to low &quot;effective demand&quot; and why even price flexibility and monetary policy might be unavailing. The term &quot;revolutionary&quot; has been applied to the book in its impact on economic analysis.

During the following decades, many economists followed Keynes&#x27; ideas and expanded on his works. John Hicks and Alvin Hansen developed the IS–LM model which was a simple formalisation of some of Keynes&#x27; insights on the economy&#x27;s short-run equilibrium. Franco Modigliani and James Tobin developed important theories of private consumption and investment, respectively, two major components of aggregate demand. Lawrence Klein built the first large-scale macroeconometric model, applying the Keynesian thinking systematically to the US economy.

=== Post-WWII economics ===

Immediately after World War II, Keynesian was the dominant economic view of the United States establishment and its allies, Marxian economics was the dominant economic view of the Soviet Union nomenklatura and its allies.

==== Monetarism ====
Monetarism appeared in the 1950s and 1960s, its intellectual leader being Milton Friedman. Monetarists contended that monetary policy and other monetary shocks, as represented by the growth in the money stock, was an important cause of economic fluctuations, and consequently that monetary policy was more important than fiscal policy for purposes of stabilisation. Friedman was also skeptical about the ability of central banks to conduct a sensible active monetary policy in practice, advocating instead using simple rules such as a steady rate of money growth.

Monetarism rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, when several major central banks followed a monetarist-inspired policy, but was later abandoned because the results were unsatisfactory.

==== New classical economics ====
A more fundamental challenge to the prevailing Keynesian paradigm came in the 1970s from new classical economists like Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent and Edward Prescott. They introduced the notion of rational expectations in economics, which had profound implications for many economic discussions, among which were the so-called Lucas critique and the presentation of real business cycle models.

==== New Keynesians ====
During the 1980s, a group of researchers appeared being called New Keynesian economists, including among others George Akerlof, Janet Yellen, Gregory Mankiw and Olivier Blanchard. They adopted the principle of rational expectations and other monetarist or new classical ideas such as building upon models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour, but simultaneously emphasised the importance of various market failures for the functioning of the economy, as had Keynes. Not least, they proposed various reasons that potentially explained the empirically observed features of price and wage rigidity, usually made to be endogenous features of the models, rather than simply assumed as in older Keynesian-style ones.

====New neoclassical synthesis====
After decades of often heated discussions between Keynesians, monetarists, new classical and new Keynesian economists, a synthesis emerged by the 2000s, often given the name &quot;the new neoclassical synthesis&quot;. It integrated the rational expectations and optimizing framework of the new classical theory with a new Keynesian role for nominal rigidities and other market imperfections like imperfect information in goods, labour and credit markets. The monetarist importance of monetary policy in stabilizing the economy and in particular controlling inflation was recognised as well as the traditional Keynesian insistence that fiscal policy could also play an influential role in affecting aggregate demand. Methodologically, the synthesis led to a new class of applied models, known as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium or DSGE models, descending from real business cycles models, but extended with several new Keynesian and other features. These models proved useful and influential in the design of modern monetary policy and are now standard workhorses in most central banks.

==== After the financial crisis ====

After the 2007–2008 financial crisis, macroeconomic research has put greater emphasis on understanding and integrating the financial system into models of the general economy and shedding light on the ways in which problems in the financial sector can turn into major macroeconomic recessions. In this and other research branches, inspiration from behavioural economics has started playing a more important role in mainstream economic theory. Also, heterogeneity among the economic agents, e.g. differences in income, plays an increasing role in recent economic research.

=== Other schools and approaches ===
Other schools or trends of thought referring to a particular style of economics practised at and disseminated from well-defined groups of academicians that have become known worldwide, include the Freiburg School, the School of Lausanne, the Stockholm school and the Chicago school of economics. During the 1970s and 1980s mainstream economics was sometimes separated into the Saltwater approach of those universities along the Eastern and Western coasts of the US, and the Freshwater, or Chicago school approach.

Within macroeconomics there is, in general order of their historical appearance in the literature; classical economics, neoclassical economics, Keynesian economics, the neoclassical synthesis, monetarism, new classical economics, New Keynesian economics and the new neoclassical synthesis.

Beside the mainstream development of economic thought, various alternative or heterodox economic theories have evolved over time, positioning themselves in contrast to mainstream theory. These include:
* Austrian School, emphasizing human action, property rights and the freedom to contract and transact to have a thriving and successful economy. It also emphasises that the state should play as small role as possible (if any role) in the regulation of economic activity between two transacting parties. Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises are the two most prominent representatives of the Austrian school.
* Post-Keynesian economics concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes. It is generally associated with the University of Cambridge and the work of Joan Robinson.
* Ecological economics like environmental economics studies the interactions between human economies and the ecosystems in which they are embedded, but in contrast to environmental economics takes an oppositional position towards general mainstream economic principles. A major difference between the two subdisciplines is their assumptions about the substitution possibilities between human-made and natural capital.

Additionally, alternative developments include Marxian economics, constitutional economics, institutional economics, evolutionary economics, dependency theory, structuralist economics, world systems theory, econophysics, econodynamics, feminist economics and biophysical economics.

Feminist economics emphasises the role that gender plays in economies, challenging analyses that render gender invisible or support gender-oppressive economic systems. The goal is to create economic research and policy analysis that is inclusive and gender-aware to encourage gender equality and improve the well-being of marginalised groups.

== Methodology ==
=== Theoretical research ===
Mainstream economic theory relies upon analytical economic models. When creating theories, the objective is to find assumptions which are at least as simple in information requirements, more precise in predictions, and more fruitful in generating additional research than prior theories. While neoclassical economic theory constitutes both the dominant or orthodox theoretical as well as methodological framework, economic theory can also take the form of other schools of thought such as in heterodox economic theories.

In microeconomics, principal concepts include supply and demand, marginalism, rational choice theory, opportunity cost, budget constraints, utility, and the theory of the firm. Early macroeconomic models focused on modelling the relationships between aggregate variables, but as the relationships appeared to change over time macroeconomists, including new Keynesians, reformulated their models with microfoundations, in which microeconomic concepts play a major part.

Sometimes an economic hypothesis is only &quot;qualitative&quot;, not &quot;quantitative&quot;.

Expositions of economic reasoning often use two-dimensional graphs to illustrate theoretical relationships. At a higher level of generality, mathematical economics is the application of mathematical methods to represent theories and analyse problems in economics. Paul Samuelson&#x27;s treatise &quot;Foundations of Economic Analysis&quot; (1947) exemplifies the method, particularly as to maximizing behavioural relations of agents reaching equilibrium. The book focused on examining the class of statements called &quot;operationally meaningful theorems&quot; in economics, which are theorems that can conceivably be refuted by empirical data.

=== Empirical research ===

Economic theories are frequently tested empirically, largely through the use of econometrics using economic data. The controlled experiments common to the physical sciences are difficult and uncommon in economics, and instead broad data is observationally studied; this type of testing is typically regarded as less rigorous than controlled experimentation, and the conclusions typically more tentative. However, the field of experimental economics is growing, and increasing use is being made of natural experiments.

Statistical methods such as regression analysis are common. Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size, economic significance, and statistical significance (&quot;signal strength&quot;) of the hypothesised relation(s) and to adjust for noise from other variables. By such means, a hypothesis may gain acceptance, although in a probabilistic, rather than certain, sense. Acceptance is dependent upon the falsifiable hypothesis surviving tests. Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question, given different tests, data sets, and prior beliefs.

Experimental economics has promoted the use of scientifically controlled experiments. This has reduced the long-noted distinction of economics from natural sciences because it allows direct tests of what were previously taken as axioms. In some cases these have found that the axioms are not entirely correct.

In behavioural economics, psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 for his and Amos Tversky&#x27;s empirical discovery of several cognitive biases and heuristics. Similar empirical testing occurs in neuroeconomics. Another example is the assumption of narrowly selfish preferences versus a model that tests for selfish, altruistic, and cooperative preferences. These techniques have led some to argue that economics is a &quot;genuine science&quot;.

== Microeconomics ==

Microeconomics examines how entities, forming a market structure, interact within a market to create a market system. These entities include private and public players with various classifications, typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and regulation. The item traded may be a tangible product such as apples or a service such as repair services, legal counsel, or entertainment.

Various market structures exist. In perfectly competitive markets, no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product. In other words, every participant is a &quot;price taker&quot; as no participant influences the price of a product. In the real world, markets often experience imperfect competition.

Forms of imperfect competition include monopoly (in which there is only one seller of a good), duopoly (in which there are only two sellers of a good), oligopoly (in which there are few sellers of a good), monopolistic competition (in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), monopsony (in which there is only one buyer of a good), and oligopsony (in which there are few buyers of a good). Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be &quot;price makers&quot;, which means that they can influence the prices of their products.

In partial equilibrium method of analysis, it is assumed that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets. This method aggregates (the sum of all activity) in only one market. General-equilibrium theory studies various markets and their behaviour. It aggregates (the sum of all activity) across &quot;all&quot; markets. This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium.

=== Production, cost, and efficiency ===
In microeconomics, production is the conversion of inputs into outputs. It is an economic process that uses inputs to create a commodity or a service for exchange or direct use. Production is a flow and thus a rate of output per period of time. Distinctions include such production alternatives as for consumption (food, haircuts, etc.) vs. investment goods (new tractors, buildings, roads, etc.), public goods (national defence, smallpox vaccinations, etc.) or private goods, and &quot;guns&quot; vs &quot;butter&quot;.

Inputs used in the production process include such primary factors of production as labour services, capital (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and land (including natural resources). Other inputs may include intermediate goods used in production of final goods, such as the steel in a new car.

Economic efficiency measures how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available technology. Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs. A widely accepted general standard is Pareto efficiency, which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off.

The production–possibility frontier (PPF) is an expository figure for representing scarcity, cost, and efficiency. In the simplest case, an economy can produce just two goods (say &quot;guns&quot; and &quot;butter&quot;). The PPF is a table or graph (as at the right) that shows the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs, which limit feasible total output. Each point on the curve shows potential total output for the economy, which is the maximum feasible output of one good, given a feasible output quantity of the other good.

Scarcity is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume &quot;beyond the PPF&quot; (such as at &quot;X&quot;) and by the negative slope of the curve. If production of one good &quot;increases&quot; along the curve, production of the other good &quot;decreases&quot;, an inverse relationship. This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good, decreasing the latter.

The slope of the curve at a point on it gives the trade-off between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, an example of a &quot;real opportunity cost&quot;. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. &quot;Along the PPF&quot;, scarcity implies that choosing &quot;more&quot; of one good in the aggregate entails doing with &quot;less&quot; of the other good. Still, in a market economy, movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.

By construction, each point on the curve shows &quot;productive efficiency&quot; in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point &quot;inside&quot; the curve (as at &quot;A&quot;), is feasible but represents &quot;production inefficiency&quot; (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of &quot;one or both goods&quot; could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high unemployment during a business-cycle recession or economic organisation of a country that discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy allocative efficiency (also called Pareto efficiency) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points.

Much applied economics in public policy is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved. Recognizing the reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organise society for the most efficient use of resources has been described as the &quot;essence of economics&quot;, where the subject &quot;makes its unique contribution.&quot;

=== Specialisation ===
Specialisation is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and empirical considerations. Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production, say from differences in stocks of human capital per worker or capital/labour ratios. According to theory, this may give a comparative advantage in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant, thus &quot;relatively&quot; cheaper, input.

Even if one region has an absolute advantage as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output, it may still specialise in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else.

It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs, including high-income countries. This has led to investigation of economies of scale and agglomeration to explain specialisation in similar but differentiated product lines, to the overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions.

The general theory of specialisation applies to trade among individuals, farms, manufacturers, service providers, and economies. Among each of these production systems, there may be a corresponding &quot;division of labour&quot; with different work groups specializing, or correspondingly different types of capital equipment and differentiated land uses.

An example that combines features above is a country that specialises in the production of high-tech knowledge products, as developed countries do, and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful, resulting in different in opportunity costs of production. More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own high-tech and low-tech products.

Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market prices of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage, so that (relatively) low-cost inputs go to producing low-cost outputs. In the process, aggregate output may increase as a by-product or by design. Such specialisation of production creates opportunities for gains from trade whereby resource owners benefit from trade in the sale of one type of output for other, more highly valued goods. A measure of gains from trade is the &quot;increased income levels&quot; that trade may facilitate.

=== Supply and demand ===
Prices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy. The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In microeconomics, it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition, which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power.

For a given market of a commodity, &quot;demand&quot; is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). Demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is &quot;constrained utility maximisation&quot; (with income and wealth as the constraints on demand). Here, utility refers to the hypothesised relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred.

The law of demand states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things unchanged). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the substitution effect). In addition, purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy (the income effect). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.

&quot;Supply&quot; is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesised to be &quot;profit maximisers&quot;, meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.

That is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The &quot;Law of Supply&quot; states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply.

Market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilise at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.

=== Firms ===
People frequently do not trade directly on markets. Instead, on the supply side, they may work in and produce through &quot;firms&quot;. The most obvious kinds of firms are corporations, partnerships and trusts. According to Ronald Coase, people begin to organise their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market. Firms combine labour and capital, and can achieve far greater economies of scale (when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced) than individual market trading.

In perfectly competitive markets studied in the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. Industrial organisation generalises from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price. It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions. Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition, various forms of oligopoly, and monopoly.

Managerial economics applies microeconomic analysis to specific decisions in business firms or other management units. It draws heavily from quantitative methods such as operations research and programming and from statistical methods such as regression analysis in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge. A unifying theme is the attempt to optimise business decisions, including unit-cost minimisation and profit maximisation, given the firm&#x27;s objectives and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions.

=== Uncertainty and game theory ===
Uncertainty in economics is an unknown prospect of gain or loss, whether quantifiable as risk or not. Without it, household behaviour would be unaffected by uncertain employment and income prospects, financial and capital markets would reduce to exchange of a single instrument in each market period, and there would be no communications industry. Given its different forms, there are various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents&#x27; responses to it.

Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that considers strategic interactions between agents, one kind of uncertainty. It provides a mathematical foundation of industrial organisation, discussed above, to model different types of firm behaviour, for example in a solipsistic industry (few sellers), but equally applicable to wage negotiations, bargaining, contract design, and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other. In behavioural economics, it has been used to model the strategies agents choose when interacting with others whose interests are at least partially adverse to their own.

In this, it generalises maximisation approaches developed to analyse market actors such as in the supply and demand model and allows for incomplete information of actors. The field dates from the 1944 classic &quot;Theory of Games and Economic Behavior&quot; by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern. It has significant applications seemingly outside of economics in such diverse subjects as the formulation of nuclear strategies, ethics, political science, and evolutionary biology.

Risk aversion may stimulate activity that in well-functioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk, as in markets for insurance, commodity futures contracts, and financial instruments. Financial economics or simply finance describes the allocation of financial resources. It also analyses the pricing of financial instruments, the financial structure of companies, the efficiency and fragility of financial markets, financial crises, and related government policy or regulation.

Some market organisations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty. Based on George Akerlof&#x27;s &quot;Market for Lemons&quot; article, the paradigm example is of a dodgy second-hand car market. Customers without knowledge of whether a car is a &quot;lemon&quot; depress its price below what a quality second-hand car would be. Information asymmetry arises here, if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it. Related problems in insurance are adverse selection, such that those at most risk are most likely to insure (say reckless drivers), and moral hazard, such that insurance results in riskier behaviour (say more reckless driving).

Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency by driving otherwise willing transactors from the market (&quot;incomplete markets&quot;). Moreover, attempting to reduce one problem, say adverse selection by mandating insurance, may add to another, say moral hazard. Information economics, which studies such problems, has relevance in subjects such as insurance, contract law, mechanism design, monetary economics, and health care. Applied subjects include market and legal remedies to spread or reduce risk, such as warranties, government-mandated partial insurance, restructuring or bankruptcy law, inspection, and regulation for quality and information disclosure.

=== Market failure ===


The term &quot;market failure&quot; encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions. Although economists categorise market failures differently, the following categories emerge in the main texts.

Information asymmetries and incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies, as discussed above.

Natural monopoly, or the overlapping concepts of &quot;practical&quot; and &quot;technical&quot; monopoly, is an extreme case of &quot;failure of competition&quot; as a restraint on producers. Extreme economies of scale are one possible cause.

Public goods are goods which are under-supplied in a typical market. The defining features are that people can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at the same time.

Externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidise or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price distortions caused by these externalities. Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply.

In many areas, some form of price stickiness is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics. Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesised long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition.

Some specialised fields of economics deal in market failure more than others. The economics of the public sector is one example. Much environmental economics concerns externalities or &quot;public bads&quot;.

Policy options include regulations that reflect cost–benefit analysis or market solutions that change incentives, such as emission fees or redefinition of property rights.

=== Welfare ===
Welfare economics uses microeconomics techniques to evaluate well-being from allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy, often relative to competitive general equilibrium. It analyses &quot;social welfare&quot;, however measured, in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered. Accordingly, individuals, with associated economic activities, are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare, whether of a group, a community, or a society, and there is no &quot;social welfare&quot; apart from the &quot;welfare&quot; associated with its individual units.

== Macroeconomics ==
Macroeconomics, another branch of economics, examines the economy as a whole to explain broad aggregates and their interactions &quot;top down&quot;, that is, using a simplified form of general-equilibrium theory. Such aggregates include national income and output, the unemployment rate, and price inflation and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components. It also studies effects of monetary policy and fiscal policy.

Since at least the 1960s, macroeconomics has been characterised by further integration as to micro-based modelling of sectors, including rationality of players, efficient use of market information, and imperfect competition. This has addressed a long-standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject.

Macroeconomic analysis also considers factors affecting the long-term level and growth of national income. Such factors include capital accumulation, technological change and labour force growth.

=== Growth ===
&quot;Growth economics&quot; studies factors that explain economic growth – the increase in output &quot;per capita&quot; of a country over a long period of time. The same factors are used to explain differences in the &quot;level&quot; of output &quot;per capita&quot; &quot;between&quot; countries, in particular why some countries grow faster than others, and whether countries converge at the same rates of growth.

Much-studied factors include the rate of investment, population growth, and technological change. These are represented in theoretical and empirical forms (as in the neoclassical and endogenous growth models) and in growth accounting.

=== Business cycle ===

The economics of a depression were the spur for the creation of &quot;macroeconomics&quot; as a separate discipline. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes authored a book entitled &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; outlining the key theories of Keynesian economics. Keynes contended that aggregate demand for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns, leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output.

He therefore advocated active policy responses by the public sector, including monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government to stabilise output over the business cycle. Thus, a central conclusion of Keynesian economics is that, in some situations, no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards full employment levels. John Hicks&#x27; IS/LM model has been the most influential interpretation of &quot;The General Theory&quot;.

Over the years, understanding of the business cycle has branched into various research programmes, mostly related to or distinct from Keynesianism. The neoclassical synthesis refers to the reconciliation of Keynesian economics with classical economics, stating that Keynesianism is correct in the short run but qualified by classical-like considerations in the intermediate and long run.

New classical macroeconomics, as distinct from the Keynesian view of the business cycle, posits market clearing with imperfect information. It includes Friedman&#x27;s permanent income hypothesis on consumption and &quot;rational expectations&quot; theory, led by Robert Lucas, and real business cycle theory.

In contrast, the new Keynesian approach retains the rational expectations assumption, however it assumes a variety of market failures. In particular, New Keynesians assume prices and wages are &quot;sticky&quot;, which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.

Thus, the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full employment, whereas the new Keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run, and hence government and central-bank policies are needed because the &quot;long run&quot; may be very long.

=== Unemployment ===
The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force. The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. People who are retired, pursuing education, or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labour force. Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes.

Classical models of unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.

Structural unemployment covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers&#x27; skills and the skills required for open jobs. Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand. Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process.

While some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy, cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates. Okun&#x27;s law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth. The original version of Okun&#x27;s law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment.

=== Money and monetary policy ===

Money is a &quot;means of final payment&quot; for goods in most price system economies, and is the unit of account in which prices are typically stated. Money has general acceptability, relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elasticity in supply, and longevity with mass public confidence. It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits. It has been described as a social convention, like language, useful to one largely because it is useful to others. In the words of Francis Amasa Walker, a well-known 19th-century economist, &quot;Money is what money does&quot; (&quot;Money is &quot;that&quot; money does&quot; in the original).

As a medium of exchange, money facilitates trade. It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with barter (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialised producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate double coincidence of wants as to what is exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces.

Monetary policy is the policy that central banks conduct to accomplish their broader objectives. Most central banks in developed countries follow inflation targeting, whereas the main objective for many central banks in development countries is to uphold a fixed exchange rate system. The primary monetary tool is normally the adjustment of interest rates, either directly via administratively changing the central bank&#x27;s own interest rates or indirectly via open market operations. Via the monetary transmission mechanism, interest rate changes affect investment, consumption and net export, and hence aggregate demand, output and employment, and ultimately the development of wages and inflation.

=== Fiscal policy ===
Governments implement fiscal policy to influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand. When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy, there is an output gap where some productive capacity is left unemployed. Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand. Resources that have been idled can be used by the government.

For example, unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending, which boosts aggregate demand. Both tax cuts and spending have multiplier effects where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity.

The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by crowding out. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government uses resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.

Sceptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of Ricardian equivalence. They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases, which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase. Under Ricardian equivalence, any boost in demand from tax cuts will be offset by the increased saving intended to pay for future higher taxes.

=== Inequality ===
Economic inequality includes income inequality, measured using the distribution of income (the amount of money people receive), and wealth inequality measured using the distribution of wealth (the amount of wealth people own), and other measures such as consumption, land ownership, and human capital. Inequality exists at different extents between countries or states, groups of people, and individuals. There are many methods for measuring inequality, the Gini coefficient being widely used for income differences among individuals. An example measure of inequality between countries is the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, a composite index that takes inequality into account. Important concepts of equality include equity, equality of outcome, and equality of opportunity.

Research has linked economic inequality to political and social instability, including revolution, democratic breakdown and civil conflict. Research suggests that greater inequality hinders economic growth and macroeconomic stability, and that land and human capital inequality reduce growth more than inequality of income. Inequality is at the centre stage of economic policy debate across the globe, as government tax and spending policies have significant effects on income distribution. In advanced economies, taxes and transfers decrease income inequality by one-third, with most of this being achieved via public social spending (such as pensions and family benefits.)

== Other branches of economics ==
=== Public economics ===
Public economics is the field of economics that deals with economic activities of a public sector, usually government. The subject addresses such matters as tax incidence (who really pays a particular tax), cost–benefit analysis of government programmes, effects on economic efficiency and income distribution of different kinds of spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of public choice theory, models public-sector behaviour analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats.

Much of economics is positive, seeking to describe and predict economic phenomena. Normative economics seeks to identify what economies ought to be like.

Welfare economics is a normative branch of economics that uses microeconomic techniques to simultaneously determine the allocative efficiency within an economy and the income distribution associated with it. It attempts to measure social welfare by examining the economic activities of the individuals that comprise society.

=== International economics ===
International trade studies determinants of goods-and-services flows across international boundaries. It also concerns the size and distribution of gains from trade. Policy applications include estimating the effects of changing tariff rates and trade quotas. International finance is a macroeconomic field which examines the flow of capital across international borders, and the effects of these movements on exchange rates. Increased trade in goods, services and capital between countries is a major effect of contemporary globalisation.

=== Labour economics ===
Labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour. &quot;Labour markets&quot; function through the interaction of workers and employers. Labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services (workers), the demands of labour services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income. In economics, &quot;labour&quot; is a measure of the work done by human beings. It is conventionally contrasted with such other factors of production as land and capital. There are theories which have developed a concept called human capital (referring to the skills that workers possess, not necessarily their actual work), although there are also counter posing macro-economic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms.

=== Development economics ===
Development economics examines economic aspects of the economic development process in relatively low-income countries focusing on structural change, poverty, and economic growth. Approaches in development economics frequently incorporate social and political factors.

Economics is one social science among several and has fields bordering on other areas, including economic geography, economic history, public choice, energy economics, cultural economics, family economics and institutional economics.

Law and economics, or economic analysis of law, is an approach to legal theory that applies methods of economics to law. It includes the use of economic concepts to explain the effects of legal rules, to assess which legal rules are economically efficient, and to predict what the legal rules will be. A seminal article by Ronald Coase published in 1961 suggested that well-defined property rights could overcome the problems of externalities.

Political economy is the interdisciplinary study that combines economics, law, and political science in explaining how political institutions, the political environment, and the economic system (capitalist, socialist, mixed) influence each other. It studies questions such as how monopoly, rent-seeking behaviour, and externalities should impact government policy. Historians have employed &quot;political economy&quot; to explore the ways in the past that persons and groups with common economic interests have used politics to effect changes beneficial to their interests.

Energy economics is a broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to energy supply and energy demand. Georgescu-Roegen reintroduced the concept of entropy in relation to economics and energy from thermodynamics, as distinguished from what he viewed as the mechanistic foundation of neoclassical economics drawn from Newtonian physics. His work contributed significantly to thermoeconomics and to ecological economics. He also did foundational work which later developed into evolutionary economics.

The sociological subfield of economic sociology arose, primarily through the work of Émile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel, as an approach to analysing the effects of economic phenomena in relation to the overarching social paradigm (i.e. modernity). Classic works include Max Weber&#x27;s &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; (1905) and Georg Simmel&#x27;s &quot;The Philosophy of Money&quot; (1900). More recently, the works of James S. Coleman, Mark Granovetter, Peter Hedstrom and Richard Swedberg have been influential in this field.

Gary Becker in 1974 presented an economic theory of social interactions, whose applications included the family, charity, merit goods and multiperson interactions, and envy and hatred. He and Kevin Murphy authored a book in 2001 that analysed market behaviour in a social environment.

== Profession ==

The professionalisation of economics, reflected in the growth of graduate programmes on the subject, has been described as &quot;the main change in economics since around 1900&quot;. Most major universities and many colleges have a major, school, or department in which academic degrees are awarded in the subject, whether in the liberal arts, business, or for professional study. See Bachelor of Economics and Master of Economics.

In the private sector, professional economists are employed as consultants and in industry, including banking and finance. Economists also work for various government departments and agencies, for example, the national treasury, central bank or National Bureau of Statistics. See Economic analyst.

There are dozens of prizes awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions to the field, the most prominent of which is the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, though it is not a Nobel Prize.

Contemporary economics uses mathematics. Economists draw on the tools of calculus, linear algebra, statistics, game theory, and computer science. Professional economists are expected to be familiar with these tools, while a minority specialise in econometrics and mathematical methods.

===Women in economics===
Harriet Martineau (1802–1876) was a widely-read populariser of classical economic thought. Mary Paley Marshall (1850–1944), the first women lecturer at a British economics faculty, wrote &quot;The Economics of Industry&quot; with her husband Alfred Marshall. Joan Robinson (1903–1983) was an important post-Keynesian economist. The economic historian Anna Schwartz (1915–2012) coauthored &quot;A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960&quot; with Milton Friedman. Three women have received the Nobel Prize in Economics: Elinor Ostrom (2009), Esther Duflo (2019) and Claudia Goldin (2023). Five have received the John Bates Clark Medal: Susan Athey (2007), Esther Duflo (2010), Amy Finkelstein (2012), Emi Nakamura (2019) and Melissa Dell (2020).

Women&#x27;s authorship share in prominent economic journals reduced from 1940 to the 1970s, but has subsequently risen, with different patterns of gendered coauthorship. Women remain globally under-represented in the profession (19% of authors in the RePEc database in 2018), with national variation.

<text>Electronic paper or intelligent paper, is a display device that reflects ambient light, mimicking the appearance of ordinary ink on paper – unlike conventional flat-panel displays which need additional energy to emit their own light. This may make them more comfortable to read, and provide a wider viewing angle than most light-emitting displays. The contrast ratio in electronic displays available as of 2008 approaches newspaper, and newly developed displays are slightly better. An ideal e-paper display can be read in direct sunlight without the image appearing to fade.

Technologies include Gyricon, electrophoretics, electrowetting, interferometry, and plasmonics.
Many electronic paper technologies hold static text and images indefinitely without electricity. Flexible electronic paper uses plastic substrates and plastic electronics for the display backplane. Applications of e-paper include electronic shelf labels and digital signage, bus station time tables, electronic billboards, smartphone displays, and e-readers able to display digital versions of books and magazines.

==Technologies==

===Gyricon===

Electronic paper was first developed in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox&#x27;s Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometers across. Each sphere is a Janus particle composed of negatively charged black plastic on one side and positively charged white plastic on the other (each bead is thus a dipole). The spheres are embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that it can rotate freely. The polarity of the voltage applied to each pair of electrodes then determines whether the white or black side is face-up, thus giving the pixel a white or black appearance.
At the FPD 2008 exhibition, Japanese company Soken demonstrated a wall with electronic wall-paper using this technology. In 2007, the Estonian company Visitret Displays was developing this kind of display using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the material for the spheres, dramatically improving the video speed and decreasing the control voltage needed.

===Electrophoretic===

An electrophoretic display (EPD) forms images by rearranging charged pigment particles with an applied electric field.
In the simplest implementation of an EPD, titanium dioxide (titania) particles approximately one micrometer in diameter are dispersed in a hydrocarbon oil. A dark-colored dye is also added to the oil, along with surfactants and charging agents that cause the particles to take on an electric charge. This mixture is placed between two parallel, conductive plates separated by a gap of 10 to 100 micrometres. When a voltage is applied across the two plates, the particles migrate electrophoretically to the plate that bears the opposite charge from that on the particles. When the particles are located at the front (viewing) side of the display, it appears white, because the light is scattered back to the viewer by the high-index titania particles. When the particles are located at the rear side of the display, it appears dark, because the light is absorbed by the colored dye. If the rear electrode is divided into a number of small picture elements (pixels), then an image can be formed by applying the appropriate voltage to each region of the display to create a pattern of reflecting and absorbing regions.

EPDs are typically addressed using MOSFET-based thin-film transistor (TFT) technology. TFTs are often used to form a high-density image in an EPD.
A common application for TFT-based EPDs are e-readers. Electrophoretic displays are considered prime examples of the electronic paper category, because of their paper-like appearance and low power consumption. Examples of commercial electrophoretic displays include the high-resolution active matrix displays used in the Amazon Kindle, Barnes &amp; Noble Nook, Sony Reader, Kobo eReader, and iRex iLiad e-readers. These displays are constructed from an electrophoretic imaging film manufactured by E Ink Corporation. A mobile phone that used the technology is the Motorola Fone.

Electrophoretic Display technology has also been developed by SiPix and Bridgestone/Delta. SiPix is now part of E Ink Corporation. The SiPix design uses a flexible 0.15 mm Microcup architecture, instead of E Ink&#x27;s 0.04 mm diameter microcapsules. Bridgestone Corp.&#x27;s Advanced Materials Division cooperated with Delta Optoelectronics Inc. in developing Quick Response Liquid Powder Display technology.

Electrophoretic displays can be manufactured using the Electronics on Plastic by Laser Release (EPLaR) process, developed by Philips Research, to enable existing AM-LCD manufacturing plants to create flexible plastic displays.

====Microencapsulated electrophoretic display====


In the 1990s another type of electronic ink based on a microencapsulated electrophoretic display was conceived and prototyped by a team of undergraduates at MIT as described in their Nature paper. J.D. Albert, Barrett Comiskey, Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded E Ink Corporation in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E Ink subsequently formed a partnership with Philips Components two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to Prime View International. &quot;It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analog of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1–5 μm), quite distinct from the molecular-scale properties that govern the behavior of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-lambertian viewing characteristic, result in an &#x27;ink on paper&#x27; look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.&quot;

This used tiny microcapsules filled with electrically charged white particles suspended in a colored oil. In early versions, the underlying circuitry controlled whether the white particles were at the top of the capsule (so it looked white to the viewer) or at the bottom of the capsule (so the viewer saw the color of the oil). This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known electrophoretic display technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.
One early version of the electronic paper consists of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 micrometers across. Each capsule contains an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white titanium dioxide particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively charged, and each one is naturally white.
The screen holds microcapsules in a layer of liquid polymer, sandwiched between two arrays of electrodes, the upper of which is transparent. The two arrays are aligned to divide the sheet into pixels, and each pixel corresponds to a pair of electrodes situated on either side of the sheet. The sheet is laminated with transparent plastic for protection, resulting in an overall thickness of 80 micrometers, or twice that of ordinary paper.
The network of electrodes connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink &#x27;on&#x27; and &#x27;off&#x27; at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge to the surface electrode repels the particles to the bottom of local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white. A more recent implementation of this concept requires only one layer of electrodes beneath the microcapsules. These are commercially referred to as Active Matrix Electrophoretic Displays (AMEPD).

===Reflective LCD===

This technology is similar to common LCD while the backlight panel is substituted by a reflective surface.
A comparable technology is also obtainable in backlight LCDs by software or hardware deactivating the backlight control.

===Electrowetting===

Electrowetting display (EWD) is based on controlling the shape of a confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.

Displays based on electrowetting provide several attractive features. The switching between white and colored reflection is fast enough to display video content. It is a low-power, low-voltage technology, and displays based on the effect can be made flat and thin. The reflectivity and contrast are better than or equal to other reflective display types and approach the visual qualities of paper. In addition, the technology offers a unique path toward high-brightness full-color displays, leading to displays that are four times brighter than reflective LCDs and twice as bright as other emerging technologies. Instead of using red, green, and blue (RGB) filters or alternating segments of the three primary colors, which effectively result in only one-third of the display reflecting light in the desired color, electrowetting allows for a system in which one sub-pixel can switch two different colors independently.

This results in the availability of two-thirds of the display area to reflect light in any desired color. This is achieved by building up a pixel with a stack of two independently controllable colored oil films plus a color filter.

The colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow, which is a subtractive system, comparable to the principle used in inkjet printing. Compared to LCD, brightness is gained because no polarisers are required.

====Electrofluidic====
Electrofluidic display is a variation of an electrowetting display that place an aqueous pigment dispersion inside a tiny reservoir. The reservoir comprises less than 5-10% of the viewable pixel area and therefore the pigment is substantially hidden from view. Voltage is used to electromechanically pull the pigment out of the reservoir and spread it as a film directly behind the viewing substrate. As a result, the display takes on color and brightness similar to that of conventional pigments printed on paper. When voltage is removed liquid surface tension causes the pigment dispersion to rapidly recoil into the reservoir. The technology can potentially provide greater than 85% white state reflectance for electronic paper.

The core technology was invented at the Novel Devices Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati and there are working prototypes developed by collaboration with Sun Chemical, Polymer Vision and Gamma Dynamics.

It has a wide margin in critical aspects such as brightness, color saturation and response time.
Because the optically active layer can be less than 15 micrometres thick, there is strong potential for rollable displays.

===Interferometric modulator (Mirasol)===
The technology used in electronic visual displays that can create various colors via interference of reflected light. The color is selected with an electrically switched light modulator comprising a microscopic cavity that is switched on and off using driver integrated circuits similar to those used to address liquid-crystal displays (LCD).

===Plasmonic electronic display===
Plasmonic nanostructures with conductive polymers have also been suggested as one kind of electronic paper. The material has two parts. The first part is a highly reflective metasurface made by metal-insulator-metal films tens of nanometers in thickness including nanoscale holes. The metasurfaces can reflect different colors depending on the thickness of the insulator. The standard RGB color schema can be used as pixels for full-color displays. The second part is a polymer with optical absorption controllable by an electrochemical potential. After growing the polymer on the plasmonic metasurfaces, the reflection of the metasurfaces can be modulated by the applied voltage. This technology presents broad range colors, high polarization-independent reflection (&gt;50 %), strong contrast (&gt;30 %), the fast response time (hundreds of ms), and long-term stability. In addition, it has ultralow power consumption (&lt; 0.5 mW/cm2) and potential for high resolution (&gt;10000 dpi). Since the ultrathin metasurfaces are flexible and the polymer is soft, the whole system can be bent. Desired future improvements for this technology include bistability, cheaper materials and implementation with TFT arrays.

===Other technologies===
Other research efforts into e-paper have involved using organic transistors embedded into flexible substrates, including attempts to build them into conventional paper.
Simple color e-paper consists of a thin colored optical filter added to the monochrome technology described above. The array of pixels is divided into triads, typically consisting of the standard cyan, magenta and yellow, in the same way as CRT monitors (although using subtractive primary colors as opposed to additive primary colors). The display is then controlled like any other electronic color display.

==History==
E Ink Corporation of E Ink Holdings Inc. released the first colored E Ink displays to be used in a marketed product. The Ectaco jetBook Color was released in 2012 as the first colored electronic ink device, which used E Ink&#x27;s Triton display technology. E Ink in early 2015 also announced another color electronic ink technology called Prism. This new technology is a color changing film that can be used for e-readers, but Prism is also marketed as a film that can be integrated into architectural design such as &quot;wall, ceiling panel, or entire room instantly.&quot; The disadvantage of these current color displays is that they are considerably more expensive than standard E Ink displays. The jetBook Color costs roughly nine times more than other popular e-readers such as the Amazon Kindle. As of January 2015, Prism had not been announced to be used in the plans for any e-reader devices.

==Applications==
Several companies are simultaneously developing electronic paper and ink. While the technologies used by each company provide many of the same features, each has its own distinct technological advantages. All electronic paper technologies face the following general challenges:
* A method for encapsulation
* An ink or active material to fill the encapsulation
* Electronics to activate the ink

Electronic ink can be applied to flexible or rigid materials. For flexible displays, the base requires a thin, flexible material tough enough to withstand considerable wear, such as extremely thin plastic. The method of how the inks are encapsulated and then applied to the substrate is what distinguishes each company from others. These processes are complex and are carefully guarded industry secrets. Nevertheless, making electronic paper is less complex and costly than LCDs.

There are many approaches to electronic paper, with many companies developing technology in this area. Other technologies being applied to electronic paper include modifications of liquid-crystal displays, electrochromic displays, and the electronic equivalent of an Etch A Sketch at Kyushu University. Advantages of electronic paper include low power usage (power is only drawn when the display is updated), flexibility and better readability than most displays. Electronic ink can be printed on any surface, including walls, billboards, product labels and T-shirts. The ink&#x27;s flexibility would also make it possible to develop rollable displays for electronic devices.

===Wristwatches===
In December 2005, Seiko released the first electronic ink based watch called the Spectrum SVRD001 wristwatch, which has a flexible electrophoretic display and in March 2010 Seiko released a second generation of this famous electronic ink watch with an active matrix display. The Pebble smart watch (2013) uses a low-power memory LCD manufactured by Sharp for its e-paper display.

In 2019, Fossil launched a hybrid smartwatch called the Hybrid HR, integrating an always on electronic ink display with physical hands and dial to simulate the look of a traditional analog watch.

===E-book readers===
In 2004, Sony released the Librié in Japan, the first e-book reader with an electronic paper E Ink display. In September 2006, Sony released the PRS-500 Sony Reader e-book reader in the USA. On October 2, 2007, Sony announced the PRS-505, an updated version of the Reader. In November 2008, Sony released the PRS-700BC, which incorporated a backlight and a touchscreen.

===Mobile phones===
Motorola&#x27;s low-cost mobile phone, the Motorola F3, uses an alphanumeric black-and-white electrophoretic display.

The Samsung Alias 2 mobile phone incorporates electronic ink from E Ink into the keypad, which allows the keypad to change character sets and orientation while in different display modes.

===Smartphones===
On December 12, 2012, Yota Devices announced the first &quot;YotaPhone&quot; prototype and was later released in December 2013, a unique double-display smartphone. It has a 4.3-inch, HD LCD on the front and an electronic ink display on the back.

On May and June 2020, Hisense released the Hisense A5c and A5 pro cc, the first color electronic ink smartphones. With a single color display, with a togglable front light running android 9 and Android 10.

===Computer monitors===
Electronic paper is used on computer monitors like the 13.3 inch Dasung Paperlike 3 HD and 25.3 inch Paperlike 253.

===Laptop===
Some laptops like Lenovo ThinkBook Plus use e-paper as a secondary screen.
Other common laptops use reflective LCD panels with no backlight.
Furthermore, some operating systems e.g. Xubuntu, Kali Linux provide a control to dim backlight LCD brightness to 0% in internal monitors, while crystals keep working so that the display is lighted by ambient light as it was paper.

In late 2007, Amazon began producing and marketing the Amazon Kindle, an e-book reader with an e-paper display. In February 2009, Amazon released the Kindle 2 and in May 2009 the larger Kindle DX was announced. In July 2010 the third-generation Kindle was announced, with notable design changes. The fourth generation of Kindle, called Touch, was announced in September 2011 that was the Kindle&#x27;s first departure from keyboards and page turn buttons in favor of touchscreens. In September 2012, Amazon announced the fifth generation of the Kindle called the Paperwhite, which incorporates a LED frontlight and a higher contrast display.

In November 2009, Barnes and Noble launched the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook, running an Android operating system. It differs from other e-readers in having a replaceable battery, and a separate touch-screen color LCD below the main electronic paper reading screen.

In 2017, Sony and reMarkable offered e-books tailored for writing with a smart stylus.

In 2020, Onyx released the first frontlit 13.3 inch electronic paper Android tablet, the Boox Max Lumi. At the end of the same year, Bigme released the first 10.3 inch color electronic paper Android tablet, the Bigme B1 Pro. This was also the first large electronic paper tablet to support 4g cellular data.

===Newspapers===
In February 2006, the Flemish daily &quot;De Tijd&quot; distributed an electronic version of the paper to select subscribers in a limited marketing study, using a pre-release version of the iRex iLiad. This was the first recorded application of electronic ink to newspaper publishing.

The French daily &quot;Les Échos&quot; announced the official launch of an electronic version of the paper on a subscription basis in September 2007. Two offers were available, combining a one-year subscription and a reading device. The offer included either a light (176g) reading device (adapted for Les Echos by Ganaxa) or the iRex iLiad. Two different processing platforms were used to deliver readable information of the daily, one based on the newly developed GPP electronic ink platform from &quot;Ganaxa&quot;, and the other one developed internally by Les Echos.

===Displays embedded in smart cards===
Flexible display cards enable financial payment cardholders to generate a one-time password to reduce online banking and transaction fraud. Electronic paper offers a flat and thin alternative to existing key fob tokens for data security. The world&#x27;s first ISO compliant smart card with an embedded display was developed by Innovative Card Technologies and nCryptone in 2005. The cards were manufactured by Nagra ID.

===Status displays===

Some devices, like USB flash drives, have used electronic paper to display status information, such as available storage space. Once the image on the electronic paper has been set, it requires no power to maintain, so the readout can be seen even when the flash drive is not plugged in.

===Electronic shelf labels===

E-paper based electronic shelf labels (ESL) are used to digitally display the prices of goods at retail stores. Electronic-paper-based labels are updated via two-way infrared or radio technology and powered by a rechargeable coin cell.
Some variants use ZBD (zenithal bistable display) which is more similar to LCD but does not need power to retain an image.
===Public transport timetables===
E-paper displays at bus or trams stops can be remotely updated. Compared to LED or liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), they consume lower energy and the text or graphics stays visible during a power failure. Compared to LCDs, it easily visible under full sunshine.

===Digital signage===

Because of its energy-saving properties, electronic paper has proved a technology suited to digital signage applications.

===Electronic tags===
Typically, e-paper electronic tags integrate e-ink technology with wireless interfaces like NFC or UHF. They are most commonly used as employees&#x27; ID cards or as production labels to track manufacturing changes and status. E-paper tags are also increasingly being used as shipping labels, especially in the case of reusable boxes. 
An interesting feature provided by some e-paper Tags manufacturers is batteryless design. This means that the power needed for a display&#x27;s content update is provided wirelessly and the module itself doesn&#x27;t contain any battery.

===Other===
Other proposed applications include clothes, digital photo frames, information boards, and keyboards. Keyboards with dynamically changeable keys are useful for less represented languages, non-standard keyboard layouts such as Dvorak, or for special non-alphabetical applications such as video editing or games.
The reMarkable is a writer tablet for reading and taking notes.

<text>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth&#x27;s water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth&#x27;s crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth&#x27;s crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth&#x27;s land hemisphere. Most of Earth&#x27;s land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth&#x27;s polar deserts retain more water than Earth&#x27;s groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined. Earth&#x27;s crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth&#x27;s surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun&#x27;s light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of , at which water is liquid under normal atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.

Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon&#x27;s gravity helps stabilize Earth&#x27;s axis, causes tides and gradually slows Earth&#x27;s rotation. Tidal locking has made the Moon always face Earth with the same side.

Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed about 4.5 billion years ago from gas and dust in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth&#x27;s history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth. Humans depend on Earth&#x27;s biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet&#x27;s environment. Humanity&#x27;s current impact on Earth&#x27;s climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and causing widespread extinctions.

== Etymology ==
The Modern English word &quot;Earth&quot; developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled &#x27;. It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as . In its earliest attestation, the word &quot;eorðe&quot; was used to translate the many senses of Latin &#x27; and Greek γῆ &quot;gē&quot;: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included Jörð (&quot;Earth&quot;), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.

Historically, &quot;Earth&quot; has been written in lowercase. Beginning with the use of Early Middle English, its definite sense as &quot;the globe&quot; was expressed as &quot;the earth&quot;. By the era of Early Modern English, capitalization of nouns began to prevail, and &quot;the earth&quot; was also written &quot;the Earth&quot;, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as &quot;Earth&quot;, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though &quot;earth&quot; and forms with &quot;the earth&quot; remain common. House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the more common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes &quot;Earth&quot; when appearing as a name, such as a description of the &quot;Earth&#x27;s atmosphere&quot;, but employs the lowercase when it is preceded by &quot;the&quot;, such as &quot;the atmosphere of the earth&quot;. It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as &quot;what on earth are you doing?&quot;

The name &quot;Terra&quot; occasionally is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity&#x27;s inhabited planet from others, while in poetry &quot;Tellus&quot; has been used to denote personification of the Earth. &quot;Terra&quot; is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages, languages that evolved from Latin, like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings, like the Spanish &quot;Tierra&quot; and the French &quot;Terre&quot;. The Latinate form &quot;Gæa&quot; or &quot;Gaea&quot; () of the Greek poetic name &quot;Gaia&quot; (; or ) is rare, though the alternative spelling &quot;Gaia&quot; has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is rather than the more classical English .

There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. The word &quot;earthly&quot; is derived from &quot;Earth&quot;. From the Latin &quot;Terra&quot; comes &quot;terran&quot; , &quot;terrestrial&quot; , and (via French) &quot;terrene&quot; , and from the Latin &quot;Tellus&quot; comes &quot;tellurian&quot; and &quot;telluric&quot;.

== Natural history ==
=== Formation ===

The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to Ga (billion years) ago. By the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.

Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger. A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth&#x27;s mass, named Theia, collided with Earth. It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.0 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.

=== After formation ===

Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing. Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets. Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed. In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity. By , Earth&#x27;s magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.

As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust. The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as , only after Earth&#x27;s formation. There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance: (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day, which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists, which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth&#x27;s history.

New continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth&#x27;s interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately , one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at , then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at .

The most recent pattern of ice ages began about , and then intensified during the Pleistocene about . High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years. The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the &quot;last ice age&quot;, covered large parts of the continents, to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.

=== Origin of life and evolution ===

Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun&#x27;s energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen () accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer () in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth&#x27;s surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.During the Neoproterozoic, , much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed &quot;Snowball Earth&quot;, and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity. Following the Cambrian explosion, , there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones. Apart from the proposed current Holocene extinction event, the most recent was , when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds. Mammalian life has diversified over the past , and several million years ago, an African ape species gained the ability to stand upright. This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.

=== Future ===

Earth&#x27;s expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next , solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next by 40%. Earth&#x27;s increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, possibly reducing concentration to levels lethally low for current plants ( for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately . A lack of vegetation would result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making current animal life impossible. Due to the increased luminosity, Earth&#x27;s mean temperature may reach in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years. Even if the Sun were stable and eternal, a significant fraction of the water in the modern oceans would descend into the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges as the core of the Earth slowly cools.

The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about . Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly , about 250 times its present radius. Earth&#x27;s fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere and be vaporized, with the heavier elements sinking to the core of the dying sun.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Size and shape ===


Earth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium, with an average diameter of , making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System.

Due to Earth&#x27;s rotation it has the shape of an ellipsoid, bulging at its equator; its diameter is longer there than at its poles. Earth&#x27;s shape also has local topographic variations; the largest local variations, like the Mariana Trench ( below local sea level), shortens Earth&#x27;s average radius by 0.17% and Mount Everest ( above local sea level) lengthens it by 0.14%. Since Earth&#x27;s surface is farthest out from its center of mass at its equatorial bulge, the summit of the volcano Chimborazo in Ecuador () is its farthest point out. Parallel to the rigid land topography the ocean exhibits a more dynamic topography.

To measure the local variation of Earth&#x27;s topography, geodesy employs an idealized Earth producing a geoid shape. Such a shape is gained if the ocean is idealized, covering Earth completely and without any perturbations such as tides and winds. The result is a smooth but irregular geoid surface, providing a mean sea level as a reference level for topographic measurements.

=== Surface ===

Earth&#x27;s surface is the boundary between the atmosphere, and the solid Earth and oceans. Defined in this way, it has an area of about . Earth can be divided into two hemispheres: by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres.

Most of Earth&#x27;s surface is ocean water: 70.8% or . This vast pool of salty water is often called the &quot;world ocean&quot;, and makes Earth with its dynamic hydrosphere a water world or ocean world. Indeed, in Earth&#x27;s early history the ocean may have covered Earth completely. The world ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic or Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean, from largest to smallest. The ocean covers Earth&#x27;s oceanic crust, with the shelf seas covering the shelves of the continental crust to a lesser extent. The oceanic crust forms large oceanic basins with features like abyssal plains, seamounts, submarine volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system. At Earth&#x27;s polar regions, the ocean surface is covered by seasonally variable amounts of sea ice that often connects with polar land, permafrost and ice sheets, forming polar ice caps.

Earth&#x27;s land covers 29.2%, or of Earth&#x27;s surface. The land surface includes many islands around the globe, but most of the land surface is taken by the four continental landmasses, which are (in descending order): Africa-Eurasia, America (landmass), Antarctica, and Australia (landmass). These landmasses are further broken down and grouped into the continents. The terrain of the land surface varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from a low point of at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about .

Land can be covered by surface water, snow, ice, artificial structures or vegetation. Most of Earth&#x27;s land hosts vegetation, but considerable amounts of land are ice sheets (10%, not including the equally large area of land under permafrost) or deserts (33%).

The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth&#x27;s land surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. Soil is crucial for land to be arable. Earth&#x27;s total arable land is 10.7% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland. Earth has an estimated of cropland and of pastureland.

The land surface and the ocean floor form the top of Earth&#x27;s crust, which together with parts of the upper mantle form Earth&#x27;s lithosphere. Earth&#x27;s crust may be divided into oceanic and continental crust. Beneath the ocean-floor sediments, the oceanic crust is predominantly basaltic, while the continental crust may include lower density materials such as granite, sediments and metamorphic rocks. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the mass of the crust.

Earth&#x27;s surface topography comprises both the topography of the ocean surface, and the shape of Earth&#x27;s land surface. The submarine terrain of the ocean floor has an average bathymetric depth of 4 km, and is as varied as the terrain above sea level. Earth&#x27;s surface is continually being shaped by internal plate tectonic processes including earthquakes and volcanism; by weathering and erosion driven by ice, water, wind and temperature; and by biological processes including the growth and decomposition of biomass into soil.

=== Tectonic plates ===

Earth&#x27;s mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth&#x27;s crust and upper mantle, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur. The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.

As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be old. By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is , although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to , indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.

The seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American. Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between . The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of and the Pacific Plate moving . At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of .

=== Internal structure ===


Earth&#x27;s interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about under the oceans to for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.

Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core. Earth&#x27;s inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed. The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth. The density increases with depth. Among the Solar System&#x27;s planetary-sized objects, Earth is the object with the highest density.

=== Chemical composition ===

Earth&#x27;s mass is approximately (). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1% by mass), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to gravitational separation, the core is primarily composed of the denser elements: iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements. The most common rock constituents of the crust are oxides. Over 99% of the crust is composed of various oxides of eleven elements, principally oxides containing silicon (the silicate minerals), aluminium, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium.

=== Internal heat ===
The major contributors to Earth&#x27;s internal heat are primordial heat (heat left over from Earth&#x27;s formation) and radiogenic heat (heat produced by radioactive decay). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach . Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth&#x27;s history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth&#x27;s heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.

The mean heat loss from Earth is , for a global heat loss of . A portion of the core&#x27;s thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts. More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans.

=== Gravitational field ===

The gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth. Near Earth&#x27;s surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately . Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in Earth&#x27;s gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies.

=== Magnetic field ===
The main part of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth&#x27;s surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth&#x27;s geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is , with a magnetic dipole moment of at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average). The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.

The extent of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the day-side of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the night-side magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the day-side magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates. The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere. During magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth&#x27;s ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing an aurora.

== Orbit and rotation ==
=== Rotation ===
Earth&#x27;s rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is of mean solar time (). Because Earth&#x27;s solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between longer than the mean solar day.

Earth&#x27;s rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its &quot;stellar day&quot; by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is of mean solar time (UT1), or Earth&#x27;s rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90° on the equator), is of mean solar time (UT1) . Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.

Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth&#x27;s sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15&#x27;/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth&#x27;s surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.

=== Orbit ===
Earth orbits the Sun, making Earth the third-closest planet to the Sun and part of the inner Solar System. Earth&#x27;s average orbital distance is about , which is the basis for the astronomical unit (AU) and is equal to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth&#x27;s distance to the Moon. Earth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. With an apparent movement of the Sun in Earth&#x27;s sky at a rate of about 1°/day eastward, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian.

The orbital speed of Earth averages about , which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth&#x27;s diameter, about , in seven minutes, and the distance from Earth to the Moon, , in about 3.5 hours.

The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system&#x27;s common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth&#x27;s north poles, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth&#x27;s axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.

The Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of Earth is about in radius. This is the maximum distance at which Earth&#x27;s gravitational influence is stronger than that of the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun. Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center. It is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.

=== Axial tilt and seasons ===
The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281° with the axis of the plane of the Earth&#x27;s orbit by definition pointing always towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth&#x27;s axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere.

During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night, and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves. These same latitudes also experience a midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all day.

By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when Earth&#x27;s rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.

The angle of Earth&#x27;s axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth&#x27;s axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth&#x27;s equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth&#x27;s surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth&#x27;s rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.

Earth&#x27;s annual orbit is elliptical rather than circular, and its closest approach to the Sun is called perihelion. In modern times, Earth&#x27;s perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates shift over time due to precession and changes to the orbit, the latter of which follows cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The annual change in the Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.

== Earth–Moon system ==
=== Moon ===

The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth&#x27;s. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as &quot;moons&quot;, after Earth&#x27;s. The most widely accepted theory of the Moon&#x27;s origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains the Moon&#x27;s relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth&#x27;s crust. Computer simulations suggest that two blob-like remnants of this protoplanet could be inside the Earth.

The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes lunar tides on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases. Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately . Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth&#x27;s day by about 23 μs/yr—add up to significant changes. During the Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately ) there were 400±7 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9±0.4 hours.

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet&#x27;s climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth&#x27;s axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth&#x27;s equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun&#x27;s diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon&#x27;s, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.

=== Asteroids and artificial satellites ===
Earth&#x27;s co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites, objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans. There are at least seven quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, ranging in diameter from 10 m to 5000 m. A trojan asteroid companion, , is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. The tiny near-Earth asteroid makes close approaches to the Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.

, there are 4,550 operational, human-made satellites orbiting Earth. There are also inoperative satellites, including Vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris. Earth&#x27;s largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station (ISS).

== Hydrosphere ==
Earth&#x27;s hydrosphere is the sum of Earth&#x27;s water and its distribution. Most of Earth&#x27;s hydrosphere consists of Earth&#x27;s global ocean. Earth&#x27;s hydrosphere also consists of water in the atmosphere and on land, including clouds, inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters. The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth&#x27;s total mass. The oceans cover an area of with a mean depth of , resulting in an estimated volume of .

If all of Earth&#x27;s crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be . About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers. The remaining 30% is ground water, 1% surface water (covering only 2.8% of Earth&#x27;s land) and other small forms of fresh water deposits such as permafrost, water vapor in the atmosphere, biological binding, etc.

In Earth&#x27;s coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice. This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity. Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions. The flow of glaciers erodes the surface, changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms. Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.

The average salinity of Earth&#x27;s oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt). Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world&#x27;s climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.

The abundance of water, particularly liquid water, on Earth&#x27;s surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the Solar System. Solar System planets with considerable atmospheres do partly host atmospheric water vapor, but they lack surface conditions for stable surface water. Despite some moons showing signs of large reservoirs of extraterrestrial liquid water, with possibly even more volume than Earth&#x27;s ocean, all of them are large bodies of water under a kilometers thick frozen surface layer.

== Atmosphere ==
The atmospheric pressure at Earth&#x27;s sea level averages , with a scale height of about . A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules. Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4% but averages about 1%. Clouds cover around two-thirds of Earth&#x27;s surface, more so over oceans than land. The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between at the poles to at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.

Earth&#x27;s biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric into. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the surface, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be , in contrast to the current , and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.

=== Weather and climate ===
Earth&#x27;s atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere&#x27;s mass is contained within the first of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°. Ocean heat content and currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.

Earth receives 1361 W/m2 of solar irradiance. The amount of solar energy that reaches Earth&#x27;s surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about per degree of latitude from the equator. Earth&#x27;s surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.

Further factors that affect a location&#x27;s climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology. Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land. Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco&#x27;s climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land. Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.

The commonly used Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes. The Köppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation. Surface air temperature can rise to around in hot deserts, such as Death Valley, and can fall as low as in Antarctica.

=== Upper atmosphere ===

The upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above the troposphere, is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as above Earth&#x27;s surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth&#x27;s gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.

== Life on Earth ==
Earth is the only known place that has ever been habitable for life. Earth&#x27;s life developed in Earth&#x27;s early bodies of water some hundred million years after Earth formed. Earth&#x27;s life has been shaping and inhabiting many particular ecosystems on Earth and has eventually expanded globally forming an overarching biosphere.

Therefore, life has impacted Earth, significantly altering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and surface over long periods of time, causing changes like the Great Oxidation Event. Earth&#x27;s life has also over time greatly diversified, allowing the biosphere to have different biomes, which are inhabited by comparatively similar plants and animals. The different biomes developed at distinct elevations or water depths, planetary temperature latitudes and on land also with different humidity. Earth&#x27;s species diversity and biomass reaches a peak in shallow waters and with forests, particularly in equatorial, warm and humid conditions. While freezing polar regions and high altitudes, or extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life.

Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain a metabolism. Plants and other organisms take up nutrients from water, soils and the atmosphere. These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species.

Extreme weather, such as tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons), occurs over most of Earth&#x27;s surface and has a large impact on life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year. Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters. Human impact is felt in many areas due to pollution of the air and water, acid rain, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion. Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause global warming. This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, a global rise in average sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.

== Human geography ==

Originating from earlier primates in Eastern Africa 300,000years ago humans have since been migrating and with the advent of agriculture in the 10th millennium BC increasingly settling Earth&#x27;s land. In the 20th century Antarctica had been the last continent to see a first and until today limited human presence.

Human population has since the 19th century grown exponentially to seven billion in the early 2010s, and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century. Most of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa.

Distribution and density of human population varies greatly around the world with the majority living in south to eastern Asia and 90% inhabiting only the Northern Hemisphere of Earth, partly due to the hemispherical predominance of the world&#x27;s land mass, with 68% of the world&#x27;s land mass being in the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, since the 19th century humans have increasingly converged into urban areas with the majority living in urban areas by the 21st century.

Beyond Earth&#x27;s surface humans have lived on a temporary basis, with only a few special-purpose deep underground and underwater presences and a few space stations. The human population virtually completely remains on Earth&#x27;s surface, fully depending on Earth and the environment it sustains. Since the second half of the 20th century, some hundreds of humans have temporarily stayed beyond Earth, a tiny fraction of whom have reached another celestial body, the Moon.

Earth has been subject to extensive human settlement, and humans have developed diverse societies and cultures. Most of Earth&#x27;s land has been territorially claimed since the 19th century by sovereign states (countries) separated by political borders, and 205 such states exist today, with only parts of Antarctica and a few small regions remaining unclaimed. Most of these states together form the United Nations, the leading worldwide intergovernmental organization, which extends human governance over the ocean and Antarctica, and therefore all of Earth.

=== Natural resources and land use ===
Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, are only replenished over geological timescales. Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth&#x27;s crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics. These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which often brings environmental and health damage.

Earth&#x27;s biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of organic waste. The land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the land. In 2019, of Earth&#x27;s land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, was shrub and grassland, were used for animal feed production and grazing, and were cultivated as croplands. Of the 1214% of ice-free land that is used for croplands, 2 percentage points were irrigated in 2015. Humans use building materials to construct shelters.

=== Humans and the environment ===

Human activities have impacted Earth&#x27;s environments. Through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, humans have been increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, altering Earth&#x27;s energy budget and climate. It is estimated that global temperatures in the year 2020 were warmer than the preindustrial baseline. This increase in temperature, known as global warming, has contributed to the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.

The concept of planetary boundaries was introduced to quantify humanity&#x27;s impact on Earth. Of the nine identified boundaries, five have been crossed: Biosphere integrity, climate change, chemical pollution, destruction of wild habitats and the nitrogen cycle are thought to have passed the safe threshold. As of 2018, no country meets the basic needs of its population without transgressing planetary boundaries. It is thought possible to provide all basic physical needs globally within sustainable levels of resource use.

== Cultural and historical viewpoint ==
Human cultures have developed many views of the planet. The standard astronomical symbols of Earth are a quartered circle, , representing the four corners of the world, and a globus cruciger, . Earth is sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity. Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities. The Gaia hypothesis, developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth&#x27;s environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability.

Images of Earth taken from space, particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on, called the overview effect, emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility. In particular, this caused a realization of the scope of effects from human activity on Earth&#x27;s environment. Enabled by science, particularly Earth observation, humans have started to take action on environmental issues globally, acknowledging the impact of humans and the interconnectedness of Earth&#x27;s environments.

Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people&#x27;s view of the planet. Initial belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in Ancient Greece by the idea of a spherical Earth, which was attributed to both the philosophers Pythagoras and Parmenides. Earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it was a moving object, one of the planets of the Solar System.

It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth&#x27;s age was at least many millions of years. Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth&#x27;s age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.

&lt;/math&gt;, where &quot;m&quot; is the mass of Earth, &quot;a&quot; is an astronomical unit, and &quot;M&quot; is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about formula_1.&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>The English Channel, also known as the Channel, is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates Southern England from northern France. It links to the southern part of the North Sea by the Strait of Dover at its northeastern end. It is the busiest shipping area in the world.

It is about long and varies in width from at its widest to at its narrowest in the Strait of Dover. It is the smallest of the shallow seas around the continental shelf of Europe, covering an area of some .

The Channel aided the United Kingdom in becoming a naval superpower, serving as a natural defence against invasions, such as in the Napoleonic Wars and in the Second World War.

The northern, English coast of the Channel is more populous than the southern, French coast. The major languages spoken in this region are English and French.

== Names ==

Roman sources as (or , meaning the Ocean, or the Sea, of the Britons or &quot;Britannī&quot;). Variations of this term were used by influential writers such as Ptolemy, and remained popular with British and continental authors well into the modern era. Other Latin names for the sea include (the Gaulish Ocean) which was used by Isidore of Seville in the sixth century.

The term &quot;British Sea&quot; is still used by speakers of Cornish and Breton, with the sea known to them as and respectively. While it is likely that these names derive from the Latin term, it is possible that they predate the arrival of the Romans in the area. The modern Welsh is often given as (the Lord&#x27;s or Prince&#x27;s Sea); however, this name originally described both the Channel and the North Sea combined.

Anglo-Saxon texts make reference to the sea as (South Sea), but this term fell out of favour, as later English authors followed the same conventions as their Latin and Norman contemporaries. One English name that did persist was the &quot;Narrow Seas&quot;, a collective term for the channel and North Sea. As England (followed by Great Britain and the United Kingdom) claimed sovereignty over the sea, a Royal Navy Admiral was appointed with maintaining duties in the two seas. The office was maintained until 1822, when several European nations (including the United Kingdom) adopted a limit to territorial waters.

=== English Channel ===

The word &quot;channel&quot; was first recorded in Middle English in the 13th century and was borrowed from the Old French word (a variant form of &#x27;canal&#x27;). By the middle of the fifteenth century, an Italian map based on Ptolemy&#x27;s description named the sea as &quot;Britanicus Oceanus nunc Canalites Anglie&quot; (Ocean of the Britons but now English Channel). The map is possibly the first recorded use of the term &quot;English Channel&quot; and the description suggests the name had recently been adopted.

In the sixteenth century, Dutch maps referred to the sea as the (English Channel) and by the 1590s, William Shakespeare used the word &quot;Channel&quot; in his history plays of Henry VI, suggesting that by that time, the name was popularly understood by English people.

By the eighteenth century, the name &quot;English Channel&quot; was in common usage in England. Following the Acts of Union 1707, this was replaced in official maps and documents with &quot;British Channel&quot; or &quot;British Sea&quot; for much of the next century. However, the term English Channel remained popular and was finally in official usage by the nineteenth century.

The French name has been used since at least the 17th century. The name is usually said to refer to the sleeve () shape of the Channel. Folk etymology has derived it from a Celtic word meaning &#x27;channel&#x27; that is also the source of the name for the Minch in Scotland, but this name is not attested before the 17th century, and French and British sources of that time are clear about its etymology. The name in French has been directly adapted in other languages as either a calque, such as in Italian or the &quot;Ärmelkanal&quot; in German, or a direct borrowing, such as in Spanish.

== Nature ==
=== Geography ===

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the English Channel as:


The Strait of Dover (), at the Channel&#x27;s eastern end, is its narrowest point, while its widest point lies between Lyme Bay and the Gulf of Saint Malo, near its midpoint. Well on the continental shelf, it has an average depth of about at its widest; yet averages about between Dover and Calais, its notable sandbank hazard being Goodwin Sands. Eastwards from there the adjoining North Sea reduces to about across the Broad Fourteens (14 fathoms) where it lies over the southern cusp of the former land bridge between East Anglia and the Low Countries. The North Sea reaches much greater depths east of northern Britain. The Channel descends briefly to in the submerged valley of Hurd&#x27;s Deep, west-northwest of Guernsey.
There are several major islands in the Channel, the most notable being the Isle of Wight off the English coast, and the Channel Islands, British Crown Dependencies off the coast of France. The coastline, particularly on the French shore, is deeply indented, with several small islands close to the coastline, including Chausey and Mont-Saint-Michel. The Cotentin Peninsula on the French coast juts out into the Channel, with the wide Bay of the Seine () to its east. On the English side there is a small parallel strait, the Solent, between the Isle of Wight and the mainland. The Celtic Sea is to the west of the Channel.

The Channel acts as a funnel that amplifies the tidal range from less than a metre at sea in eastern places to more than 6 metres in the Channel Islands, the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula and the north coast of Brittany in monthly spring tides. The time difference of about six hours between high water at the eastern and western limits of the Channel is indicative of the tidal range being amplified further by resonance. Amphidromic points are the Bay of Biscay and varying more in precise location in the far south of the North Sea, meaning both those associated eastern coasts repel the tides effectively, leaving the Strait of Dover as every six hours the natural bottleneck short of its consequent gravity-induced repulsion of the southward tide (surge) of the North Sea (equally from the Atlantic). The Channel does not experience, but its existence is necessary to explain the extent of North Sea storm surges, such as necessitate the Thames Barrier, Delta Works, Zuiderzee works (Afsluitdijk and other dams).

In the UK Shipping Forecast the Channel is divided into the following areas, from the east:
* Dover
* Wight
* Portland
* Plymouth

=== Geological origins ===

The full English Channel connecting the North Sea to the Western Atlantic via the Strait of Dover is of geologically recent origin, having formed late in the Pleistocene period. The English Channel first developed as an arm of the Atlantic Ocean during the Pliocene period (5.3-2.6 million years ago) as a result of differential tectonic uplift along pre-existing tectonic weaknesses during the Oligocene and Miocene periods. During this early period, the Channel did not connect to the North Sea, with Britain and Ireland remaining part of continental Europe, linked by an unbroken Weald–Artois anticline, a ridge running between the Dover and Calais regions. During Pleistocene glacial periods this ridge acted as a natural dam holding back a large freshwater pro-glacial lake in the Doggerland region, now submerged under the North Sea. During this period, the North Sea and almost all of the British Isles were covered by ice. The lake was fed by meltwater from the Baltic and from the Caledonian and Scandinavian ice sheets that joined to the north, blocking its exit. The sea level was about lower than it is today. Then, between 450,000 and 180,000 years ago, at least two catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods breached the Weald–Artois anticline. These contributed to creating some of the deepest parts of the channel such as Hurd&#x27;s Deep.

The first flood of 450,000 years ago would have lasted for several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second. The flood started with large but localised waterfalls over the ridge, which excavated depressions now known as the &quot;Fosses Dangeard&quot;. The flow eroded the retaining ridge, causing the rock dam to fail and releasing lake water into the Atlantic. After multiple episodes of changing sea level, during which the &quot;Fosses Dangeard&quot; were largely infilled by various layers of sediment, another catastrophic flood some 180,000 years ago carved a large bedrock-floored valley, the Lobourg Channel, some 500 m wide and 25 m deep, from the southern North Sea basin through the centre of the Straits of Dover and into the English Channel. It left streamlined islands, longitudinal erosional grooves, and other features characteristic of catastrophic megaflood events, still present on the sea floor and now revealed by high-resolution sonar. Through the scoured channel passed a river, the Channel River, which drained the combined Rhine and Thames westwards to the Atlantic.

The flooding destroyed the ridge that connected Britain to continental Europe, although a land connection across the southern North Sea would have existed intermittently at later times when periods of glaciation resulted in lowering of sea levels.

During interglacial periods (when sea levels were high) between the initial flooding 450,000 years ago until around 180,000 years ago, the Channel would still have been separated from the North Sea by a land bridge to the north of the Strait of Dover (the Strait of Dover at this time formed part of a estuary fed by the Thames and Scheldt), restricting interchange of marine fauna between the Channel and the North Sea (except perhaps by occasional overtopping). During the Last Interglacial/Eemian (115–130,000 years ago) the connection between the North Sea and the English Channel was fully open as it is today, resulting in Britain being an island during this interval, before lowered sea levels reconnected it to the continent during the Last Glacial Period. From the end of the Last Glacial Period, to the beginning of the Holocene rising sea levels again resulted in the unimpeded connection between the North Sea and the English Channel resuming due to the sinking of Doggerland, with Britain again becoming an island.

=== Ecology ===
As a busy shipping lane, the Channel experiences environmental problems following accidents involving ships with toxic cargo and oil spills. Indeed, over 40% of the UK incidents threatening pollution occur in or very near the Channel. One occurrence was the MSC &quot;Napoli&quot;, which on 18 January 2007 was beached with nearly 1700 tonnes of dangerous cargo in Lyme Bay, a protected World Heritage Site coastline. The ship had been damaged and was en route to Portland Harbour.

The English Channel, despite being a busy shipping lane, remains in part a haven for wildlife. Atlantic oceanic species are more common in the westernmost parts of the channel, particularly to the west of Start Point, Devon, but can sometimes be found further east towards Dorset and the Isle of Wight. Seal sightings are becoming more common along the English Channel, with both grey seal and harbour seal recorded frequently.

== Human history ==

The Channel is thought to have prevented Neanderthals from colonising Britain during the Last Interglacial/Eemian, though they returned to Britain during the Last Glacial Period when sea levels were lower. The Channel has in historic times been both an easy entry for seafaring people and a key natural defence, halting invading armies while in conjunction with control of the North Sea allowing Britain to blockade the continent. The most significant failed invasion threats came when the Dutch and Belgian ports were held by a major continental power, e.g. from the Spanish Armada in 1588, Napoleon during the Napoleonic Wars, and Nazi Germany during World War II. Successful invasions include the Roman conquest of Britain, the Norman Conquest in 1066 and the Glorious Revolution of 1688, while the concentration of excellent harbours in the Western Channel on Britain&#x27;s south coast made possible the largest amphibious invasion in history, the Normandy Landings in 1944. Channel naval battles include the Battle of the Downs (1639), Battle of Dover (1652), the Battle of Portland (1653) and the Battle of La Hougue (1692).

In more peaceful times, the Channel served as a link joining shared cultures and political structures, particularly the huge Angevin Empire from 1135 to 1217. For nearly a thousand years, the Channel also provided a link between the Modern Celtic regions and languages of Cornwall and Brittany. Brittany was founded by Britons who fled Cornwall and Devon after Anglo-Saxon encroachment. In Brittany, there is a region known as &quot;Cornouaille&quot; (Cornwall) in French and &quot;Kernev&quot; in Breton. In ancient times there was also a &quot;Domnonia&quot; (Devon) in Brittany as well.

In February 1684, ice formed on the sea in a belt wide off the coast of Kent and wide on the French side.

=== Route to Britain ===
Remnants of a mesolithic boatyard have been found on the Isle of Wight. Wheat was traded across the Channel about 8,000 years ago. &quot;... Sophisticated social networks linked the Neolithic front in southern Europe to the Mesolithic peoples of northern Europe.&quot; The Ferriby Boats, Hanson Log Boats and the later Dover Bronze Age Boat could carry a substantial cross-Channel cargo.

Diodorus Siculus and Pliny both suggest trade between the rebel Celtic tribes of Armorica and Iron Age Britain flourished. In 55 BC Julius Caesar invaded, claiming that the Britons had aided the Veneti against him the previous year. He was more successful in 54 BC, but Britain was not fully established as part of the Roman Empire until Aulus Plautius&#x27;s 43 AD invasion. A brisk and regular trade began between ports in Roman Gaul and those in Britain. This traffic continued until the end of Roman rule in Britain in 410 AD, after which the early Anglo-Saxons left less clear historical records.

In the power vacuum left by the retreating Romans, the Germanic Angles, Saxons, and Jutes began the next great migration across the North Sea. Having already been used as mercenaries in Britain by the Romans, many people from these tribes crossed during the Migration Period, conquering and perhaps displacing the native Celtic populations.

=== Norsemen and Normans ===
The attack on Lindisfarne in 793 is generally considered the beginning of the Viking Age. For the next 250 years the Scandinavian raiders of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark dominated the North Sea, raiding monasteries, homes, and towns along the coast and along the rivers that ran inland. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; they began to settle in Britain in 851. They continued to settle in the British Isles and the continent until around 1050, with some raids recorded along the channel coast of England, including at Wareham, Portland, near Weymouth and along the river Teign in Devon.

The fiefdom of Normandy was created for the Viking leader Rollo (also known as Robert of Normandy). Rollo had besieged Paris but in 911 entered vassalage to the king of the West Franks Charles the Simple through the Treaty of St.-Claire-sur-Epte. In exchange for his homage and fealty, Rollo legally gained the territory he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name &quot;Normandy&quot; reflects Rollo&#x27;s Viking (i.e. &quot;Northman&quot;) origins.

The descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local Gallo-Romance language and intermarried with the area&#x27;s inhabitants and became the Normans – a Norman French-speaking mixture of Scandinavians, Hiberno-Norse, Orcadians, Anglo-Danish, and indigenous Franks and Gauls.

Rollo&#x27;s descendant William, Duke of Normandy, became king of England in 1066 in the Norman Conquest beginning with the Battle of Hastings, while retaining the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants. In 1204, during the reign of King John, mainland Normandy was taken from England by France under Philip II, while insular Normandy (the Channel Islands) remained under English control. In 1259, Henry III of England recognised the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the Treaty of Paris. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of mainland Normandy.

With the rise of William the Conqueror, the North Sea and Channel began to lose some of their importance. The new order oriented most of England and Scandinavia&#x27;s trade south, toward the Mediterranean and the Orient.

Although the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy and other French possessions in 1801, the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands (except for Chausey) are Crown Dependencies of the British Crown. Thus the Loyal toast in the Channel Islands is &quot;Le roi, notre Duc&quot; (&quot;The King, our Duke&quot;). The British monarch is understood to &quot;not&quot; be the Duke of Normandy in regards of the French region of Normandy described herein, by virtue of the Treaty of Paris of 1259, the surrender of French possessions in 1801, and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to Salic Law which excludes inheritance through female heirs.

French Normandy was occupied by English forces during the Hundred Years&#x27; War in 1346–1360 and again in 1415–1450.

=== England and Britain: Naval superpower ===
From the reign of Elizabeth I, English foreign policy concentrated on preventing invasion across the Channel by ensuring no major European power controlled the potential Dutch and Flemish invasion ports. Her climb to the pre-eminent sea power of the world began in 1588 as the attempted invasion of the Spanish Armada was defeated by the combination of outstanding naval tactics by the English and the Dutch under command of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham with Sir Francis Drake second in command, and the following stormy weather. Over the centuries the Royal Navy slowly grew to be the most powerful in the world.
The building of the British Empire was possible only because the Royal Navy eventually managed to exercise unquestioned control over the seas around Europe, especially the Channel and the North Sea. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, France attempted to launch an invasion of Britain. To achieve this France needed to gain control of the Channel for several weeks, but was thwarted following the British naval victory at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759 and was unsuccessful (The last French landing on English soil being in 1690 with a raid on Teignmouth, although the last French raid on British soil was a raid on Fishguard, Wales in 1797).

Another significant challenge to British domination of the seas came during the Napoleonic Wars. The Battle of Trafalgar took place off the coast of Spain against a combined French and Spanish fleet and was won by Admiral Horatio Nelson, ending Napoleon&#x27;s plans for a cross-Channel invasion and securing British dominance of the seas for over a century.

=== First World War ===
The exceptional strategic importance of the Channel as a tool for blockading was recognised by the First Sea Lord Admiral Fisher in the years before World War I. &quot;Five keys lock up the world! Singapore, the Cape, Alexandria, Gibraltar, Dover.&quot; However, on 25 July 1909 Louis Blériot made the first Channel crossing from Calais to Dover in an aeroplane. Blériot&#x27;s crossing signalled a change in the function of the Channel as a barrier-moat for England against foreign enemies.

Because the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; surface fleet could not match the British Grand Fleet, the Germans developed submarine warfare, which was to become a far greater threat to Britain. The Dover Patrol, set up just before the war started, escorted cross-Channel troopships and prevented submarines from sailing in the Channel, obliging them to travel to the Atlantic via the much longer route around Scotland.

On land, the German army attempted to capture French Channel ports in the Race to the Sea but although the trenches are often said to have stretched &quot;from the frontier of Switzerland to the English Channel&quot;, they reached the coast at the North Sea. Much of the British war effort in Flanders was a bloody but successful strategy to prevent the Germans reaching the Channel coast.

At the outset of the war, an attempt was made to block the path of U-boats through the Dover Strait with naval minefields. By February 1915, this had been augmented by a stretch of light steel netting called the Dover Barrage, which it was hoped would ensnare submerged submarines. After initial success, the Germans learned how to pass through the barrage, aided by the unreliability of British mines. On 31 January 1917, the Germans resumed unrestricted submarine warfare leading to dire Admiralty predictions that submarines would defeat Britain by November, the most dangerous situation Britain faced in either world war.

The Battle of Passchendaele in 1917 was fought to reduce the threat by capturing the submarine bases on the Belgian coast, though it was the introduction of convoys and not capture of the bases that averted defeat. In April 1918 the Dover Patrol carried out the Zeebrugge Raid against the U-boat bases. During 1917, the Dover Barrage was re-sited with improved mines and more effective nets, aided by regular patrols by small warships equipped with powerful searchlights. A German attack on these vessels resulted in the Battle of Dover Strait in 1917. A much more ambitious attempt to improve the barrage, by installing eight massive concrete towers across the strait was called the Admiralty M-N Scheme but only two towers were nearing completion at the end of the war and the project was abandoned.

The naval blockade in the Channel and North Sea was one of the decisive factors in the German defeat in 1918.

=== Second World War ===
During the Second World War, naval activity in the European theatre was primarily limited to the Atlantic. During the Battle of France in May 1940, the German forces succeeded in capturing both Boulogne and Calais, thereby threatening the line of retreat for the British Expeditionary Force. By a combination of hard fighting and German indecision, the port of Dunkirk was kept open allowing 338,000 Allied troops to be evacuated in Operation Dynamo. More than 11,000 were evacuated from Le Havre during Operation Cycle and a further 192,000 were evacuated from ports further down the coast in Operation Aerial in June 1940. The early stages of the Battle of Britain featured German air attacks on Channel shipping and ports; despite these early successes against shipping the Germans did not win the air supremacy necessary for Operation Sealion, the projected cross-Channel invasion.

The Channel subsequently became the stage for an intensive coastal war, featuring submarines, minesweepers, and Fast Attack Craft.

The narrow waters of the Channel were considered too dangerous for major warships until the Normandy Landings with the exception, for the German Kriegsmarine, of the Channel Dash (Operation Cerberus) in February 1942, and this required the support of the Luftwaffe in Operation Thunderbolt.

Dieppe was the site of an ill-fated Dieppe Raid by Canadian and British armed forces. More successful was the later Operation Overlord (D-Day), a massive invasion of German-occupied France by Allied troops. Caen, Cherbourg, Carentan, Falaise and other Norman towns endured many casualties in the fight for the province, which continued until the closing of the so-called Falaise gap between Chambois and Montormel, then liberation of Le Havre.

The Channel Islands were the only part of the British Commonwealth occupied by Germany (excepting the part of Egypt occupied by the Afrika Korps at the time of the Second Battle of El Alamein, which was a protectorate and not part of the Commonwealth). The German occupation of 1940–1945 was harsh, with some island residents being taken for slave labour on the Continent; native Jews sent to concentration camps; partisan resistance and retribution; accusations of collaboration; and slave labour (primarily Russians and eastern Europeans) being brought to the islands to build fortifications. The Royal Navy blockaded the islands from time to time, particularly following the liberation of mainland Normandy in 1944. Intense negotiations resulted in some Red Cross humanitarian aid, but there was considerable hunger and privation during the occupation, particularly in the final months, when the population was close to starvation. The German troops on the islands surrendered on 9 May 1945, a day after the final surrender in mainland Europe.

=== English Channel migrant crossings (2018–present)===
There is significant public concern in the UK about illegal immigrants coming on small boats from France. Since 2018, the English Channel has seen a major increase in number of crossing.

== Population ==
The English Channel coast is far more densely populated on the English shore. The most significant towns and cities along both the English and French sides of the Channel (each with more than 20,000 inhabitants, ranked in descending order; populations are the urban area populations from the 1999 French census, 2001 UK census, and 2001 Jersey census) are as follows:

The two dominant cultures are English on the north shore of the Channel, French on the south. However, there are also a number of minority languages that are or were found on the shores and islands of the English Channel, which are listed here, with the Channel&#x27;s name in the specific language following them.

=== Shipping ===
The Channel has traffic on both the UK–Europe and North Sea–Atlantic routes, and is the world&#x27;s busiest seaway, with over 500 ships per day. Following an accident in January 1971 and a series of disastrous collisions with wreckage in February, the Dover TSS, the world&#x27;s first radar-controlled traffic separation scheme, was set up by the International Maritime Organization. The scheme mandates that vessels travelling north must use the French side, travelling south the English side. There is a separation zone between the two lanes.

In December 2002 the MV &quot;Tricolor&quot;, carrying £30m of luxury cars, sank northwest of Dunkirk after collision in fog with the container ship &quot;Kariba&quot;. The cargo ship &quot;Nicola&quot; ran into the wreckage the next day. There was no loss of life.
The shore-based long-range traffic control system was updated in 2003 and there is a series of traffic separation systems in operation. Though the system is inherently incapable of reaching the levels of safety obtained from aviation systems such as the traffic collision avoidance system, it has reduced accidents to one or two per year.

Marine GPS systems allow ships to be preprogrammed to follow navigational channels accurately and automatically, further avoiding risk of running aground, but following the fatal collision between Dutch Aquamarine and Ash in October 2001, Britain&#x27;s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) issued a safety bulletin saying it believed that in these most unusual circumstances GPS use had actually contributed to the collision. The ships were maintaining a very precise automated course, one directly behind the other, rather than making use of the full width of the traffic lanes as a human navigator would.

A combination of radar difficulties in monitoring areas near cliffs, a failure of a CCTV system, incorrect operation of the anchor, the inability of the crew to follow standard procedures of using a GPS to provide early warning of the ship dragging the anchor and reluctance to admit the mistake and start the engine led to the MV &quot;Willy&quot; running aground in Cawsand Bay, Cornwall, in January 2002. The MAIB report makes it clear that the harbour controllers were informed of impending disaster by shore observers before the crew were themselves aware. The village of Kingsand was evacuated for three days because of the risk of explosion, and the ship was stranded for 11 days.

=== Channel Tunnel ===
Many travellers cross beneath the Channel using the Channel Tunnel, first proposed in the early 19th century and finally opened in 1994, connecting the UK and France by rail. It is now routine to travel between Paris or Brussels and London on the Eurostar train. Freight trains also use the tunnel. Cars, coaches and lorries are carried on Eurotunnel Shuttle trains between Folkestone and Calais.

=== Tourism ===
The coastal resorts of the Channel, such as Brighton and Deauville, inaugurated an era of aristocratic tourism in the early 19th century. Short trips across the Channel for leisure purposes are often referred to as Channel Hopping.

=== Renewable energy ===
The Rampion Wind Farm is an offshore wind farm located in the Channel, off the coast of West Sussex. Other offshore wind farms planned on the French side of the Channel.

== History of Channel crossings ==

As one of the narrowest and most well-known international waterways lacking dangerous currents, the Channel has been the first objective of numerous innovative sea, air, and human powered crossing technologies.
Pre-historic people sailed from the mainland to England for millennia. At the end of the last Ice Age, lower sea levels even permitted walking across.

=== By boat ===
Pierre Andriel crossed the English Channel aboard the &quot;Élise&quot;, ex the Scottish p.s. &quot;Margery&quot; in March 1816, one of the earliest seagoing voyages by steam ship.

The paddle steamer &quot;Defiance&quot;, Captain William Wager, was the first steamer to cross the Channel to Holland, arriving there on 9 May 1816.

On 10 June 1821, English-built paddle steamer &quot;Rob Roy&quot; was the first passenger ferry to cross channel. The steamer was purchased subsequently by the French postal administration and renamed &quot;Henri IV&quot; and put into regular passenger service a year later. It was able to make the journey across the Straits of Dover in around three hours.

In June 1843, because of difficulties with Dover harbour, the South Eastern Railway company developed the Boulogne-sur-Mer-Folkestone route as an alternative to Calais-Dover. The first ferry crossed under the command of Captain Hayward.

In 1974 a Welsh coracle piloted by Bernard Thomas of Llechryd crossed the English Channel to France in 13 hours. The journey was undertaken to demonstrate how the Bull Boats of the Mandan Indians of North Dakota could have been copied from coracles introduced by Prince Madog in the 12th century.

The Mountbatten class hovercraft (MCH) entered commercial service in August 1968, initially between Dover and Boulogne but later also Ramsgate (Pegwell Bay) to Calais. The journey time Dover to Boulogne was roughly 35 minutes, with six trips per day at peak times. The fastest crossing of the English Channel by a commercial car-carrying hovercraft was 22 minutes, recorded by the &quot;Princess Anne&quot; MCH SR-N4 Mk3 on 14 September 1995,

=== By air ===

The first aircraft to cross the Channel was a balloon in 1785, piloted by Jean Pierre François Blanchard (France) and John Jeffries (US).

Louis Blériot (France) piloted the first aeroplane to cross in 1909.

On 26 September 2008, Swiss Yves Rossy aka &quot;Jetman&quot; became the first person to cross the English Channel with a Jet Powered Wing,
He jumped from a Pilatus Porter over Calais, France, Rossy crossed the English Channel where he deployed his parachute and landed in Dover

The first flying car to have crossed the English Channel is a Pégase designed by the French company Vaylon on 14 June 2017. It was piloted by a Franco-Italian pilot Bruno Vezzoli. This crossing was carried out as part of the first road and air trip from Paris to London in a flying car. Pegase is a 2 seats road approved dune buggy and a powered paraglider. The takeoff was at 8:03 a.m. from Ambleteuse in the North of France and landing was at East Studdal, near Dover. The flight was completed in 1 hour and 15 minutes for a total distance covered of including over the English Channel at an altitude of .

On 12 June 1979, the first human-powered aircraft to cross the English Channel was the &quot;Gossamer Albatross&quot;, built by American aeronautical engineer Dr. Paul B. MacCready&#x27;s company AeroVironment, and piloted by Bryan Allen. The crossing was completed in 2 hours and 49 minutes.

On 4 August 2019, Frenchman Franky Zapata became the first person to cross the English Channel on a jet-powered Flyboard Air. The board was powered by a kerosene-filled backpack. Zapata made the journey in 22 minutes, having landed on a boat half-way across to refuel.

=== By swimming ===

The sport of Channel swimming traces its origins to the latter part of the 19th century when Captain Matthew Webb made the first observed and unassisted swim across the Strait of Dover, swimming from England to France on 24–25 August 1875 in 21 hours 45 minutes.

Up to 1927, fewer than ten swimmers (including the first woman, Gertrude Ederle in 1926) had managed to successfully swim the English Channel, and many dubious claims had been made. The Channel Swimming Association (CSA) was founded to authenticate and ratify swimmers&#x27; claims to have swum the Channel and to verify crossing times. The CSA was dissolved in 1999 and was succeeded by two separate organisations: CSA Ltd (CSA) and the Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation (CSPF), both observe and authenticate cross-Channel swims in the Strait of Dover. The Channel Crossing Association was also set up to cater for unorthodox crossings.

The team with the most Channel swims to its credit is the Serpentine Swimming Club in London, followed by the international Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team.

As of 2023, 1,881 people had completed 2,428 verified solo crossings under the rules of the CSA and the CSPF. This includes 24 two-way crossings and three three-way crossings.

The Strait of Dover is the busiest stretch of water in the world. It is governed by International Law as described in &quot;Unorthodox Crossing of the Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme&quot;. It states: &quot;[In] exceptional cases the French Maritime Authorities may grant authority for unorthodox craft to cross French territorial waters within the Traffic Separation Scheme when these craft set off from the British coast, on condition that the request for authorisation is sent to them with the opinion of the British Maritime Authorities.&quot;

The fastest verified swim of the Channel was by the Australian Trent Grimsey on 8 September 2012, in 6 hours 55 minutes, beating a swim of 2007. The female record is held by Yvetta Hlavacova of Czechia, on 7 hours, 25 minutes on 5 August 2006. Both records were from England to France.

There may have been some unreported swims of the Channel, by people intent on entering Britain in circumvention of immigration controls. A failed attempt to cross the Channel by two Syrian refugees in October 2014 came to light when their bodies were discovered on the shores of the North Sea in Norway and the Netherlands.

=== By car ===
On 16 September 1965, two Amphicars crossed from Dover to Calais.

=== Other types ===
PLUTO was war-time fuel delivery project of &quot;pipelines under the ocean&quot; from England to France. Though plagued with technical difficulties during the Battle of Normandy, the pipelines delivered about 8% of the fuel requirements of the allied forces between D-Day and VE-Day.

<text>The Eiffel Tower ( ; ) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.

Locally nicknamed &quot;La dame de fer&quot; (French for &quot;Iron Lady&quot;), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World&#x27;s Fair, and to crown the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution. Although initially criticised by some of France&#x27;s leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022. The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world: 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site (&quot;Paris, Banks of the Seine&quot;) in 1991.

The tower is tall, about the same height as an 81- building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by . Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.

The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level&#x27;s upper platform is above the ground—the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600-step climb. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift. On this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel&#x27;s personal use. He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.

==History==
===Origin===
The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world&#x27;s fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as &quot;a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals&quot;. Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company&#x27;s architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.

The new version gained Eiffel&#x27;s support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nouguier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the ; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise 

Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grévy was re-elected as president of France and Édouard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel&#x27;s design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars. (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.) On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel&#x27;s scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel&#x27;s were either impractical or lacking in details.

After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.

A French bank, the &quot;Crédit Industriel et Commercial&quot; (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower. During the period of the tower&#x27;s construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower. These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy that saw France force Haiti&#x27;s government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, &quot;effectively choking off the nation&#x27;s primary source of income&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world&#x27;s best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti&#x27;s economy, taking much of the young nation&#x27;s income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.&quot;

===Artists&#x27; protest===
The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. Prior to the Eiffel Tower&#x27;s construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter, and many people believed it was impossible. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a &quot;Committee of Three Hundred&quot; (one member for each metre of the tower&#x27;s height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A petition called &quot;Artists against the Eiffel Tower&quot; was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by &quot;Le Temps&quot; on 14 February 1887:

Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: &quot;My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?&quot; These criticisms were also dealt with by Édouard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying, &quot;Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time&quot;, and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.

Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel pointed out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: &quot;Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?&quot;

Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced. Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower&#x27;s restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.

By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany. Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.

===Construction===
Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons long and in diameter driven to a depth of to support the concrete slabs, which were thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.

Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts in diameter and long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed. The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within and angles worked out to one second of arc. The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.5 million rivets.

At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as &quot;Eiffel Suicide!&quot; and &quot;Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum&quot; appeared in the tabloid press. Multiple famous artists of that time, Charles Garnier and Alexander Dumas, thought poorly of the newly made tower. Charles Garnier thought it was a &quot;truly tragic street lamp&quot;. Alexander Dumas said that it was like &quot;Odius shadow of the odious column built of rivets and iron plates extending like a black blot&quot;. There were multiple protests over the style and the reasoning of placing it in the middle of Paris. At this stage, a small &quot;creeper&quot; crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888. Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees, due to Eiffel&#x27;s safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died.


===Inauguration and the 1889 exposition===
The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower. Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, Émile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and &quot;Le Monde Illustré&quot;, completed the ascent. At 2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.

There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May. Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays, and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.

After dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.

On the second level, the French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, &quot;Le Figaro de la Tour&quot;, was made.

At the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower. Gustave Eiffel described the collection of responses as &quot;truly curious&quot;.

Famous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison. Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition. Edison signed the guestbook with this message on September 10, 1889: 

Eiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies.

===Subsequent events===
Eiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris. The city had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for many innovations in the early 20th century, particularly radio telegraphy, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit, and from 1910 it also became part of the International Time Service.

For the 1900 &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot;, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism as the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism. At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.

On 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.

In 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays. Two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 m) to demonstrate his parachute design. In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne. 

During World War I, the Eiffel Tower&#x27;s wireless station played a crucial role in intercepting enemy communications from Berlin. In 1914, French forces successfully launched a counter-attack during the Battle of the Marne after gaining critical intelligence on the German Army&#x27;s movements. In 1917, the station intercepted a coded message between Germany and Spain that referenced &#x27;Operative H-21.&#x27; This information contributed to the arrest, conviction, and execution of Mata Hari, the famous spy accused of working for Germany.

From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citroën adorned three of the tower&#x27;s sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time. In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed.

On two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist Victor Lustig &quot;sold&quot; the tower for scrap metal. A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station. A bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg on 2 May 1929. In 1930, the tower lost the title of the world&#x27;s tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed. In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed.

Upon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the French. The tower was restricted to German visitors during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946. In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika-centered Reichskriegsflagge, but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one. When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. When the Allies were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order. On 25 August, before the Germans had been driven out of Paris, the German flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the French Naval Museum, who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans.

A fire started in the television transmitter on 3 January 1956, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top. In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, André Malraux. A year later, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar.

According to interviews, in 1967, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with Charles de Gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during Expo 67. The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location.

In 1982, the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new emergency staircases were installed, replacing the original spiral staircases. In 1983, the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven Otis lift to serve the Jules Verne restaurant. The Fives-Lille lifts in the east and west legs, fitted in 1899, were extensively refurbished in 1986. The cars were replaced, and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts. The motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system. A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.

Robert Moriarty flew a Beechcraft Bonanza under the tower on 31 March 1984. In 1987, A. J. Hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police. On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Hervé Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower. Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump.

For its &quot;Countdown to the Year 2000&quot; celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered searchlights were installed on the tower. During the last three minutes of the year, the lights were turned on starting from the base of the tower and continuing to the top to welcome 2000 with a huge fireworks show. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris&#x27;s night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour.

The lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium on 31 December 2000. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing.

The tower received its th guest on 28 November 2002. The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7 million visitors per year since 2003. In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level. A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment.

==Design==
===Material===
The puddle iron (wrought iron) of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tonnes, and the addition of lifts, shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately 10,100 tonnes. As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300 tonnes of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, on each side, to a depth of only assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8 tonnes per cubic metre. Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324 m × 125 m × 125 m) would contain  tonnes of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun.

===Wind and weather considerations===

When it was built, Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team were experienced bridge builders. In an interview with the newspaper &quot;Le Temps&quot; published on 14 February 1887, Eiffel said:

He used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. Close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape. All parts of the tower were overdesigned to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was assumed to have no gaps in the latticework. After it was completed, some have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. A one devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English described it as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.

The Eiffel Tower sways by up to in the wind.

===Floors===
====Ground floor====

The four columns of the tower each house access stairs and elevators to the first two floors, while at the south column only the elevator to the second floor restaurant is publicly accessible.

====1st floor====
The first floor is publicly accessible by elevator or stairs. When originally built, the first level contained three restaurants—one French, one Russian and one Flemish—and an &quot;Anglo-American Bar&quot;. After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. Today there is the restaurant and other facilities.

====2nd floor====
The second floor is publicly accessible by elevator or stairs and has a restaurant called , a gourmet restaurant with its own lift going up from the south column to the second level. This restaurant has one star in the Michelin Red Guide. It was run by the multi-Michelin star chef Alain Ducasse from 2007 to 2017. As of May 2019, it is managed by three-star chef Frédéric Anton. It owes its name to the famous science-fiction writer Jules Verne.

====3rd floor====
The third floor is the top floor, publicly accessible by elevator.

Originally there were laboratories for various experiments, and a small apartment reserved for Gustave Eiffel to entertain guests, which is now open to the public, complete with period decorations and lifelike mannequins of Eiffel and some of his notable guests.

From 1937 until 1981, there was a restaurant near the top of the tower. It was removed due to structural considerations; engineers had determined it was too heavy and was causing the tower to sag. This restaurant was sold to an American restaurateur and transported to New York and then New Orleans. It was rebuilt on the edge of New Orleans&#x27; Garden District as a restaurant and later event hall. Today there is a champagne bar.

===Lifts===
The arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower&#x27;s history. Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift.

Equipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts had to be the main means of ascent.

Constructing lifts to reach the first level was done by making the legs wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track. A contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier &amp; Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs. Roux, Combaluzier &amp; Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car&#x27;s weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around diameter sprockets. Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains.

Installing lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis Brothers &amp; Company submitted a proposal, but this was rejected: the fair&#x27;s charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended, but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887. Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.

The car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. Motive power was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram long and in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of : this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a block and tackle but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.

The original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Léon Edoux. A pair of hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car travelled only half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.

===Engraved names===

Gustave Eiffel engraved on the building of the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians as a recognition of their contributions. Eiffel chose this &quot;invocation of science&quot; because of his concern over the artists&#x27; protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986–87 by the , a company operating the tower.

===Aesthetics===

The tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the Parisian sky. It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as &quot;Eiffel Tower Brown&quot;. In what is expected to be a temporary change, the tower was painted gold in commemoration of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

Following the 2024 Summer Olympics held in Paris, Mayor Anne Hidalgo proposed keeping the Olympic rings on the tower permanently. The rings, which measure wide and high, were initially installed for the Games and were scheduled for removal after the Paralympics. Hidalgo&#x27;s decision faced criticism from the Eiffel family and some residents concerned about altering the protected monument. The original 30-ton rings would be replaced with lighter versions for long-term display.

The only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre&#x27;s sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition.

A pop-culture movie cliché is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower. In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to seven storeys, only a small number of tall buildings have a clear view of the tower.

===Maintenance===
Maintenance of the tower includes applying 60 tons of paint every 7 years to prevent it from rusting. The tower has been completely repainted at least 19 times since it was built, with the most recent being in 2010. Lead paint was still being used as recently as 2001 when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment.

==Communications==
The tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington County, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C. Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.

===FM radio===
===Digital television===
A television antenna was first installed on the tower in 1957, increasing its height by . Work carried out in 2000 added a further , giving the current height of . Analogue television signals from the Eiffel Tower ceased on 8 March 2011.
==Dimensions==

===Height changes===
The pinnacle height of the Eiffel Tower has changed multiple times over the years as described in the chart below.


==Taller structures==
The Eiffel Tower was the world&#x27;s tallest structure when completed in 1889, a distinction it retained until 1929 when the Chrysler Building in New York City was topped out. The tower also lost its standing as the world&#x27;s tallest tower to the Tokyo Tower in 1958 but retains its status as the tallest freestanding (non-guyed) structure in France.

==Tourism==
===Transport===
The nearest Paris Métro station is Bir-Hakeim and the nearest RER station is Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel. The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Pont d&#x27;Iéna.

===Popularity===
More than 300 million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889. In 2015, there were 6.91 million visitors. The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world. An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day (which can result in long queues).

==Illumination copyright==

The tower and its image have been in the public domain since 1993, 70 years after Eiffel&#x27;s death. In June 1990, a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower&#x27;s 100th anniversary was an &quot;original visual creation&quot; protected by copyright. The Court of Cassation, France&#x27;s judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992. The (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright. As a result, the SNTE alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries for commercial use. For this reason, it is often rare to find images or videos of the lit tower at night on stock image sites, and media outlets rarely broadcast images or videos of it.

The imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the (SNTE), Stéphane Dieu, commented in 2005: &quot;It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn&#x27;t used in ways [of which] we don&#x27;t approve&quot;. SNTE made over €1 million from copyright fees in 2002. However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower.

The copyright claim itself has never been tested in courts to date, according to a 2014 article in the &quot;Art Law Journal&quot;, and there has never been an attempt to track down millions of people who have posted and shared their images of the illuminated tower on the Internet worldwide. However, the article adds that commercial uses of such images, like in a magazine, on a film poster, or on product packaging, may require prior permission.

French doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented, a reasoning akin to the &quot;de minimis&quot; rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower.

==Replicas==

As one of the most famous landmarks in the world, the Eiffel Tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers. An early example is Blackpool Tower in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town. It opened in 1894 and is tall. Tokyo Tower in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower. Well known is the Petřín Lookout Tower in Prague too. 

There are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the Paris Las Vegas, Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at Kings Island, located in Mason, Ohio, and Kings Dominion, Virginia, amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in Durango, Mexico that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe.

In 2011, the TV show &quot;Pricing the Priceless&quot; on the National Geographic Channel speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480 million to build. This would be more than ten times the cost of the original (nearly 8 million in 1890 francs; around US$40 million in 2018 dollars).
