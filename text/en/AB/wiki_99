<text>In philosophy, empiricism is an epistemological view which holds that true knowledge or justification comes only or primarily from sensory experience and empirical evidence. It is one of several competing views within epistemology, along with rationalism and skepticism. Empiricists argue that empiricism is a more reliable method of finding the truth than purely using logical reasoning, because humans have cognitive biases and limitations which lead to errors of judgement. Empiricism emphasizes the central role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas, rather than innate ideas or traditions. Empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sensory experiences. 

Historically, empiricism was associated with the &quot;blank slate&quot; concept (&quot;tabula rasa&quot;), according to which the human mind is &quot;blank&quot; at birth and develops its thoughts only through later experience. 

Empiricism in the philosophy of science emphasizes evidence, especially as discovered in experiments. It is a fundamental part of the scientific method that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on &quot;a priori&quot; reasoning, intuition, or revelation.

Empiricism, often used by natural scientists, believes that &quot;knowledge is based on experience&quot; and that &quot;knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and falsification&quot;. Empirical research, including experiments and validated measurement tools, guides the scientific method.

==Etymology==
The English term &quot;empirical&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek word ἐμπειρία, &quot;empeiria&quot;, which is cognate with and translates to the Latin &quot;experientia&quot;, from which the words &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;experiment&quot; are derived.

==Background==
A central concept in science and the scientific method is that conclusions must be &quot;empirically&quot; based on the evidence of the senses. Both natural and social sciences use working hypotheses that are testable by observation and experiment. The term &quot;semi-empirical&quot; is sometimes used to describe theoretical methods that make use of basic axioms, established scientific laws, and previous experimental results to engage in reasoned model building and theoretical inquiry.

Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one&#x27;s sense-based experience. In epistemology (theory of knowledge) empiricism is typically contrasted with rationalism, which holds that knowledge may be derived from reason independently of the senses, and in the philosophy of mind it is often contrasted with innatism, which holds that some knowledge and ideas are already present in the mind at birth. However, many Enlightenment rationalists and empiricists still made concessions to each other. For example, the empiricist John Locke admitted that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God&#x27;s existence) could be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone. Similarly, Robert Boyle, a prominent advocate of the experimental method, held that we also have innate ideas. At the same time, the main continental rationalists (Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz) were also advocates of the empirical &quot;scientific method&quot;.

==History==
===Early empiricism===
Between 600 and 200 BCE, the Vaisheshika school of Hindu philosophy, founded by the ancient Indian philosopher Kanada, accepted perception and inference as the only two reliable sources of knowledge. This is enumerated in his work &quot;Vaiśeṣika Sūtra&quot;. The Charvaka school held similar beliefs, asserting that perception is the only reliable source of knowledge while inference obtains knowledge with uncertainty.

The earliest Western proto-empiricists were the empiric school of ancient Greek medical practitioners, founded in 330 BCE. Its members rejected the doctrines of the dogmatic school, preferring to rely on the observation of &quot;phantasiai&quot; (i.e., phenomena, the appearances). The Empiric school was closely allied with the Pyrrhonist school of philosophy, which made the philosophical case for their proto-empiricism. 

The notion of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; (&quot;clean slate&quot; or &quot;blank tablet&quot;) connotes a view of the mind as an originally blank or empty recorder (Locke used the words &quot;white paper&quot;) on which experience leaves marks. This denies that humans have innate ideas. The notion dates back to Aristotle, :

Aristotle&#x27;s explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense, but rather based on his theory of potentiality and actuality, and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the active &quot;nous&quot;. These notions contrasted with Platonic notions of the human mind as an entity that pre-existed somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body on Earth (see Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot; and &quot;Apology&quot;, as well as others). Aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than Plato, and commentators in the Middle Ages summarized one of his positions as &quot;nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu&quot; (Latin for &quot;nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses&quot;).

This idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the Stoic school, from about 330 BCE. Stoic epistemology generally emphasizes that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it. The doxographer Aetius summarizes this view as &quot;When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon.&quot;

===Islamic Golden Age and Pre-Renaissance (5th to 15th centuries CE)===

During the Middle Ages (from the 5th to the 15th century CE) Aristotle&#x27;s theory of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; was developed by Islamic philosophers starting with Al Farabi (), developing into an elaborate theory by Avicenna (c.  980 – 1037 CE) and demonstrated as a thought experiment by Ibn Tufail. For Avicenna (Ibn Sina), for example, the &quot;tabula rasa&quot; is a pure potentiality that is actualized through education, and knowledge is attained through &quot;empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts&quot; developed through a &quot;syllogistic method of reasoning in which observations lead to propositional statements which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts&quot;. The intellect itself develops from a material intellect (&quot;al-&#x27;aql al-hayulani&quot;), which is a potentiality &quot;that can acquire knowledge to the active intellect (&quot;al-&#x27;aql al-fa&#x27;il&quot;), the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge&quot;. So the immaterial &quot;active intellect&quot;, separate from any individual person, is still essential for understanding to occur.

In the 12th century CE, the Andalusian Muslim philosopher and novelist Abu Bakr Ibn Tufail (known as &quot;Abubacer&quot; or &quot;Ebu Tophail&quot; in the West) included the theory of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; as a thought experiment in his Arabic philosophical novel, &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot; in which he depicted the development of the mind of a feral child &quot;from a &quot;tabula rasa&quot; to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society&quot; on a desert island, through experience alone. The Latin translation of his philosophical novel, entitled &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;, published by Edward Pococke the Younger in 1671, had an influence on John Locke&#x27;s formulation of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;.

A similar Islamic theological novel, &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot;, was written by the Arab theologian and physician Ibn al-Nafis in the 13th century. It also dealt with the theme of empiricism through the story of a feral child on a desert island, but departed from its predecessor by depicting the development of the protagonist&#x27;s mind through contact with society rather than in isolation from society.

During the 13th century Thomas Aquinas adopted into scholasticism the Aristotelian position that the senses are essential to the mind. Bonaventure (1221–1274), one of Aquinas&#x27; strongest intellectual opponents, offered some of the strongest arguments in favour of the Platonic idea of the mind.

===Renaissance Italy===

In the late renaissance various writers began to question the medieval and classical understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way. In political and historical writing Niccolò Machiavelli and his friend Francesco Guicciardini initiated a new realistic style of writing. Machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the &quot;effectual truth&quot; instead. Their contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) said, &quot;If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings.&quot;

Significantly, an empirical metaphysical system was developed by the Italian philosopher Bernardino Telesio which had an enormous impact on the development of later Italian thinkers, including Telesio&#x27;s students Antonio Persio and Sertorio Quattromani, his contemporaries Thomas Campanella and Giordano Bruno, and later British philosophers such as Francis Bacon, who regarded Telesio as &quot;the first of the moderns&quot;. Telesio&#x27;s influence can also be seen on the French philosophers René Descartes and Pierre Gassendi.

The decidedly anti-Aristotelian and anti-clerical music theorist Vincenzo Galilei (c. 1520 – 1591), father of Galileo and the inventor of monody, made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems, firstly, of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments, and to volume of air in wind instruments; and secondly to composition, by his various suggestions to composers in his &quot;Dialogo della musica antica e moderna&quot; (Florence, 1581). The Italian word he used for &quot;experiment&quot; was &quot;esperimento&quot;. It is known that he was the essential pedagogical influence upon the young Galileo, his eldest son (cf. Coelho, ed. &quot;Music and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei&quot;), arguably one of the most influential empiricists in history. Vincenzo, through his tuning research, found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of &#x27;Pythagoras&#x27; hammers&#x27; (the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals, not the actual numbers, as believed), and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities, a radically empirical attitude developed, passed on to Galileo, which regarded &quot;experience and demonstration&quot; as the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of valid rational enquiry.

===British empiricism===

British empiricism, a retrospective characterization, emerged during the 17th century as an approach to early modern philosophy and modern science. Although both integral to this overarching transition, Francis Bacon, in England, first advocated for empiricism in 1620, whereas René Descartes, in France, laid the main groundwork upholding rationalism around 1640. (Bacon&#x27;s natural philosophy was influenced by Italian philosopher Bernardino Telesio and by Swiss physician Paracelsus.) Contributing later in the 17th century, Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza are retrospectively identified likewise as an empiricist and a rationalist, respectively. In the Enlightenment of the late 17th century, John Locke in England, and in the 18th century, both George Berkeley in Ireland and David Hume in Scotland, all became leading exponents of empiricism, hence the dominance of empiricism in British philosophy. The distinction between rationalism and empiricism was not formally made until Immanuel Kant, in Germany, around 1780, who sought to merge the two views.

In response to the early-to-mid-17th-century &quot;continental rationalism&quot;, John Locke (1632–1704) proposed in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1689) a very influential view wherein the &quot;only&quot; knowledge humans can have is &quot;a posteriori&quot;, i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a &quot;tabula rasa&quot;, a &quot;blank tablet&quot;, in Locke&#x27;s words &quot;white paper&quot;, on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person&#x27;s life proceeds are written. 

There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple were structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which is very different from the quest for certainty of Descartes.
A generation later, the Irish Anglican bishop George Berkeley (1685–1753) determined that Locke&#x27;s view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual atheism. In response to Locke, he put forth in his &quot;Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge&quot; (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things &quot;only&quot; exist either as a &quot;result&quot; of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.) In his text &quot;Alciphron&quot;, Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God. Berkeley&#x27;s approach to empiricism would later come to be called subjective idealism.

Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) responded to Berkeley&#x27;s criticisms of Locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of skepticism. Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, &quot;Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated. But to conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition.&quot; And,

Hume divided all of human knowledge into two categories: &quot;relations of ideas&quot; and &quot;matters of fact&quot; (see also Kant&#x27;s analytic-synthetic distinction). Mathematical and logical propositions (e.g. &quot;that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides&quot;) are examples of the first, while propositions involving some contingent observation of the world (e.g. &quot;the sun rises in the East&quot;) are examples of the second. All of people&#x27;s &quot;ideas&quot;, in turn, are derived from their &quot;impressions&quot;. For Hume, an &quot;impression&quot; corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation. To remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an &quot;idea&quot;. Ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations.
Hume maintained that no knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, can be conclusively established by reason. Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated &quot;habits&quot;, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method—that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume&#x27;s conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.

Hume concluded that such things as belief in an external world and belief in the existence of the self were not rationally justifiable. According to Hume these beliefs were to be accepted nonetheless because of their profound basis in instinct and custom. Hume&#x27;s lasting legacy, however, was the doubt that his skeptical arguments cast on the legitimacy of inductive reasoning, allowing many skeptics who followed to cast similar doubt.

===Phenomenalism===

Most of Hume&#x27;s followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is &quot;rationally&quot; unjustifiable, contending that Hume&#x27;s own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit. According to an extreme empiricist theory known as phenomenalism, anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences. 

Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist—hence the closely related term subjective idealism. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences. This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As John Stuart Mill put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the &quot;permanent possibility of sensation&quot;.
Mill&#x27;s empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for &quot;all&quot; meaningful knowledge including mathematics. As summarized by D.W. Hamlin:

Mill&#x27;s empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill&#x27;s position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill&#x27;s formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such &quot;groups of permanent possibilities of sensation&quot; might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. 

In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of &quot;reality&quot; that goes beyond mere &quot;possibilities of sensation&quot;, such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill&#x27;s formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the &quot;gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all&quot;. Thirdly, Mill&#x27;s position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.

The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data. If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. The translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. 

There is, however, no &quot;finite&quot; set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal. But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor&#x27;s normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the third man).

===Logical empiricism===

Logical empiricism (also &quot;logical positivism&quot; or &quot;neopositivism&quot;) was an early 20th-century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of British empiricism (e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge) with certain insights from mathematical logic that had been developed by Gottlob Frege and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Some of the key figures in this movement were Otto Neurath, Moritz Schlick and the rest of the Vienna Circle, along with A. J. Ayer, Rudolf Carnap and Hans Reichenbach.

The neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the methods, insights and discoveries of the sciences. They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848–1925) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege&#x27;s thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein&#x27;s idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the &quot;analytic&quot; (&quot;a priori&quot;) and the &quot;synthetic&quot; (&quot;a posteriori&quot;). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called &quot;verification principle&quot;. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable, is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.

In the extreme empiricism of the neopositivists—at least before the 1930s—any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions. In later years, Carnap and Neurath abandoned this sort of &quot;phenomenalism&quot; in favor of a rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics. That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called &quot;protocol sentences&quot;, for example, &quot;&quot;X&quot; at location &quot;Y&quot; and at time &quot;T&quot; observes such and such&quot;. The central theses of logical positivism (verificationism, the analytic–synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as Nelson Goodman, W. V. Quine, Hilary Putnam, Karl Popper, and Richard Rorty. By the late 1960s, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement had pretty much run its course, though its influence is still significant among contemporary analytic philosophers such as Michael Dummett and other anti-realists.

===Pragmatism===
In the late 19th and early 20th century, several forms of pragmatic philosophy arose. The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between Charles Sanders Peirce and William James when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s. James popularized the term &quot;pragmatism&quot;, giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of &quot;pragmaticism&quot;. Along with its &quot;pragmatic theory of truth&quot;, this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and rational (concept-based) thinking.
Charles Peirce (1839–1914) was highly influential in laying the groundwork for today&#x27;s empirical scientific method. Although Peirce severely criticized many elements of Descartes&#x27; peculiar brand of rationalism, he did not reject rationalism outright. Indeed, he concurred with the main ideas of rationalism, most importantly the idea that rational concepts can be meaningful and the idea that rational concepts necessarily go beyond the data given by empirical observation. In later years he even emphasized the concept-driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism, in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the &quot;data-driven&quot; strict-empiricist view.

Among Peirce&#x27;s major contributions was to place inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning in a complementary rather than competitive mode, the latter of which had been the primary trend among the educated since David Hume wrote a century before. To this, Peirce added the concept of abductive reasoning. The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today. Peirce&#x27;s approach &quot;presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them. According to Peirce&#x27;s doctrine of fallibilism, the conclusions of science are always tentative. The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions, but on its self-corrective character: by continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes, and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth&quot;.
In his Harvard &quot;Lectures on Pragmatism&quot; (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the &quot;three cotary propositions of pragmatism&quot; (L: &quot;cos, cotis&quot; whetstone), saying that they &quot;put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism&quot;. First among these, he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street. That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses. Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference, its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique—in a word, incorrigible. This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or &quot;thisness&quot;—what the Scholastics called its &quot;haecceity&quot;—that stands beyond control and correction. Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them. This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research, most recently for instance with the work of Irvin Rock on &quot;indirect perception&quot;.

Around the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842–1910) coined the term &quot;radical empiricism&quot; to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism—though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James&#x27;s published lectures. James maintained that the empirically observed &quot;directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous trans-empirical connective support&quot;, by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any value added by seeking supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. James&#x27; &quot;radical empiricism&quot; is thus &quot;not&quot; radical in the context of the term &quot;empiricism&quot;, but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term &quot;empirical&quot;. His method of argument in arriving at this view, however, still readily encounters debate within philosophy even today.

John Dewey (1859–1952) modified James&#x27; pragmatism to form a theory known as instrumentalism. The role of sense experience in Dewey&#x27;s theory is crucial, in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated. Dewey&#x27;s basic thought, in accordance with empiricism, was that reality is determined by past experience. Therefore, humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience. The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically, and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation, in physical sciences as in ethics. Thus, ideas in Dewey&#x27;s system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known &quot;a posteriori&quot;.

<doc id="10175" wikidata="Q1369726" url="?curid=10175" title="Estampie">
<text>The estampie (, Occitan and , ) is a medieval dance and musical form which was a popular instrumental and vocal form in the 13th and 14th centuries. The name was also applied to poetry.

==Musical form==
The estampie is similar in form to the lai, consisting of a succession of repeated notes. According to Johannes de Grocheio, there were both vocal and instrumental estampies (for which he used the Latin calque &quot;stantipes&quot;), which differed somewhat in form.

Grocheio calls the sections in both the French vocal and instrumental estampie &quot;puncta&quot; (singular &quot;punctus&quot;), Each &quot;puncta&quot; has a pair of lines that repeat the same melody, in the form:

:&quot;aa, bb, cc, etc.&quot;.

The two statements of the melody in each punctus differ only in their endings, described as &quot;apertum&quot; (&quot;open&quot;) and &quot;clausum&quot; (&quot;closed&quot;) by Grocheio, who believed that six &quot;puncta&quot; were standard for the stantipes (his term for the estampie), though he was aware of stantipes with seven &quot;puncta&quot;. The structure can therefore be diagrammed as:

:&quot;a+x, a+y; b+w, b+z; etc.&quot;.

In an instrumental estampie, the open and closed endings of the puncta are the same each time, so that the end of the &quot;punctum&quot; serves as the refrain, in the form:

&quot;a+x, a+y; b+x, b+y, c+x, c+y, etc.&quot;

In comparison to other dance forms, Grocheio considered the instrumental estampie &quot;complicated,&quot; with &quot;puncta&quot; of varying lengths This is in contrast to the more regular verse length of the ductia. There are also more &quot;puncta&quot; in an estampie than in a ductia. He further states that this difficulty captivates the attention of both the players and listeners because of these complications. According to Grocheio, the vocal estampie begins with a refrain, which is repeated at the end of each stanza, with text and melody independent of the stanza. However, surviving songs do not include a section labeled as a refrain, so some scholars suggest that a convention must have existed for choosing lines to use as a refrain. Like the instrumental form, the vocal dance was complicated enough to require concentration, which helps to distract young people from wicked thoughts.

== History ==
The estampie is the first known genre of medieval era dance music which continues to exist today. The earliest reported example of this musical form is the song &quot;Kalenda maya&quot;, written by the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras (1180–1207), possibly to a preexisting melody. 14th century examples include &quot;estampies&quot; with subtitles such as &quot;Isabella&quot; and &quot;Tre fontane&quot;.

== Instrumentation ==
Sources for individual songs do not generally indicate what instruments were used. However, according to Grocheio, the &quot;vielle&quot; was the supreme instrument of the period, and the &quot;stantipes&quot;, together with the cantus coronatus and ductia, were the principal forms played on &quot;vielles&quot; before the wealthy in their celebration. Though the estampie is generally monophonic, there are also two-voice compositions in the form of an estampie, such as the two for keyboard in the Robertsbridge Fragment. The French estampie was performed in a lively triple meter, a primary division of three beats to the bar.

==Dance==

==Etymology==
According to the &quot;OED&quot;, the name comes from the Provençal &quot;estampida&quot;, feminine of &quot;estampit&quot;, the past participle of &quot;estampir&quot; &quot;to resound&quot;.

<text>Experimental cancer treatments are mainstream medical therapies intended to treat cancer by improving on, supplementing or replacing conventional methods (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy). However, researchers are still trying to determine whether these treatments are safe and effective treatments. Experimental cancer treatments are normally available only to people who participate in formal research programs, which are called &quot;clinical trials&quot;. Occasionally, a seriously ill person may be able to access an experimental drug through an expanded access program. Some of the treatments have regulatory approval for treating other conditions. Health insurance and publicly funded health care programs normally refuse to pay for experimental cancer treatments.

The entries listed below vary between theoretical therapies to unproven controversial therapies. Many of these treatments are alleged to help against only specific forms of cancer. It is not a list of treatments widely available at hospitals.

==Studying cancer treatments==

The twin goals of research are to determine whether the treatment actually works (called efficacy) and whether it is sufficiently safe. Regulatory processes attempt to balance the potential benefits with the potential harms, so that people given the treatment are more likely to benefit from it than to be harmed by it.

Medical research for cancer begins much like research for any disease. In organized studies of new treatments for cancer, the pre-clinical development of drugs, devices, and techniques begins in laboratories, either with isolated cells or in small animals, most commonly rats or mice. In other cases, the proposed treatment for cancer is already in use for some other medical condition, in which case more is known about its safety and potential efficacy.

Clinical trials are the study of treatments in humans. The first-in-human tests of a potential treatment are called Phase I studies. Early clinical trials typically enroll a very small number of patients, and the purpose is to identify major safety issues and the &quot;maximum tolerated dose&quot;, which is the highest dose that does not produce serious or fatal adverse effects. The dose given in these trials may be far too small to produce any useful effect. In most research, these early trials may involve healthy people, but cancer studies normally enroll only people with relatively severe forms of the disease in this stage of testing. On average, 95% of the participants in these early trials receive no benefit, but all are exposed to the risk of adverse effects. Most participants show signs of optimism bias (the irrational belief that they will beat the odds).

Later studies, called Phase II and Phase III studies, enroll more people, and the goal is to determine whether the treatment actually works. Phase III studies are frequently randomized controlled trials, with the experimental treatment being compared to the current best available treatment rather than to a placebo. In some cases, the Phase III trial provides the best available treatment to all participants, in addition to some of the patients receiving the experimental treatment.

==Bacterial treatments==
Chemotherapeutic drugs have a hard time penetrating tumors to kill them at their core because these cells may lack a good blood supply. Researchers have been using anaerobic bacteria, such as &quot;Clostridium novyi&quot;, to consume the interior of oxygen-poor tumours. These should then die when they come in contact with the tumor&#x27;s oxygenated sides, meaning they would be harmless to the rest of the body. A major problem has been that bacteria do not consume all parts of the malignant tissue. However, combining the therapy with chemotherapeutic treatments can help to solve this problem.

Another strategy is to use anaerobic bacteria that have been transformed with an enzyme that can convert a non-toxic prodrug into a toxic drug. With the proliferation of the bacteria in the necrotic and hypoxic areas of the tumor, the enzyme is expressed solely in the tumor. Thus, a systemically applied prodrug is metabolised to the toxic drug only in the tumor. This has been demonstrated to be effective with the nonpathogenic anaerobe &quot;Clostridium sporogenes&quot;.

==Drug therapies==

===HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells)===

HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) is a molecular complex derived from human breast milk that kills tumor cells by a process resembling programmed cell death (apoptosis). , it had been tested in humans with skin papillomas and bladder cancer.

===p53 activation therapy===

Several drug therapies are being developed based on p53, the tumour suppressor gene that protects the cell in response to damage and stress. It is analogous to deciding what to do with a damaged car: p53 brings everything to a halt, and then decides whether to fix the cell or, if the cell is beyond repair, to destroy the cell. This protective function of p53 is disabled in most cancer cells, allowing them to multiply without check. Restoration of p53 activity in tumours (where possible) has been shown to inhibit tumour growth and can even shrink the tumour.

As p53 protein levels are usually kept low, one could block its degradation and allow large amounts of p53 to accumulate, thus stimulating p53 activity and its antitumour effects. Drugs that utilize this mechanism include nutlin and MI-219, which are both in phase I clinical trials. , there are also other drugs that are still in the preclinical stage of testing, such as RITA and MITA.

===BI811283===
BI811283 is a small molecule inhibitor of the aurora B kinase protein being developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for use as an anti-cancer agent. , BI 811283 is currently in the early stages of clinical development and is undergoing first-in-human trials in patients with solid tumors and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.

=== Itraconazole ===
Itraconazole, sometimes abbreviated ITZ, is an antifungal medication used to treat a number of fungal infections. Recent research works suggest itraconazole (ITZ) could also be used in the treatment of cancer by inhibiting the hedgehog pathway in a similar way to Sonidegib.

===Selective androgen receptor modulators===
The majority of breast cancers are androgen receptor (AR) positive and SARMs may help treat these cancers, although promising results have only been obtained with cancers that are both estrogen receptor (ER) positive and AR positive. Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) were historically used successfully to treat AR positive breast cancer, but were phased out after the development of anti-estrogen therapies, due to androgenic side effects and concerns about aromatization to estrogen. SARMs have some of the same therapeutic effects as AAS, but fewer side effects, and they cannot be aromatized. Although a trial on AR positive triple negative breast cancer was ended early due to lack of efficacy, ostarine showed benefits in some patients with ER+, AR+ metastatic breast cancer in a phase II study. In patients with more than 40 percent AR positivity as determined by immunohistochemistry, the clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 80 percent and the objective response rate (ORR) was 48 percent—which was considered promising given that the patients had advanced disease and had been heavily pretreated. In 2022, the FDA granted fast track designation to ostarine for AR+, ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. SARMs have also shown antitumor effects in prostate cancer.

==Gene therapy==
Introduction of tumor suppressor genes into rapidly dividing cells has been thought to slow down or arrest tumor growth. Adenoviruses are a commonly utilized vector for this purpose. Much research has focused on the use of adenoviruses that cannot reproduce, or reproduce only to a limited extent, within the patient to ensure safety via the avoidance of cytolytic destruction of noncancerous cells infected with the vector. However, new studies focus on adenoviruses that can be permitted to reproduce, and destroy cancerous cells in the process, since the adenoviruses&#x27; ability to infect normal cells is substantially impaired, potentially resulting in a far more effective treatment.

Another use of gene therapy is the introduction of enzymes into these cells that make them susceptible to particular chemotherapy agents; studies with introducing thymidine kinase in gliomas, making them susceptible to aciclovir, are in their experimental stage.

==Epigenetic options==

Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene activity that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence, often a result of environmental or dietary damage to the histone receptors within the cell. Current research has shown that epigenetic pharmaceuticals could be a putative replacement or adjuvant therapy for currently accepted treatment methods such as radiation and chemotherapy, or could enhance the effects of these current treatments. It has been shown that the epigenetic control of the proto-onco regions and the tumor suppressor sequences by conformational changes in histones directly affects the formation and progression of cancer. Epigenetics also has the factor of reversibility, a characteristic that other cancer treatments do not offer.

Some investigators, like Randy Jirtle, PhD, of Duke University Medical Center, think epigenetics may ultimately turn out to have a greater role in disease than genetics.

==Telomerase deactivation therapy==
Because most malignant cells rely on the activity of the protein telomerase for their immortality, it has been proposed that a drug that inactivates telomerase might be effective against a broad spectrum of malignancies. At the same time, most healthy tissues in the body express little if any telomerase, and would function normally in its absence. Currently, inositol hexaphosphate, which is available over-the-counter, is undergoing testing in cancer research due to its telomerase-inhibiting abilities.

A number of research groups have experimented with the use of telomerase inhibitors in animal models, and as of 2005 and 2006 phase I and II human clinical trials are underway. Geron Corporation is currently conducting two clinical trials involving telomerase inhibitors. One uses a vaccine (GRNVAC1) and the other uses a lipidated oligonucleotide (GRN163L).

==Radiation therapies==

===Photodynamic therapy===
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is generally a non-invasive treatment using a combination of light and a photosensitive drug, such as 5-ALA, Foscan, Metvix, padeliporfin (Tookad, WST09, WST11), Photofrin, or Visudyne. The drug is triggered by light of a specific wavelength.

===Hyperthermiatic therapy===
Localized and whole-body application of heat has been proposed as a technique for the treatment of malignant tumours. Intense heating will cause denaturation and coagulation of cellular proteins, rapidly killing cells within a tumour.

More prolonged moderate heating to temperatures just a few degrees above normal (39.5 °C) can cause more subtle changes. A mild heat treatment combined with other stresses can cause cell death by apoptosis. There are many biochemical consequences to the heat shock response within the cell, including slowed cell division and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation therapy. The purpose of overheating the tumor cells is to create a lack of oxygen so that the heated cells become overacidified, which leads to a lack of nutrients in the tumor. This in turn disrupts the metabolism of the cells so that cell death (apoptosis) can set in. In certain cases chemotherapy or radiation that has previously not had any effect can be made effective. Hyperthermia alters the cell walls by means of so-called heat shock proteins. The cancer cells then react very much more effectively to the cytostatics and radiation. If hyperthermia is used conscientiously it has no serious side effects.

There are many techniques by which heat may be delivered. Some of the most common involve the use of focused ultrasound (FUS or HIFU), microwave heating, induction heating, magnetic hyperthermia, and direct application of heat through the use of heated saline pumped through catheters. Experiments with carbon nanotubes that selectively bind to cancer cells have been performed. Lasers are then used that pass harmlessly through the body, but heat the nanotubes, causing the death of the cancer cells. Similar results have also been achieved with other types of nanoparticles, including gold-coated nanoshells and nanorods that exhibit certain degrees of &#x27;tunability&#x27; of the absorption properties of the nanoparticles to the wavelength of light for irradiation. The success of this approach to cancer treatment rests on the existence of an &#x27;optical window&#x27; in which biological tissue (i.e., healthy cells) are completely transparent at the wavelength of the laser light, while nanoparticles are highly absorbing at the same wavelength. Such a &#x27;window&#x27; exists in the so-called near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this way, the laser light can pass through the system without harming healthy tissue, and only diseased cells, where the nanoparticles reside, get hot and are killed.

Magnetic Hyperthermia makes use of magnetic nanoparticles, which can be injected into tumours and then generate heat when subjected to an alternating magnetic field.

One of the challenges in thermal therapy is delivering the appropriate amount of heat to the correct part of the patient&#x27;s body. A great deal of current research focuses on precisely positioning heat delivery devices (catheters, microwave, and ultrasound applicators, etc.) using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, as well as of developing new types of nanoparticles that make them particularly efficient absorbers while offering little or no concerns about toxicity to the circulation system. Clinicians also hope to use advanced imaging techniques to monitor heat treatments in real time—heat-induced changes in tissue are sometimes perceptible using these imaging instruments. In magnetic hyperthermia or magnetic fluid hyperthermia method, it will be easier to control temperature distribution by controlling the velocity of ferrofluid injection and size of magnetic nanoparticles.

===Noninvasive cancer heat treatment===
Heat treatment involves using radio waves to heat up tiny metals that are implanted in cancerous tissue. Gold nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes are the most likely candidate. Promising preclinical trials have been conducted, although clinical trials may not be held for another few years.

Another method that is entirely non-invasive referred to as Tumor Treating Fields has already reached clinical trial stage in many countries. The concept applies an electric field through a tumour region using electrodes external to the body. Successful trials have shown the process effectiveness to be greater than chemotherapy and there are no side-effects and only negligible time spent away from normal daily activities. This treatment is still in very early development stages for many types of cancer.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is still in investigatory phases in many places around the world. In China it has CFDA approval and over 180 treatment centres have been established in China, Hong Kong, and Korea. HIFU has been successfully used to treat cancer to destroy tumours of the bone, brain, breast, liver, pancreas, rectum, kidney, testes, and prostate. Several thousand patients have been treated with various types of tumours. HIFU has CE approval for palliative care for bone metastasis. Experimentally, palliative care has been provided for cases of advanced pancreatic cancer. High-energy therapeutic ultrasound could increase higher-density anti-cancer drug load and nanomedicines to target tumor sites by 20x fold higher than traditional target cancer therapy.

== Cold atmospheric plasma treatment ==
Cold atmospheric plasma or CAP for has been proposed for the treatment of solid tumors.

==Electromagnetic treatments==
Tumor Treating Fields is a novel FDA-approved cancer treatment therapy that uses alternating electric field to disturb the rapid cell division exhibited by cancer cells.

==Complementary and alternative treatments==
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments are the diverse group of medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that are not part of conventional medicine and have not been proven to be effective. &quot;Complementary medicine&quot; usually refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine, while &quot;alternative medicine&quot; refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine. CAM use is common among people with cancer.

Most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been rigorously studied or tested. Some alternative treatments that have been proven ineffective continue to be marketed and promoted.

<doc id="10183" wikidata="Q5381339" url="?curid=10183" title="Environmental movement in the United States">
<text>The organized environmental movement is represented by a wide range of non-governmental organizations or NGOs that seek to address environmental issues in the United States. They operate on local, national, and international scales. Environmental NGOs vary widely in political views and in the ways they seek to influence the environmental policy of the United States and other governments.

The environmental movement today consists of both large national groups and also many smaller local groups with local concerns. Some resemble the old U.S. conservation movement – whose modern expression is The Nature Conservancy, Audubon Society and National Geographic Society – American organizations with a worldwide influence. Increasingly that movement is organized around addressing climate change in the United States alongside interrelated issues like climate justice and broader environmental justice issues.

== Issues ==
==Scope of the movement==
* The early Conservation movement, which began in the late 19th century, included fisheries and wildlife management, water, soil conservation and sustainable forestry. Today it includes sustainable yield of natural resources, preservation of wilderness areas and biodiversity.
* The modern Environmental movement, which began in the 1960s with concern about air and water pollution, became broader in scope to include all landscapes and human activities. See List of environmental issues.
* Environmental health movement dating at least to Progressive Era (the 1890s - 1920s) urban reforms including clean water supply, more efficient removal of raw sewage and reduction in crowded and unsanitary living conditions. Today Environmental health is more related to nutrition, preventive medicine, ageing well and other concerns specific to the human body&#x27;s well-being.
* Sustainability movement which started in the 1980s focused on Gaia theory, value of Earth and other interrelations between human sciences and human responsibilities. Its spinoff deep ecology was more spiritual but often claimed to be science.
As public awareness and the environmental sciences have improved in recent years, environmental issues have broadened to include key concepts such as &quot;sustainability&quot; and also new emerging concerns such as ozone depletion, global warming, acid rain, land use and biogenetic pollution.

Environmental movements often interact or are linked with other social movements, e.g. for peace, human rights, and animal rights; and against nuclear weapons and/or nuclear power, endemic diseases, poverty, hunger, etc.

Some US colleges are now going green by signing the &quot;President&#x27;s Climate Commitment,&quot; a document that a college President can sign to enable said colleges to practice environmentalism by switching to solar power, etc.

==History==
Native Americans are frequently categorized as &quot;the original environmentalists&quot;, however this assertion is frequently challenged for being overly simplistic. Early European settlers came to the United States brought from Europe the concept of the commons. In the colonial era, access to natural resources was allocated by individual towns, and disputes over fisheries or land use were resolved at the local level. Changing technologies, however, strained traditional ways of resolving disputes of resource use, and local governments had limited control over powerful special interests. For example, the damming of rivers for mills cut off upriver towns from fisheries; logging and clearing of forest in watersheds harmed local fisheries downstream. In New England, many farmers became uneasy as they noticed clearing of the forest changed stream flows and a decrease in bird population which helped control insects and other pests. These concerns become widely known with the publication of &quot;Man and Nature&quot; (1864) by George Perkins Marsh. The environmental impact method of analysis is generally the main mode for determining what issues the environmental movement is involved in. This model is used to determine how to proceed in situations that are detrimental to the environment by choosing the way that is least damaging and has the fewest lasting implications.

===Conservation movement===
Conservation first became a national issue during the progressive era&#x27;s conservation movement (1890s - 1920s). The early national conservation movement shifted emphasis to scientific management which favored larger enterprises and control began to shift from local governments to the states and the federal government.(Judd) Some writers credit sportsmen, hunters and fishermen with the increasing influence of the conservation movement. In the 1870s sportsman magazines such as &quot;American Sportsmen&quot;, &quot;Forest and Stream&quot;, and &quot;Field and Stream&quot; are seen as leading to the growth of the conservation movement.(Reiger) This conservation movement also urged the establishment of state and national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, and national monuments intended to preserve noteworthy natural features.
Conservation groups focus primarily on an issue that&#x27;s origins are rooted in general expansion. As industrialization became more prominent as well as the increasing trend towards urbanization the conservative environmental movement began. Contrary to popular belief conservation groups are not against expansion in general, instead, they are concerned with efficiency with resources and land development.

===Progressive era===

Theodore Roosevelt and his close ally George Bird Grinnell, were motivated by the wanton waste that was taking place at the hand of market hunting. This practice resulted in placing a large number of North American game species on the edge of extinction. Roosevelt recognized that the laissez-faire approach of the U.S. Government was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government. The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources. To accomplish the mission, Roosevelt and Grinnell formed the Boone and Crockett Club in 1887. The club was made up of the best minds and influential men of the day. The Boone and Crockett Club&#x27;s contingency of conservationists, scientists, politicians, and intellectuals became Roosevelt&#x27;s closest advisers during his march to preserve wildlife and habitat across North America. As president, Theodore Roosevelt became a prominent conservationist, putting the issue high on the national agenda. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter, Gifford Pinchot. Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources and is considered to be the nation&#x27;s first conservation President. He encouraged the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land for national parks and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined.

Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of five National Parks, and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act, under which he proclaimed 18 new U.S. National Monuments. He also established the first 51 Bird Reserves, four Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests, including Shoshone National Forest, the nation&#x27;s first. The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately .

Gifford Pinchot had been appointed by McKinley as chief of Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture. In 1905, his department gained control of the national forest reserves. Pinchot promoted private use (for a fee) under federal supervision. In 1907, Roosevelt designated of new national forests just minutes before a deadline.

In May 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the Conference of Governors held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: &quot;Conservation as a National Duty.&quot;

In 1903 Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with John Muir, who had a very different view of conservation and tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests. Working through the Sierra Club he founded, Muir succeeded in 1905 in having Congress transfer the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley to the National Park Service. While Muir wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot&#x27;s formulation, &quot;to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees.&quot; Muir and the Sierra Club vehemently opposed the damming of the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite in order to provide water to the city of San Francisco. Roosevelt and Pinchot supported the dam, as did President Woodrow Wilson. The Hetch Hetchy dam was finished in 1923 and is still in operation, but the Sierra Club still wants to tear it down.

Other influential conservationists of the Progressive Era included George Bird Grinnell (a prominent sportsman who founded the Boone and Crockett Club), the Izaak Walton League and John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club in 1892. Conservationists organized the National Parks Conservation Association, the Audubon Society, and other groups that still remain active.

===New Deal===
Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1933–45), like his cousin Theodore Roosevelt, was an ardent conservationist. He used numerous programs of the departments of Agriculture and Interior to end wasteful land-use, mitigate the effects of the Dust Bowl, and efficiently develop natural resources in the West. One of the most popular of all New Deal programs was the Civilian Conservation Corps (1933–1943), which sent two million poor young men to work in rural and wilderness areas, primarily on conservation projects.

===Post-1945===
After World War II increasing encroachment on wilderness land evoked the continued resistance of conservationists, who succeeded in blocking a number of projects in the 1950s and 1960s, including the proposed Bridge Canyon Dam that would have backed up the waters of the Colorado River into the Grand Canyon National Park.

The Inter-American Conference on the Conservation of Renewable Natural Resources met in 1948 as a collection of nearly 200 scientists from all over the Americans forming the trusteeship principle that:

&quot;No generation can exclusively own the renewable resources by which it lives. We hold the commonwealth in trust for prosperity, and to lessen or destroy it is to commit treason against the future&quot;

====Beginning of the modern movement====
During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, several events occurred which raised the public awareness of harm to the environment caused by man. In 1954, the 23 man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel &quot;Lucky Dragon&quot; was exposed to radioactive fallout from a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll. By 1969, the public reaction to an ecologically catastrophic oil spill from an offshore well in California&#x27;s Santa Barbara Channel, Barry Commoner&#x27;s protest against nuclear testing, along with Rachel Carson&#x27;s 1962 book &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, and Paul R. Ehrlich&#x27;s &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; (1968) all added anxiety about the environment. Pictures of Earth from space emphasized that the earth was small and fragile.

As the public became more aware of environmental issues, concern about air pollution, water pollution, solid waste disposal, dwindling energy resources, radiation, pesticide poisoning (particularly use of DDT as described in Carson&#x27;s influential &quot;Silent Spring&quot;), noise pollution, and other environmental problems engaged a broadening number of sympathizers. That public support for environmental concerns was widespread became clear in the Earth Day demonstrations of 1970.

Several books after the middle of the 20th century contributed to the rise of American environmentalism (as distinct from the longer-established conservation movement), especially among college and university students and the more literate public. One was the publication of the first textbook on ecology, &quot;Fundamentals of Ecology,&quot; by Eugene Odum and Howard Odum, in 1953. Another was the appearance of the Carson&#x27;s 1962 best-seller &quot;Silent Spring.&quot; Her book brought about a whole new interpretation of pesticides by exposing their harmful effects in nature. From this book, many began referring to Carson as the &quot;mother of the environmental movement&quot;. Another influential development was a 1965 lawsuit, &quot;Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission,&quot; opposing the construction of a power plant on Storm King Mountain in New York (state), which is said to have given birth to modern United States environmental law. The wide popularity of &quot;The Whole Earth Catalogs&quot;, starting in 1968, was quite influential among the younger, hands-on, activist generation of the 1960s and 1970s. Recently, in addition to opposing environmental degradation and protecting wilderness, an increased focus on coexisting with natural biodiversity has appeared, a strain that is apparent in the movement for sustainable agriculture and in the concept of Reconciliation Ecology.

During his time as U.S President, Lyndon Johnson would sign over 300 environment protection measures into law. This was credited as forming the legal basis of the modern environmental movement.

====Wilderness preservation====

In the modern wilderness preservation movement, important philosophical roles are played by the writings of John Muir who had been activist in the late 19th and early 20th century. Along with Muir perhaps most influential in the modern movement is Henry David Thoreau who published Walden in 1854. Also important was forester and ecologist Aldo Leopold, one of the founders of the Wilderness Society in 1935, who wrote a classic of nature observation and ethical philosophy, &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot;, (1949).

There is also a growing movement of campers and other people who enjoy outdoor recreation activities to help preserve the environment while spending time in the wilderness.

====Anti-nuclear movement====

The anti-nuclear movement in the United States consists of more than 80 anti-nuclear groups that have acted to oppose nuclear power or nuclear weapons, or both, in the United States. These groups include the Abalone Alliance, Clamshell Alliance, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, Nuclear Information and Resource Service, and Physicians for Social Responsibility. The anti-nuclear movement has delayed construction or halted commitments to build some new nuclear plants, and has pressured the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to enforce and strengthen the safety regulations for nuclear power plants.

Anti-nuclear protests reached a peak in the 1970s and 1980s and grew out of the environmental movement. Campaigns which captured national public attention involved the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, Diablo Canyon Power Plant, Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, and Three Mile Island. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City&#x27;s Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history. International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protests were held on June 20, 1983, at 50 sites across the United States.
There were many Nevada Desert Experience protests and peace camps at the Nevada Test Site during the 1980s and 1990s.

More recent campaigning by anti-nuclear groups has related to several nuclear power plants including the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Power Plant, Indian Point Energy Center, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, Salem Nuclear Power Plant, and Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant. There have also been campaigns relating to the Y-12 Nuclear Weapons Plant, the Idaho National Laboratory, proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, the Hanford Site, the Nevada Test Site, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and transportation of nuclear waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Some scientists and engineers have expressed reservations about nuclear power, including: Barry Commoner, S. David Freeman, John Gofman, Arnold Gundersen, Mark Z. Jacobson, Amory Lovins, Arjun Makhijani, Gregory Minor, Joseph Romm and Benjamin K. Sovacool. Scientists who have opposed nuclear weapons include Linus Pauling and Eugene Rabinowitch.

====Antitoxics groups====

Antitoxics groups are a subgroup that is affiliated with the Environmental Movement in the United States, that is primarily concerned with the effects that cities and their by-products have on humans. This aspect of the movement is a self-proclaimed &quot;movement of housewives&quot;. Concern around the issues of groundwater contamination and air pollution rose in the early 1980s and individuals involved in antitoxics groups claim that they are concerned for the health of their families.
A prominent case can be seen in the Love Canal Homeowner&#x27;s association (LCHA); in this case, a housing development was built on a site that had been used for toxic dumping by the Hooker Chemical Company. As a result of this dumping, the residents had symptoms of skin irritation, Lois Gibbs, a resident of the development, started a grassroots campaign for reparations. Eventual success led to the government having to purchase homes that were sold in the development.

====Federal legislation in the 1970s====
Prior to the 1970s the protection of basic air and water supplies was a matter mainly left to each state. During the 1970s, the primary responsibility for clean air and water shifted to the federal government. Growing concerns, both environmental and economic, from cities and towns as well as sportsman and other local groups, and senators such as Maine&#x27;s Edmund S. Muskie, led to the passage of extensive legislation, notably the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. Other legislation included the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which established the Council on Environmental Quality; the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Safe Drinking Water Act (1974), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (1976), the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1977, which became known as the Clean Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as the Superfund Act (1980). These laws regulated public drinking water systems, toxic substances, pesticides, and ocean dumping; and protected wildlife, wilderness, and wild and scenic rivers. Moreover, the new laws provide for pollution research, standard setting, contaminated site cleanup, monitoring, and enforcement.

The creation of these laws led to a major shift in the environmental movement. Groups such as the Sierra Club shifted focus from local issues to becoming a lobby in Washington and new groups, for example, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense, arose to influence politics as well. (Larson)

===Renewed focus on local action===
In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sought to curtail the scope of environmental protection taking steps such as appointing James G. Watt. The major environmental groups responded with mass mailings which led to increased membership and donations.

When industry groups lobbied to weaken regulation and a backlash against environmental regulations, the so-called wise use movement gained importance and influence.(Larson)

===Attacks on environmental activists===
In the early 1990s, multiple environmental activists in the United States became targets of arson attacks. In 1991, Greenpeace toxics researcher Pat Costner’s Arkansas home was set on fire, and Maine anti-logging activist Michael Vernon narrowly escaped a similar attack. In October 1993, Leroy Jackson, a Native American environmentalist, was found dead in his van in New Mexico shortly before he was scheduled to testify in Washington, D.C., against the clearcutting of old-growth trees on Navajo land.

===&quot;Post-environmentalism&quot;===
In 2004, with the environmental movement seemingly stalled, some environmentalists started questioning whether &quot;environmentalism&quot; was even a useful political framework. According to a controversial essay titled &quot;The Death of Environmentalism&quot; (Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus, 2004) American environmentalism has been remarkably successful in protecting the air, water, and large stretches of wilderness in North America and Europe, but these environmentalists have stagnated as a vital force for cultural and political change.

Shellenberger and Nordhaus wrote, &quot;Today environmentalism is just another special interest. Evidence for this can be found in its concepts, its proposals, and its reasoning. What stands out is how arbitrary environmental leaders are about what gets counted and what doesn&#x27;t as &#x27;environmental.&#x27; Most of the movement&#x27;s leading thinkers, funders, and advocates do not question their most basic assumptions about who we are, what we stand for, and what it is that we should be doing.&quot; Their essay was followed by a speech in San Francisco called &quot;Is Environmentalism Dead?&quot; by former Sierra Club President, Adam Werbach, who argued for the evolution of environmentalism into a more expansive, relevant and powerful progressive politics. Werbach endorsed building an environmental movement that is more relevant to average Americans and controversially chose to lead Wal-Mart&#x27;s effort to take sustainability mainstream.

These &quot;post-environmental movement&quot; thinkers argue that the ecological crises the human species faces in the 21st century are qualitatively different from the problems the environmental movement was created to address in the 1960s and 1970s. They argue that climate change and habitat destruction are global and more complex, therefore demanding far deeper transformations of the economy, the culture and political life. The consequence of environmentalism&#x27;s outdated and arbitrary definition, they argue, is a political irrelevancy.

These &quot;politically neutral&quot; groups tend to avoid global conflicts and view the settlement of inter-human conflict as separate from regard for nature – in direct contradiction to the ecology movement and peace movement which have increasingly close links: while Green Parties, Greenpeace, and groups like the ACTivist Magazine regard ecology, biodiversity, and an end to non-human extinction as an absolute basis for peace, the local groups may not, and see a high degree of global competition and conflict as justifiable if it lets them preserve their own local uniqueness. However, such groups tend not to &quot;burn out&quot; and to sustain for long periods, even generations, protecting the same local treasures.

Local groups increasingly find that they benefit from collaboration, e.g. on consensus decision-making methods, or making simultaneous policy, or relying on common legal resources, or even sometimes a common glossary. However, the differences between the various groups that make up the modern environmental movement tend to outweigh such similarities, and they rarely co-operate directly except on a few major global questions. In a notable exception, over 1,000 local groups from around the country united for a single day of action as part of the Step It Up 2007 campaign for real solutions to global warming.

Groups such as The Bioregional Revolution are calling on the need to bridge these differences, as the converging problems of the 21st century they claim compel the people to unite and to take decisive action. They promote bioregionalism, permaculture, and local economies as solutions to these problems, overpopulation, global warming, global epidemics, and water scarcity, but most notably to &quot;peak oil&quot; – the prediction that the country is likely to reach a maximum in global oil production which could spell drastic changes in many aspects of the residents&#x27; everyday lives.

==Criticisms==

Some people are skeptical of the environmental movement and feel that it is more deeply rooted in politics than science. Although there have been serious debates about climate change and effects of some pesticides and herbicides that mimic animal sex steroids, science has shown that some of the claims of environmentalists have credence.

Novelist Michael Crichton appeared before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on September 28, 2005, to address concerns and recommended the employment of double-blind experimentation in environmental research. Crichton suggested that because environmental issues are so political in nature, policymakers need neutral, conclusive data to base their decisions on, rather than conjecture and rhetoric, and double-blind experiments are the most efficient way to achieve that aim.

A consistent theme acknowledged by both supporters and critics (though more commonly vocalized by critics) of the environmental movement is that we know very little about the Earth we live in. Most fields of environmental studies are relatively new, and therefore what research we have is limited and does not date far enough back for us to completely understand long-term environmental trends. This has led a number of environmentalists to support the use of the precautionary principle in policy-making, which ultimately asserts that we don&#x27;t know how certain actions may affect the environment and because there is reason to believe they may cause more harm than good we should refrain from such actions.

===Elitist===

In the December 1994 &quot;Wild Forest Review,&quot; Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair wrote &quot;The mainstream environmental movement was elitist, highly paid, detached from the people, indifferent to the working class, and a firm ally of big government...The environmental movement is now accurately perceived as just another well-financed and cynical special interest group, its rancid infrastructure supported by Democratic Party operatives and millions in grants from corporate foundations.&quot;

Many environmental organizations lack diversity, including often white women as the main demographic. However, environmental problems are experienced differently by different social groups, including black versus white groups. For the middle class white population in the US, environmental issues have often included pollution, barriers to recreational activities, etc.. On the other hand, for people of color, environmental issues were often life or death including issues of &quot;smoke, soot, dust, . . . fumes gases, stench, and carbon monoxide.&quot; In the past environmental organizations have focused &quot;on preserving natural resources and endangered species instead of protecting people of color from hazardous waste sites being built in their communities&quot;. When environmental organizations appoint people of color to positions of leadership, the focus will often shift more towards focus on these major, life-threatening issues. However, a significant 2014 State of Diversity in Environmental Organizations study found that the percentage of minorities working for environmental organizations has never exceeded 16% and less than 12% have achieved positions of leadership.

===Wilderness myth===

Historians have criticized the modern environmental movement for having romantic idealizations of wilderness. William Cronon writes &quot;wilderness serves as the unexamined foundation on which so many of the quasi-religious values of modern environmentalism rest.&quot; Cronon claims that &quot;to the extent that we live in an urban-industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness, to just that extent we give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead.&quot;

Similarly Michael Pollan has argued that the wilderness ethic leads people to dismiss areas whose wildness is less than absolute. In his book &quot;Second Nature,&quot; Pollan writes that &quot;once a landscape is no longer &#x27;virgin&#x27; it is typically written off as fallen, lost to nature, irredeemable.&quot;

===Debates within the movement===
Within the environmental movement, an ideological debate has taken place between those with an ecocentric viewpoint and an anthropocentric viewpoint. The anthropocentric view has been seen as the conservationist approach to the environment with nature viewed, at least in part, as a resource to be used by man. In contrast to the conservationist approach the ecocentric view, associated with John Muir, Henry David Thoreau and William Wordsworth referred to as the preservationist movement. This approach sees nature in a more spiritual way. Many environmental historians consider the split between John Muir and Gifford Pinchot. During the preservation/conservation debate, the term preservationist becomes to be seen as a pejorative term.

While the ecocentric view focused on biodiversity and wilderness protection the anthropocentric view focuses on urban pollution and social justice. Some environmental writers, for example, William Cronon have criticized the ecocentric view as have a dualist view as a man being separate from nature. Critics of the anthropocentric viewpoint contend that the environmental movement has been taken over by so-called leftist with an agenda beyond environmental protection.

==Environmentalism and politics==
Environmentalists gained popularity in American politics after the creation or strengthening of numerous US environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and the formation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. These successes were followed by the enactment of a series of laws regulating waste including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; Toxic substances, (Toxic Substances Control Act); Pesticides (FIFRA: Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act); clean-up of polluted sites (Superfund); protection of endangered species (Endangered Species Act).

Fewer environmental laws have been passed in the last decade as corporations and other conservative interests have increased their influence over American politics. Corporate cooperation against environmental lobbyists has been organized by the Wise Use group. At the same time, many environmentalists have been turning toward other means of persuasion, such as working with business, community, and other partners to promote sustainable development. Since the 1970s, coalitions and interests groups have directed themselves along the democrat and republican party lines.

Much environmental activism is directed towards conservation as well as the prevention or elimination of pollution. However, conservation movements; ecology movements; peace movements; green parties; green- and eco-anarchists often subscribe to very different ideologies, while supporting the same goals as those who call themselves &quot;environmentalists&quot;. To outsiders, these groups or factions can appear to be indistinguishable.

As human population and industrial activity continue to increase, environmentalists often find themselves in serious conflict with those who believe that human and industrial activities should not be overly regulated or restricted, such as some libertarians.

Environmentalists often clash with others, particularly corporate interests, over issues of the management of natural resources, like in the case of the atmosphere as a &quot;carbon dump&quot;, the focus of climate change, and global warming controversy. They usually seek to protect commonly owned or unowned resources for future generations.

== Environmental justice in the United States ==
Environmental justice is a movement that began in the U.S. in the 1980s and seeks an end to environmental racism. Environmental justice (EJ) did not come into regular use until 1982 when Warren County, a predominantly African American community, became a site for toxic waste dumping. This sparked protests which eventually led to the arrest of 414 peaceful African American protestors. In 1987, the publication of the United Church of Christ (UCC) Commission for Racial Justice&#x27;s report &quot;Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States&quot; offered the first clear description of environmental racism (ER). ER looks different in different communities, and each context requires distinct policies and actions. Closely related to ER, the environmental justice movement is also grassroots in practice and &quot;importantly, a movement, which means that it starts and lives with the people&quot;.

Often, low-income and minority communities are located close to highways, garbage dumps, and factories, where they are exposed to greater pollution and environmental health risk than the rest of the population. The Environmental Justice movement seeks to link &quot;social&quot; and &quot;ecological&quot; environmental concerns, while at the same time keeping environmentalists conscious of the dynamics in their own movement, i.e. racism, sexism, homophobia, classicism, and other malaises of the dominant culture.

In 1991, the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit drafted the 17 principles of environmental justice calling for an &quot;appreciation of our diverse cultural perspectives&quot; along with the &quot;ecological unity and the interdependence of all species, and the right to be free from ecological destruction&quot;. Throughout the EJ movement there has been a focus on everyone being safe from environmental harms including pollution, hazardous wastes, land access, and also the ability of all to participate in decision-making. Over time, the main principle that has developed within the movement is &quot;We speak for ourselves&quot; meaning those within the community experiencing the environmental injustice should be the leaders of change.

=== Major US environmental justice organizations ===
* Communities for a Better Environment: An organization founded in 1978 in San Francisco, California with the main mission of building power for low-income and communities of color to ultimately achieve environmental justice. They focus on reducing pollution and helping to create healthy, environmentally-friendly communities. In order to create action to tackle such an encompassing mission, CBE follows a threefold approach including community organizing, legal advocacy, and science. CBE, focuses on bringing marginalized communities together to create power and hence change in environmental decisions in their local areas. Volunteers from throughout the community come together to participate in door-knocking, community meetings, school groups, and various other educational opportunities. Today Communities for a Better Environment has expanded into Wisconsin and Minnesota.
* West Harlem Environmental Action: An organization founded in 1988 in New York city by community members foregrounding environmental racism within their community. West Harlem Environmental Action, now known as We Act, works on issues of climate justice, ensuring community-based participatory research, and participatory democracy are upheld within their organization and throughout the Harlem community. They mainly tackle issues of air regulation, pollution, and fair land use. Today, We Act has expanded to Washington, D.C.
* Indigenous Environmental Network: An organization founded in 1990 in North America with the main mission of uniting indigenous communities to protect &quot;sacred sites, land, water, air, natural resources, health of both our people and all living things, and to build economically sustainable communities&quot;. IEN works with tribes to increase environmental education, organization, and in turn inspire action. IEN has expanded its reach globally, in recent years, providing global meetings to Indigenous communities on indigenous environmental issues.
* Climate Justice Alliance: An organization founded in 2013 in Detroit, Michigan with the main mission of uniting communities and organizations to following the just transition theory, versus the exploitative economic system in place. They place a strong emphasis on race, gender, and class in creating this transition. With creating this link between organizations and communities they hope to inspire action towards confronting climate change and the economy that creates it. Climate Justice Alliance focuses on making the transition within local communities to &quot;clean community energy, regional food systems, zero waste, efficient, affordable, and durable housing, public transportation, ecosystem restoration and stewardship within scientific planetary boundaries&quot;. Climate Justice Alliance has currently expanded in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and North Carolina.

===Environmental rights===
Many environmental lawsuits turn on the question of who has standing; are the legal issues limited to property owners, or does the general public have a right to intervene? Christopher D. Stone&#x27;s 1972 essay, &quot;Should trees have standing?&quot; seriously addressed the question of whether natural objects themselves should have legal rights, including the right to participate in lawsuits. Stone suggested that there was nothing absurd in this view, and noted that many entities now regarded as having legal rights were, in the past, regarded as &quot;things&quot; that were regarded as legally rightless; for example, aliens, children and women. His essay is sometimes regarded as an example of the fallacy of hypostatization.

One of the earliest lawsuits to establish that citizens may sue for environmental and aesthetic harms was Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, decided in 1965 by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The case helped halt the construction of a power plant on Storm King Mountain in New York State. See also United States environmental law and David Sive, an attorney who was involved in the case.

Conservation biology is an important and rapidly developing field. One way to avoid the stigma of an &quot;ism&quot; was to evolve early anti-nuclear groups into the more scientific Green Parties, sprout new NGOs such as Greenpeace and Earth Action, and devoted groups to protecting global biodiversity and preventing global warming and climate change. But in the process, much of the emotional appeal, and many of the original aesthetic goals were lost. Nonetheless, these groups have well-defined ethical and political views, backed by science.

===Radical environmentalism===
While most environmentalists are often mainstream and peaceful, other groups are more radical in their approach. Adherents of radical environmentalism and ecological anarchism are involved in direct action campaigns to protect the environment. Some campaigns have employed controversial tactics including sabotage, blockades, and arson, while most use peaceful protests such as marches, tree sitting, and the like. There is substantial debate within the environmental movement as to the acceptability of these tactics, but almost all environmentalists condemn violent actions that can harm humans.

==== Clashes by police ====
In 2023, for the first time in the history of the United States, the police killed an environmental activist during a protest. The protesters were camping in Atlanta&#x27;s South River Forest, a natural area that the City of Atlanta and Police planned to raze in order to erect a police training facility to be called &quot;Cop City.&quot; Police attacked protesters on 18 January 2023. One protester, Tortuguita or, Manuel Esteban Páez Terán was killed and seven more were arrested.

<text>The Eastern Orthodox Church, officially the Orthodox Catholic Church, and also called the Greek Orthodox Church or simply the Orthodox Church, is one of the three major doctrinal and jurisdictional groups of Christianity, with approximately 230 million baptised members. It operates as a communion of autocephalous churches, each governed by its bishops via local synods. The church has no central doctrinal or governmental authority analogous to the pope of the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is recognised by them as &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (&quot;first among equals&quot;), a title formerly given to the patriarch of Rome. As one of the oldest surviving religious institutions in the world, the Eastern Orthodox Church has played an especially prominent role in the history and culture of Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Currently, the Eastern Orthodox Church is in the midst of a major ongoing schism between Constantinople and Moscow, with the two not in full communion with each other.

Eastern Orthodox theology is based on the Scriptures and holy tradition, which incorporates the dogmatic decrees of the seven ecumenical councils, and the teaching of the Church Fathers. The church teaches that it is the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church established by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, and that its bishops are the successors of Christ&#x27;s apostles. It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, as passed down by holy tradition. Its patriarchates, descending from the pentarchy, and other autocephalous and autonomous churches, reflect a variety of hierarchical organisation. It recognises seven major sacraments (which are called holy mysteries), of which the Eucharist is the principal one, celebrated liturgically in synaxis. The church teaches that through consecration invoked by a priest, the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the God-bearer and honoured in devotions.

The Churches of Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch—except for some breaks of communion such as the Photian schism or the Acacian schism—shared communion with the Church of Rome until the East–West Schism in 1054. The 1054 schism was the culmination of mounting theological, political, and cultural disputes, particularly over the authority of the pope, between those churches. Before the Council of Ephesus in AD 431, the Church of the East also shared in this communion, as did the various Oriental Orthodox Churches before the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, all separating primarily over differences in Christology.

The Eastern Orthodox Church is the primary religious confession in Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Greece, Belarus, Serbia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova, North Macedonia, Cyprus, and Montenegro. Eastern Orthodox Christians are also one of the main religious groups in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo, as well as a significant group in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and other countries in the Middle East. Roughly half of Eastern Orthodox Christians live in the post Eastern Bloc countries, mostly in Russia. The communities in the former Byzantine regions of North Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean are among the oldest Orthodox communities from the Middle East, which are decreasing due to forced migration driven by increased religious persecution. Eastern Orthodox communities outside Western Asia, Asia Minor, Caucasia and Eastern Europe, including those in North America, Western Europe, and Australia, have been formed through diaspora, conversions, and missionary activity.
== Name and characteristics ==

=== Definition ===

The Eastern Orthodox Church is defined as the Eastern Christians which recognise the seven ecumenical councils and usually are in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the Patriarchate of Alexandria, the Patriarchate of Antioch, and the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The Eastern Orthodox churches &quot;are defined positively by their adherence to the dogmatic definitions of the seven [ecumenical] councils, by the strong sense of not being a sect or a denomination but simply continuing the Christian church, and, despite their varied origins, by adherence to the Byzantine rite&quot;. Those churches are negatively defined by their rejection of papal immediate and universal supremacy.

The seven ecumenical councils recognised by the Eastern Orthodox churches are: Nicaea I, Constantinople I, Ephesus, Chalcedon, Constantinople II, Constantinople III, and Nicaea II. Those churches consider the Quinisext Council &quot;shar[es] the ecumenical authority of Constantinople III. &quot;By an agreement that appears to be in place in the [Eastern] Orthodox world, possibly the council held in 879 to vindicate the Patriarch Photius will at some future date be recognized as the eighth [ecumenical] council&quot; by the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Western Rite Orthodoxy exists both outside and inside Eastern Orthodoxy. Within Eastern Orthodoxy, it is practised by a vicariate of the Antiochian Orthodox church.

=== Name ===

In keeping with the church&#x27;s teaching on universality and with the Nicene Creed, Eastern Orthodox authorities such as Raphael of Brooklyn have insisted that the full name of the church has always included the term &quot;Catholic&quot;, as in &quot;Holy Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Church&quot;.

The official name of the Eastern Orthodox Church is the &quot;Orthodox Catholic Church&quot;. It is the name by which the church refers to itself and which is issued in its liturgical or canonical texts. Eastern Orthodox theologians refer to the church as Catholic. This name and longer variants containing &quot;Catholic&quot; are also recognised and referenced in other books and publications by secular or non-Eastern Orthodox writers. The catechism of Philaret (Drozdov) of Moscow published in the 19th century is titled: &quot;The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church&quot; ().

From ancient times through the first millennium, Greek was the most prevalent shared language in the demographic regions where the Byzantine Empire flourished, and Greek, being the language in which the New Testament was written, was the primary liturgical language of the church. For this reason, the eastern churches were sometimes identified as &quot;Greek&quot; (in contrast to the &quot;Roman&quot; or &quot;Latin&quot; church, which used a Latin translation of the Bible), even before the Great Schism of 1054. After 1054, &quot;Greek Orthodox&quot; or &quot;Greek Catholic&quot; marked a church as being in communion with Constantinople, much as &quot;Catholic&quot; did for communion with the Catholic Church.

In Hungarian, the church is still commonly called &quot;Eastern Greek&quot; (). This identification with Greek, however, became increasingly confusing with time. Missionaries brought Eastern Orthodoxy to many regions without ethnic Greeks, where the Greek language was not spoken. In addition, struggles between Rome and Constantinople to control parts of Southeastern Europe resulted in the conversion of some churches to the Catholic Church, which then also used &quot;Greek Catholic&quot; to indicate their continued use of the Byzantine rites. Today, only a minority of Eastern Orthodox adherents use Greek as the language of worship.

&quot;Eastern&quot;, then, indicates the geographical element in the church&#x27;s origin and development, while &quot;Orthodox&quot; indicates the faith, as well as communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. There are additional Christian churches in the east that are in communion with neither the Catholic Church nor the Eastern Orthodox Church, who tend to be distinguished by the category named &quot;Oriental Orthodox&quot;. While the Eastern Orthodox Church continues officially to call itself &quot;Catholic&quot;, for reasons of universality, the common title of &quot;Eastern Orthodox Church&quot; avoids casual confusion with the Catholic Church.

=== Orthodoxy ===

The first known use of the phrase &quot;the catholic Church&quot; (&quot;he katholike ekklesia&quot;) occurred in a letter written about AD 110 from one Greek church to another (Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyrnaeans). The letter states: &quot;Wheresoever the bishop shall appear, there let the people be, even as where Jesus may be, there is the universal [katholike] Church.&quot; Thus, almost from the beginning, Christians referred to the Christian Church as the &quot;one, holy, catholic (from the Greek καθολική, &#x27;according to the whole, universal&#x27;) and apostolic Church&quot;. The Eastern Orthodox Church claims that it is today the continuation and preservation of that same early church.

A number of other Christian churches also make a similar claim: the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Assyrian Church, and the Oriental Orthodox. In the Eastern Orthodox view, the Assyrians and Orientals left the Orthodox Church in the years following the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus (431) and the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451), respectively, in their refusal to accept those councils&#x27; Christological definitions. Similarly, the churches in Rome and Constantinople separated in an event known as the East–West Schism, traditionally dated to the year 1054, although it was more a gradual process than a sudden break.

To all these churches, the claim to catholicity (universality, oneness with the ancient Church) is important for multiple doctrinal reasons that have more bearing internally in each church than in their relation to the others, now separated in faith. The meaning of holding to a faith that is true is the primary reason why anyone&#x27;s statement of which church split off from which other has any significance at all; the issues go as deep as the schisms. The depth of this meaning in the Eastern Orthodox Church is registered first in its use of the word &quot;Orthodox&quot; itself, a union of Greek &quot;orthos&quot; (&quot;straight&quot;, &quot;correct&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;right&quot;) and &quot;doxa&quot; (&quot;common belief&quot;, from the ancient verb δοκέω-δοκῶ which is translated &quot;to believe&quot;, &quot;to think&quot;, &quot;to consider&quot;, &quot;to imagine&quot;, &quot;to assume&quot;).

The dual meanings of &quot;doxa&quot;, with &quot;glory&quot; or &quot;glorification&quot; (of God by the church and of the church by God), especially in worship, yield the pair &quot;correct belief&quot; and &quot;true worship&quot;. Together, these express the core of a fundamental teaching about the inseparability of belief and worship and their role in drawing the church together with Christ. All Slavic churches use the title &quot;Pravoslavie&quot; (), meaning &quot;correctness of glorification&quot;, to denote what is in English &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;, while the Georgians use the title &quot;Martlmadidebeli&quot;.

The term &quot;Eastern Church&quot; (the geographic east in the East–West Schism) has been used to distinguish it from western Christendom (the geographic West, which at first came to designate the Catholic communion, later also the various Protestant and Anglican branches). &quot;Eastern&quot; is used to indicate that the highest concentrations of the Eastern Orthodox Church presence remain in the eastern part of the Christian world, although it is growing worldwide. Orthodox Christians throughout the world use various ethnic or national jurisdictional titles, or more inclusively, the title &quot;Eastern Orthodox&quot;, &quot;Orthodox Catholic&quot;, or simply &quot;Orthodox&quot;.

What unites Orthodox Christians is the catholic faith as carried through holy tradition. That faith is expressed most fundamentally in scripture and worship, and the latter most essentially through baptism and in the Divine Liturgy.

The lines of even this test can blur, however, when differences that arise are not due to doctrine, but to recognition of jurisdiction. As the Eastern Orthodox Church has spread into the west and over the world, the church as a whole has yet to sort out all the inter-jurisdictional issues that have arisen in the expansion, leaving some areas of doubt about what is proper church governance. Moreover, as in the ancient church persecutions, the aftermath of persecutions of Christians in communist nations has complicated some issues of governance that have yet to be completely resolved.

All members of the Eastern Orthodox Church profess the same faith, regardless of race or nationality, jurisdiction or local custom, or century of birth. Holy tradition encompasses the understandings and means by which that unity of faith is transmitted across boundaries of time, geography, and culture. It is a continuity that exists only inasmuch as it lives within Christians themselves. It is not static, nor an observation of rules, but rather a sharing of observations that spring both from within and also in keeping with others, even others who lived lives long past. The church proclaims the Holy Spirit maintains the unity and consistency of holy tradition to preserve the integrity of the faith within the church, as given in the scriptural promises.

Orthodoxy asserts that its shared beliefs, and its theology, exist within holy tradition and cannot be separated from it, and that their meaning is not expressed in mere words alone; that doctrine cannot be understood unless it is prayed; and that it must also be lived in order to be prayed, that without action, the prayer is idle, empty, and in vain, and therefore the theology of demons.

=== Catholicity ===

The Eastern Orthodox Church considers itself to be both orthodox and catholic. The doctrine of the Catholicity of the Church, as derived from the Nicene Creed, is essential to Eastern Orthodox ecclesiology. The term &quot;Catholicity of the Church&quot; (Greek ) is used in its original sense, as a designation for the universality of the Christian Church, centred around Christ. Therefore, the Eastern Orthodox notion of catholicity is not centred around any singular see, unlike the Catholic Church which has one earthly centre.

Due to the influence of the Catholic Church in the west, where the English language itself developed, the words &quot;catholic&quot; and &quot;catholicity&quot; are sometimes used to refer to that church specifically. However, the more prominent dictionary sense given for general use is still the one shared by other languages, implying breadth and universality, reflecting comprehensive scope. In a Christian context, the Christian Church, as identified with the original church founded by Christ and his apostles, is said to be catholic (or universal) in regard to its union with Christ in faith.

Just as Christ is indivisible, so are union with him and faith in him, whereby the Christian Church is &quot;universal&quot;, unseparated, and comprehensive, including all who share that faith. Orthodox bishop Kallistos Ware has called that &quot;simple Christianity&quot;. That is the sense of early and patristic usage wherein the church usually refers to itself as the &quot;Catholic Church&quot;, whose faith is the &quot;Orthodox faith&quot;. It is also the sense within the phrase &quot;one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church&quot;, found in the Nicene Creed, and referred to in Orthodox worship, e.g. in the litany of the catechumens in the Divine Liturgy.

With the mutual excommunications of the East–West Schism in 1054, the churches in Rome and Constantinople each viewed the other as having departed from the true church, leaving a smaller but still-catholic church in place. Each retained the &quot;Catholic&quot; part of its title, the &quot;&quot;Roman&quot; Catholic Church&quot; (or Catholic Church) on the one hand, and the &quot;&quot;Orthodox&quot; Catholic Church&quot; on the other, each of which was defined in terms of inter-communion with either Rome or Constantinople. While the Eastern Orthodox Church recognises what it shares in common with other churches, including the Catholic Church, it sees catholicity in terms of complete union in communion and faith, with the Church throughout all time, and the sharing remains incomplete when not shared fully.

== History ==

=== Early Church ===

Paul and the Apostles travelled extensively throughout the Roman Empire, including Asia Minor, establishing churches in major communities, with the first churches appearing in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, then in Antioch, Ethiopia, Egypt, Rome, Alexandria, Athens, Thessalonica, Illyricum, and Byzantium, which centuries later would become prominent as the New Rome. Christianity encountered considerable resistance in the Roman Empire, mostly because its adherents refused to comply with the demands of the Roman state—often even when their lives were threatened—by offering sacrifices to the pagan gods. Despite persecution, skepticism, and initial social stigma, the Christian Church spread, particularly following the conversion of Emperor Constantine I in AD 312.

By the fourth century, Christianity was present in numerous regions well beyond the Levant. A number of influential schools of thought had arisen, particularly the Alexandrian and Antiochian philosophical approaches. Other groups, such as the Arians, had also managed to gain influence. However, their positions caused theological conflicts within the church, thus prompting the Emperor Constantine to call for a great ecumenical synod in order to define the church&#x27;s position against the growing, often widely diverging, philosophical and theological interpretations of Christianity. He made it possible for this council to meet not only by providing a location, but by offering to pay for the transportation of all the existing bishops of the church. Most modern Christian churches regard this synod, commonly called the First Council of Nicaea or more generally the First Ecumenical Council, as of major importance.

=== Ecumenical councils ===

Several doctrinal disputes from the fourth century onwards led to the calling of ecumenical councils. In the Orthodox Church, an ecumenical council is the supreme authority that can be invoked to resolve contested issues of the faith. As such, these councils have been held to resolve the most important theological matters that came to be disputed within the Christian Church. Many lesser disagreements were resolved through local councils in the areas where they arose, before they grew significant enough to require an ecumenical council.

There are seven councils authoritatively recognised as ecumenical by the Eastern Orthodox Church:
# The First Ecumenical Council was convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325 and presided over by the Patriarch Alexander of Alexandria, with over 300 bishops condemning the view of Arius that the Son is a created being inferior to the Father.
# The Second Ecumenical Council was held at Constantinople in 381, presided over by the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, with 150 bishops, defining the nature of the Holy Spirit against those asserting His inequality with the other persons of the Trinity.
# The Third Ecumenical Council is that of Ephesus in 431, presided over by the Patriarch of Alexandria, with 250 bishops, which affirmed that Mary is truly &quot;Birthgiver&quot; or &quot;Mother&quot; of God (&quot;Theotokos&quot;), contrary to the teachings of Nestorius.
# The Fourth Ecumenical Council is that of Chalcedon in 451, Patriarch of Constantinople presiding, 500 bishops, affirmed that Jesus is truly God and truly man, without mixture of the two natures, contrary to Monophysite teaching.
# The Fifth Ecumenical Council is the second of Constantinople in 553, interpreting the decrees of Chalcedon and further explaining the relationship of the two natures of Jesus; it also condemned the alleged teachings of Origen on the pre-existence of the soul, etc.
# The Sixth Ecumenical Council is the third of Constantinople in 681; it declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the Monothelites.
# The Seventh Ecumenical Council was called under the Empress Regent Irene of Athens in 787, known as the second of Nicaea. It supports the veneration of icons while forbidding their worship. It is often referred to as &quot;The Triumph of Orthodoxy&quot;.

There are also two other councils which are considered ecumenical by some Eastern Orthodox:

* The Fourth Council of Constantinople was called in 879. It restored Photius to his See in Constantinople and condemned any alteration of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381.
* The Fifth Council of Constantinople was actually a series of councils held between 1341 and 1368. It affirmed the hesychastic theology of Gregory Palamas and condemned the philosopher Barlaam of Calabria.

=== Other major councils ===
In addition to these councils, there have been a number of other significant councils meant to further define the Eastern Orthodox position. They are the Synods of Constantinople, in 1484, 1583, 1755, 1819, and 1872, the Synod of Iași in 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox Synod of Jerusalem in 1672. Another council convened in June 2016 to discuss many modern phenomena, other Christian confessions, Eastern Orthodoxy&#x27;s relation with other religions and fasting disciplines.

=== Roman/Byzantine Empire ===

Constantinople is generally considered to be the centre and the &quot;cradle of Orthodox Christian civilisation&quot;. From the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe. Eastern Christian culture reached its golden age during the high point of the Byzantine Empire and continued to flourish in Ukraine and Russia, after the fall of Constantinople. Numerous autocephalous churches were established in Europe: Greece, Georgia, Ukraine, as well as in Russia and Asia.

In the 530s the Church of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) was built in Constantinople under Emperor Justinian I. Beginning with subsequent Byzantine architecture, Hagia Sophia became the paradigmatic Orthodox church form and its architectural style was emulated by Ottoman mosques a thousand years later. Being the episcopal see of the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, it remained the world&#x27;s largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years, until Seville Cathedral was completed in 1520. Hagia Sophia has been described as &quot;holding a unique position in the Christian world&quot;, and architectural and cultural icon of Byzantine and Eastern Orthodox civilisation, and it is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture and is said to have &quot;changed the history of architecture&quot;.

=== Early schisms ===

There are the &quot;Nestorian&quot; churches resulted from the reaction of the Council of Ephesus (431), which are the earliest surviving Eastern Christian churches that keep the faith of only the first two ecumenical councils, i.e., the First Council of Nicaea (325) and the First Council of Constantinople (381) as legitimate. &quot;Nestorian&quot; is an outsider&#x27;s term for a tradition that predated the influence of Nestorius, the origin of which might lie in certain sections of the School of Antioch or via Nestorius&#x27; teachers Theodore of Mopsuestia or Diodore of Tarsus. The modern incarnation of the &quot;Nestorian Church&quot; is commonly referred to as &quot;the Assyrian Church&quot; or fully as the Assyrian Church of the East.

The church in Egypt (Patriarchate of Alexandria) split into two groups following the Council of Chalcedon (451), over a dispute about the relation between the divine and human natures of Jesus. Eventually this led to each group anathematising the other. Those that remained in communion with the other patriarchs (by accepting the Council of Chalcedon) are known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria, where the adjective &quot;Greek&quot; refers to their ties to the Greek-speaking culture of the Byzantine Empire.

Those who disagreed with the findings of the Council of Chalcedon were the majority in Egypt. Today they are known as the Coptic Orthodox Church, having maintained a separate patriarchate. The Coptic Orthodox Church is currently the largest Christian church in Egypt and in the whole Middle East. There was also a similar, albeit smaller scale, split in Syria (Patriarchate of Antioch), which resulted in the separation of the Syriac Orthodox Church from the Byzantine Patriarchate of Antioch.

Those who disagreed with the Council of Chalcedon are sometimes called &quot;Oriental Orthodox&quot; to distinguish them from the &quot;Eastern Orthodox&quot;, who accepted the Council of Chalcedon. Oriental Orthodox are also sometimes referred to as &quot;non-Chalcedonians&quot;, or &quot;anti-Chalcedonians&quot;. The Oriental Orthodox Church denies that it is monophysite and prefers the term &quot;miaphysite&quot;, to denote the &quot;united&quot; nature of Jesus (two natures united into one) consistent with Cyril&#x27;s theology: &quot;The term union ... signifies the concurrence in one reality of those things which are understood to be united&quot; and &quot;the Word who is ineffably united with it in a manner beyond all description&quot; (Cyril of Alexandria, &quot;On the Unity of Christ&quot;). This is also defined in the Coptic liturgy, where it is mentioned &quot;He made it [his humanity] one with his divinity without mingling, without confusion and without alteration&quot;, and &quot;His divinity parted not from his humanity for a single moment nor a twinkling of an eye.&quot; They do not accept the teachings of Eutyches, or Eutychianism. Both the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches formally believe themselves to be the continuation of the true church.

=== Conversion of the South and East Slavs ===

In the ninth and tenth centuries, Christianity made great inroads into pagan Europe, including Bulgaria (864) and later Kievan Rus&#x27; (988). This work was made possible by Cyril and Methodius of Thessaloniki, two brothers chosen by Byzantine emperor Michael III to fulfil the request of Rastislav of Moravia for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own language. Cyril and Methodius began translating the divine liturgy, other liturgical texts, and the Gospels along with some other scriptural texts into local languages; with time, as these translations were copied by speakers of other dialects, the hybrid literary language Church Slavonic was created. Originally sent to convert the Slavs of Great Moravia, Cyril and Methodius were forced to compete with Frankish missionaries from the Roman diocese; their disciples were driven out of Great Moravia in AD 886 and emigrated to Bulgaria.

After the Christianisation of Bulgaria in 864, the disciples of Cyril and Methodius in Bulgaria, the most important being Clement of Ohrid and Naum of Preslav, were of great importance to the Orthodox faith in the First Bulgarian Empire. In a short time they managed to prepare and instruct the future Bulgarian clergy into the biblical texts and in AD 870 the Fourth Council of Constantinople granted the Bulgarians the oldest organised autocephalous Slavic Orthodox Church, which shortly thereafter became Patriarchate. The success of the conversion of the Bulgarians facilitated the conversion of the East Slavs. A major event in this effort was the development of the Cyrillic script in Bulgaria, at the Preslav Literary School in the ninth century; this script, along with the liturgical Old Church Slavonic, also called Old Bulgarian, was declared official in Bulgaria in 893.

The work of Cyril and Methodius and their disciples had a major impact on the Serbs as well. They accepted Christianity collectively along familial and tribal lines, a gradual process that occurred between the seventh and ninth centuries. In commemoration of their baptisms, each Serbian family or tribe began to celebrate an exclusively Serbian custom called Slava (patron saint) in a special way to honour the saint on whose day they received the sacrament of baptism. It is the most solemn day of the year for all Serbs of the Orthodox faith and has played a role of vital importance in the history of the Serbian people. Slava remains a celebration of the conversion of the Serbian people, which the church blessed and proclaimed a church institution.

The missionaries to the East and South Slavs had great success in part because they used the people&#x27;s native language rather than Greek, the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire, or Latin, as the Roman priests did. Perhaps the greatest legacy of their efforts is the Russian Orthodox Church, which is the largest of the Orthodox churches.

=== Great Schism (1054) ===

In the 11th century, what was recognised as the Great Schism took place between Rome and Constantinople, which led to separation between the Church of the West, the Catholic Church, and the Eastern Byzantine churches, now the Orthodox. There were doctrinal issues like the filioque clause and the authority of the Roman Pope involved in the split, but these were greatly exacerbated by political factors of both Church and state, and by cultural and linguistic differences between Latins and Greeks. Regarding papal supremacy, the Eastern half grew disillusioned with the Pope&#x27;s centralisation of power, as well as his blatant attempts of excluding the Eastern half in regard to papal approvals. It had previously been the case that the emperor would have a say when a new Pope was elected, but towards the high Middle Ages, the Christians in Rome were slowly consolidating power and removing Byzantine influence. However, even before this exclusionary tendency from the West, well before 1054, the Eastern and Western halves of the Church were in perpetual conflict, particularly during the periods of Eastern iconoclasm and the Photian schism.

The final breach is often considered to have arisen after the capture and sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204; the final break with Rome occurred circa 1450. The sacking of Church of Holy Wisdom and establishment of the Latin Empire as a seeming attempt to supplant the Orthodox Byzantine Empire in 1204 is viewed with some rancour to the present day. In 2004, Pope John Paul II extended a formal apology for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204, which had also been strongly condemned by the Pope at the time, Innocent III; the apology was formally accepted by Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. However, many items stolen during this time, such as holy relics and riches, are still held in various European cities, particularly Venice.

Reunion was attempted twice, at the 1274 Second Council of Lyon and the 1439 Council of Florence. The Council of Florence briefly reestablished communion between East and West, which lasted until after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. In each case, however, the councils were rejected by the Orthodox people as a whole, and the union of Florence also became very politically difficult after Constantinople came under Ottoman rule. However, in the time since, several local Orthodox Christian churches have renewed union with Rome, known as the Eastern Catholic Churches. Recent decades have seen a renewal of ecumenical spirit and dialogue between the Catholic and Orthodox churches.

=== Greek Church under Ottoman rule ===

The Byzantine Empire never fully recovered from the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Over the next two centuries, it entered a precipitous decline in both territory and influence. In 1453, a much-diminished Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottoman Empire, ending what was once the most powerful state in the Orthodox Christian world, if not in all Christendom. By this time Egypt, another major centre of Eastern Christianity, had been under Muslim control for some seven centuries; most Eastern Orthodox communities across southeastern Europe gradually came under Ottoman rule by the 16th century.

Under the Ottomans, the Greek Orthodox Church acquired substantial power as an autonomous &quot;millet&quot;. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the &quot;Rûm&quot;, an Ottoman administrative unit meaning &quot;Roman&quot;, which encompassed all Orthodox subjects of the Empire regardless of ethnicity. While legally subordinate to Muslims and subject to various restrictions, the Orthodox community was generally tolerated until the rise of nationalist movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and left to govern its own internal affairs, both religiously and legally. Until the empire&#x27;s dissolution in the early 20th century, Orthodox Christians would remain the largest non-Muslim minority, and at times among the wealthiest and most politically influential.

During the period 1914–1923 in Asia Minor (Anatolia) the Greek genocide took place by the Ottomans. During the Greek genocide, many Orthodox Christians were persecuted and killed. The culmination of the martyrdom was the Asia Minor Catastrophe with the killing of a large number of Orthodox. Among them, 347 clergymen of the Smyrna region and Metropolitan of Smyrna Chrysostomos were tortured and killed. The period 1923–1924 was followed by the obligatory population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

=== Russian Orthodox Church in the Russian Empire ===

By the time most Orthodox communities came under Muslim rule in the mid 15th century, Orthodoxy was very strong in Russia, which had maintained close cultural and political ties with the Byzantine Empire; roughly two decades after the fall of Constantinople, Ivan III of Russia married Sophia Palaiologina, a niece of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI, and styled himself Tsar (&quot;Caesar&quot;) or &quot;imperator&quot;. In 1547, his grandson Ivan IV, a devout Orthodox Christian, cemented the title as &quot;Tsar of All Rus&quot;, establishing Russia&#x27;s first centralised state with divinely appointed rulers. In 1589, the Patriarchate of Constantinople granted autocephalous status to Moscow, the capital of what was now the largest Orthodox Christian polity; the city thereafter referred to itself as the Third Rome —the cultural and religious heir of Constantinople.

Until 1666, when Patriarch Nikon was deposed by the tsar, the Russian Orthodox Church had been independent of the State. In 1721, the first Russian Emperor, Peter I, abolished completely the patriarchate and effectively made the church a department of the government, ruled by a most holy synod composed of senior bishops and lay bureaucrats appointed by the Emperor himself. Over time, Imperial Russia would style itself a protector and patron of all Orthodox Christians, especially those within the Ottoman Empire.

For nearly 200 years, until the Bolsheviks&#x27; October Revolution of 1917, the Russian Orthodox Church remained, in effect, a governmental agency and an instrument of tsarist rule. It was used to varying degrees in imperial campaigns of Russification, and was even allowed to levy taxes on peasants. The church&#x27;s close ties with the state came to a head under Nicholas I (1825–1855), who explicitly made Orthodoxy a core doctrine of imperial unity and legitimacy. The Orthodox faith became further tied to Russian identity and nationalism, while the church was further subordinated to the interests of the state. Consequently, Russian Orthodox Church, along with the imperial regime to which it belonged, came to be presented as an enemy of the people by the Bolsheviks and other Russian revolutionaries.

=== Eastern Orthodox churches under Communist rule ===


After the October Revolution of 1917, part of the clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church fled abroad to escape Bolshevik persecutions, founding an independent church in exile, which reunified with its Russian counterpart in 2007. Some actions against Orthodox priests and believers along with execution included torture, being sent to prison camps, labour camps or mental hospitals. In the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.

After Nazi Germany&#x27;s attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. However, in 1959, Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. It is estimated that 50,000 clergy had been executed between the revolution and the end of the Khrushchev era. Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the KGB. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.

Albania was the only state to have declared itself officially fully atheist. In some other Communist states such as Romania, the Romanian Orthodox Church as an organisation enjoyed relative freedom and even prospered, albeit under strict secret police control. That, however, did not rule out demolishing churches and monasteries as part of broader systematisation (urban planning), and state persecution of individual believers. As an example of the latter, Romania stands out as a country which ran a specialised institution where many Orthodox (along with people of other faiths) were subjected to psychological punishment or torture and mind control experimentation in order to force them give up their religious convictions. However, this was only supported by one faction within the regime, and lasted only three years. The Communist authorities closed down the prison in 1952, and punished many of those responsible for abuses (twenty of them were sentenced to death).

=== Post-Communism to 21st century ===
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the subsequent Fall of Communist governments across the Orthodox world, there has been marked growth in Christian Orthodoxy, particularly in Russia. According to the Pew Research Religion &amp; Public Life Project, between 1991 and 2008, the share of Russian adults identifying as Orthodox Christian rose from 31 per cent to 72 per cent, based on analysis of three waves of data (1991, 1998 and 2008) from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), a collaborative effort involving social scientists in about 50 countries.

Pew research conducted in 2017 found a doubling in the global Orthodox population since the early 20th century, with the greatest resurgence in Russia. In the former Soviet Union—where the largest Orthodox communities live—self-identified Orthodox Christians generally report low levels of observance and piety: In Russia, only 6% of Orthodox Christian adults reported attending church at least weekly, 15% say religion is &quot;very important&quot; in their lives, and 18% say they pray daily; other former Soviet republics display similarly low levels of religious observance.

==== Moscow–Constantinople schisms ====
=====1996=====

Since 1923, the Orthodox Church of Estonia separated from the Russian Orthodox Church due to the imprisonment of Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow, and the church in the Republic of Estonia falling out of communication with the Russian Church. They petitioned to be placed under direct control of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, operating as an autonomous church. In 1944 the Soviet Union annexed Estonia and outlawed the Orthodox Church of Estonia, forcefully bringing their churches back under the control of the Moscow Patriarch. However, the church&#x27;s Primate, Metropolitan Aleksander, fled to Sweden with 21 clergymen and 8,000 followers and established a synod there operating there throughout the Cold War.

In 1993, the synod of the Orthodox Church of Estonia in Exile was re-registered and on 20 February 1996, Bartholomew I of Constantinople restored the church&#x27;s position as subordinate to Constantinople, not Moscow. Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow, who had been born in Estonia, rejected this loss of territory, and severed ties with Patriarch Bartholomew on February 23, removing his name from the diptychs. The two sides would then negotiate in Zürich, and a settlement was reached on 16 May 1996. In it, the ethnically Estonian population of Estonia would be under the jurisdiction of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, while the ethnically Russian population of Estonia would be under the jurisdiction of the Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. After signing the document the Russian Church restored communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

=====2018=====

Since the Baptism of Rus&#x27; in 867 the Orthodox church in Ukraine was led by the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; who was subordinate to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and was largely governed by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth since the territory was conquered in the Galicia–Volhynia Wars, ending in 1392. Poland-Lithuania lost the territory to Russia as part of the peace deal of the Great Northern War in 1654. In 1686 Dionysius IV of Constantinople transferred the territory to the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus&#x27;. In 1924, Orthodox churches in Ukraine besides the Metropolitan of Kyiv were placed under the jurisdiction of the Polish Orthodox Church by the Ecumenical Patriarch as an autonomous church, however, the Russian Church never agreed to nor recognised this transfer, mostly due to Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow and most of the Russian Church&#x27;s leaders being imprisoned by Soviet officials. The Soviet Union, initially, had a policy of repression against the Orthodox Church, regardless of its denomination. However, after the start of the Nazi Invasion of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin transformed the Russian Church into a propaganda tool to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. Following Soviet victory in the war, various autonomous and Independent Orthodox churches around eastern Europe were forcefully integrated or reintegrated into the Russian Church, including the church in Ukraine. Many of the church&#x27;s leaders at this time were installed and closely monitored by the NKVD to ensure the church&#x27;s support for the Soviet Union.

This situation led to the rise of rival, anti-Russian and anti-Soviet churches within Ukraine, including the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC), founded in 1917 which declared itself the restored autonomous church that existed prior to 1686 but had been eradicated within Soviet Ukraine by the 1930s. The church was largely supported by Ukrainian émigrés and diaspora, and was restored as a legally recognised church by the Ukrainian government in 1991. In 1992, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP) came into existence, being founded by members of the Russian Church defrocked for insubordination, alongside support with the Ukrainian émigré community. The church submitted a request for Ukrainian autocephaly at its founding synod in Kyiv in 1992. These churches were competing with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC-MP), the Russian Church in Ukraine.

On 11 October 2018, the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople revoked the Russian Church&#x27;s letter of issue, allowing them to ordain the Metropolitan of Kyiv, re-established a in Kyiv, and lifted the Russian Church&#x27;s excommunication of members of the UAOC and the UOC-KP. In response, on 15 October, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church severed all ties with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and barred all members of the Russian Church from receiving communion or sacraments from any churches with ties to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. On 15 December 2018, the UAOC and UOC-KP voted to merge in the Unification council of the Eastern Orthodox churches of Ukraine, forming the restored Orthodox Church of Ukraine, with Epiphanius I of Ukraine, of the UOC-KP, becoming the first primate of the unified church. On 5 January 2019, Bartholomew I signed the official tomos that granted autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

In addition to severing ties with the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the Russian Church has also severed communion with Archbishop Ieronymos II of Athens primate of the Church of Greece, Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria, and Archbishop Chrysostomos II of Cyprus. In response to the severing of ties with the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox Churches in Western Europe (AROCWE), voted to dissolve itself, although the vote failed, it resulted in a split in AROCWE, with several churches leaving to form the &quot;Vicariate of Russian Tradition of the Metropolis of France&quot;, while , head of the AROCWE, personally joined the Russian Church. Additionally, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the UOC-MP severed all ties with the Russian Church.

== Organisation and leadership ==


The Eastern Orthodox Church is a fellowship of autocephalous (; &quot;self-headed&quot;) churches, with the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople recognised as having &quot;primus inter pares&quot; status. The patriarch of Constantinople has the honour of primacy, but his title is only &quot;first among equals&quot; and he has no real authority over churches other than the Constantinopolitan church. Rather, his role is limited to defined prerogatives interpreted by the ecumenical patriarch. At times, though, the office of the ecumenical patriarch has been accused of Constantinopolitan or Eastern papism.

The Eastern Orthodox Church considers Jesus Christ to be the head of the Church and the Church to be his body. It is believed that Church authority and the grace of God is directly passed down to Orthodox bishops and other clergy through the laying on of hands—a practice started by the New Testament apostlesand that this unbroken historical link is an essential element of the true church (; ; ) The Eastern Orthodox Church asserts that apostolic succession requires apostolic faith, and bishops without apostolic faith, who are in heresy, forfeit their claim to apostolic succession. Orthodox churches differentiate themselves from other Christian churches by practising &quot;ritual and liturgy... rich in mystery and symbolism,&quot; similar to their views on the sacraments.

The Eastern Orthodox communion is organised into several regional churches, which are either autocephalous or lower-ranking autonomous (&quot;self-governing&quot;) church bodies unified in theology and worship. These include the fourteen autocephalous churches of the Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, Georgia, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Serbia, Russia, Greece, Poland, Romania, Albania, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which were officially invited to the Pan-Orthodox Council of 2016; the Orthodox Church in America formed in 1970; the autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine created in 2019; the Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric, granted autocephaly by the Serbian Orthodox Church in 2022; and a number of autonomous churches. Each church has a ruling bishop and a holy synod to administer its jurisdiction and lead the Eastern Orthodox Church in the preservation and teaching of the apostolic and traditions and church practices.

Each bishop has a territory (see) over which he governs. His main duty is to make sure the traditions and practices of the Eastern Orthodox Church are preserved. Bishops are equal in authority and cannot interfere in the jurisdiction of another bishop. Administratively, these bishops and their territories are organised into various autocephalous groups or synods of bishops who gather together at least twice each year to discuss the state of affairs within their respective sees. While bishops and their autocephalous synods have the ability to administer guidance in individual cases, their actions do not usually set precedents that affect the entire Eastern Orthodox Church. Bishops are almost always chosen from the monastic ranks and must remain unmarried.

=== Church councils ===

The ecumenical councils followed a democratic form, with each bishop having one vote. Though present and allowed to speak before the council, members of the Imperial Roman/Byzantine court, abbots, priests, deacons, monks and laymen were not allowed to vote. The primary goal of these great synods was to verify and confirm the fundamental beliefs of the Great Christian Church as truth, and to remove as heresy any false teachings that would threaten the Christian Church. The pope of Rome at that time held the position of &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (&quot;first among equals&quot;) and, while he was not present at any of the councils, he continued to hold this title until the East–West Schism of 1054.

Other councils have helped to define the Eastern Orthodox position, specifically the Quinisext Council, the Synods of Constantinople, 879–880, 1341, 1347, 1351, 1583, 1819, and 1872, the Synod of Iași, 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox Synod of Jerusalem, 1672; the Pan-Orthodox Council, held in Greece in 2016, was the only such Eastern Orthodox council in modern times.

According to Eastern Orthodox teaching the position of &quot;first among equals&quot; gives no additional power or authority to the bishop that holds it, but rather that this person sits as organisational head of a council of equals (like a president).

One of the decisions made by the First Council of Constantinople (the second ecumenical council, meeting in 381) and supported by later such councils was that the Patriarch of Constantinople should be given equal honour to the Pope of Rome since Constantinople was considered to be the &quot;New Rome&quot;. According to the third canon of the second ecumenical council: &quot;Because [Constantinople] is new Rome, the bishop of Constantinople is to enjoy the privileges of honor after the bishop of Rome&quot;.

The 28th canon of the fourth ecumenical council clarified this point by stating: &quot;For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of Old Rome because it was the royal city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops (i.e. the second ecumenical council in 381) actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she is.&quot;

Because of the schism, the Eastern Orthodox no longer recognise the primacy of the pope of Rome. The patriarch of Constantinople therefore, like the Pope before him, now enjoys the title of &quot;first among equals&quot;.

=== Adherents ===


The most reliable estimates currently available number Eastern Orthodox adherents at around 220 million worldwide, making Eastern Orthodoxy the second largest Christian communion in the world after the Catholic Church.

According to the 2015 Yearbook of International Religious Demography, as of 2010, the Eastern Orthodox population was 4% of the global population, declining from 7.1% in 1910. The study also found a decrease in proportional terms, with Eastern Orthodox Christians making up 12.2% of the world&#x27;s total Christian population in 2015 compared to 20.4% a century earlier. A 2017 report by the Pew Research Center reached similar figures, noting that Eastern Orthodoxy has seen slower growth and less geographic spread than Catholicism and Protestantism, which were driven by colonialism and missionary activity across the world.

Over two-thirds of all Eastern Orthodox members are concentrated in Southeast Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia, with significant minorities in Central Asia and the Levant. However, Eastern Orthodoxy has become more globalised over the last century, seeing greater growth in Western Europe, the Americas, and parts of Africa; churches are present in the major cities of most countries. Adherents constitute the largest single religious community in Russia—which is home to roughly half the world&#x27;s Eastern Orthodox Christians—and are the majority in Ukraine, Romania, Belarus, Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Moldova, Georgia, North Macedonia, Cyprus, and Montenegro; communities also dominate the disputed territories of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria. Significant Eastern Orthodox minorities exist in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Latvia, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Albania, Syria, and many other countries.

Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the fastest growing religion in certain Western countries, primarily through labour migration from Eastern Europe, and to a lesser degree conversion. Ireland saw a doubling of its Eastern Orthodox population between 2006 and 2011. Spain and Germany have the largest communities in Western Europe, at roughly 1.5 million each, followed by Italy with around 900,000 and France with between 500,000 and 700,000.

In the Americas, four countries have over 100,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians: Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and the United States; all but the latter had fewer than 20,000 at the turn of the 20th century. The U.S. has seen its community more than quadruple since 1910, from 460,000 to 1.8 million as of 2017; consequently, the number of Eastern Orthodox parishes has been growing, with a 16% increase between 2000 and 2010.

Turkey, which for centuries once had one of the largest Eastern Orthodox communities, saw its overall Christian population fall from roughly one-fifth in 1914 to 2.5% in 1927. This was predominantly due to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, which saw most Christian territories become independent nations. The remaining Christian population was reduced further by large-scale genocides against the Armenian, Greek, Assyrian communities; subsequent population exchanges between Greece and Turkey and Bulgaria and Turkey; and associated emigration of Christians to foreign countries (mostly in Europe and the Americas). Today, only 0.2% of Turkey&#x27;s population represent various Christian denominations (320,000).

== Theology ==

=== Trinity ===

Eastern Orthodox Christians believe in the Trinity, three distinct, divine persons (&quot;hypostases&quot;), without overlap or modality among them, who each have the same divine essence (&quot;ousia&quot;, Greek: οὐσία)—uncreated, immaterial, and eternal. These three persons are typically distinguished by their relation to each other. The Father is eternal and not begotten and does not proceed from any, the Son is eternal and begotten of the Father, and the Holy Spirit is eternal and proceeds from the Father. Orthodox doctrine regarding the Trinity is summarised in the Nicene Creed.

Eastern Orthodox Christians believe in a monotheistic conception of God (God is only one), which is both transcendent (wholly independent of, and removed from, the material universe) and immanent (involved in the material universe). 

In discussing God&#x27;s relationship to his creation, Eastern Orthodox theology distinguishes between God&#x27;s eternal essence, which is totally transcendent, and his &quot;uncreated energies&quot;, which is how he reaches humanity. The God who is transcendent and the God who touches mankind are one and the same. That is, these energies are not something that proceed from God or that God produces, but rather they are God himself: distinct, yet inseparable from God&#x27;s inner being. This view is often called Palamism.

In understanding the Trinity as &quot;one God in three persons&quot;, &quot;three persons&quot; is not to be emphasised more than &quot;one God&quot;, and vice versa. While the three persons are distinct, they are united in one divine essence, and their oneness is expressed in community and action so completely that they cannot be considered separately. For example, their salvation of mankind is an activity engaged in common: &quot;Christ became man by the good will of the Father and by the cooperation of the Holy Spirit. Christ sends the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father, and the Holy Spirit forms Christ in our hearts, and thus God the Father is glorified.&quot; Their &quot;communion of essence&quot; is &quot;indivisible&quot;. Trinitarian terminology—essence, hypostasis, etc.—are used &quot;philosophically&quot;, &quot;to answer the ideas of the heretics&quot;, and &quot;to place the terms where they separate error and truth.&quot; The words do what they can do, but the nature of the Trinity in its fullness is believed to remain beyond man&#x27;s comprehension and expression, a holy mystery that can only be experienced.

=== Sin, salvation, and the incarnation ===

When Eastern Orthodox Christians refer to fallen nature they are not saying that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still formed in the image of God; humans are still God&#x27;s creation, and God has never created anything evil, but fallen nature remains open to evil intents and actions. It is sometimes said among Eastern Orthodox that humans are &quot;inclined to sin&quot;; that is, people find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful things seem the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors.

Since the fall of man, then, it has been mankind&#x27;s dilemma that no human can restore his nature to union with God&#x27;s grace; it was necessary for God to effect another change in human nature. Eastern Orthodox Christians believe that Christ Jesus was both God and Man absolutely and completely, having two natures indivisibly: eternally begotten of the Father in his divinity, he was born in his humanity of a woman, Mary, by her consent, through descent of the Holy Spirit. He lived on earth, in time and history, as a man. As a man he also died, and went to the place of the dead, which is Hades. But being God, neither death nor Hades could contain him, and he rose to life again, in his humanity, by the power of the Holy Spirit, thus destroying the power of Hades and of death itself.

Through Christ&#x27;s destruction of Hades&#x27; power to hold humanity hostage, he made the path to salvation effective for all the righteous who had died from the beginning of time—saving many, including Adam and Eve, who are remembered in the church as saints.

=== Resurrection of Christ ===

The Eastern Orthodox Church understands the death and resurrection of Jesus to be real historical events, as described in the gospels of the New Testament.

=== Christian life ===

Church teaching is that Eastern Orthodox Christians, through baptism, enter a new life of salvation through repentance whose purpose is to share in the life of God through the work of the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Orthodox Christian life is a spiritual pilgrimage in which each person, through the imitation of Christ and &quot;hesychasm&quot;, cultivates the practice of unceasing prayer. Each life occurs within the life of the church as a member of the body of Christ. It is then through the fire of God&#x27;s love in the action of the Holy Spirit that each member becomes more holy, more wholly unified with Christ, starting in this life and continuing in the next. The church teaches that everyone, being born in God&#x27;s image, is called to theosis, fulfilment of the image in likeness to God. God the creator, having divinity by nature, offers each person participation in divinity by cooperatively accepting His gift of grace.

The Eastern Orthodox Church, in understanding itself to be the Body of Christ, and similarly in understanding the Christian life to lead to the unification in Christ of all members of his body, views the church as embracing all Christ&#x27;s members, those now living on earth, and also all those through the ages who have passed on to the heavenly life. &quot;In general,&quot; Eastern Orthodox Christianity sees the Church &quot;as a purely mystical body, the understanding of which cannot be attained through the development of a rational or natural theology.&quot;

The church includes the Christian saints from all times, and also judges, prophets and righteous Jews of the first covenant, Adam and Eve, even the angels and heavenly hosts. In Eastern Orthodox services, the earthly members together with the heavenly members worship God as one community in Christ, in a union that transcends time and space and joins heaven to earth. This unity of the church is sometimes called the &quot;communion of the saints&quot;.

==== Eastern Orthodox Order of Saint Benedict ====
The Order of Saint Benedict is an affiliation of monastics of the Eastern Orthodox Church who strive to live according to the Rule of St Benedict. The equivalent monastic order in the Catholic Church is known as the Order of Saint Benedict, abbreviated as OSB.

Within the United States, the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of North America has at least one Benedictine monastery.

Several Benedictine monastic houses, &quot;sketes&quot; and hermitages fit within the Russian Orthodox Church outside of Russia, all of which are &quot;stavropegial&quot; directly under the Metropolitan. An oblate programme exists for Orthodox laity Saint Benedict Russian Orthodox Church in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

=== Virgin Mary and other saints ===


The Eastern Orthodox Church believes death and the separation of body and soul to be unnatural—a result of the Fall of Man. They also hold that the congregation of the church comprises both the living and the dead. All persons currently in heaven are considered to be saints, whether their names are known or not. There are, however, those saints of distinction whom God has revealed as particularly good examples. When a saint is revealed and ultimately recognised by a large portion of the church a service of official recognition (glorification) is celebrated.

This does not &quot;make&quot; the person a saint; it merely recognises the fact and announces it to the rest of the church. A day is prescribed for the saint&#x27;s celebration, hymns composed and icons created. Numerous saints are celebrated on each day of the year. They are venerated (shown great respect and love) but not worshipped, for worship is due God alone (this view is also held by the Oriental Orthodox and Catholic churches). In showing the saints this love and requesting their prayers, the Eastern Orthodox manifest their belief that the saints thus assist in the process of salvation for others.

Pre-eminent among the saints is the Virgin Mary (commonly referred to as &quot;Theotokos&quot; or &quot;Bogoroditsa&quot;: &quot;Mother of God&quot;). In Eastern Orthodox theology, the Mother of God is the fulfilment of the Old Testament archetypes revealed in the Ark of the Covenant (because she carried the New Covenant in the person of Christ) and the burning bush that appeared before Moses (symbolising the Mother of God&#x27;s carrying of God without being consumed).

The Eastern Orthodox believe that Christ, from the moment of his conception, was both fully God and fully human. Mary is thus called the &quot;Theotokos&quot; or &quot;Bogoroditsa&quot; as an affirmation of the divinity of the one to whom she gave birth. It is also believed that her virginity was not compromised in conceiving God-incarnate, that she was not harmed and that she remained forever a virgin. Scriptural references to &quot;brothers&quot; of Christ are interpreted as kin, given that the word &quot;brother&quot; was used in multiple ways, as was the term &quot;father&quot;. Due to her unique place in salvation history, Mary is honoured above all other saints and especially venerated for the great work that God accomplished through her.

The Eastern Orthodox Church regards the bodies of all saints as holy, made such by participation in the holy mysteries, especially the communion of Christ&#x27;s holy body and blood, and by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within the church. Indeed, that persons and physical things can be made holy is a cornerstone of the doctrine of the Incarnation, made manifest also directly by God in Old Testament times through his dwelling in the Ark of the Covenant. Thus, physical items connected with saints are also regarded as holy, through their participation in the earthly works of those saints. According to church teaching and tradition, God himself bears witness to this holiness of saints&#x27; relics through the many miracles connected with them that have been reported throughout history since biblical times, often including healing from disease and injury.

=== Eschatology ===


Orthodox Christians believe that when a person dies the soul is temporarily separated from the body. Though it may linger for a short period on Earth, it is ultimately escorted either to paradise (Abraham&#x27;s bosom) or the darkness of Hades, following the Temporary Judgment. Orthodox do not accept the doctrine of Purgatory, which is held by Catholicism. The soul&#x27;s experience of either of these states is only a &quot;foretaste&quot;—being experienced only by the soul—until the Final Judgment, when the soul and body will be reunited.

The Eastern Orthodox believe that the state of the soul in Hades can be affected by the love and prayers of the righteous up until the Last Judgment. For this reason the Church offers a special prayer for the dead on the third day, ninth day, fortieth day, and the one-year anniversary after the death of an Orthodox Christian. There are also several days throughout the year that are set aside for general commemoration of the departed, sometimes including nonbelievers. These days usually fall on a Saturday, since it was on a Saturday that Christ lay in the Tomb.

The Eastern Orthodox believe that after the Final Judgment:
* All souls will be reunited with their resurrected bodies.
* All souls will fully experience their spiritual state.
* Having been perfected, the saints will forever progress towards a deeper and fuller love of God, which equates with eternal happiness.

=== Bible ===

The official Bible of the Eastern Orthodox Church contains the Septuagint text of the Old Testament, with the Book of Daniel given in the translation by Theodotion. The Patriarchal Text is used for the New Testament. Orthodox Christians hold that the Bible is a verbal icon of Christ, as proclaimed by the 7th ecumenical council. They refer to the Bible as holy scripture, meaning writings containing the foundational truths of the Christian faith as revealed by Christ and the Holy Spirit to its divinely inspired human authors. Holy scripture forms the primary and authoritative written witness of holy tradition and is essential as the basis for all Orthodox teaching and belief.

Once established as holy scripture, there has never been any question that the Eastern Orthodox Church holds the full list of books to be venerable and beneficial for reading and study, even though it informally holds some books in higher esteem than others, the four gospels highest of all. Of the subgroups significant enough to be named, the &quot;Anagignoskomena&quot; (ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα, &quot;things that are read&quot;) comprises ten of the Old Testament books rejected in the Protestant canon, but deemed by the Eastern Orthodox worthy to be read in worship services, even though they carry a lesser esteem than the 39 books of the Hebrew canon. The lowest tier contains the remaining books not accepted by either Protestants or Catholics, among them, Psalm 151. Though it is a psalm, and is in the book of psalms, it is not classified as being within the Psalter (the first 150 psalms).

In a very strict sense, it is not entirely orthodox to call the holy scripture the &quot;Word of God&quot;. That is a title the Eastern Orthodox Church reserves for Christ, as supported in the scriptures themselves, most explicitly in the first chapter of the Gospel of John. God&#x27;s Word is not hollow, like human words. &quot;God said, &#x27;let there be light&#x27;; and there was light.&quot;

The Eastern Orthodox Church does not subscribe to the Protestant doctrine of &quot;sola scriptura&quot;. The church has defined what Scripture is; it also interprets what its meaning is. Christ promised: &quot;When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth&quot;.

Scriptures are understood to contain historical fact, poetry, idiom, metaphor, simile, moral fable, parable, prophecy and wisdom literature, and each bears its own consideration in its interpretation. While divinely inspired, the text still consists of words in human languages, arranged in humanly recognisable forms. The Eastern Orthodox Church does not oppose honest critical and historical study of the Bible.

== Liturgy ==


=== Church calendar ===

Lesser cycles also run in tandem with the annual ones. A weekly cycle of days prescribes a specific focus for each day in addition to others that may be observed.

=== Church services ===


==== Music and chanting ====

The church has developed eight modes or tones (see Octoechos) within which a chant may be set, depending on the time of year, feast day, or other considerations of the Typikon. There are numerous versions and styles that are traditional and acceptable and these vary a great deal between cultures.

== Traditions ==

=== Art and architecture ===


The Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on New York City&#x27;s Upper East Side is the largest Orthodox Christian church in the Western Hemisphere.

=== Local customs ===

Locality is also expressed in regional terms of churchly jurisdiction, which is often also drawn along national lines. Many Orthodox churches adopt a national title (e.g. Albanian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox, Antiochian Orthodox, Georgian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Romanian Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox, etc.) and this title can identify which language is used in services, which bishops preside, and which of the typica is followed by specific . In the Middle East, Orthodox Christians are usually referred to as &quot;Rum&quot; (&quot;Roman&quot;) Orthodox, because of their historical connection with the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.

== Holy mysteries (sacraments) ==

The Byzantine Rite is used for the administration of the &quot;Holy mysteries&quot; or seven sacraments in Eastern Orthodox Christianity; among these are Holy Communion (the most direct connection), baptism, Chrismation, confession, unction, matrimony, and ordination, as well as blessings, exorcisms, and other occasions.

While the Catholic Church numbers seven sacraments, and many Protestant groups list two (baptism and the Eucharist) or even none, the Eastern Orthodox do not limit the number. However, for the sake of convenience, catechisms of the Eastern Orthodox Church will often speak of the &quot;seven great mysteries&quot;. The term &quot;sacrament&quot; also properly applies to other sacred actions such as monastic tonsure or the blessing of holy water, and involves fasting, almsgiving, or an act as simple as lighting a candle, burning incense, praying or asking God&#x27;s blessing on food.

=== Baptism ===
Baptism is the mystery which transforms the old and sinful person into a new and pure one; the old life, the sins, any mistakes made are gone and a clean slate is given. Through baptism a person is united to the Body of Christ by becoming a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church. During the service, water is blessed. The catechumen is fully immersed in the water three times in the name of the Trinity. This is considered to be a death of the &quot;old man&quot; by participation in the crucifixion and burial of Christ, and a rebirth into new life in Christ by participation in his resurrection.

Properly, the mystery of baptism is administered by bishops and priests; however, in emergencies any Eastern Orthodox Christian can baptise.

=== Chrismation ===

Chrismation (sometimes called confirmation) is the mystery by which a baptised person is granted the gift of the Holy Spirit through anointing with Holy Chrism. It is normally given immediately after baptism as part of the same service, but is also used to receive lapsed members of the Eastern Orthodox Church. As baptism is a person&#x27;s participation in the death and resurrection of Christ, so Chrismation is a person&#x27;s participation in the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.

A baptised and chrismated Eastern Orthodox Christian is a full member of the church and may receive the Eucharist regardless of age.

The creation of Chrism may be accomplished by any bishop at any time, but usually is done only once a year, often when a synod of bishops convenes for its annual meeting. Some autocephalous churches get their chrism from others. Anointing with it substitutes for the laying-on of hands described in the New Testament, even when an instrument such as a brush is used.

=== Holy Communion (Eucharist) ===
Holy Communion is given only to baptised and chrismated Eastern Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer and confession. The priest will administer the gifts with a spoon, called a &quot;cochlear&quot;, directly into the recipient&#x27;s mouth from the chalice. From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive holy communion.

=== Marriage ===

From the Eastern Orthodox perspective, marriage is one of the holy mysteries or sacraments. As well as in many other Christian traditions, for example in Catholicism, it serves to unite a woman and a man in eternal union and love before God, with the purpose of following Christ and his Gospel and raising up a faithful, holy family through their holy union. The church understands marriage to be the union of one man and one woman, and certain Orthodox leaders have spoken out strongly in opposition to the civil institution of same-sex marriage.
Jesus said that &quot;when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven&quot; (Mk 12:25). For the Orthodox Christian this passage should not be understood to imply that Christian marriage will not remain a reality in the Kingdom, but points to the fact that relations will not be &quot;fleshy&quot;, but &quot;spiritual&quot;. Love between wife and husband, as an icon of relationship between Christ and church, is eternal.

The church does recognise that there are rare occasions when it is better that couples do separate, but there is no official recognition of civil divorces. For the Eastern Orthodox, to say that marriage is indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offence resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the church towards sinful man.

=== Holy orders ===

Widowed priests and deacons may not remarry and it is common for such members of the clergy to retire to a monastery (see clerical celibacy). This is also true of widowed wives of clergy, who do not remarry and become nuns when their children are grown. Only men are allowed to receive holy orders, although deaconesses had both liturgical and pastoral functions within the church.

In 2016, the Holy Synod of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria voted to reinstate the female diaconate; in the following year, it ordained six sub-deaconesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2024 the Patriarchate ordained its first female deacon, Angelic Molen, in Zimbabwe, making her the first female deacon in the Eastern Orthodox Church. This move was met with criticism from other autocephalous Orthodox church leaders, such as the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America&#x27;s Metropolitan Saba Esber, and Archpriest John Whiteford of the ROCOR, who criticized the move as being politically motivated and did not accurately reflect the historical use of deaconesses in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

== Interfaith relations ==


=== Relations with other Christians ===

In 1920, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, published an encyclical &quot;addressed &#x27;To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be&#x27;, urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a &#x27;League of Churches&#x27;, parallel to the newly founded League of Nations&quot;. This gesture was instrumental in the foundation of the World Council of Churches (WCC); as such, almost all Eastern Orthodox churches are members of the WCC and &quot;Orthodox ecclesiastics and theologians serve on its committees&quot;. Kallistos Ware, a British metropolitan bishop of the Orthodox Church, has stated that ecumenism &quot;is important for Orthodoxy: it has helped to force the various Orthodox churches out of their comparative isolation, making them meet one another and enter into a living contact with non-Orthodox Christians.&quot;

Hilarion Alfeyev, then the Metropolitan of Volokolamsk and head of external relations for the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, stated that Orthodox and Evangelical Protestant Christians share the same positions on &quot;such issues as abortion, the family, and marriage&quot; and desire &quot;vigorous grassroots engagement&quot; between the two Christian communions on such issues.
In that regard, the differences between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox communions have not been improved in any relevant way. Dogmatic and liturgical polarities have been significant, even and especially in recent times. A pertinent point of contention between the monarchically papal, administratively centralised Catholic Church and the decentralised confederation of Orthodox churches is the theological significance of the Virgin Mary. During his visit to Georgia in October 2016, Pope Francis was snubbed by most Orthodox Christians as he led mass before a practically empty Mikheil Meskhi Stadium in Tbilisi.

The Oriental Orthodox Churches are not in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church, despite their similar names. Slow dialogue towards restoring communion between the two churches began in the mid-20th century, and, notably, in the 19th century, when the Greek Patriarch in Egypt had to absent himself from the country for a long period of time; he left his church under the guidance of the Coptic Pope Cyril IV of Alexandria.

In 2019, the Primate of the OCU Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine Epiphanius stated that &quot;theoretically&quot; the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church could in the future unite into a united church around the Kyiv throne. In 2019, the Primate of the UGCC, Major Archbishop of Kyiv-Galicia Sviatoslav, stated that every effort should be made to restore the original unity of the Kyivan Church in its Orthodox and Catholic branches, saying that the restoration of Eucharistic communion between Rome and Constantinople is not a utopia.

Notwithstanding certain overtures by both Catholic and Eastern Orthodox leaders, the majority of Orthodox Christians, as well as Catholics, are not in favour of communion between their churches, with only a median of 35 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively, claiming support.

=== Relations with Islam ===

According to Bat Ye&#x27;or, Christians under Islamic rule were denied equality of rights since they were forced to pay the &quot;jizya&quot; poll tax.

In 2007, Metropolitan Alfeyev expressed the possibility of peaceful coexistence between Islam and Christianity in Russia, as the two religions have never had religious wars in Russia.

== Constituencies ==

The various autocephalous and autonomous synods of the Eastern Orthodox Church are distinct in terms of administration and local culture, but for the most part exist in full communion with one another. In addition, some schismatic churches not in any communion exist, with all three groups identifying as Eastern Orthodox.

Another group of non-mainstream Eastern Orthodox Christians are referred True Orthodoxy or Old Calendarists; they are those who, without authority from their parent churches, have continued to use the old Julian calendar, and split from their parent church.

The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) has united in 2007 with the Moscow Patriarchate; these two churches had separated from each other in the 1920s due to the subjection of the latter to the hostile Soviet regime.

Another group called the Old Believers, separated in 1666 from the official Russian Orthodox Church as a protest against church rite reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow.

=== Main communion ===

The Eastern Orthodox Church is a communion of 15 autocephalous—that is, administratively completely independent—regional churches, plus the Orthodox Church in America and two Ukrainian Orthodox Churches. The Orthodox Church in America is recognised as autocephalous only by the Russian, Bulgarian, Georgian, Polish and Czech-Slovak churches. In December 2018, representatives of two unrecognised Ukrainian Orthodox churches, along with two metropolitans of the recognised, but self-declared autocephalous Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, proclaimed the formation of the unified Orthodox Church of Ukraine. On 5 January 2019, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine received its &quot;tomos&quot; of autocephaly (decree which defines the conditions of a church&#x27;s independence) from the Ecumenical Patriarchate and thus received a place in the diptych.
Each church has defined geographical boundaries of its jurisdiction and is ruled by its council of bishops or synod presided by a senior bishop–its primate (or first hierarch). The primate may carry the honorary title of patriarch, metropolitan (in the Slavic tradition) or archbishop (in the Greek tradition).

Each regional church consists of constituent eparchies (or dioceses) ruled by a bishop. Some churches have given an eparchy or group of eparchies varying degrees of autonomy (self-government). Such autonomous churches maintain varying levels of dependence on their mother church, usually defined in a &quot;tomos&quot; or other document of autonomy.

Below is a list of the 15 autocephalous Orthodox churches forming the main body of Orthodox Christianity, all of which are titled equal to each other, but the Ecumenical Patriarchate is titled the &quot;first among equals&quot;. Based on the definitions, the list is in the order of precedence and alphabetical order where necessary, with some of their constituent autonomous churches and exarchates listed as well. The liturgical title of the primate is in italics.

* Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric (&quot;Metropolitan of Skopje and Archbishop of Ohrid and Macedonia and of Justiniana Prima&quot;)
Within the main body of Eastern Orthodoxy there are unresolved internal issues as to the autonomous or autocephalous status or legitimacy of the following Orthodox churches, particularly between those stemming from the Russian Orthodox or Constantinopolitan churches:
* Orthodox Church in America (&quot;Archbishop of Washington, Metropolitan of All America and Canada&quot;) – Autocephaly not recognised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
* Self-governing Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church (&quot;Metropolitan of Tallinn and all Estonia&quot;) – Recognised only by the Ecumenical Patriarchate, opposed only by the Russian Orthodox Church.
* Self-governing Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (&quot;Metropolitan of Tallinn and all Estonia&quot;) – Declared itself autocephalous in 2024; not recognised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
* Autonomous Bessarabian Orthodox Church in Moldova (&quot;Archbishop of Chișinău, Metropolitan of Bessarabia and Exarch of the Territories&quot;) of the Romanian Orthodox Church – Territory claimed by the Russian Orthodox Church.
* Autonomous Moldovan Orthodox Church (&quot;Metropolitan of Chișinău and all Moldova&quot;) of the Russian Orthodox Church – Jurisdiction disputed by the Romanian Orthodox Church.
* Orthodox Church of Ukraine (&quot;Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine&quot;) – Recognised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Church of Greece, Church of Cyprus, and Patriarchate of Alexandria as of October 2020, opposed by the Russian, Antiochian, Czech and Slovak, Serbian and Polish Orthodox Churches, and the Orthodox Church in America.
* Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), self-governing by declaration which later was approved and recognised by the Georgian Orthodox Church – jurisdiction disputed with the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which nearly all Churches continued to recognise as part of ROC.
* Latvian Orthodox Church (&quot;Metropolitan of Riga and all Latvia&quot;) holding autocephaly prior to 1941, forcibly integrated in 1941 as a result of the Soviet occupation and annexation of the Baltic states to become a self-governing part of the Russian Orthodox Church, with the Ecumenical Patriarchate accepting this situation in 1978; in 2022, the Latvian Parliament (the Saeima) declared the restoration of autocephaly of the LOC from the ROC, due to security reasons. 

=== Traditionalist groups ===

==== True Orthodox ====

True Orthodoxy has been separated from the mainstream communion over issues of ecumenism and calendar reform since the 1920s. The movement rejects the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Moscow Patriarchate, and all churches which are in communion with them, accusing them of heresy and placing themselves under bishops who do the same thing. They adhere to the use of the Julian calendar, claiming that the calendar reform in the 1920s is in contradiction with the ecumenical councils. There is no official communion of True Orthodox; and they often are local groups and are limited to a specific bishop or locality.

==== Old calendarists ====

==== Old Believers ====


Old Believers are groups which do not accept the liturgical reforms which were carried out within the Russian Orthodox Church by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow in the 17th century. Although all of the groups of Old Believers emerged as a result of opposition to the Nikonian reforms, they do not constitute a single monolithic body. Despite their emphasis on invariable adherence to the pre-Nikonian traditions, the Old Believers feature a great diversity of groups which profess different interpretations of church tradition and they are often not in communion with each other (some groups even practise re-baptism before admitting a member of another group into their midst).

=== Churches not in communion with other churches ===

Churches with irregular or unresolved canonical status are entities that have carried out episcopal consecrations outside of the norms of canon law or whose bishops have been excommunicated by one of the 14 autocephalous churches. These include nationalist and other schismatic bodies such as the Abkhazian Orthodox Church.

A fifth-century legend evolved that Pope Sylvester I was the one to baptise Constantine, but this is dismissed by scholars as a forgery &quot;to amend the historical memory of the Arian baptism that the emperor received at the end of his life, and instead to attribute an unequivocally orthodox baptism to him&quot;. He was a bishop of Berytus (modern-day Beirut) in Phoenicia. He was later made the bishop of Nicomedia, where the Imperial court resided. He lived finally in Constantinople from 338 up to his death.

== Influence in the Imperial family and the Imperial court ==
Distantly related to the imperial family of Constantine the Great, he owed his progression from a less significant Levantine bishopric to the most important episcopal see to his influence at court and the great power he wielded in the church was derived from that source. In fact, during his time in the imperial court, the Eastern court and the major positions in the Eastern Church were held by Arians or Arian sympathizers. With the exception of a short period of eclipse, he enjoyed the confidence both of Constantine and Constantius II. He also served as the tutor of the later Roman emperor Julian, and it was he who might have baptised Constantine the Great on 22 May 337 owing to his familial relationship with the emperor. Also during his time in the imperial court, Arianism became more popular with the royal family. It can be logically surmised that Eusebius had a huge hand in the acceptance of Arianism in the Constantinian household. The Arian influence grew so strong during his tenure in the imperial court that it was not until the end of the Constantinian dynasty and the appointment of Theodosius I that Arianism lost its influence in the empire.

It was of particular interest that Eusebius was nearly persecuted because of his close relationship to the Emperor Licinius while serving as bishop of Nicomedia during Licinius&#x27; reign.

== Relationship with Arius ==
Like Arius, he was a pupil of Lucian of Antioch, and it is probable that he held the same views as Arius from the very beginning; he was also one of Arius&#x27; most fervent supporters who encouraged Arius. It was also because of this relationship that he was the first person whom Arius contacted after the latter was excommunicated from Alexandria by Alexander I of Alexandria in 321. Apparently, Arius and Eusebius were close enough and Eusebius powerful enough that Arius was able to put his theology down in writing. He afterward modified his ideas somewhat, or perhaps he only yielded to the pressure of circumstances; but he was, if not the teacher, at all events the leader and organizer of the Arian council.

At the First Council of Nicaea in 325, he signed the Confession, but only after a long and desperate opposition in which he was said to &quot;subscribe with hand only, not heart&quot; according to ancient sources. It was a huge blow to the Arian party since it was surmised that the participants in the First Council of Nicaea were evenly split between non-Arians and Arians. His defense of Arius angered the emperor, and a few months after the council he was sent into exile due to his continual contacts with Arius and his followers. After the lapse of three years, he succeeded in regaining the imperial favor by convincing Constantine that Arius and his views do not conflict with the proclaimed Nicene Creed. After his return in 329, he brought the whole machinery of the state government into action in order to impose his views upon the Church. 

== Political and religious career ==
In complement to his theological interests, Eusebius was a skilled politician. Upon his return, he regained the lost ground resulting from the First Council of Nicaea, established alliances with other groups such as the Melitians and expelled many opponents.

He was described by modern historians as an &quot;ambitious intriguer&quot; and a &quot;consummate political player&quot;. He was also described by ancient sources as a high-handed person who was also aggressive in his dealings; he also used his allies to spy on his opponents.

He was able to dislodge and exile three key opponents who espoused the First Council of Nicaea: Eustathius of Antioch in 330, Athanasius of Alexandria in 335 and Marcellus of Ancyra in 336. This was no small feat since Athanasius was regarded as a &quot;man of God&quot; by Constantine, and both Eustathius and Athanasius held top positions in the church.

Another major feat was his appointment as the Patriarch of Constantinople by expelling Paul I of Constantinople; Paul I would eventually return as Patriarch after Eusebius&#x27;s death.

Even outside the empire, Eusebius had great influence. He brought Ulfilas into the Arian priesthood and sent the latter to convert the heathen Goths.

Eusebius baptised Constantine the Great in his villa in Nicomedia, on 22 May 337 just before the death of the Emperor.

== Death and aftermath ==
He died at the height of his power in the year 341.

He was so influential that even after his death, Constantius II heeded his and Eudoxus of Constantinople&#x27;s advice to attempt to convert the Roman Empire to Arianism by creating Arian Councils and official Arian Doctrines.

It was because of Eusebius that &quot;On the whole, Constantine and his successors made life pretty miserable for Church leaders committed to the Nicene decision and its Trinitarian formula&quot;.

Eusebius of Nicomedia is not to be confused with his contemporary Eusebius, the author of well-known early books of Church history.

<text>Edo (), also romanized as Jedo, Yedo or Yeddo, is the former name of Tokyo.

Edo, formerly a (castle town) centered on Edo Castle located in Musashi Province, became the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Japan from 1603 as the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. Edo grew to become one of the largest cities in the world under the Tokugawa.

After the Meiji Restoration in 1868 the Meiji government renamed Edo to &quot;Tokyo&quot; (, &quot;Eastern Capital&quot;) and relocated the Emperor from the historic capital of Kyoto to the city. The era of Tokugawa rule in Japan from 1603 to 1868 is known as the Edo period.

==History==

=== Before Tokugawa ===
Before the 10th century, there is no mention of Edo in historical records, but for a few settlements in the area. That name for the area first appears in the Azuma Kagami chronicles, which have probably been used since the second half of the Heian period. Edo&#x27;s development started in the late 11th century with a branch of the called the coming from the banks of the then-Iruma River, present-day upstream of the Arakawa river. A descendant of the head of the Chichibu clan settled in the area and took the name , likely based on the name used for the place, and founded the Edo clan. Shigetsugu built a fortified residence, probably around the edge of the Musashino Terrace, that would become Edo castle. Shigetsugu&#x27;s son, , took the Taira&#x27;s side against Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1180 but eventually surrendered to Minamoto and became a gokenin for the Kamakura shogunate. At the fall of the shogunate in the 14th century, the Edo clan took the side of the Southern Court, and its influence declined during the Muromachi period.

In 1456, a vassal of the Ōgigayatsu branch of the Uesugi clan started to build a castle on the former fortified residence of the Edo clan and took the name Ōta Dōkan. Dōkan lived in the castle until his assassination in 1486. Under Dōkan, with good water connections to Kamakura, Odawara and other parts of Kanto and the country, Edo expanded as a &quot;jōkamachi&quot;, with the castle bordering a cove (now Hibiya Park) opening into Edo Bay, and the town developing along the Hirakawa River running into the cove, and on , the stretch of land on the eastern side of the cove (now roughly where Tokyo Station is). Some priests and scholars fleeing Kyoto after the Ōnin War came to Edo during that period.

After the death of Dōkan, the castle became one of strongholds of the Uesugi clan, which fell to the Later Hōjō clan at the battle of Takanawahara in 1524, during the expansion of their rule over the Kantō area. When the Hōjō clan was finally defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590, the Kanto area was given to rule to Toyotomi&#x27;s senior officer Tokugawa Ieyasu, who took his residence in Edo.

=== Tokugawa shogunate ===
Tokugawa Ieyasu emerged as the paramount warlord of the Sengoku period following his victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in October 1600. He formally founded the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603 and established his headquarters at Edo Castle. Edo became the center of political power and the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Japan, although the historic capital of Kyoto remained the &quot;de jure&quot; capital as the seat of the emperor. Edo grew from a fishing village in Musashi Province in 1457 into the largest metropolis in the world, with an estimated population of 1 million by 1721.

Edo was repeatedly devastated by fires, the Great Fire of Meireki in 1657 being the most disastrous, with an estimated 100,000 victims and a vast portion of the city completely burnt. The population of Edo was around 300,000, and the impact of the fire was tremendous. The fire destroyed the central keep of Edo Castle, which was never rebuilt, and it influenced the urban planning afterwards to make the city more resilient, with many empty areas to break spreading fires, and wider streets. Reconstruction efforts expanded the city east of the Sumida River, and some &quot;daimyō&quot; residences were relocated to give more space to the city, especially in the immediate vicinity of the shogun&#x27;s residence, creating a large green space beside the castle, now the Fukiage gardens of the Imperial Palace. During the Edo period, there were about 100 major fires, mostly begun by accident and often quickly escalating and spreading through neighborhoods of wooden &quot;nagaya&quot; that were heated with charcoal fires.
In 1868, the Tokugawa shogunate was overthrown in the Meiji Restoration by supporters of Emperor Meiji and his Imperial Court in Kyoto, ending Edo&#x27;s status as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Japan. However, the new Meiji government soon renamed Edo to &quot;Tōkyō&quot; (東京, &quot;Eastern Capital&quot;) and the city became the formal capital of Japan when the emperor moved his residence to the city.

==Urbanism==
Very quickly after its inception, the shogunate undertook major works in Edo that drastically changed the topography of the area, notably under the nationwide program of major civil works involving the now pacified &quot;daimyō&quot; workforce. The Hibiya cove facing the castle was soon filled after the arrival of Ieyasu, the Hirakawa river was diverted, and several protective moats and logistical canals were dug (including the Kanda river), to limit the risks of flooding. Landfill works on the bay began, with several areas reclaimed during the duration of the shogunate (notably the Tsukiji area). East of the city and of the Sumida River, a massive network of canals was dug.

Fresh water was a major issue, as direct wells would provide brackish water because of the location of the city over an estuary. The few fresh water ponds of the city were put to use, and a network of canals and underground wooden pipes bringing freshwater from the western side of the city and the Tama River was built. Some of this infrastructure was used until the 20th century.

=== General layout of the city ===
The city was laid out as a castle town around Edo Castle, which was positioned at the tip of the Musashino terrace. The area in the immediate proximity of the castle consisted of samurai and &quot;daimyō&quot; residences, whose families lived in Edo as part of the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system; the &quot;daimyō&quot; made journeys in alternating years to Edo and used the residences for their entourages. The location of each residence was carefully attributed depending on their position as &quot;tozama&quot;, &quot;shinpan&quot; or &quot;fudai&quot;. It was this extensive organization of the city for the samurai class which defined the character of Edo, particularly in contrast to the two major cities of Kyoto and Osaka, neither of which were ruled by a &quot;daimyō&quot; or had a significant samurai population. Kyoto&#x27;s character was defined by the Imperial Court, the court nobles, its Buddhist temples and its history; Osaka was the country&#x27;s commercial center, dominated by the &quot;chōnin&quot; or the merchant class. On the contrary, the samurai and &quot;daimyō&quot; residences occupied up to 70% of the area of Edo. On the east and northeast sides of the castle lived the including the &quot;chōnin&quot; in a much more densely populated area than the samurai class area, organized in a series of gated communities called &quot;machi&quot; (町, &quot;town&quot; or &quot;village&quot;). This area, Shitamachi (下町, &quot;lower town&quot; or &quot;lower towns&quot;), was the center of urban and merchant culture. Shomin also lived along the main roads leading in and out of the city. The Sumida River, then called the Great River (大川, &quot;Ōkawa&quot;), ran on the eastern side of the city. The shogunate&#x27;s official rice-storage warehouses and other official buildings were located here.
The marked the center of the city&#x27;s commercial center and the starting point of the gokaidō (thus making it the de facto &quot;center of the country&quot;). Fishermen, craftsmen and other producers and retailers operated here. Shippers managed ships known as &quot;tarubune&quot; to and from Osaka and other cities, bringing goods into the city or transferring them from sea routes to river barges or land routes.

The northeastern corner of the city was considered dangerous in the traditional &quot;onmyōdō&quot; cosmology and was protected from evil by a number of temples including Sensō-ji and Kan&#x27;ei-ji, one of the two tutelary Bodaiji temples of the Tokugawa. A path and a canal, a short distance north of Sensō-ji, extended west from the Sumida riverbank leading along the northern edge of the city to the Yoshiwara pleasure district. Previously located near Ningyōchō, the district was rebuilt in this more remote location after the great fire of Meireki. Danzaemon, the hereditary position head of &quot;eta,&quot; or outcasts, who performed &quot;unclean&quot; works in the city resided nearby.

Temples and shrines occupied roughly 15% of the surface of the city, equivalent to the living areas of the townspeople, with however an average of one-tenth of its population. Temples and shrines were spread out over the city. Besides the large concentration in the northeast side to protect the city, the second Bodaiji of the Tokugawa, Zōjō-ji occupied a large area south of the castle.

=== Housing ===

==== Military caste ====
The samurai and &quot;daimyōs&quot; residential estates varied dramatically in size depending on their status. Some daimyōs could have several of those residences in Edo. The , was the main residence while the lord was in Edo and was used for official duties. It was not necessarily the largest of his residences, but the most convenient to commute to the castle. The upper residence also acted as the representative embassy of the domain in Edo, connecting the shogunate and the clan. The shogunate did not exercise its investigative powers inside the precincts of the residential estate of the upper residence, which could also act as a refuge. The estate of the upper residence was attributed by the shogunate according to the status of the clan and its relation with the Shogun. The , a bit further from the castle, could house the heir of the lord, his servants from his fief when he was in Edo for the sankin-kotai alternate residency, or be a hiding residence if needed. The , if there was any, was on the outskirts of town, more of a pleasure retreat with gardens. The lower residence could also be used as a retreat for the lord if a fire had devastated the city. Some of the powerful &quot;daimyōs&quot; residences occupied vast grounds of several dozens of hectares. Maintenance and operations of those residential estates could be extremely expensive. Samurai in service of a specific clan would normally live in the residence of their lord.

The samurais, in direct service of the Shogun, would have their own residences, usually located behind the castle on the Western side in the Banchō area.

==== Shonin ====

In a strict sense of the word, &quot;chōnin&quot; were only the townspeople who owned their residence, which was actually a minority. The &quot;shonin&quot; population mainly lived in semi-collective housings called , multi-rooms wooden dwellings, organized in enclosed , with communal facilities, such as wells connected to the city&#x27;s fresh water distribution system, garbage collection area and communal bathrooms. A typical &quot;machi&quot; was of rectangular shape and could have a population of several hundred.
The &quot;machi&quot; had curfew for the night with closing and guarded gates called opening on the in the &quot;machi&quot;. Two floor buildings and larger shops, reserved to the higher-ranking members of the society, were facing the main street. A &quot;machi&quot; would typically follow a grid pattern and smaller streets, , were opening on the main street, also with (sometimes) two-floor buildings, shop on the first floor, living quarter on the second floor, for the more well-off residents. Very narrow streets accessible through small gates called , would enter deeper inside the &quot;machi&quot;, where single floor &quot;nagayas&quot;, the were located. Rentals and smaller rooms for lower ranked &quot;shonin&quot; were located in those back housings.

Edo was nicknamed the , depicting the large number and diversity of those communities, but the actual number was closer to 1,700 by the 18th century.

==Government and administration==
Edo&#x27;s municipal government was under the responsibility of the &quot;rōjū&quot;, the senior officials who oversaw the entire &quot;bakufu&quot; – the government of the Tokugawa shogunate. The administrative definition of Edo was called .

The &quot;Kanjō-bugyō&quot; (finance commissioners) were responsible for the financial matters of the shogunate, whereas the &quot;Jisha-Bugyō&quot; handled matters related to shrines and temples. The were &quot;samurai&quot; (at the very beginning of the shogunate daimyōs, later hatamoto) officials appointed to keep the order in the city, with the word designating both the heading magistrate, the magistrature and its organization. They were in charge of Edo&#x27;s day-to-day administration, combining the role of police, judge and fire brigade. There were two offices, the South Machi-Bugyō and the North Machi-Bugyō, which had the same geographical jurisdiction in spite of their name but rotated roles on a monthly basis. Despite their extensive responsibilities, the teams of the Machi-Bugyō were rather small, with 2 offices of 125 people each. The Machi-Bugyō did not have jurisdiction over the samurai residential areas, which remained under the shogunate direct rule. The geographical jurisdiction of the Machi-Bugyō did not exactly coincide with the Gofunai, creating some complexity on the handling on the matters of the city. The Machi-bugyō oversaw the numerous Machi where shonin lived through representatives called . Each Machi had a Machi leader called , who reported to a who himself was in charge of several Machis.

<text>An explosive (or explosive material) is a reactive substance that contains a great amount of potential energy that can produce an explosion if released suddenly, usually accompanied by the production of light, heat, sound, and pressure. An explosive charge is a measured quantity of explosive material, which may either be composed solely of one ingredient or be a mixture containing at least two substances.

The potential energy stored in an explosive material may, for example, be:
* chemical energy, such as nitroglycerin or grain dust
* pressurized gas, such as a gas cylinder, aerosol can, or boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion
* nuclear energy, such as in the fissile isotopes uranium-235 and plutonium-239

Explosive materials may be categorized by the speed at which they expand. Materials that detonate (the front of the chemical reaction moves faster through the material than the speed of sound) are said to be &quot;high explosives&quot; and materials that deflagrate are said to be &quot;low explosives&quot;. Explosives may also be categorized by their sensitivity. Sensitive materials that can be initiated by a relatively small amount of heat or pressure are primary explosives and materials that are relatively insensitive are secondary or tertiary explosives.

A wide variety of chemicals can explode; a smaller number are manufactured specifically for the purpose of being used as explosives. The remainder are too dangerous, sensitive, toxic, expensive, unstable, or prone to decomposition or degradation over short time spans.

In contrast, some materials are merely combustible or flammable if they burn without exploding. The distinction, however, is not alwys clear. Certain materials—dusts, powders, gases, or volatile organic liquids—may be simply combustible or flammable under ordinary conditions, but become explosive in specific situations or forms, such as dispersed airborne clouds, or confinement or sudden release.

==History==
Early thermal weapons, such as Greek fire, have existed since ancient times. At its roots, the history of chemical explosives lies in the history of gunpowder. During the Tang dynasty in the 9th century, Taoist Chinese alchemists were eagerly trying to find the elixir of immortality. In the process, they stumbled upon the explosive invention of black powder made from coal, saltpeter, and sulfur in 1044. Gunpowder was the first form of chemical explosives and by 1161, the Chinese were using explosives for the first time in warfare. The Chinese would incorporate explosives fired from bamboo or bronze tubes known as bamboo firecrackers. The Chinese also inserted live rats inside the bamboo firecrackers; when fired toward the enemy, the flaming rats created great psychological ramifications—scaring enemy soldiers away and causing cavalry units to go wild.

The first useful explosive stronger than black powder was nitroglycerin, developed in 1847. Since nitroglycerin is a liquid and highly unstable, it was replaced by nitrocellulose, trinitrotoluene (TNT) in 1863, smokeless powder, dynamite in 1867 and gelignite (the latter two being sophisticated stabilized preparations of nitroglycerin rather than chemical alternatives, both invented by Alfred Nobel). World War I saw the adoption of TNT in artillery shells. World War II saw extensive use of new explosives .

In turn, these have largely been replaced by more powerful explosives such as C-4 and PETN (PentaErythritol TetraNitrate) which are also waterproof and malleable though they may catch fire due to reactions with metals.

==Applications==

===Commercial===
The largest commercial application of explosives is mining. The detonation or deflagration of either a high or low explosive in a confined space can be used to liberate a fairly specific sub-volume of a brittle material (rock) in a much larger volume of the same or similar material. The mining industry tends to use nitrate-based explosives such as emulsions of fuel oil and ammonium nitrate solutions, mixtures of ammonium nitrate prills (fertilizer pellets) and fuel oil (ANFO) and gelatinous suspensions or slurries of ammonium nitrate and combustible fuels.

In materials science and engineering, explosives are used in cladding (explosion welding). A thin plate of some material is placed atop a thick layer of a different material, both layers typically of metal. Atop the thin layer is placed an explosive. At one end of the layer of explosive, the explosion is initiated. The two metallic layers are forced together at high speed and with great force. The explosion spreads from the initiation site throughout the explosive. Ideally, this produces a metallurgical bond between the two layers.

===Military===
===Civilian===
===Safety===
==Types==

===Chemical===
An explosion is a type of spontaneous chemical reaction that, once initiated, is driven by both a large exothermic change (great release of heat) and a large positive entropy change (great quantities of gases are released) in going from reactants to products, thereby constituting a thermodynamically favorable process in addition to one that propagates very rapidly. Thus, explosives are substances that contain a large amount of energy stored in chemical bonds. The energetic stability of the gaseous products and hence their generation comes from the formation of strongly bonded species like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen gas, which contain strong double and triple bonds having bond strengths of nearly 1 MJ/mole. Consequently, most commercial explosives are organic compounds containing –NO2, –ONO2 and –NHNO2 groups that, when detonated, release gases like the aforementioned (e.g., nitroglycerin, TNT, HMX, PETN, nitrocellulose).

An explosive is classified as a low or high explosive according to its rate of combustion: low explosives burn rapidly (or deflagrate), while high explosives detonate. While these definitions are distinct, the problem of precisely measuring rapid decomposition makes practical classification of explosives difficult. For a reaction to be classified as a detonation as opposed to just a deflagration, the propagation of the reaction shockwave through the material being tested must be faster than the speed of sound through that material. The speed of sound through a liquid or solid material is usually orders of magnitude faster than the speed of sound through air or other gases. 

Traditional explosives mechanics is based on the shock-sensitive rapid oxidation of carbon and hydrogen to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water in the form of steam. Nitrates typically provide the required oxygen to burn the carbon and hydrogen fuel. High explosives tend to have the oxygen, carbon and hydrogen contained in one organic molecule, and less sensitive explosives like ANFO are combinations of fuel (carbon and hydrogen fuel oil) and ammonium nitrate. A sensitizer such as powdered aluminum may be added to an explosive to increase the energy of the detonation. Once detonated, the nitrogen portion of the explosive formulation emerges as nitrogen gas and toxic nitric oxides.

====Decomposition====
The chemical decomposition of an explosive may take years, days, hours, or a fraction of a second. The slower processes of decomposition take place in storage and are of interest only from a stability standpoint. Of more interest are the other two rapid forms besides decomposition: deflagration and detonation.

====Deflagration====

In deflagration, decomposition of the explosive material is propagated by a flame front which moves relatively slowly through the explosive material, at speeds less than the speed of sound within the substance (which is usually still higher than 340 m/s or in most liquid or solid materials) in contrast to detonation, which occurs at speeds greater than the speed of sound. Deflagration is a characteristic of low explosive material.

====Detonation====

This term is used to describe an explosive phenomenon whereby the decomposition is propagated by a shock wave traversing the explosive material at speeds greater than the speed of sound within the substance. The shock front is capable of passing through the high explosive material at supersonic typically thousands of metres per second.

===Exotic===
In addition to chemical explosives, there are a number of more exotic explosive materials, and exotic methods of causing explosions. Examples include nuclear explosives, and abruptly heating a substance to a plasma state with a high-intensity laser or electric arc.

Laser- and arc-heating are used in laser detonators, exploding-bridgewire detonators, and exploding foil initiators, where a shock wave and then detonation in conventional chemical explosive material is created by laser- or electric-arc heating. Laser and electric energy are not currently used in practice to generate most of the required energy, but only to initiate reactions.

==Properties==
To determine the suitability of an explosive substance for a particular use, its physical properties must first be known. The usefulness of an explosive can only be appreciated when the properties and the factors affecting them are fully understood. Some of the more important characteristics are listed below:

===Sensitivity===

Sensitivity refers to the ease with which an explosive can be ignited or detonated, i.e., the amount and intensity of shock, friction, or heat that is required. When the term is used, care must be taken to clarify what kind of sensitivity is under discussion. The relative sensitivity of a given explosive to impact may vary greatly from its sensitivity to friction or heat. Some of the test methods used to determine sensitivity relate to:
* Impact – Sensitivity is expressed in terms of the distance through which a standard weight must be dropped onto the material to cause it to explode.
* Friction – Sensitivity is expressed in terms of the amount of pressure applied to the material in order to create enough friction to cause a reaction.
* Heat – Sensitivity is expressed in terms of the temperature at which decomposition of the material occurs.

Specific explosives (usually but not always highly sensitive on one or more of the three above axes) may be idiosyncratically sensitive to such factors as pressure drop, acceleration, the presence of sharp edges or rough surfaces, incompatible materials, or in rare nuclear or electromagnetic radiation. These factors present special hazards that may rule out any practical utility.

Sensitivity is an important consideration in selecting an explosive for a particular purpose. The explosive in an armor-piercing projectile must be relatively insensitive, or the shock of impact would cause it to detonate before it penetrated to the point desired. The explosive lenses around nuclear charges are also designed to be highly insensitive, to minimize the risk of accidental detonation.

===Sensitivity to initiation===
The index of the capacity of an explosive to be initiated into detonation in a sustained manner. It is defined by the power of the detonator which is certain to prime the explosive to a sustained and continuous detonation. Reference is made to the Sellier-Bellot scale that consists of a series of 10 detonators, from to , each of which corresponds to an increasing charge weight. In practice, most of the explosives on the market today are sensitive to an detonator, where the charge corresponds to 2 grams of mercury fulminate.

===Velocity of detonation===

The velocity with which the reaction process propagates in the mass of the explosive. Most commercial mining explosives have detonation velocities ranging from 1,800 m/s to 8,000 m/s. Today, velocity of detonation can be measured with accuracy. Together with density it is an important element influencing the yield of the energy transmitted for both atmospheric over-pressure and ground acceleration. By definition, a &quot;low explosive&quot;, such as black powder, or smokeless gunpowder has a burn rate of 171–631 m/s. In contrast, a &quot;high explosive&quot;, whether a primary, such as detonating cord, or a secondary, such as TNT or C-4, has a significantly higher burn rate about 6900–8092 m/s.

===Stability===

Stability is the ability of an explosive to be stored without deterioration.

The following factors affect the stability of an explosive:
* Chemical constitution. In the strictest technical sense, the word &quot;stability&quot; is a thermodynamic term referring to the energy of a substance relative to a reference state or to some other substance. However, in the context of explosives, stability commonly refers to ease of detonation, which is concerned with chemical kinetics (i.e., rate of decomposition). It is perhaps best, then, to differentiate between the terms thermodynamically stable and kinetically stable by referring to the former as &quot;inert.&quot; Contrarily, a kinetically unstable substance is said to be &quot;labile.&quot; It is generally recognized that certain groups like nitro (–NO2), nitrate (–ONO2), and azide (–N3), are intrinsically labile. Kinetically, there exists a low activation barrier to the decomposition reaction. Consequently, these compounds exhibit high sensitivity to flame or mechanical shock. The chemical bonding in these compounds is characterized as predominantly covalent and thus they are not thermodynamically stabilized by a high ionic-lattice energy. Furthermore, they generally have positive enthalpies of formation and there is little mechanistic hindrance to internal molecular rearrangement to yield the more thermodynamically stable (more strongly bonded) decomposition products. For example, in lead azide, Pb(N3)2, the nitrogen atoms are already bonded to one another, so decomposition into Pb and N2[1] is relatively easy.
* Temperature of storage. The rate of decomposition of explosives increases at higher temperatures. All standard military explosives may be considered to have a high degree of stability at temperatures from –10 to +35 °C, but each has a high temperature at which its rate of thermal decomposition rapidly accelerates and stability is reduced. As a rule of thumb, most explosives become dangerously unstable at temperatures above 70 °C.
* Exposure to sunlight. When exposed to the ultraviolet rays of sunlight, many explosive compounds containing nitrogen groups rapidly decompose, affecting their stability.
* Electrical discharge. Electrostatic or spark sensitivity to initiation is common in a number of explosives. Static or other electrical discharge may be sufficient to cause a reaction, even detonation, under some circumstances. As a result, safe handling of explosives and pyrotechnics usually requires proper electrical grounding of the operator.

===Power, performance, and strength===

The term power or performance as applied to an explosive refers to its ability to do work. In practice it is defined as the explosive&#x27;s ability to accomplish what is intended in the way of energy delivery (i.e., fragment projection, air blast, high-velocity jet, underwater shock and bubble energy, etc.). Explosive power or performance is evaluated by a tailored series of tests to assess the material for its intended use. Of the tests listed below, cylinder expansion and air-blast tests are common to most testing programs, and the others support specific applications.
* Cylinder expansion test. A standard amount of explosive is loaded into a long hollow cylinder, usually of copper, and detonated at one end. Data is collected concerning the rate of radial expansion of the cylinder and the maximum cylinder wall velocity. This also establishes the Gurney energy or 2&quot;E&quot;.
* Cylinder fragmentation. A standard steel cylinder is loaded with explosive and detonated in a sawdust pit. The fragments are collected and the size distribution analyzed.
* Detonation pressure (Chapman–Jouguet condition). Detonation pressure data derived from measurements of shock waves transmitted into water by the detonation of cylindrical explosive charges of a standard size.
* Determination of critical diameter. This test establishes the minimum physical size a charge of a specific explosive must be to sustain its own detonation wave. The procedure involves the detonation of a series of charges of different diameters until difficulty in detonation wave propagation is observed.
* Massive-diameter detonation velocity. Detonation velocity is dependent on loading density (c), charge diameter, and grain size. The hydrodynamic theory of detonation used in predicting explosive phenomena does not include the diameter of the charge, and therefore a detonation velocity, for a massive diameter. This procedure requires the firing of a series of charges of the same density and physical structure, but different diameters, and the extrapolation of the resulting detonation velocities to predict the detonation velocity of a charge of a massive diameter.
* Pressure versus scaled distance. A charge of a specific size is detonated and its pressure effects measured at a standard distance. The values obtained are compared with those for TNT.
* Impulse versus scaled distance. A charge of a specific size is detonated and its impulse (the area under the pressure-time curve) measured as a function of distance. The results are tabulated and expressed as TNT equivalents.
* Relative bubble energy (RBE). A 5 to 50 kg charge is detonated in water and piezoelectric gauges measure peak pressure, time constant, impulse, and energy.
::The RBE may be defined as &quot;K&quot;&quot;x&quot; 3
::RBE = &quot;K&quot;&quot;s&quot;
::where &quot;K&quot; = the bubble expansion period for an experimental (&quot;x&quot;) or a standard (&quot;s&quot;) charge.

===Brisance===

In addition to strength, explosives display a second characteristic, which is their shattering effect or brisance (from the French meaning to &quot;break&quot;). Brisance is important in determining the effectiveness of an explosion in fragmenting shells, bomb casings, and grenades. The rapidity with which an explosive reaches its peak pressure (power) is a measure of its brisance. Brisance values are primarily employed in France and Russia.

The sand crush test is commonly employed to determine the relative brisance in comparison to TNT. No test is capable of directly comparing the explosive properties of two or more compounds; it is important to examine the data from several such tests (sand crush, trauzl, and so forth) in order to gauge relative brisance. True values for comparison require field experiments.

===Density===
Density of loading refers to the mass of an explosive per unit volume. Several methods of loading are available, including pellet loading, cast loading, and press loading, the choice being determined by the characteristics of the explosive. Dependent upon the method employed, an average density of the loaded charge can be obtained that is within 80–99% of the theoretical maximum density of the explosive. High load density can reduce sensitivity by making the mass more resistant to internal friction. However, if density is increased to the extent that individual crystals are crushed, the explosive may become more sensitive. Increased load density also permits the use of more explosive, thereby increasing the power of the warhead. It is possible to compress an explosive beyond a point of sensitivity, known also as &quot;dead-pressing&quot;, in which the material is no longer capable of being reliably initiated, if at all.

===Volatility===
Volatility is the readiness with which a substance vaporizes. Excessive volatility often results in the development of pressure within rounds of ammunition and separation of mixtures into their constituents. Volatility affects the chemical composition of the explosive such that a marked reduction in stability may occur, which results in an increase in the danger of handling.

===Hygroscopicity and water resistance===
The introduction of water into an explosive is highly undesirable since it reduces the sensitivity, strength, and velocity of detonation of the explosive. Hygroscopicity is a measure of a material&#x27;s moisture-absorbing tendencies. Moisture affects explosives adversely by acting as an inert material that absorbs heat when vaporized, and by acting as a solvent medium that can cause undesired chemical reactions. Sensitivity, strength, and velocity of detonation are reduced by inert materials that reduce the continuity of the explosive mass. When the moisture content evaporates during detonation, cooling occurs, which reduces the temperature of reaction. Stability is also affected by the presence of moisture since moisture promotes decomposition of the explosive and, in addition, causes corrosion of the explosive&#x27;s metal container.

Explosives considerably differ from one another as to their behavior in the presence of water. Gelatin dynamites containing nitroglycerine have a degree of water resistance. Explosives based on ammonium nitrate have little or no water resistance as ammonium nitrate is highly soluble in water and is hygroscopic.

===Toxicity===
Many explosives are toxic to some extent. Manufacturing inputs can also be organic compounds or hazardous materials that require special handling due to risks (such as carcinogens). The decomposition products, residual solids, or gases of some explosives can be toxic, whereas others are harmless, such as carbon dioxide and water.

Examples of harmful by-products are:
* Heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, and barium from primers (observed in high-volume firing ranges)
* Nitric oxides from TNT
* Perchlorates when used in large quantities

&quot;Green explosives&quot; seek to reduce environment and health impacts. An example of such is the lead-free primary explosive copper(I) 5-nitrotetrazolate, an alternative to lead azide.

===Explosive train===

Explosive material may be incorporated in the explosive train of a device or system. An example is a pyrotechnic lead igniting a booster, which causes the main charge to detonate.

===Volume of products of explosion===
The most widely used explosives are condensed liquids or solids converted to gaseous products by explosive chemical reactions and the energy released by those reactions. The gaseous products of complete reaction are typically carbon dioxide, steam, and nitrogen. Gaseous volumes computed by the ideal gas law tend to be too large at high pressures characteristic of explosions. Ultimate volume expansion may be estimated at three orders of magnitude, or one liter per gram of explosive. Explosives with an oxygen deficit will generate soot or gases like carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which may react with surrounding materials such as atmospheric oxygen. Attempts to obtain more precise volume estimates must consider the possibility of such side reactions, condensation of steam, and aqueous solubility of gases like carbon dioxide.

===Oxygen balance (OB% or &quot;Ω&quot;)===

Oxygen balance is an expression that is used to indicate the degree to which an explosive can be oxidized. If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to convert all of its carbon to carbon dioxide, all of its hydrogen to water, and all of its metal to metal oxide with no excess, the molecule is said to have a zero oxygen balance. The molecule is said to have a positive oxygen balance if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a negative oxygen balance if it contains less oxygen than is needed. The sensitivity, strength, and brisance of an explosive are all somewhat dependent upon oxygen balance and tend to approach their maxima as oxygen balance approaches zero.

===Chemical composition===
A chemical explosive may consist of either a chemically pure compound, such as nitroglycerin, or a mixture of a fuel and an oxidizer, such as black powder or grain dust and air.

====Pure compounds====
Some chemical compounds are unstable in that, when shocked, they react, possibly to the point of detonation. Each molecule of the compound dissociates into two or more new molecules (generally gases) with the release of energy.
* Nitroglycerin: A highly unstable and sensitive liquid
* Acetone peroxide: A very unstable white organic peroxide
* TNT: Yellow insensitive crystals that can be melted and cast without detonation
* Cellulose nitrate: A nitrated polymer which can be a high or low explosive depending on nitration level and conditions
* RDX, PETN, HMX: Very powerful explosives which can be used pure or in plastic explosives
** C-4 (or Composition C-4): An RDX plastic explosive plasticized to be adhesive and malleable

The above compositions may describe most of the explosive material, but a practical explosive will often include small percentages of other substances. For example, dynamite is a mixture of highly sensitive nitroglycerin with sawdust, powdered silica, or most commonly diatomaceous earth, which act as stabilizers. Plastics and polymers may be added to bind powders of explosive compounds; waxes may be incorporated to make them safer to handle; aluminium powder may be introduced to increase total energy and blast effects. Explosive compounds are also often &quot;alloyed&quot;: HMX or RDX powders may be mixed (typically by melt-casting) with TNT to form Octol or Cyclotol.

====Oxidized fuel====
An oxidizer is a pure substance (molecule) that in a chemical reaction can contribute some atoms of one or more oxidizing elements, in which the fuel component of the explosive burns. On the simplest level, the oxidizer may itself be an oxidizing element, such as gaseous or liquid oxygen.
* Black powder: Potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur
* Flash powder: Fine metal powder (usually aluminium or magnesium) and a strong oxidizer (e.g. potassium chlorate or perchlorate)
* Ammonal: Ammonium nitrate and aluminium powder
* Armstrong&#x27;s mixture: Potassium chlorate and red phosphorus. This is a very sensitive mixture. It is a primary high explosive in which sulfur is substituted for some or all of the phosphorus to slightly decrease sensitivity.
* Sprengel explosives: A very general class incorporating any strong oxidizer and highly reactive fuel, although in practice the name was most commonly applied to mixtures of chlorates and nitroaromatics.
** ANFO: Ammonium nitrate and fuel oil
** Cheddites: Chlorates or perchlorates and oil
** Oxyliquits: Mixtures of organic materials and liquid oxygen
** Panclastites: Mixtures of organic materials and dinitrogen tetroxide

===Availability and cost===
The availability and cost of explosives are determined by the availability of the raw materials and the cost, complexity, and safety of the manufacturing operations.

==Classification==

===By sensitivity===

====Primary====
A primary explosive is an explosive that is extremely sensitive to stimuli such as impact, friction, heat, static electricity, or electromagnetic radiation. Some primary explosives are also known as contact explosives. A relatively small amount of energy is required for initiation. As a very general rule, primary explosives are considered to be those compounds that are more sensitive than PETN. As a practical measure, primary explosives are sufficiently sensitive that they can be reliably initiated with a blow from a hammer; however, PETN can also usually be initiated in this manner, so this is only a very broad guideline. Additionally, several compounds, such as nitrogen triiodide, are so sensitive that they cannot even be handled without detonating. Nitrogen triiodide is so sensitive that it can be reliably detonated by exposure to alpha radiation. 

Primary explosives are often used in detonators or to trigger larger charges of less sensitive secondary explosives. Primary explosives are commonly used in blasting caps and percussion caps to translate a physical shock signal. In other situations, different signals such as electrical or physical shock, or, in the case of laser detonation systems, light, are used to initiate an action, i.e., an explosion. A small quantity, usually milligrams, is sufficient to initiate a larger charge of explosive that is usually safer to handle.

Examples of primary high explosives are:

* Acetone peroxide
* Alkali metal ozonides
* Ammonium permanganate
* Ammonium chlorate
* Azidotetrazolates
* Azoclathrates
* Benzoyl peroxide
* Benzvalene
* 3,5-Bis(trinitromethyl)tetrazole

** Xenon oxytetrafluoride
** Xenon tetroxide
** Xenon trioxide
====Secondary====
A secondary explosive is less sensitive than a primary explosive and requires substantially more energy to be initiated. Because they are less sensitive, they are usable in a wider variety of applications and are safer to handle and store. Secondary explosives are used in larger quantities in an explosive train and are usually initiated by a smaller quantity of a primary explosive.

Examples of secondary explosives include TNT and RDX.

====Tertiary====
Tertiary explosives, also called blasting agents, are so insensitive to shock that they cannot be reliably detonated by practical quantities of primary explosive, and instead require an intermediate explosive booster of secondary explosive. These are often used for safety and the typically lower costs of material and handling. The largest consumers are large-scale mining and construction operations.

Most tertiaries include a fuel and an oxidizer. ANFO can be a tertiary explosive if its reaction rate is slow.

===By velocity===

====Low====
Low explosives (or low-order explosives) are compounds wherein the rate of decomposition proceeds through the material at less than the speed of sound. The decomposition is propagated by a flame front (deflagration) that travels much more slowly through the explosive material than the shock wave of a high explosive. Under normal conditions, low explosives undergo deflagration at rates that vary from a few centimetres per second to approximately . It is possible for them to deflagrate very quickly, producing an effect similar to a detonation. This can happen under higher pressure (such as when gunpowder deflagrates inside the confined space of a bullet casing, accelerating the bullet to well beyond the speed of sound) or temperature.

A low explosive is usually a mixture of a combustible substance and an oxidant that decomposes rapidly (deflagration); however, they burn more slowly than a high explosive, which has an extremely fast burn rate.

Low explosives are normally employed as propellants. Included in this group are petroleum products such as propane and gasoline, gunpowder (including smokeless powder), and light pyrotechnics such as flares and fireworks, but they can replace high explosives in certain applications, including gas pressure blasting.

====High====
High explosives (HE, or high-order explosives) are explosive materials that detonate, meaning that the explosive shock front passes through the material at a supersonic speed. High explosives detonate with explosive velocity of about . For instance, TNT has a detonation (burn) rate of approximately 6.9 km/s (22,600 feet per second), detonating cord of 6.7 km/s (22,000 feet per second), and C-4 about 8.0 km/s (26,000 feet per second). They are normally employed in mining, demolition, and military applications. The term &quot;high explosive&quot; is in contrast with the term &quot;low explosive&quot;, which explodes (deflagrates) at a lower rate.

High explosives can be divided into two explosives classes differentiated by sensitivity: primary explosive and secondary explosive. Although tertiary explosives (such as ANFO at 3,200 m/s) can technically meet the explosive velocity definition, they are not considered high explosives in regulatory contexts.

Countless high-explosive compounds are chemically possible, but commercially and militarily important ones have included NG, TNT, TNP, TNX, RDX, HMX, PETN, TATP, TATB, and HNS.

===By physical form===

Explosives are often characterized by the physical form that the explosives are produced or used in. These use forms are commonly categorized as:
* Pressings
* Castings
* Plastic or polymer bonded
* Plastic explosives, a.k.a. putties
* Rubberized
* Extrudable
* Binary
* Blasting agents
* Slurries and gels
* Dynamites

===Shipping label classifications===
Shipping labels and tags may include both United Nations and national markings.

United Nations markings include numbered Hazard Class and Division (HC/D) codes and alphabetic Compatibility Group codes. Though the two are related, they are separate and distinct. Any Compatibility Group designator can be assigned to any Hazard Class and Division. An example of this hybrid marking would be a consumer firework, which is labeled as 1.4G or 1.4S.

Examples of national markings would include United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) codes.

====United Nations (UN) GHS Hazard Class and Division====

The UN GHS Hazard Class and Division (HC/D) is a numeric designator within a hazard class indicating the character, predominance of associated hazards, and potential for causing personnel casualties and property damage. It is an internationally accepted system that communicates using the minimum amount of markings the primary hazard associated with a substance.

Listed below are the Divisions for Class 1 (Explosives):
* 1.1 Mass Detonation Hazard. With HC/D 1.1, it is expected that if one item in a container or pallet inadvertently detonates, the explosion will sympathetically detonate the surrounding items. The explosion could propagate to all or the majority of the items stored together, causing a mass detonation. There will also be fragments from the item&#x27;s casing and/or structures in the blast area.
* 1.2 Non-mass explosion, fragment-producing. HC/D 1.2 is further divided into three subdivisions, HC/D 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3, to account for the magnitude of the effects of an explosion.
* 1.3 Mass fire, minor blast or fragment hazard. Propellants and many pyrotechnic items fall into this category. If one item in a package or stack initiates, it will usually propagate to the other items, creating a mass fire.
* 1.4 Moderate fire, no blast or fragment. HC/D 1.4 items are listed in the table as explosives with no significant hazard. Most small arms ammunition (including loaded weapons) and some pyrotechnic items fall into this category. If the energetic material in these items inadvertently initiates, most of the energy and fragments will be contained within the storage structure or the item containers themselves.
* 1.5 mass detonation hazard, very insensitive.
* 1.6 detonation hazard without mass detonation hazard, extremely insensitive.

====Class 1 Compatibility Group====
Compatibility Group codes are used to indicate storage compatibility for HC/D Class 1 (explosive) materials. Letters are used to designate 13 compatibility groups as follows.
* A: Primary explosive substance (1.1A).
* B: An article containing a primary explosive substance and not containing two or more effective protective features. Some articles, such as detonator assemblies for blasting and primers, cap-type, are included. (1.1B, 1.2B, 1.4B).
* C: Propellant explosive substance or other deflagrating explosive substance or article containing such explosive substance (1.1C, 1.2C, 1.3C, 1.4C). These are bulk propellants, propelling charges, and devices containing propellants with or without means of ignition. Examples include single-based propellant, double-based propellant, triple-based propellant, and composite propellants, solid propellant rocket motors and ammunition with inert projectiles.
* D: Secondary detonating explosive substance or black powder or article containing a secondary detonating explosive substance, in each case without means of initiation and without a propelling charge, or article containing a primary explosive substance and containing two or more effective protective features. (1.1D, 1.2D, 1.4D, 1.5D).
* E: Article containing a secondary detonating explosive substance without means of initiation, with a propelling charge (other than one containing flammable liquid, gel or hypergolic liquid) (1.1E, 1.2E, 1.4E).
* F containing a secondary detonating explosive substance with its means of initiation, with a propelling charge (other than one containing flammable liquid, gel or hypergolic liquid) or without a propelling charge (1.1F, 1.2F, 1.3F, 1.4F).
* G: Pyrotechnic substance or article containing a pyrotechnic substance, or article containing both an explosive substance and an illuminating, incendiary, tear-producing or smoke-producing substance (other than a water-activated article or one containing white phosphorus, phosphide or flammable liquid or gel or hypergolic liquid) (1.1G, 1.2G, 1.3G, 1.4G). Examples include Flares, signals, incendiary or illuminating ammunition and other smoke and tear producing devices.
* H: Article containing both an explosive substance and white phosphorus (1.2H, 1.3H). These articles will spontaneously combust when exposed to the atmosphere.
* J: Article containing both an explosive substance and flammable liquid or gel (1.1J, 1.2J, 1.3J). This excludes liquids or gels which are spontaneously flammable when exposed to water or the atmosphere, which belong in group H. Examples include liquid or gel filled incendiary ammunition, fuel-air explosive (FAE) devices, and flammable liquid fueled missiles.
* K: Article containing both an explosive substance and a toxic chemical agent (1.2K, 1.3K)
* L Explosive substance or article containing an explosive substance and presenting a special risk (e.g., due to water-activation or presence of hypergolic liquids, phosphides, or pyrophoric substances) needing isolation of each type (1.1L, 1.2L, 1.3L). Damaged or suspect ammunition of any group belongs in this group.
* N: Articles containing only extremely insensitive detonating substances (1.6N).
* S: Substance or article so packed or designed that any hazardous effects arising from accidental functioning are limited to the extent that they do not significantly hinder or prohibit fire fighting or other emergency response efforts in the immediate vicinity of the package (1.4S).

==Regulation==
The legality of possessing or using explosives varies by jurisdiction. Various countries around the world have enacted explosives law and require licenses to manufacture, distribute, store, use, possess explosives or ingredients.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the civil and commercial use of explosives is covered under the &quot;Wet explosieven voor civiel gebruik&quot; (explosives for civil use Act), in accordance with EU directive nr. 93/15/EEG (Dutch). The illegal use of explosives is covered under the &quot;Wet Wapens en Munitie&quot; (Weapons and Munition Act) (Dutch).

===United Kingdom===

The new Explosives Regulations 2014 (ER 2014) came into force on 1 October 2014 and defines &quot;explosive&quot; as:

===United States===
During World War I, numerous laws were created to regulate war related industries and increase security within the United States. In 1917, the 65th United States Congress created many laws, including the &quot;Espionage Act of 1917&quot; and &quot;Explosives Act of 1917&quot;.

The &quot;Explosives Act of 1917&quot; (session 1, chapter 83, ) was signed on 6 October 1917 and went into effect on 16 November 1917. The legal summary is &quot;An Act to prohibit the manufacture, distribution, storage, use, and possession in time of war of explosives, providing regulations for the safe manufacture, distribution, storage, use, and possession of the same, and for other purposes&quot;. This was the first federal regulation of licensing explosives purchases. The act was deactivated after World War I ended.

After the United States entered World War II, the Explosives Act of 1917 was reactivated. In 1947, the act was deactivated by President Truman.

The &quot;Organized Crime Control Act of 1970&quot; () transferred many explosives regulations to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) of the Department of Treasury. The bill became effective in 1971.

Currently, regulations are governed by Title 18 of the United States Code and Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations:
* &quot;Importation, Manufacture, Distribution and Storage of Explosive Materials&quot; (18 U.S.C. Chapter 40).
* &quot;Commerce in Explosives&quot; (27 C.F.R. Chapter II, Part 555).

<text>Enter the Dragon () is a 1973 martial arts film directed by Robert Clouse and written by Michael Allin. The film stars Bruce Lee, John Saxon, Ahna Capri, Bob Wall, Shih Kien and Jim Kelly. &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was Bruce Lee&#x27;s final completed film appearance before his death on 20 July 1973 at the age of 32. An American-Hong Kong co-production, the film was premiered in Los Angeles on 19 August 1973, one month after Lee&#x27;s death.

&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was estimated to have grossed over worldwide (equivalent to an estimated adjusted for inflation ) against a budget of $850,000. It is the most successful martial arts film ever and is widely regarded as one of the greatest martial arts films of all time. In 2004, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Among the first films to combine martial arts action with spy film elements and the emerging blaxploitation genre, its success led to a series of similar productions combining the martial arts and blaxploitation genres. The film&#x27;s themes have generated scholarly debate about the changes taking place within post-colonial Asian societies following the end of World War II.

&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; is also considered one of the most influential action films of all time, with its success contributing to mainstream worldwide interest in the martial arts as well as inspiring numerous fictional works, including action films, television shows, action games, comic books, manga and anime.

==Plot==
Lee, a martial artist and instructor from Shaolin temple, Hong Kong, is approached by British intelligence agent Braithwaite, who asks for his help in an undercover mission to investigate suspected crime lord Han, who was one of the students in Shaolin temple. Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts tournament on Han&#x27;s private island to gather evidence that will prove Han&#x27;s involvement and suspicions to in drug trafficking and prostitution.

Since Han&#x27;s island is only partly in their jurisdiction, they are unable to conduct any formal investigations. Han does not allow firearms on the island to prevent assassination attempts and raids from international authorities. Han runs a martial arts school as cover for his illegal operations and holds the tournament to recruit martial artists to expand his illegal business. Lee agrees to help Braithwaite, believing his efforts will also redeem the honor of the Shaolin temple that was tarnished by Han. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that Han&#x27;s bodyguard O&#x27;Hara is responsible for the death of his sister Su Lin.

Lee arrives on Han&#x27;s island and receives a warm reception. Joining him are other competitors, including Roper, an American playboy and gambler, who is indebted and on the run from the mob, and Williams, an African-American activist, who is on the run after defending himself against two racist police officers in Los Angeles. Roper and Williams are former Karate brothers and fellow Vietnam veterans, who also have a betting scam going: one will underperform until the other can get a bet on the outcome at good odds. Roper and Williams win their first fights easily.

The rules of Han&#x27;s tournament are simple: competitors compete in one-on-one matches against each other, the opponent, who gets knocked to the ground loses each round. Any weapons are strictly prohibited in the fighting arena. At the end of the first day, the competitors are all offered girls of their choice by Han&#x27;s assistant Tania. Williams chooses several women, while Roper cunningly chooses Tania as a mutual attraction grows between them. Lee chooses a girl, which he saw in Han&#x27;s entourage, who is Mei Ling, a covert agent whom Braithwaite had placed on the island to gather intelligence. However, Mei Ling has been unable to escape Han&#x27;s strict observation never to leave their rooms.

That night, Lee begins to stealthily search and infiltrate the island for evidence and finds a secret entrance to an underground compound base where drugs are being manufactured and tested on unwitting prisoners. Lee runs into Han&#x27;s guards, but manages to take them down and flee before they can identify him. Lee is seen by Williams, who is outside for some fresh air and practice, despite strict rules against being outside after night. The next morning, Han warns the competitors about wandering out of their rooms at night. Han punishes his guards for their inability to fulfill their duties by leaving them to be killed by Bolo, Han&#x27;s giant enforcer and chief bodyguard. After the execution, the competition resumes as Lee is called to his first match, which is against O&#x27;Hara.

During the fight, Han warns O&#x27;Hara to step down as Lee keeps outclassing him in a humiliating fashion. Lee kills O&#x27;Hara after he tries to attack him with a pair of half-shattered glass bottles, thus avenging Su Lin&#x27;s death. An embarrassed Han abruptly ends the day&#x27;s competition after stating that O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s treachery has disgraced them. Later, Han summons Williams in his office and accuses him of attacking the guards the previous night. Williams denies this and decides to leave the island. Han brutally beats Williams to death with his iron prosthetic left hand.

Han takes Roper on a tour of his underground base and invites him to be his representative for his illegal operations in US. Han also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper with other martial artists who joined Han&#x27;s tournaments in the past. Roper reluctantly accepts after Han throws the mutilated corpse of Williams over a pit of acid, hinting that Roper will face the same fate if he refuses to cooperate. The same night, Lee infiltrates the underground base again to gather sufficient evidence to warrant Han&#x27;s arrest and manages to send a message to Braithwaite. After a prolonged battle with Han&#x27;s guards, Lee is eventually lured into a door trap to get imprisoned and captured.

The next morning, Han commands Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses and Han has him fight Bolo. Roper manages to overpower and beat Bolo after a gruelling battle. Han orders all his men to kill Lee and Roper. Despite facing insurmountable odds, the island&#x27;s prisoners, released by Mei Ling, and the other invited martial artists aid Lee and Roper in defeating Han&#x27;s guards. Amid the chaos, Han attempts to fight his way out to escape, only to have Lee pursue and corner him in his museum, where Han retrieves a bladed-talon replacement for his hand to prepare for a brutal fight. Han retreats into a room full of mirrors, which proves disorientating for Lee until Lee keeps a strategy in mind and smashes all the mirrors to spoil Han&#x27;s illusions. Lee kicks Han, who gets impaled on his own spear that was halfway harpooned through a wall.

Lee returns to Roper and they exchange a weary thumbs-up as the military finally arrives to take control of the island.

== Production ==
Due to the success of his earlier films, Warner Bros. began helping Bruce Lee with the film in 1972. They brought in producers Fred Weintraub and Paul Heller. The film was produced on a tight production budget of $850,000. Fighting sequences were staged by Bruce Lee.

=== Writing ===
The screenplay title was originally named &quot;Blood and Steel&quot;. The story features heroic protagonists who are Asian, white, and Black, as the producers wanted a film that would appeal to the widest possible international audience. The scene in which Lee states that his style is &quot;Fighting Without Fighting&quot; is based upon a famous anecdote involving the 16th century samurai Tsukahara Bokuden.

=== Casting ===
Rod Taylor was first choice for playing the down-on-his-luck martial artist Roper. Director Robert Clouse had already worked with Taylor in the 1970 film &quot;Darker than Amber&quot;. However, Taylor was dropped after Bruce Lee deemed him to be too tall for the role. John Saxon, who was a black belt in Judo and Shotokan Karate (he studied under grandmaster Hidetaka Nishiyama for three years), became the preferred choice. During contractual negotiations, Saxon&#x27;s agent told the film&#x27;s producers that if they wanted him they would have to change the plot so that the character of Williams is killed instead of Roper. They agreed and the script was changed. In a six decade career, the character would become one of Saxon&#x27;s best known roles.

Rockne Tarkington was originally cast in the role of Williams. However, he unexpectedly dropped out days before the production was about to begin in Hong Kong. Producer Fred Weintraub knew that karate world champion Jim Kelly had a training dojo in Crenshaw, Los Angeles, so he hastily arranged a meeting. Weintraub was immediately impressed, and Kelly was cast in the film. The success of Kelly&#x27;s appearance launched his career as a star: after &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, he signed a three-film deal with Warner Bros and went on to make several martial arts-themed blaxploitation films in the 1970s.

Jackie Chan has uncredited roles as various guards during the fights with Lee. However, Yuen Wah was Lee&#x27;s main stunt double for the film, responsible for the gymnastics stunts such as the cartwheels and jumping back flip in the opening fight.

Sammo Hung also has an uncredited role in the opening fight scene against Lee at the start of the film.

A rumour surrounding the making of &quot;Enter The Dragon&quot; claims that actor Bob Wall did not like Bruce Lee and that their fight scenes were not choreographed. However, Wall has denied this, stating he and Lee were good friends.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot on location in Hong Kong. In keeping with local film-making practices, scenes were filmed without sound: dialogue and sound effects were added or dubbed in during post-production. Bruce Lee, after he had been goaded or challenged, fought several real fights with the film&#x27;s extras and some set intruders during filming. The scenes on Han&#x27;s Island were filmed at a residence known as Palm Villa near the coastal town of Stanley. The villa is now demolished and the area heavily redeveloped around Tai Tam Bay where the martial artists were filmed coming ashore.

=== Soundtrack ===

Argentinian musician Lalo Schifrin composed the film&#x27;s musical score. While Schifrin was widely known at the time for his jazz scores, he also incorporated funk and traditional film score elements into the film&#x27;s soundtrack. He composed the score by sampling sounds from China, Korea, and Japan. The soundtrack has sold over 500,000 copies, earning a gold record.

== Release ==
=== Marketing ===
&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was heavily advertised in the United States before its release. The budget for advertising was over . It was unlike any promotional campaign that had been seen before, and was extremely comprehensive. To advertise the film, the studio offered free Karate classes, produced thousands of illustrated flip books, comic books, posters, photographs, and organised dozens of news releases, interviews, and public appearances for the stars. &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; all wrote stories on the film.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was one of the most successful films of 1973. Upon release in Hong Kong, the film grossed , which was huge business for the time, but less than Lee&#x27;s previous 1972 films &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; and &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot;.

In North America, the film was receiving offers of from American distributors by April 1973 for the distribution rights, several months before release. Upon its limited release in August 1973 in four theatres in New York, the film entered the weekly box office charts at number 17 with a gross of in 3 days. Upon its expansion the following week, it topped the charts for two weeks. Over the next four weeks, it remained in the top 10 while competing with other kung fu films, including &quot;Lady Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;The Shanghai Killers&quot; and &quot;Deadly China Doll&quot; which held the top spot for one week each.

In October, &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; regained the top spot in its eighth week. It sold tickets and grossed from its initial US release, making it the year&#x27;s fourth highest-grossing film in the market. It was repeatedly re-released throughout the 1970s, with each re-release entering the top five in the box office charts. The film&#x27;s US gross had increased to by 1982, and more than (equivalent to $ million adjusted for inflation) by 1998.

In Europe, the film initially monopolised several London West End cinemas for five weeks, before becoming a sellout success across Britain and the rest of Europe. In England, it grossed over $2.5 million. In Spain, it was the seventh top-grossing film of 1973, selling 2,462,489 tickets. In France, it was one of the top five highest-grossing films of 1974 (above two other Lee films, &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; at and &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; at ), with 4,444,582 ticket sales. In Germany, it was one of the top 10 highest-grossing films of 1974, with ticket sales. In Greece, the film earned in its first year of release.

In India, the movie was released in 1975 and opened to full houses; in one Bombay theatre, New Excelsior, it had a packed 32-week run. The film was also a success in Iran, where there was a theatre which played it daily up until the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

Against a tight budget of $850,000, the film grossed upon its initial 1973 worldwide release, making it one of the world&#x27;s highest-grossing films of all time up until then. The film went on to have multiple re-releases around the world over the next several decades, significantly increasing its worldwide gross. The film went on to gross over internationally by 1981, making it the highest-grossing martial arts film of all time. It was reportedly still among the all-time highest-grossing films in 1990.

In 1998, it had grossed more than worldwide. , it has grossed an estimated total of over worldwide, having earned more than 400 times its original budget. The film&#x27;s cost-to-profit ratio makes it one of the most commercially successful and profitable films of all time. Adjusted for inflation, the film&#x27;s worldwide gross is estimated to be the equivalent of over .

=== Critical reception ===
Upon release, the film was initially received mixed reviews from several critics, including a favourable review from &quot;Variety&quot; magazine. The film eventually went on to be well-received by most critics, and it is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1973. Critics have referred to &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; as &quot;a low-rent James Bond thriller&quot;, a &quot;remake of &quot;Dr. No&quot;&quot; with elements of Fu Manchu. J.C. Maçek III of PopMatters wrote, &quot;Of course the real showcase here is the obvious star here, Bruce Lee, whose performance as an actor and a fighter are the most enhanced by the perfect sound and video transfer. While Kelly was a famous martial artist and a surprisingly good actor and Saxon was a famous actor and a surprisingly good martial artist, Lee proves to be a master of both fields.&quot;

Many acclaimed newspapers and magazines reviewed the film. &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;rich in the atmosphere&quot;, the music score as &quot;a strong asset&quot; and the photography as &quot;interesting&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a rave review: &quot;The picture is expertly made and well-meshed; it moves like lightning and brims with color. It is also the most savagely murderous and numbing hand-hacker (not a gun in it) you will ever see anywhere.&quot;

The film holds an 88% approval rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 78 reviews, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Badass to the max, &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; is the ultimate kung-fu movie and fitting (if untimely) Bruce Lee swan song.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100 based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In 2004, the film was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was selected as the best martial arts film of all time, in a 2013 poll of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; critics. The film also ranks No. 474 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;.

=== Home video ===
&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; has remained one of the most popular martial arts films since its premiere and has been released numerous times worldwide on multiple home video formats. For almost three decades, many theatrical and home video versions were censored for violence, especially in the West. In the UK alone, at least four different versions have been released. Since 2001, the film has been released uncut in the UK and most other territories. Most DVDs and Blu-rays come with a wide range of extra features in the form of documentaries, interviews, etc. In 2013, a second, remastered HD transfer appeared on Blu-ray, billed as the &quot;40th Anniversary Edition&quot;.

In 2020, new 2K digital restorations of the theatrical cut and special edition were included as part of the &quot;Bruce Lee: His Greatest Hits&quot; box set by The Criterion Collection (under licensed from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment through the physical home media joint venture in US and Canada named Studio Distribution Services, LLC. and Fortune Star Media Limited), which featured all of Lee&#x27;s films, as well as &quot;Game of Death II&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; has been parodied and referenced in places such as the 1976 film &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot;, the satirical publication &quot;The Onion&quot;, the Japanese game-show &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;, and the 1977 John Landis comedy anthology film &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; (in its lengthy &quot;A Fistful of Yen&quot; sequence, basically a comedic, note for note remake of &quot;Dragon&quot;) and also in the film &quot;Balls of Fury&quot;. It was also parodied on television in &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; during the episode &quot;Jackie Moves On&quot; with regular character Fez taking on the Bruce Lee role. Several clips from the film are comically used during the theatre scene in &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;. Lee&#x27;s martial arts films were broadly lampooned in the recurring &quot;Almost Live!&quot; sketch &quot;Mind Your Manners with&quot; &quot;Billy Quan&quot;. Ram Gopal Varma directed the martial-arts film &quot;&quot; after being heavily inspired by the film.

In August 2007, the now-defunct Warner Independent Pictures announced that television producer Kurt Sutter would be remaking the film as a noir-style thriller entitled &quot;Awaken the Dragon&quot; with Korean singer-actor Rain. It was announced in September 2014 that Spike Lee would work on the remake. In March 2015, Brett Ratner revealed that he wanted to make the remake. In July 2018, David Leitch was in early talks to direct the remake. As of 2024, there are no further updates on this project.

=== Cultural impact ===
&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; has been cited as one of the most influential action films of all time. Sascha Matuszak of &quot;Vice&quot; called it the most influential kung fu film and said it &quot;is referenced in all manner of media, the plot line and characters continue to influence storytellers today and the impact was particularly felt in the revolutionizing way the film portrayed African-Americans, Asians and traditional martial arts.&quot; Joel Stice of &quot;Uproxx&quot; called it &quot;arguably the most influential kung fu movie of all time.&quot; Kuan-Hsing Chen and Beng Huat Chua cited its fight scenes as influential as well as its &quot;hybrid form and its mode of address&quot; which pitches &quot;an elemental story of good against evil in such a spectacle-saturated way.&quot; Quentin Tarantino cited &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; as a formative influence on his career.

According to Scott Mendelson of &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; contains spy film elements similar to the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series. &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was the most successful action-spy film to not be part of the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series; &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; had an initial global box office comparable to the &quot;James Bond&quot; films of that era, and a lifetime gross surpassing every &quot;James Bond&quot; film up until &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. Mendelson argues that, had Bruce Lee lived after &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was released, the film had the potential to launch an action-spy film franchise starring Bruce Lee that could have rivalled the success of the &quot;James Bond&quot; franchise.

The film had an impact on MMA. In the opening fight sequence, where Lee fights Sammo Hung, Lee demonstrated elements of what would later become known as MMA. Both fighters wore what would later become common MMA clothing items, including kempo gloves and small shorts, and the fight ends with Lee utilising an armbar (then used in judo and jiu-jitsu) to submit Hung. According to UFC Hall of Fame fighter Urijah Faber, &quot;that was the moment&quot; that MMA was born.

The &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga and anime franchise, debuted in 1984, was inspired by &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, which &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; creator Akira Toriyama was a fan of. The title &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was also inspired by &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; and the piercing eyes of Goku&#x27;s Super Saiyan transformation was based on Bruce Lee&#x27;s paralysing glare.

&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; inspired early beat &#x27;em up brawler games. It was cited by game designer Yoshihisa Kishimoto as a key inspiration behind Technōs Japan&#x27;s brawler &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot;, released as &quot;Renegade&quot; in the West. Its spiritual successor &quot;Double Dragon&quot; also drew inspiration from &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, with the game&#x27;s title being a homage to the film. &quot;Double Dragon&quot; also features two enemies named Roper and Williams, a reference to the two characters Roper and Williams from &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;. The sequel &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot; includes opponents named Bolo and Oharra.

&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was the foundation for fighting games. The film&#x27;s tournament plot inspired numerous fighting games, such as the &quot;Tekken&quot; series, for example. The &quot;Street Fighter&quot; video game franchise, debuted in 1987, was inspired by &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, with the gameplay centered around an international fighting tournament, and each character having a unique combination of ethnicity, nationality and fighting style. &quot;Street Fighter&quot; went on to set the template for all fighting games that followed. The little-known 1985 Nintendo arcade game &quot;Arm Wrestling&quot; contains voice leftovers from the film, as well as their original counterparts. The popular fighting game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; borrows multiple plot elements from &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; as does its movie adaptation.

<doc id="10201" wikidata="Q60661" url="?curid=10201" title="Exothermic process">
<text>In thermodynamics, an exothermic process () is a thermodynamic process or reaction that releases energy from the system to its surroundings, usually in the form of heat, but also in a form of light (e.g. a spark, flame, or flash), electricity (e.g. a battery), or sound (e.g. explosion heard when burning hydrogen). The term &quot;exothermic&quot; was first coined by 19th-century French chemist Marcellin Berthelot.

The opposite of an exothermic process is an endothermic process, one that absorbs energy, usually in the form of heat. The concept is frequently applied in the physical sciences to chemical reactions where chemical bond energy is converted to thermal energy (heat).

==Two types of chemical reactions==
Exothermic and endothermic describe two types of chemical reactions or systems found in nature, as follows:

=== Exothermic===
An exothermic reaction occurs when heat is released to the surroundings. According to the IUPAC, an exothermic reaction is &quot;a reaction for which the overall standard enthalpy change Δ&quot;H&quot;⚬ is negative&quot;. Some examples of exothermic process are fuel combustion, condensation and nuclear fission, which is used in nuclear power plants to release large amounts of energy.

===Endothermic===
In an endothermic reaction or system, energy is taken from the surroundings in the course of the reaction, usually driven by a favorable entropy increase in the system. An example of an endothermic reaction is a first aid cold pack, in which the reaction of two chemicals, or dissolving of one in another, requires calories from the surroundings, and the reaction cools the pouch and surroundings by absorbing heat from them.

Photosynthesis, the process that allows plants to convert carbon dioxide and water to sugar and oxygen, is an endothermic process: plants absorb radiant energy from the sun and use it in an endothermic, otherwise non-spontaneous process. The chemical energy stored can be freed by the inverse (spontaneous) process: combustion of sugar, which gives carbon dioxide, water and heat (radiant energy).

==Energy release==
Exothermic refers to a transformation in which a closed system releases energy (heat) to the surroundings, expressed by

:formula_1

When the transformation occurs at constant pressure and without exchange of electrical energy, heat is equal to the enthalpy change, i.e.

:formula_2

while at constant volume, according to the first law of thermodynamics it equals internal energy () change, i.e.

:formula_3

In an adiabatic system (i.e. a system that does not exchange heat with the surroundings), an otherwise exothermic process results in an increase in temperature of the system.

In exothermic chemical reactions, the heat that is released by the reaction takes the form of electromagnetic energy or kinetic energy of molecules. The transition of electrons from one quantum energy level to another causes light to be released. This light is equivalent in energy to some of the stabilization energy of the energy for the chemical reaction, i.e. the bond energy. This light that is released can be absorbed by other molecules in solution to give rise to molecular translations and rotations, which gives rise to the classical understanding of heat. In an exothermic reaction, the activation energy (energy needed to start the reaction) is less than the energy that is subsequently released, so there is a net release of energy.

==Examples==

Some examples of exothermic processes are:
* Combustion of fuels such as wood, coal and oil/petroleum
* The thermite reaction
* The reaction of alkali metals and other highly electropositive metals with water
* Condensation of rain from water vapor
* Mixing water and strong acids or strong bases
* The reaction of acids and bases
* Dehydration of carbohydrates by sulfuric acid
* The setting of cement and concrete
* Some polymerization reactions such as the setting of epoxy resin
* The reaction of most metals with halogens or oxygen
* Nuclear fusion in hydrogen bombs and in stellar cores (to iron) 
* Nuclear fission of heavy elements
* The reaction between zinc and hydrochloric acid
* Respiration (breaking down of glucose to release energy in cells)

==Implications for chemical reactions==

Chemical exothermic reactions are generally more spontaneous than their counterparts, endothermic reactions.

In a thermochemical reaction that is exothermic, the heat may be listed among the products of the reaction.

<text>Elihu Yale (5 April 1649 – 8 July 1721) was a British-American colonial administrator.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Yale lived in America only as a child, and spent the rest of his life in England, Wales, and India.

He became a clerk for the East India Company at Fort St. George, later Madras, and eventually rose to the Presidency of the settlement. He was later removed from the post under charges of corruption for self-dealing, and required to pay a fine.

In 1699, he returned to Britain with a considerable fortune, around £200,000 (equivalent to £ in ), mostly made by selling diamonds, and spent his time and wealth in philanthropy and art collecting.

He was the primary benefactor of Yale College, now Yale University, which was named in his honor, following a donation of books, portraits, and textiles at the request of Rev. Cotton Mather, a Harvard University graduate. He had no male heir, and no descendants of his have survived past his grandchildren.

In the 21st century, Yale&#x27;s connections to slavery in India began to be more closely explored, a process assisted by the digitalisation and online publication of the East India Company&#x27;s records. In 2020, Peter Salovey, president of Yale University, launched the Yale and Slavery Research Project to explore the university&#x27;s historical links with slavery and colonialism, including Elihu Yale&#x27;s role.

== Early life ==
Yale was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to David Yale (1613–1690), a wealthy Boston merchant and attorney to Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, and Ursula Knight; he was the grandson of Ann Yale (born Lloyd), daughter of Bishop George Lloyd. After the death of her first husband, Thomas Yale Sr. (1587–1619), son of Chancellor David Yale, Anne Yale married Theophilus Eaton, ambassador to Denmark. Eaton was the co-founder of two of the Thirteen British Colonies, which are represented on the Flag of the United States, mainly through the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the New Haven Colony, and was the brother of Nathaniel Eaton, Harvard&#x27;s first Headmaster and President designate, at the founding of Harvard in 1636.

His son, Samuel Eaton, the uncle of Elihu, was also involved in the foundation of Harvard, being one of the seven founder members of the Harvard Corporation, the governing board and charter that incorporated the college in 1650. It was they, along with Elihu&#x27;s uncle and aunt, Thomas Yale Jr., and Anne Yale Jr., who brought the reconstituted Eaton/Yale family to America, while other members of the family stayed in England. Their estates in Wales were Plas-yn-Yale and Plas Grono, and Elihu&#x27;s brother was London merchant Thomas Yale, later ambassador to the King of Siam for the East India Company.

Elihu&#x27;s father, David Yale, would later come from London to New Haven Colony with his stepfather, Theophilus Eaton, in 1639. He moved to Boston in 1641 and met and married Elihu Yale&#x27;s mother, Ursula, in 1643. In 1652, at the age of three, Elihu Yale left New England, as David Yale took his family back to London. While documentation of this period is sparse, a letter suggests that David Yale remained a successful merchant and settled his family in the Hanseatic merchant district &quot;Steelyard Court&quot;. In 1662, at the age of thirteen, Elihu Yale entered the private school of William Dugard, but Dugard died a few months after Elihu Yale enrolled. Yale likely lived through the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire of London.

==East India Company==
In 1670, Yale joined the British East India Company, starting as a clerk at East India House in London. Among the board was the Earl of Berkeley, Sir Samuel Barnardiston, Vice-Admiral John Robinson, and Chairman Sir Andrew Riccard. Yale&#x27;s uncle, Connecticut Gov. Edward Hopkins, was also one of the shareholders. It is possible that Yale had business training in his father&#x27;s merchant counting house beforehand. He then sailed to India in December 1671 on one of the East Indiamen, on a voyage that would take six months, with the eminent dangers of pirates, storms and diseases.

He landed in Madras on 23 June 1672, at Fort St. George, where Portuguese, English and Hindu lived. He then learned the rules of Gov. William Langhorne, some of which being the interdiction to start a duel, to desert the fort, or to blaspheme, and met with Father Ephrem de Nevers. At the time, the East India Company was already exporting to Europe spices, pepper, precious stones, Chinese porcelains, Japanese screens, and cotton cloth. In 1674, Yale was sent to negotiate the potential establishment of a new factory, and by February, was allowed to deal in private trade, which included pearls, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, neckcloths, cloves and nutmegs. By 1677, Gov. Langhorne was accused of corruption by competitors within the Company. The directors were always suspicious, and with huge fortune being made six months away from London, they easily mistrust their employees.

He was then replaced by Gov. Streynsham Master, the son-in-law of Richard Legh of Lyme Hall. In April 1678, Yale was promoted to the rank of Factor, doubling his salary. In June arrived the Welsh chaplain John Evans, future Bishop of Meath, who would become a lifelong friend. In 1679, Yale&#x27;s duties now involved receiving and invoicing textiles worth about 100,000 pagodas, consisting of neckcloths, chintz, and longcloth of various grades. With the death of Joseph Hynmers, second-in-command, Yale was made Assistant to the Warehouse Keeper, and started courting his widow. They married at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, the oldest Anglican Church in India, on 4 November 1680, with Sir Henry Oxenden, Governor of Bombay, as brideman. With his wife&#x27;s capital, Yale learned the trade and became a specialist in diamonds and precious stones.

===Madras Council===
In January 1681, he was promoted to the office of Provisional Customer. In the same year, Gov. Streynsham Master was replaced by William Gyfford, and Yale was sent as a diplomat to meet the VOC Governor of Pulicat. Despite Master&#x27;s loyalty, the directors once again believed the charges of bad management, fueled by enemies, who brought complaints after complaints to the board in London. According to Madras historian Arthur Pringle, the official records are full of invented circumstantial charges of injustice and fraud. Yale was then promoted to the office of Mintmaster, and was given a seat on the council, occupying the fifth position on a board of six, as the directors were &quot;pleased with Elihu&#x27;s behavior and ability&quot;. In 1682, he was sent to Porto Novo on the Coromandel Coast to find investment opportunities for the sale of longcloth. During his mission, a great storm struck the coast, and 14,000 persons died. He made assessments of harbor facilities and fortifications, and was welcomed with coconuts as gifts of diplomacy.

Yale then negotiated with Sikandar Shah, the Sultan of Bijapur, and obtained permission for the gold trade in his territory. In 1683, as a member of Gov. Gyfford&#x27;s council, he became a cofounder of the Madras Bank, the oldest in India. On 12 February, the second-in-command was dismissed for his &quot;language that was too independent and not sufficiently subservient in his letters&quot;. The Councilmen rose in rank, with Yale becoming Warehouse Keeper. When Gov. Gyfford was sent to inspect factories in the Bay of Bengal, Yale became acting governor for a few months, and procured three elephants from King Narai of Siam, to be sent to the Sultan of Gingee as war elephants. In peace time, they were used with a Howdah as status symbols, while at war, they were the prototypes of the modern tank. Yale then obtained a house and garden at St. Thomas Mount for the sickly and their convalesce. Thereafter, he received 3 princes from Sumatra, Indonesia, bringing a letter from Sultanah Inayat Syah, Queen of Acheen, resulting in a trade agreement. About this time, King Charles II of England died, with James II ascending to the throne. The change was well welcomed by the company, as the chairman, Sir Josiah Child, had spent a fortune on James&#x27;s ascension. Yale then organized the official ceremony at Fort St. George, with Gov. Gyfford resuming his office, and received the ambassadors of Persia and Siam.

===Presidency of Madras===

In July 1687, Yale was appointed President of Madras and Governor of Fort St. George, replacing William Gyfford. A difficulty of the office was to deal with the native rulers through firmans, as Madras was surrounded by the Mughal Empire, with rulers always asking for bribes. When their demands were refused, they would seized the food supplies, half starving the company&#x27;s servants with a blockade. In terms of size, Madras consisted of about 300,000 people, or around 6% of England&#x27;s population at the time. Yale had previously been popular with both the Europeans and native Indians, and reverted to the former practice of living and dining in the Fort House with merchants, writers and factors.

With Yale&#x27;s nomination, Sir Josiah Child hoped that Madras would be less critical of London. As the East India Company&#x27;s headquarters were thousands of miles away, the board implemented policies that were not well adapted to the conditions in Madras. Letters took 6 months to be received, sometimes over a year, making communications difficult. One of these policies was the creation of a new tax upon Madras inhabitants that Yale had now to carry out, which caused a local rebellion. During this time, they accused him of not cutting expenses down, such as keeping a Bengal tiger at the fort, among other things. Those who were taxed the most were the owners of the 128 houses within the fort, which half belonged to the Portuguese merchants. The company&#x27;s chairman sent a letter to Yale, writing that &quot;your elaborate arguments to persuade us not to impose a moderate duty upon the Portuguese and other inhabitants of our city of Madras, whom we do protect and exceedingly encourage in their several vocations, have no weight at all with us&quot;.

Yale had received similar letters during the Great Famine under Gov. Gyfford, where they had refused to collect taxes, with the directors replying that &quot;you are still fencing against our creating revenue at the Fort, with slight, insignificant arguments, wherein the worst is that you should have so mean an opinion of us, as to think such sophistical reasons will make any impressions on our judgment&quot;. The directors also gave the order to close the Garden House, which was used for those who were resting outside the city, having a place to eat. Yale didn&#x27;t follow this order and kept Gov. Gyfford there as his health was fragile. During August 1687, Yale is then recorded corresponding with the Ambassador of Shah Suleiman of Persia, regarding his arrival with a Koran to try to convert the Siamese king to Mohammedanism, which the latter refused. Being bankrupt after his failed mission, Yale loaned him money, which was never repaid.

===Anglo-Siamese War===

For many years, merchants of Madras and Siam were trading partners in the Andaman Sea, trading in rhinoceros horns, elephant tusks, copper and other commodities. Yale&#x27;s brother, Thomas Yale, became ambassador to King Narai of Siam, and during this time, Elihu would entertain at his house the French ambassador and musketeer, Count Claude de Forbin, drinking to the health of the royal families of England and France. But around August 1687, disputes regarding Siam&#x27;s strategic importance emerged among European powers, and Gov. Yale was charged by King Narai&#x27;s agents regarding the sale of jewels, which they estimated having overpaid by 25%. The man behind the charges was a Greek named Constantine Phaulkon, who wanted to lower English&#x27;s influence over King Narai, and get him closer to Louis XIV of France through Chevalier de Chaumont.

This trading dispute started the Anglo-Siamese War, with Yale acting on behalf of King James II of England, which resulted in number of casualties for the company, as cities were now being robbed by Siameses. Some English merchants at Siam sided with the enemy, and became involved in acts of piracy, which had Yale send warships in retaliation against Englishmen who changed sides. No peace treaty was ever signed, but the war against the Company will eventually stop around 1688. In London, the directors investigated the accusations of the Siameses on Yale and cleared his name, declaring that &quot;you can not be ignorant that Phaulkon himself in the King of Siam&#x27;s name, began the war... upon a pretense that Mr. Yale injured the King of Siam in a bargain&quot;. Phaulkon&#x27;s alliance with France would later cost him his life, being assassinated by the Siameses nobles during the Siamese revolution of 1688. On 11 August 1687, Yale approved the recall of several Englishmen to Madras detained by Prussian Wolf Henrik von Kalnein, governor of Tranquebar under the Danish East India Co..

===Siege of Golconda===

About a month later, on 22 September 1687, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb conquered the nearby Kingdom of Golconda, defeating Sultan Abul Shah at the Siege of Golconda, ending the Qutb Shahi dynasty. Aurangzeb was a member of Tamerlane&#x27;s dynasty, and his parents, founders of the Taj Mahal, were direct descendants of Genghis Khan. As Yale expected the Mughal&#x27;s revenge for the Anglo-Mughal War started by the directors in Bengal, he prepared for war and raised a Portuguese militia, but as the Mughal had thousands of war elephants, he and the council had no choice but to pay him 50,000 pagodas to keep the Company&#x27;s activities in Madras. Gov. Yale was now under the overlordship of the Islamic Mughal Empire. He sent diplomats to pay Emperor Aurangzeb, one of which was his friend Daniel Chardin, diamond merchant and brother of Sir Jean Chardin, Yale&#x27;s partner in England. He also sent letters to Mughal general Mahabat Khan, and complied with the ceremonies of prince Muhammad Bakhs and prime minister Asad Khan. The situation was delicate as the Dutch and Louis XIV at Versailles were also trying to get the Mughal in their favor, and the directors would hold Yale responsible if anything went wrong, including failing to keep the Golconda diamonds trade from the Kollur Mines.

At the time, India was the world producer of diamonds, with Golconda producing 60% of its total output. Most of Yale&#x27;s private fortune will be obtained from this trade with the Moghul, who received royalties, while Yale used his expertise and capital to hold on these stones until they were faceted and polished in Amsterdam, on their way to London. The process took on average 3 years before getting a return on investment, and Yale had 50 trained men to protect the goods from robbers during transportation. By 1688, Sir Josiah Child, the Company&#x27;s largest shareholder, retired with a fortune of about £200,000 (equivalent to £ in ), and married his daughter to the son of the 1st Duke of Beaufort at Badminton House. During the same year, Yale welcomed the Armenian merchants to establish themselves at Fort St. George following their persecution in Europe. In July, he sent diplomats for the arrival of Dutch Gov. Johannes Camphuys, and on 29 September 1688, he inaugurated the Madras Corporation, where Nathaniel Higginson was elected its first mayor, with Amsterdam merchant Jacques de Paiva and others, elected on its board. Initially founded to restrain Yale&#x27;s powers as governor, it became the oldest corporation in India, and the second oldest municipal body in the world after the City of London. Paiva&#x27;s widow, Hieronima, would become Yale&#x27;s mistress and bear him a son named Charles.

===Anglo-Dutch relations===
Following the English Revolution of 1688, William of Orange, a Dutch, ascended to the throne of England, replacing James II, which was a fatal blow for Sir Josiah Child who had bet on the wrong side. The past wars between the Dutch and English merchants in Madras were now settled, and both started to form alliances through marriage. From then on, the directors&#x27; letters to Yale changed in tone. Sir Langhorne started complimenting him on his private trade in diamonds, as they now saw it as a way to expand the company to new markets without having to bear the risks themselves. Yale tried to build routes at Mindanao, the second largest island of the Philippines, getting from them Clove and Ironwood. He was then put on a secret committee with Sir John Child, governor of Bombay, and Nathaniel Higginson, mayor of Madras, to plan the establishment of a new fort near the South Seas, to engage in trade with China. On 17 March 1689, Yale received the arrival of Commander Job Charnock, with his staff and four companies of soldiers. He arrived from a failed mission that consisted of blocking and seizing the ships of Mughal Aurangzeb, who had attacked the company&#x27;s ships in the Bay of Bengal, and taken control of Chittagong during the Anglo-Mughal War.

Charnock stayed in Madras for a few months under Gov. Yale&#x27;s protection, which caused dissensions in the council for fear of the Mughal&#x27;s revenge. The Council eventually outvoted Yale, and Charnock was forced to leave, where he would found the city of Calcutta. In July, 1690, news of the war between William of Orange and Louis XIV of France arrived in Madras, and Yale prepared Fort St. George once more for war. On 15 August, the French sent seven warships to attack the Madras roads, along with one fireship. The fort was protected by a garrison of 700 soldiers under Gov. Yale, with the help of a Dutch fleet. Combat lasted a few hours, and the French were repulsed by the fort&#x27;s guns, after which they didn&#x27;t return. Yale then negotiated the release of Englishmen, dealing with Moghul general Shaista Khan, along with Daniel Chardin, who was sent to the King of Kandy. In 1690, Yale&#x27;s brother negotiated with Rama Raja, the Chhatrapati of the Marathas, for the acquisition of a fort at Devanampatnam on behalf of the company, which was sold for 40,000 pagodas. They renamed the place Fort St. David in honor of a Welsh saint. On 28 December, they supplied ammunition to general Zulfiqar Khan, son of Grand Vizier Asad Khan, from which they obtained the firman for the territories of Vizagapatam, Gingee and Golconda. During this year, Yale was also instrumental to the development of the Government General Hospital for Madras soldiers.

===Slavery===

Records of the period indicate a flourishing slave trade in Madras. After English merchants began to kidnap young children and deport them to distant parts of the world, the administration of Fort St George stepped in and introduced laws to curb the practice. On 2 February 1688, Elihu Yale decreed that slaves should be examined by the judges of the choultry before being transported. Transportation of young children, in particular, was made unlawful. During his tenure as President of Madras, Yale ordered a minimum of 10 slaves sent on every ship going to Europe, and on a month in 1687, Fort St George exported at least 665 slaves. In his judicial capacity he also on several occasions sentenced so-called &quot;black criminals&quot; to whipping and enslavement. Evidence as to whether Yale personally owned slaves, or participated directly in their sale is inconclusive; the historian Steven Pincus suggests that he did not, while, in a 2016 article in the &quot;Journal of Global History&quot;, Elizabeth Kuebler-Wolf stated that he enslaved one or two people as household servants, citing explorer Hiram Bingham&#x27;s 1939 book &quot;Elihu Yale&quot;. Historian Joseph Yannielli writes that although Yale &quot;probably did not own any of these people – the majority were held as the property of the East India Company – he certainly profited both directly and indirectly from their sale&quot;, while the Sterling Professor David W. Blight suggests that Yale&#x27;s personal ownership is &quot;not a key question [...] some portion of [his] considerable fortune derived from his myriad entanglements with the purchase and sale of human beings&quot; through his &quot;key leadership role in the business of human trafficking&quot;.

===The Groom===
Gov. Yale&#x27;s story of having hanged his groom for taking his favorite horse on a day is a false story that was propagated by privateer Alexander Hamilton. The events were as follow: In August 1689, two soldiers of Fort St. George stole guns, horses, and other items, and left Madras as fugitives with a group of five confederates to join the enemy&#x27;s army during war time. One was named George Isaac, and the other was named Charles Cross, the latter being not only a soldier but also one of the grooms of the fort&#x27;s stables. They were captured by the Polligars on their way to the Mughal and surrendered to Madras on condition of showing them mercy, which was initially agreed, but once arrived, Gov. Yale and the Council decided to have them sentenced for treason and desertion. One was executed before the stables, the other was shot in front of the fort&#x27;s gate. Thirty-eight years later, Capt. Hamilton wrote about the event in his memoirs, from a &quot;weal and treacherous memory&quot;. As a past employee who became a Privateer, he never forgave the taxes the Company forced upon him during his private travels, and his depiction of the time, always critical of his past employer, are not considered faithful about the period.

==Elihu Yale v. East India Co.==
The later years of Yale&#x27;s governance was marked by serious conflicts between his Presidency and the council, coming from Thomas Gray, Sir Josiah Child&#x27;s servant, and lawyer William Fraser, a man known for his violent temper. They accused Yale of trying to get military power into his own hands. In 1691, Yale then received several Indian merchants and citizens who came to complain about Fraser&#x27;s behaviour as new Mayor of Madras. Fraser had imprisoned four of their friends for refusing to sign an arbitration proceeding, and were stuck without food adapted to their religion. Yale ordered the marshal to temporarily release them to their private homes, and reversed other sentences made by the Mayor&#x27;s Court. Yale wrote in his letter that &quot;he would have been unfaithful to his trust had he permitted an innocent man to starve to death in prison&quot;. On 1 October 1692, letters arrived from London with accusations against Yale, making Nathaniel Higginson the new President of Madras. According to Madras historian Fanny Penny, the accusations were the same as with past governors, being the &quot;old story of private trade, jealousy on the part of his fellow-merchants, and suspicion and distrust at home as his wealth accumulated&quot;.

By then, Yale&#x27;s fortune was at £205,000 (equivalent to £ in ), which was the same as the Company&#x27;s former chairman and largest shareholder, Sir Josiah Child. On 23 November, Sir John Goldsborough and judge John Dolben arrived in Madras for Yale&#x27;s investigation. The Councillors took the law into their own hands, and had the Yale brothers imprisoned, and fearing of being poisoned, Yale wrote a letter to be delivered to the King of England by his brother, who will leave Madras on 20 February 1694. The investigators then inspected the fortifications around Black Town, the Indian natives&#x27;s neighborhood. Yale had built the walls with the company&#x27;s fund to protect the town against invasions of the Mughal Emperor, but having not followed the directors&#x27;s order to tax the natives for it, he was fined 3484 pagodas with interest by the Company. Goldsborough then sent a group of musketeers to Mrs. Nicks&#x27;s house, Yale&#x27;s friend, to investigate fraud charges regarding cloths, where she would be fined for her husband&#x27;s mistakes. Not having enough money to pay the taxes to bring her children home to England, she would be forced to sail without them. For Yale&#x27;s trial, William Fraser was first put on the court, but Yale had him temporarily displaced after Fraser had imprisoned a Portuguese merchant for four years upon suspicion alone. By July, Sir John Goldsborough concluded his investigation, and left the countercharges to Fraser, not finding any evidence that Yale had defrauded the East India Company. His fines were based for the most part on technicalities, where he had not followed orders or made errors of judgment.

===The case reach London===
Ten months later, while still in prison, Yale&#x27;s brother arrived in London in 1695, and reached directly to the King&#x27;s Privy Council on 14 February at Kensington Palace, contesting the accusations. The Privy Council ordered a reply from the East India Company but were not impressed by their statements against Yale&#x27;s activities, therefore they ordered, on behalf of the king, to stop all the company&#x27;s ships that were ready to sail for Fort St. George in India. Yale&#x27;s case was given to Sir Thomas Rawlinson, and was attended by the King of England, William of Orange, Prince George of Denmark, Archbishop Thomas Tenison and the principal ministers. They ordered that the Attorney General examine the charter granted to the whole Company, and to examine their powers in matters of judicature. Their investigation was brought to Parliament, where they discovered briberies made by Sir Josiah Child and Sir Thomas Cook to Tory members. Thereafter, the King of England, William of Orange, ordered on 15 March 1695, the liberation of Elihu Yale, so that he could come back to England whenever he chose, with the additional order of giving him the Great Cabin in the Company ship of his choosing when he would be ready to sail home. When the letter reached Madras ten months later on 8 January 1696, Yale was immediately offered a ship for Britain, but having already served the company for over 20 years, he decided to stay as Fraser was still on his case.

Fraser then suggested to Sir Josiah Child that Yale had poisoned four members of the Council over the years. Fraser&#x27;s case relied on statements made by two Indian natives that were not sworn, where they said that they had heard someone, who is now dead, say that somebody else, who has now left Madras, that two of Yale&#x27;s enemies were still alive, and that they would be dead soon. Based on native gossips, the directors dismissed the case. Thereafter, president Higginson was told by his servant of seven years that Fraser had threatened him twice, to which he replied that he had beaten him because he didn&#x27;t like his Salams. Fraser was then charged and banned from the council. With Fraser removed, Yale stayed at Fort St. George for some years, and over time, cleared his name of all scandal and developed his diamond business. Gov. Thomas Pitt, who would find the Pitt Diamond, became Yale&#x27;s partner, as the Company had now removed all restrictions on private trade. In 1699, after a 30 years career in India, Yale decided to sail home, and was granted the usual privilege of past governors to bring back five tons of goods, which he filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, Chinawares, Persian carpets, nutmegs, and other items. He decided to have Gov Pitt&#x27;s ship as his vessel, and brought back with him the children of Mrs. Nicks. Over time, the old accusations against the company&#x27;s officers enriching themselves at their expense appeared less frequently, as the directors learned that their employees could grow wealthy while advancing their commercial interests.

==Return to Britain==
Yale arrived in Britain in 1699 with a fortune that amounted to £200,000 (equivalent to £ in ), mostly made from his diamond business in the Golconda mines and Kollur mines in Southern India. In relation to GDP, his fortune amounted to 1/4 % of UK&#x27;s GDP at the time, which translates to nearly 6 billion British pounds in 2021 money. Famous diamonds extracted from these mines over time have included the Orlov Diamond, belonging to Catherine the Great, the Hope Diamond, belonging to Louis XIV, the Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond, belonging to the Habsburgs, among others. Yale acquired rough stones from the Mughal Emperors of Golconda in exchange for a royalty, and were sent to Fort St. George, India, under the protection of 50 trained men. Thereafter, Yale would send the diamonds to Amsterdam to be faceted and polished, until ready to be shipped to London. The process took on average 3 years and needed large amounts of capital to endure setbacks, such as wars and political instability.

During the War of the Spanish Succession, shipments would get stolen by pirates on their way to Europe, and once there, the Europeans princes and nobility would lack the funds to acquire them, forcing some merchants into bankruptcy. Demand followed the Coronations of monarchs, royal court events, war victories and other ceremonies. It became the most important branch of private trade of East India employees between Madras and London. Along with Sir Jean Chardin and Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, Yale became one of the largest European diamond traders in the world, as nearly all diamonds came from India during that period. Chardin, the past jewel merchant of the Shah of Persia, was also one his partners. He kept doing business with his friends Gov. Thomas Pitt, grandfather of prime minister William Pitt, and Sir Charles Cotterell, during the era where London became the international trading centre of diamonds, dislodging Portugal and the Netherlands. This new class of merchants who made their fortune in the East Indies would become known as the Nabobs in Britain.

===London life===
During the Georgian era under King George I, Yale and other merchants would meet at London coffee houses as centres of social life. He kept his title of governor, and after the failures of his bankers, he opened a bank account in the newly created Bank of England, with deposits at C. Hoare &amp; Co of Sir Richard Hoare, now the oldest bank in Britain. He lived most of his remaining years at the Plas Grono estate in Wales, next to Erddig Hall, inherited from the line of his great-grandfather, Chancellor David Yale, and at his London house in Queen Square. His neighbors included the Duke of Powis at Powis House, Lord Chancellor Bathurst, Queen Anne and her son Prince William, and artists Charles Burney and Jonathan Richardson. In London society, Yale was associated with Sir Charles Cotterell, Master of the Ceremonies. He was then elected in December 1717 a Fellow of the Royal Society under Sir Isaac Newton. His candidature was introduced by Sir Hans Sloan, founder of the British Museum and compeer of Voltaire and Benjamin Franklin. In the same year, Yale was asked by Newton to deal with the donations of Dr. Thomas Paget, and later received a new map of the Netherlands dedicated to him by John Senex, royal geographer of Queen Anne.

Thereafter, his American godson David Yale entered Pembroke College at the University of Cambridge. Yale leased Latimer House from his son-in-law, Lord James Cavendish, son of the 1st Duke of Devonshire, to accommodate his daughter Ursula. He was elected High Sheriff of Denbighshire in Wales, gave money to Wrexham Church, and built a family gallery. He then became a member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and met there the Bishop of London, John Robinson, and the Lt. Gov. of New England, Francis Nicholson. From Nicholson&#x27;s influence, and with Jeremiah Dummer as intermediary, Yale would answer a donation request for Connecticut College through Harvard graduate Cotton Mather. While his initial plan was to bestow a charity at Oxford, he sent them books, along with Sir Isaac Newton. He also sent a newly painted portrait of King George I by artist Sir Godfrey Kneller, principal painter of the king at the time, and the institution changed its name to Yale College. The total sum gifted was about the same as John Harvard&#x27;s to Harvard College. The painting is now at Yale University Gallery, while about 214 of the books are at Yale Library. Yale&#x27;s will included donations to the poor of Wrexham in Wales, to Christ&#x27;s Hospital in London, St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, various workhouse and poorhouses, and to Connecticut College, later known as Yale.

== Marriage and children ==

In 1680 Yale married Catherine Elford, widow of Joseph Hynmers, second-in-command of Fort St George, India as Deputy Governor for the East India Company. Her father was wealthy Levant merchant Walter Elford, son of Turkey merchant Walter Sr., the step-nephew of Admiral Sir Francis Drake of Buckland Abbey, the explorer, and the half-brother of Sir Francis Drake, the MP.

Walter Elford Sr. was among the pioneers of the English Coffee Houses on Exchange Alley, next to the Royal Exchange, owning the Great Coffee House (Turk&#x27;s Head) until the Great Fire of London, and was featured in Samuel Pepys&#x27;s diaries. Catherine Elford&#x27;s maternal grandfather was merchant Richard Chambers, Alderman and Sheriff of the City of London, family of Sir Amyas Bampfylde of Poltimore House and Barrington Court.

Their wedding took place at St Mary&#x27;s Church, at Fort St George, where Yale was a vestryman and treasurer. The marriage was the first registered at the church. They had 4 children together. David Yale died young in 1687. Katherine Yale (died 1715), married to Dudley North of Glenham Hall, a cousin of Lord North, the prime minister who later lost the American War of Independence. Their daughter would marry Nicholas Herbert, son of Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke, and lived at Wilton House and Highclere Castle.

Anne Yale (died 1734) married to Lord James Cavendish of Chatsworth House, son of the 1st Duke of Devonshire of Hardwick Hall, and Lady Mary Butler, the Duke of Ormond&#x27;s daughter at Kilkenny Castle. Lord Cavendish was also a nephew of Earl John Cecil of Burghley House, and a grandson of Countess Elizabeth Cecil of Hatfield House.

Ursula Yale, who never married, died in 1721 at Latimer House, a house rented by Yale from his son-in-law - who is buried in the church on the estate. In 1687, after the death of Jacques de Paiva, a Portuguese Jewish diamond merchant and mines owner, Yale formed a relationship with his widow Hieronima de Paiva and brought her to live with him, causing a scandal within Madras&#x27;s colonial society. They had a son who died, along with his mother, in South Africa.

== Death ==
Yale died on 8 July 1721 in London. No descendants of his have survived past his grandchildren. His body was buried in the churchyard of the parish church of St Giles&#x27; Church, Wrexham, Wales. His tomb bears an inscription:

In Boston, Massachusetts, a tablet to Yale was erected in 1927 at Scollay Square, near the site of Yale&#x27;s birth. Yale president Arthur Twining Hadley penned the inscription, which reads: &quot;On Pemberton Hill, 255 Feet North of This Spot, Was Born on April Fifth 1649 Elihu Yale, Governor of Madras, Whose Permanent Memorial in His Native Land is the College That Bears His Name.&quot;

At his death, with no proper will, his heirs-at-law inherited the Plas Grono estate and sold it to Sir George Wynne.

==Yale University==

In 1718, Cotton Mather contacted Yale and asked for his help. Mather represented a small institution of learning that had been founded in 1701 in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, as the Collegiate School of Connecticut, which needed money for a new building. In 1717, Isaac Newton gave the college a copy of his book &quot;Principia&quot;, on Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, and in 1718, Yale sent Mather 417 books, a portrait of King George I of Britain, and nine bales of goods. These last were sold by the school for £800. In gratitude, officials named the new building Yale; eventually the entire institution became Yale College.

Yale was also a vestryman and treasurer of St Mary&#x27;s Church at Fort St George. On 6 October 1968, the 250th anniversary of the naming of Yale College for Yale, the classmates of Chester Bowles, then the American ambassador to India and a graduate of Yale (1924), donated money for lasting improvements to the church and erected a plaque to commemorate the occasion. In 1970, a portrait of him, later renamed &quot;Elihu Yale with Members of his Family and an Enslaved Child&quot;, was donated to the Yale Center for British Art from Chatsworth House. A portrait, painted during the 18th century, was also given to Yale University by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

On 5 April 1999, Yale University recognised the 350th anniversary of Yale&#x27;s birthday. An article that year in &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine by John Steele Gordon described Yale as the &quot;most overrated philanthropist&quot; in American history, arguing that the college that became Yale University was successful largely because of the generosity of a man named Jeremiah Dummer, but that the trustees of the school did not want it known by the name &quot;Dummer College&quot;. Of Yale&#x27;s donation to the college, totalling just under £1,162, Gordon suggested that &quot;never has so much immortality been purchased for so paltry a [...] sum.&quot;

In her article for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; about Skull and Bones, a secret society at Yale University, Alexandra Robbins alleges that Yale&#x27;s headstone was stolen years ago from its proper setting in Wrexham. She further alleges that the tombstone is now displayed in a glass case in a room with purple walls.

=== 21st century re-appraisal ===
In the 21st century Yale University&#x27;s historic associations with the slave trade have been re-evaluated. In 2017, the university determined to rename Calhoun College, which honoured the white supremacist and pro-slavery leader John C. Calhoun. In respect of Elihu Yale, the process was assisted by the availability online of the relevant East India Company records. In 2020 Yale&#x27;s president, Peter Salovey, launched the &quot;Yale and Slavery Research Project&quot; to explore the university&#x27;s links with slavery and colonialism, including Elihu Yale&#x27;s central role. The project was led by David W. Blight, director of the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition, and published its findings in 2024. Blight identified &quot;Yale&#x27;s key leadership role in the business of human trafficking&quot; and confirmed that part of Yale&#x27;s fortune unquestionably derived from &quot;the purchase and sale of human beings [...] much of his growing wealth derived from the lucrative trade in cloth, silks, precious jewels, and other commodities, yet this commerce was inseparable from the slave trade&quot;. In his foreword to the report, Salovey wrote of the importance of the study as providing a &quot;deeper, more honest understanding of who we are&quot; and of helping in &quot;coming to terms with injustices of the past and in confronting current wrongs&quot;.

A linked re-evaluation considered the artworks donated by, and related to, Elihu Yale, in particular, the painting &quot;Elihu Yale with Members of his Family and an Enslaved Child&quot;. The picture, which shows Yale and his relations being served by a collared African child, was donated to the Yale Center for British Art in 1970 and regularly displayed at the university. In 2020 the artist Titus Kaphar produced a version of the painting, entitled &quot;Enough About You&quot;, in which the main sitters are distorted beyond recognition and the image of the uncollared boy is set within a gold frame.

==The Yale collection==

Yale arrived in England with Indian artworks, and used his new wealth to build a large European art collection of 10,000 items, including 7,000 paintings, which would become, after his death, the first art auction in Britain. During this era, the English country houses started to include goods from India and China, brought over the continent by the East India Company. As about 75% of all Indian exports were long-lasting and colorful textiles, it gave rise to the 1700–1750 Western fashion period, which included the use of tapestries. A new desire for collecting emerged among the English aristocracy under the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim Palace, and the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth House. Yale followed their lead and became a famous collector in London, with artists visiting him at his Queen Square home to secure patronage, one of which would be Vanderbank, who worked at Kensington Palace and Castle Howard.

Many of Yale&#x27;s paintings came from Dutch Golden Age&#x27;s artists, the most famous being Rembrandt, Bruegel, Van Dyck, Rubens, Dürer, Van de Velde, Teniers, Lely, Kneller and Rosa. Yale&#x27;s collection was stored in four London houses, in addition to several coach houses and stables. Through the influence of the Royal Society under Isaac Newton, he collected instruments built on new science from dealers like George Willdey. He obtained the Leibniz–Clarke correspondence and acquired books from Bernard de Montfaucon, one of the modern founders of archaeology at the time. With a rising middle class in search of status symbols, he acquired watches and clocks from Thomas Tompion, father of English clockmaking, along with works of engineer Henry Winstanley. When Queen Anne commissioned Nicolas Dorigny to produce large prints at Hampton Court, Yale and the Duke of Devonshire acquired several of them. He acquired one of the Jewels of Mary, Queen of Scots, along with works of Medici painter Adriaen van der Werff.

Other paintings included those of philosopher Thomas Hobbes, astronomer Pierre Gassendi, Sir John Wynn, and Jacques Courtois, previously patroned by Mattias de&#x27; Medici. At Yale&#x27;s death, his collection launched the auction concept in Britain, spacing the sales at a few months&#x27; intervals to not overload the art market. His European paintings were the largest group ever sold in England. Catalogues were available at various coffee houses such as Garraways. Van der Werff&#x27;s painting was acquired by the Earl of Derby, while a bidding war ensued for Queen Mary&#x27;s ring between the Earl of Oxford and the Earl of Pembroke. Yale&#x27;s granddaughter married the latter&#x27;s son, Nicholas Herbert, who lived at Wilton House and Highclere Castle. Inigo Jones&#x27;s designs were acquired by the 2nd Duke of Devonshire, and are still at Chatsworth House. It is thought that some of Yale&#x27;s missing paintings are now at the Hermitage Museum in Russia, dating back from Catherine the Great&#x27;s acquisition of the Walpole collection at Houghton Hall. Numerous works would later be acquired by Yale University, while others went to Madryn Castle, seat of Deputy William Corbet Yale of the Yales of Plas yn Yale.

==Ancestry and coats of arms==

Elihu&#x27;s ancestry, as a member of the Yale family, originated from the Lordship of Yale in North Wales. The Yale name was adopted from the maternal line, while the coat of arms, later adopted by Yale College, came from the paternal line. The Yales derived from the 6th century prince of Powys, Brochwel Ysgithrog, and from the 4th century king Cunedda. Following the division of the Kingdom of Powys during the 12th century, a new principality will emerge named Northern Powys, which will be kept by Elihu&#x27;s ancestors, the princes of Powys Fadog, Lords of Yale, with their seat at Castle Dinas Bran as members of the House of Mathrafal. They will submit to Edward Longshanks during the 13th century, with prince Gruffudd Fychan losing the lordship of Yale to the Earl of Surrey, William Wallace&#x27;s rival at Sterling Bridge.

About a century later, his descendant Owain Glyndwr, a cousin of the Tudors, would lose the War of Independence against Henry V, becoming the last Welsh Prince of Wales in 1415. Known by Shakespeare as Owen Glendower, he became the granduncle of baron Elissau ap Gruffudd, founder of the House of Yale in 1480, which Elihu belonged to. Elissau&#x27;s mother, Lowry ap Tudor, was Glyndwr&#x27;s niece, while his father, Griffith ap Einion, was a member of the House of Fitzgerald. Elissau would become co-heir of Glyndwr&#x27;s claims through his mother, including those of Mathrafal (Powys Fadog), which featured the Lordship of Bromfield and Yale. From his marriage to an heiress within the lordship, he received the estate of Allt Llwyn Dragon, which he renamed Plas yn Yale (Yale Manor). The name would then be adopted by his grandson, Chancellor Thomas Yale (b. 1525), and by Elihu&#x27;s great-grandfather, Chancellor David Yale, Thomas&#x27;s nephew.

While the Yale name was adopted from baron Elissau&#x27;s maternal line, the Yale arms would be inherited from his father, a member of the Fitzgeralds of Corsygedol, from the line of Osborne Fitzgerald, initially a Desmond. This line was founded by the marriage of a Welsh princess named Nesta, daughter of Rhys ap Tudor, with Norman lord Gerald de Windsor, son of the first governor of Windsor Castle for William the Conqueror. Two branches will form over time, the Yales of Plas yn Yale, who stayed in Britain, and the Yales of Plas Grono, who went to America in 1637. As Elihu was heir of the Plas Gronos in 1689, his arms would be those later used for Yale College, as well as for the Yale schools of Public Health, Environment and Medicine.

<text>Jean-Maurice-Émile Baudot (; 11 September 1845 – 28 March 1903), French telegraph engineer and inventor of the first means of digital communication Baudot code, was one of the pioneers of telecommunications. He invented a multiplexed printing telegraph system that used his code and allowed multiple transmissions over a single line. The baud unit was named after him.

==Early life==
Baudot was born in Magneux, Haute-Marne, France, the son of farmer Pierre Émile Baudot, who later became the mayor of Magneux. His only formal education was at his local primary school, after which he carried out agricultural work on his father&#x27;s farm before joining the French Post &amp; Telegraph Administration as an apprentice operator in 1869.

The telegraph service trained him in the Morse telegraph and also sent him on a four-month course of instruction on the Hughes printing telegraph system, which was later to inspire his own system.

After serving briefly during the Franco-Prussian War, he returned to civilian duties in Paris in 1872.

==Telegraphy==
The Telegraph Service encouraged Baudot to develop—on his own time—a system for time-multiplexing several telegraph messages using Hughes teleprinters. He realised that with most printing telegraphs of the period the line is idle for most of the time, apart from the brief intervals when a character is transmitted. Baudot devised one of the first applications of time-division multiplexing in telegraphy. Using synchronized clockwork-powered switches at the transmitting and receiving ends, he was able to transmit five messages simultaneously; the system was officially adopted by the French Post &amp; Telegraph Administration five years later.

Baudot invented his telegraph code in 1870 and patented it in 1874. It was a 5-bit code, with equal on and off intervals, which allowed telegraph transmission of the Roman alphabet, punctuation and control signals. By 1874 or 1875 (various sources give both dates) he had also perfected the electromechanical hardware to transmit his code. His inventions were based on the printing mechanism from Hughes&#x27; instrument, a distributor invented by Bernard Meyer in 1871, and the five-unit code devised by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber. Baudot combined these, together with original ideas of his own, to produce a complete multiplex system.

==Baudot system==

On 17 June 1874 Baudot patented his first printing telegraph (Patent no. 103,898 &quot;Système de télégraphie rapide&quot;), in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Baudot&#x27;s hardware had three main parts: the keyboard, the distributor, and a paper tape.

Each operator - there were as many as four - was allocated a single sector. The keyboard had just five piano type keys, operated with two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand. The five unit code was designed to be easy to remember. Once the keys had been pressed they were locked down until the contacts again passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard, when the keyboard was unlocked ready for the next character to be entered, with an audible click (known as the &quot;cadence signal&quot;) to warn the operator. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.

The receiver was also connected to the distributor. The signals from the telegraph line were temporarily stored on a set of five electromagnets, before being decoded to print the corresponding character on paper tape.

Accurate operation of this system depended on the distributor at the transmitting end keeping in synchronization with the one at the receiving end and operators only sending characters when the contacts passed over their allocated sector. This could be achieved at a speed of 30 wpm by strictly observing the &quot;cadence&quot; of rhythm of the system when the distributor gave the operator the use of the line.

==First use==
The Baudot system was accepted by the French Telegraph Administration in 1875, with the first online tests of his system occurring between Paris and Bordeaux on 12 November 1877. At the end of 1877, the Paris-Rome line, which was about , began operating a duplex Baudot.

The Baudot apparatus was shown at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1878) and won him the Exposition&#x27;s gold medal, as well as bringing his system to worldwide notice.

==Later career==
After the first success of his system, Baudot was promoted to Controller in 1880, and was named Inspector-Engineer in 1882.

In July 1887 he conducted successful tests on the Atlantic telegraph cable between Weston-super-Mare and Waterville, Nova Scotia operated by the Commercial Company, with a double Baudot installed in duplex, the Baudot transmitters and receivers substituted for the recorder.

On 8 August 1890 he established communications between Paris, Vannes, and Lorient over a single wire. On 3 January 1894 he installed a triplex apparatus on the telegraph between Paris and Bordeaux that had previously been operating with some difficulty on the Hughes telegraph system. On 27 April 1894 he established communications between the Paris stock exchange and the Milan stock exchange, again over a single wire, using his new invention, the retransmitter.

In 1897 the Baudot system was improved by switching to punched tape, which was prepared offline like the Morse tape used with the Wheatstone and Creed systems. A tape reader, controlled by the Baudot distributor, then replaced the manual keyboard. The tape had five rows of holes for the code, with a sixth row of smaller holes for transporting the tape through the reader mechanism. Baudot&#x27;s code was later standardised as International Telegraph Alphabet Number One.

Baudot received little help from the French Telegraph Administration for his system, and often had to fund his own research, even having to sell the gold medal awarded by the 1878 Exposition Universelle in 1880.

The Baudot telegraph system was employed progressively in France, and then was adopted in other countries, Italy being the first to introduce it, in its inland service, in 1887. The Netherlands followed in 1895, Switzerland in 1896, and Austria and Brazil in 1897. The British Post Office adopted it for a simplex circuit between London and Paris during 1897, then used it for more general purposes from 1898. In 1900 it was adopted by Germany, by Russia in 1904, the British West Indies in 1905, Spain in 1906, Belgium in 1909, Argentina in 1912, and Romania in 1913.

==Final years==
Baudot married Marie Josephine Adelaide Langrognet on 15 January 1890. She died only three months later, on 9 April 1890.

Soon after starting work with the telegraph service, Baudot began to suffer physical discomfort and was frequently absent from work for this reason, for as long as a month on one occasion. His condition affected him for the rest of his life, until he died on 28 March 1903, at Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine, near Paris, at the age of 57.

==Mimault patent suit==
In 1874, French telegraph operator Louis Victor Mimault patented a telegraph system using five separate lines to transmit. After his patent was rejected by the Telegraph Administration, Mimault modified his device to incorporate features from the Meyer telegraph and obtained a new patent which was also rejected. In the meantime, Baudot had patented his prototype telegraph a few weeks earlier.

Mimault claimed priority of invention over Baudot and brought a patent suit against him in 1877. The Tribunal Civil de la Seine, which reviewed testimony from three experts unconnected with the Telegraph Administration, found in favor of Mimault and accorded him priority of invention of the Baudot code and ruled that Baudot&#x27;s patents were simply improvements of Mimault&#x27;s. Neither inventor was satisfied with this judgment, which was eventually rescinded with Mimault being ordered to pay all legal costs.

Mimault became unnerved because of the decision, and after an incident where he shot at and wounded two students of the École Polytechnique (charges for which were dropped), he demanded a special act to prolong the duration of his patents, 100,000 Francs, and election to the Légion d&#x27;honneur. A commission directed by Jules Raynaud (head of telegraph research) rejected his demands. Upon hearing the decision, Mimault shot and killed Raynaud, and was sentenced to 10 years of forced labour and 20 years of exile.

==Honors==
*1881 - Diploma of Honor from the International Electrical Exposition.
*1882 - Gold medal from the Société d&#x27;Encouragement pour l&#x27;Industrie Nationale (SEIN)
*1889 - Ampere Medal from SEIN
*1878 - Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur
*1882 - Knight of the Order of Leopold
*1884 - Knight of the Order of Franz Joseph of Austria.
*1891 - Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy
*1898 - Promoted to Officier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur
*1900 - Knight of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (Italy)
*1901 - Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy
*A street in the 17th arrondissement of Paris was named after Baudot, but it no longer exists.
*In 1926 the International Telegraph Communications Advisory Committee of the International Telecommunication Union met in Berlin and immortalized Baudot by designating the baud - shortened from his name - as the unit of telegraph transmission speed.
*In 1949, the French Post Office issued a series of stamps with his portrait. By mistake, the year of his birth was given as 1848, not the correct 1845. The stamp was corrected and reprinted with a different color. However, the erroneous stamps still circulate among philatelists and have greater value than the corrected stamps.

<doc id="10211" wikidata="Q2497445" url="?curid=10211" title="Economic security">
<text>Economic security or financial security is the condition of having stable income or other resources to support a standard of living now and in the foreseeable future. It includes:
* probable continued solvency
* predictability of the future cash flow of a person or other economic entity, such as a country
* employment security or job security

Without such security, people may experience its opposite: economic insecurity and resulting economic anxiety.

Financial security more often refers to individual and family money management and savings. Economic security tends to include the broader effect of a society&#x27;s production levels and monetary support for non-working citizens.

==Components of individual economic security==
In the United States, children&#x27;s economic security is indicated by the income level and employment security of their families or organizations. Economic security of people over 50 years old is based on Social Security benefits, pensions and savings, earnings and employment, and health insurance coverage.

=== Arizona ===
In 1972, the state legislature of Arizona formed a Department of Economic Security with a mission to promote &quot;the safety, well-being, and self sufficiency of children, adults, and families&quot;. This department combines state government activities previously managed by the Employment Security Commission, the State Department of Public Welfare, the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, the State Office of Economic Opportunity, the Apprenticeship Council, and the State Office of Manpower Planning. The State Department of Mental Retardation (renamed the Division of Developmental Disabilities, House Bill 2213) joined the Department in 1974 . The purpose in creating the Department was to provide an integration of direct services to people in such a way as to reduce duplication of administrative efforts, services and expenditures. Family Connections became a part of the Department in January 2007.

=== Minnesota ===
The Minnesota Department of Economic Security was formed in 1977 from the departments of Employment Services and Vocational Rehabilitation, the Governor&#x27;s Manpower Office, and the Economic Opportunity Office, which administered anti-poverty programs. In 1985, State Services for the Blind was included in this department. In 2003, the Minnesota Department of Economic Security and Minnesota Department of Trade and Economic Development were merged to form The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development.

== National economic security ==
In the context of domestic politics and international relations, national economic security is the ability of a country to follow its choice of policies to develop the national economy in the manner desired. Historically, conquest of nations have made conquerors rich through plunder, access to new resources and enlarged trade through controlling of the economies of conquered nations. Today&#x27;s complex system of international trade is characterized by multi-national agreements and mutual inter-dependence. Availability of natural resources and capacity for production and distribution are essential under this system, leading many experts to consider economic security to be as important a part of national security as military policy.

Economic security has been proposed as a key determinant of international relations, particularly in the geopolitics of petroleum in American foreign policy after 1973 oil crisis and September 11, 2001.

In Canada, threats to the country&#x27;s overall economic security are considered economic espionage, which is &quot;illegal, clandestine or coercive activity by a foreign government in order to gain unauthorized access to economic intelligence, such as proprietary information or technology, for economic advantage.&quot;

In January 2021, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued Strategic Action Plan to Counter the Threat Posed by China.

In October 2021 in Japan, prime minister Fumio Kishida created the first-ever ministerial post for economic security.
And in April 2022, Japan&#x27;s National Diet passed an economic security bill aimed at guarding technology and reinforcing critical supply chains, while also imposing tighter oversight of Japanese firms working in sensitive sectors or critical infrastructure.
Measures in the legislation, which is primarily aimed at warding off risks from China, will be implemented over two years once it is enacted, according to the bill.

In March 2023, Japan and Germany agreed to strengthen cooperation on economic security in the aftermath of tensions over global supply chains and the economic impact of Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the first high-ministerial government consultations held between the two countries, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reached out to Tokyo to seek to reduce Germany&#x27;s dependence on China for imports of raw materials.

On April 4, 2023, a G7 Trade Ministers&#x27; Meeting via video conference was held to discuss on enhancing economic security, and a G7 Trade Ministers&#x27; Statement was issued on the day.
Also in April 2023, Japan&#x27;s Public Security Intelligence Agency (PSIA) launched a division dedicated to economic security. The agency also plans to set up such dedicated units in its regional bureaus nationwide to step up efforts to prevent cutting-edge technology and data from being leaked out of the country.
On 20 May 2023 on occasion of the G7 Hiroshima summit, economic security was discussed for the first time as the G7 agenda, and &quot;G7 Leaders&#x27; Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security&quot; was issued based on the discussion.

On 20 June 2023, the European Commission and the High Representative proposed a Joint Communication on a European Economic Security Strategy which will be discussed by EU leaders at their meeting.

==Other==
It is widely believed that there is a tradeoff between economic security and economic opportunity.

<doc id="10213" wikidata="Q204833" url="?curid=10213" title="Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution">
<text>Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), also known as 2.75G and under various other names, is a 2G digital mobile phone technology for packet switched data transmission. It is a subset of General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) on the GSM network and improves upon it offering speeds close to 3G technology, hence the name 2.75G. EDGE is standardized by the 3GPP as part of the GSM family and as an upgrade to GPRS.

EDGE was deployed on GSM networks beginning in 2003 – initially by Cingular (now AT&amp;T) in the United States. It could be readily deployed on existing GSM and GPRS cellular equipment, making it an easier upgrade for cellular companies compared to the UMTS 3G technology that required significant changes. Through the introduction of sophisticated methods of coding and transmitting data, EDGE delivers higher bit-rates per radio channel, resulting in a threefold increase in capacity and performance compared with an ordinary GSM/GPRS connection - originally a max speed of 384 kbit/s. Later, Evolved EDGE was developed as an enhanced standard providing even more reduced latency and more than double performance, with a peak bit-rate of up to 1 Mbit/s.

== Name and definition ==
Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution is the common full name of the EDGE standard. Other names include: Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS), IMT Single Carrier (IMT-SC), and Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution.

Although described as &quot;2.75G&quot; by the 3GPP body, EDGE is part of International Telecommunication Union (ITU)&#x27;s 3G definition. It is also recognized as part of the International Mobile Telecommunications - 2000 (IMT-2000) standard for 3G.

== Technology ==

EDGE/EGPRS is implemented as a bolt-on enhancement for 2.5G GSM/GPRS networks, making it easier for existing GSM carriers to upgrade to it. EDGE is a superset to GPRS and can function on any network with GPRS deployed on it, provided the carrier implements the necessary upgrade.
EDGE requires no hardware or software changes to be made in GSM core networks. EDGE-compatible transceiver units must be installed and the base station subsystem needs to be upgraded to support EDGE. If the operator already has this in place, which is often the case today, the network can be upgraded to EDGE by activating an optional software feature. Today EDGE is supported by all major chip vendors for both GSM and WCDMA/HSPA.

=== Transmission techniques ===
In addition to Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK), EDGE uses higher-order PSK/8 phase-shift keying (8PSK) for the upper five of its nine modulation and coding schemes. EDGE produces a 3-bit word for every change in carrier phase. This effectively triples the gross data rate offered by GSM. EDGE, like GPRS, uses a rate adaptation algorithm that adapts the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) according to the quality of the radio channel, and thus the bit rate and robustness of data transmission. It introduces a new technology not found in GPRS, incremental redundancy, which, instead of retransmitting disturbed packets, sends more redundancy information to be combined in the receiver. This increases the probability of correct decoding.

EDGE can carry a bandwidth up to 236 kbit/s (with end-to-end latency of less than 150 ms) for 4 timeslots (theoretical maximum is 473.6 kbit/s for 8 timeslots) in packet mode. This means it can handle four times as much traffic as standard GPRS. EDGE meets the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s requirement for a 3G network, and has been accepted by the ITU as part of the IMT-2000 family of 3G standards. It also enhances the circuit data mode called HSCSD, increasing the data rate of this service.

=== EDGE modulation and coding scheme (MCS) ===
The channel encoding process in GPRS as well as EGPRS/EDGE consists of two steps: first, a cyclic code is used to add parity bits, which are also referred to as the Block Check Sequence, followed by coding with a possibly punctured convolutional code. In GPRS, the Coding Schemes CS-1 to CS-4 specify the number of parity bits generated by the cyclic code and the puncturing rate of the convolutional code. In GPRS Coding Schemes CS-1 through CS-3, the convolutional code is of rate 1/2, i.e. each input bit is converted into two coded bits. In Coding Schemes CS-2 and CS-3, the output of the convolutional code is punctured to achieve the desired code rate. In GPRS Coding Scheme CS-4, no convolutional coding is applied.

In EGPRS/EDGE, the modulation and coding schemes MCS-1 to MCS-9 take the place of the coding schemes of GPRS, and additionally specify which modulation scheme is used, GMSK or 8PSK. MCS-1 through MCS-4 use GMSK and have performance similar (but not equal) to GPRS, while MCS-5 through MCS-9 use 8PSK. In all EGPRS modulation and coding schemes, a convolutional code of rate 1/3 is used, and puncturing is used to achieve the desired code rate. In contrast to GPRS, the Radio Link Control (RLC) and medium access control (MAC) headers and the payload data are coded separately in EGPRS. The headers are coded more robustly than the data.


== Deployment ==
The first EDGE network was deployed by Cingular (now AT&amp;T) in the United States on June 30, 2003, initially covering Indianapolis. T-Mobile US deployed their EDGE network in September 2005. In Canada, Rogers Wireless deployed their EDGE network in 2004. In Malaysia, DiGi launched EDGE beginning in May 2004 initially only in the Klang Valley.

In Europe, TeliaSonera in Finland rolled out EDGE in April 2004. Orange began trialling EDGE in France in April 2005 before a consumer rollout later that year. Bouygues Telecom completed its national deployment of EDGE in the country in 2005, strategically focusing on EDGE which is cheaper to deploy compared to 3G networks. Telfort was the first network in the Netherlands to roll out EDGE having done so by May 2005. Orange launched the UK&#x27;s first EDGE network in February 2006.

The Global Mobile Suppliers Association reported in 2008 that EDGE networks have been launched in 147 countries around the world.

== Evolved EDGE ==
Evolved EDGE, also called EDGE Evolution and 2.875G, is a bolt-on extension to the GSM mobile telephony standard, which improves on EDGE in a number of ways. Latencies are reduced by lowering the Transmission Time Interval by half (from 20 ms to 10 ms). Bit rates are increased up to 1 Mbit/s peak bandwidth and latencies down to 80 ms using dual carrier, higher symbol rate and higher-order modulation (32QAM and 16QAM instead of 8PSK), and turbo codes to improve error correction. This results in real world downlink speeds of up to 600 kbit/s. Further the signal quality is improved using dual antennas improving average bit-rates and spectrum efficiency.

The main intention of increasing the existing EDGE throughput is that many operators would like to upgrade their existing infrastructure rather than invest on new network infrastructure. Mobile operators have invested billions in GSM networks, many of which are already capable of supporting EDGE data speeds up to 236.8 kbit/s. With a software upgrade and a new device compliant with Evolved EDGE (like an Evolved EDGE smartphone) for the user, these data rates can be boosted to speeds approaching 1 Mbit/s (i.e. 98.6 kbit/s per timeslot for 32QAM). Many service providers may not invest in a completely new technology like 3G networks.

Considerable research and development happened throughout the world for this new technology. A successful trial by Nokia Siemens and &quot;one of China&#x27;s leading operators&quot; was achieved in a live environment. However, Evolved EDGE was introduced much later than its predecessor, EDGE, coinciding with the widespread adoption of 3G technologies such as HSPA and just before the emergence of 4G networks. This timing significantly limited its relevance and practical application, as operators prioritized investment in more advanced wireless technologies like UMTS and LTE.

Moreover, these newer technologies also targeted network coverage layers on low frequencies, further diminishing the potential advantages of Evolved EDGE. Coupled with the upcoming phase-out and shutdown of 2G mobile networks, it became very unlikely that Evolved EDGE would ever see deployment on live networks. As of 2016, no commercial networks supported the Evolved EDGE standard (3GPP Rel-7).

=== Technology ===

==== Reduced Latency ====
With Evolved EDGE come three major features designed to reduce latency over the air interface.

In EDGE, a single RLC data block (ranging from 23 to 148 bytes of data) is transmitted over four frames, using a single time slot. On average, this requires 20 ms for one way transmission. Under the RTTI scheme, one data block is transmitted over two frames in two timeslots, reducing the latency of the air interface to 10 ms.

In addition, Reduced Latency also implies support of Piggy-backed ACK/NACK (PAN), in which a bitmap of blocks not received is included in normal data blocks. Using the PAN field, the receiver may report missing data blocks immediately, rather than waiting to send a dedicated PAN message.

A final enhancement is RLC-non persistent mode. With EDGE, the RLC interface could operate in either acknowledged mode, or unacknowledged mode. In unacknowledged mode, there is no retransmission of missing data blocks, so a single corrupt block would cause an entire upper-layer IP packet to be lost. With non-persistent mode, an RLC data block may be retransmitted if it is less than a certain age. Once this time expires, it is considered lost, and subsequent data blocks may then be forwarded to upper layers.

==== Higher modulation schemes ====
Both uplink and downlink throughput is improved by using 16 or 32 QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), along with turbo codes and higher symbol rates.

== Enhanced CSD ==
A lesser-known version of the EDGE standard is Enhanced Circuit Switched Data (ECSD), which is circuit switched.

== Compact-EDGE ==
A variant, so called Compact-EDGE, was developed for use in a portion of Digital AMPS network spectrum. 

== Networks ==

The Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) states that, as of May 2013, there were 604 GSM/EDGE networks in 213 countries, from a total of 606 mobile network operator commitments in 213 countries.

<doc id="10216" wikidata="Q9993" url="?curid=10216" title="Eth">
<text>Eth ( , uppercase: ⟨Ð⟩, lowercase: ⟨ð⟩; also spelled edh or eð), known as  in Old English, is a letter used in Old English, Middle English, Icelandic, Faroese (in which it is called ), and Elfdalian. 

It was also used in Scandinavia during the Middle Ages, but was subsequently replaced with , and later . 

It is often transliterated as . 

The lowercase version has been adopted to represent a voiced dental fricative (IPA: ) in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

==Faroese==
In Faroese, is not assigned to any particular phoneme and appears mostly for etymological reasons, but it indicates most glides. When appears before , it is in a few words pronounced . In the Faroese alphabet, follows .

==Khmer==
 is sometimes used in Khmer romanization to represent &quot;&quot;.

==Icelandic==
In Icelandic, , called &quot;eð&quot;, represents an alveolar non-sibilant fricative, voiced intervocalically and word-finally, and voiceless otherwise, which form one phoneme, . Generally, is represented by thorn at the beginning of words and by elsewhere. The in the name of the letter is devoiced in the nominative and accusative cases: . In the Icelandic alphabet, follows .

==Norwegian==
In Olav Jakobsen Høyem&#x27;s version of based on , was always silent, and was introduced for etymological reasons.

==Old English==
In Old English, (called &quot;&quot;) was used interchangeably with to represent the Old English dental fricative phoneme or its allophone , which exist in modern English as the voiceless and voiced dental fricatives both now spelled .

Unlike the runic letter , is a modified Roman letter. Neither nor was found in the earliest records of Old English. A study of Mercian royal diplomas found that began to emerge in the early 8th century, with becoming strongly preferred by the 780s. Another source indicates that the letter is &quot;derived from Irish writing&quot;. 

Under the reign of King Alfred the Great, grew greatly in popularity and started to overtake , and did so completely by the Middle English period. in turn went obsolete by the Early Modern English period, mostly due to the rise of the printing press, and was replaced by the digraph .

==Welsh==
 has also been used by some in written Welsh to represent , which is normally represented as .

==Phonetic transcription==
* (U+00F0) represents a voiced dental fricative in the International Phonetic Alphabet.
* (U+1D9E) is used in phonetic transcription.
* ᴆ (U+1D06) is used in the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet.

==Computer encoding ==
Upper and lower case forms of eth have Unicode encodings:
* 

These Unicode codepoints were inherited from ISO/IEC 8859-1 (&quot;ISO Latin-1&quot;) encoding.
==Modern uses==
*A capital eth is used as the currency symbol for Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency.

<text>The Euphrates ( ; see below) is the longest and one of the most historically important rivers of Western Asia. Together with the Tigris, it is one of the two defining rivers of Mesopotamia (). Originating in Turkey, the Euphrates flows through Syria and Iraq to join the Tigris in the Shatt al-Arab in Iraq, which empties into the Persian Gulf.

The Euphrates is the fifteenth-longest river in Asia and the longest in Western Asia, at about , with a drainage area of that covers six countries.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Euphrates&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;Euphrátēs&quot; (), adapted from , itself from . The Elamite name is ultimately derived from cuneiform 𒌓𒄒𒉣; read as &quot;Buranun&quot; in Sumerian and &quot;Purattu&quot; in Akkadian; many cuneiform signs have a Sumerian pronunciation and an Akkadian pronunciation, taken from a Sumerian word and an Akkadian word that mean the same. The Akkadian &quot;Purattu&quot; has been perpetuated in Semitic languages (cf. &quot;al-Furāt&quot;; &quot;Pǝrāṯ&quot;, &quot;Pǝrāṯ&quot;) and in other nearby languages of the time (cf. Hurrian &quot;Puranti&quot;, Sabarian &quot;Uruttu&quot;). The Elamite, Akkadian, and possibly Sumerian forms are suggested to be from an unrecorded substrate language. Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze and Vyacheslav Ivanov suggest the proto-Sumerian &quot;*burudu&quot; &quot;copper&quot; (Sumerian &quot;urudu&quot;) as an origin, with an explanation that Euphrates was the river by which copper ore was transported in rafts, since Mesopotamia was the center of copper metallurgy during the period.

The Euphrates is called &quot;Yeprat&quot; in Armenian (), &quot;Perat&quot; in modern Hebrew (), in Turkish and in Kurdish. The Mandaic name is (), and is often mentioned as (pronounced ) in Mandaean scriptures such as the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot;. In Mandaean scriptures, the Euphrates is considered to be the earthly manifestation of the heavenly yardna or flowing river (similar to the Yazidi concept of Lalish being the earthly manifestation of its heavenly counterpart, or the ‘Sacred House’ Kaaba in Mecca being the earthly manifestation of the heavenly Al-Bayt Al-Mamur).

The earliest references to the Euphrates come from cuneiform texts found in Shuruppak and pre-Sargonic Nippur in southern Iraq and date to the mid-3rd millennium BCE. In these texts, written in Sumerian, the Euphrates is called &quot;Buranuna&quot; (logographic: UD.KIB.NUN). The name could also be written KIB.NUN.(NA) or dKIB.NUN, with the prefix &quot;d&quot; indicating that the river was a divinity. In Sumerian, the name of the city of Sippar in modern-day Iraq was also written UD.KIB.NUN, indicating a historically strong relationship between the city and the river.

== Course ==

The Euphrates is the longest river of Western Asia. It emerges from the confluence of the Kara Su or Western Euphrates () and the Murat Su or Eastern Euphrates () upstream from the town of Keban in southeastern Turkey. Daoudy and Frenken put the length of the Euphrates from the source of the Murat River to the confluence with the Tigris at , of which is in Turkey, in Syria and in Iraq. The same figures are given by Isaev and Mikhailova. The length of the Shatt al-Arab, which connects the Euphrates and the Tigris with the Persian Gulf, is given by various sources as .

Both the Kara Su and the Murat Su rise northwest from Lake Van at elevations of and amsl, respectively. At the location of the Keban Dam, the two rivers, now combined into the Euphrates, have dropped to an elevation of amsl. From Keban to the Syrian–Turkish border, the river drops another over a distance of less than . Once the Euphrates enters the Upper Mesopotamian plains, its grade drops significantly; within Syria the river falls while over the last stretch between Hīt and the Shatt al-Arab the river drops only .

=== Discharge===
The Euphrates receives most of its water in the form of rainfall and melting snow, resulting in peak volumes during the months April through May. Discharge in these two months accounts for 36 percent of the total annual discharge of the Euphrates, or even 60–70 percent according to one source, while low runoff occurs in summer and autumn. The average natural annual flow of the Euphrates has been determined from early- and mid-twentieth century records as at Keban, at Hīt and at Hindiya. However, these averages mask the high inter-annual variability in discharge; at Birecik, just north of the Syro–Turkish border, annual discharges have been measured that ranged from a low volume of in 1961 to a high of in 1963.

The discharge regime of the Euphrates has changed dramatically since the construction of the first dams in the 1970s. Data on Euphrates discharge collected after 1990 show the impact of the construction of the numerous dams in the Euphrates and of the increased withdrawal of water for irrigation. Average discharge at Hīt after 1990 has dropped to per second ( per year). The seasonal variability has equally changed. The pre-1990 peak volume recorded at Hīt was per second, while after 1990 it is only per second. The minimum volume at Hīt remained relatively unchanged, rising from per second before 1990 to per second afterward.

=== Tributaries ===

In Syria, three rivers add their water to the Euphrates; the Sajur, the Balikh and the Khabur. These rivers rise in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains along the Syro–Turkish border and add comparatively little water to the Euphrates. The Sajur is the smallest of these tributaries; emerging from two streams near Gaziantep and draining the plain around Manbij before emptying into the reservoir of the Tishrin Dam. The Balikh receives most of its water from a karstic spring near &#x27;Ayn al-&#x27;Arus and flows due south until it reaches the Euphrates at the city of Raqqa. In terms of length, drainage basin and discharge, the Khabur is the largest of these three. Its main karstic springs are located around Ra&#x27;s al-&#x27;Ayn, from where the Khabur flows southeast past Al-Hasakah, where the river turns south and drains into the Euphrates near Busayrah. Once the Euphrates enters Iraq, there are no more natural tributaries to the Euphrates, although canals connecting the Euphrates basin with the Tigris basin exist.

== Drainage basin ==
The drainage basins of the Kara Su and the Murat River cover an area of and , respectively. Estimates of the area of the Euphrates drainage basin vary widely; from a low to a high . Recent estimates put the basin area at , and . The greater part of the Euphrates basin is located in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. According to both Daoudy and Frenken, Turkey&#x27;s share is 28 percent, Syria&#x27;s is 17 percent and that of Iraq is 40 percent. Isaev and Mikhailova estimate the percentages of the drainage basin lying within Turkey, Syria and Iraq at 33, 20 and 47 percent respectively. Some sources estimate that approximately 15 percent of the drainage basin is located within Saudi Arabia, while a small part falls inside the borders of Kuwait. Finally, some sources also include Jordan in the drainage basin of the Euphrates; a small part of the eastern desert () drains toward the east rather than to the west.

== Climate change ==
In 2021, the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources reported that the Euphrates river could dry out by 2040 due to climate change and droughts.

== Natural history ==
The Euphrates flows through a number of distinct vegetation zones. Although millennia-long human occupation in most parts of the Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a xeric woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks, pistachio trees, and &quot;Rosaceae&quot; (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and &quot;Rosaceae&quot;. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including einkorn wheat, emmer, oat and rye.

South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-steppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the Syro–Iraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood (&quot;Artemisia herba-alba&quot;) and Amaranthaceae. Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of sheep and goat pastoralism by its inhabitants. Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of &quot;Chenopodiaceae&quot; or &quot;Poa sinaica&quot;. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a riverine forest. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the Oriental plane, the Euphrates poplar, the tamarisk, the ash and various wetland plants.

Among the fish species in the Tigris–Euphrates basin, the family of the Cyprinidae are the most common, with 34 species out of 52 in total. Among the Cyprinids, the mangar has good recreational fishing qualities, leading the British to nickname it the &quot;Tigris salmon.&quot; The Euphrates softshell turtle is an endangered soft-shelled turtle that is limited to the Tigris–Euphrates river system.

The Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs from the 1st millennium BCE depict lion and bull hunts in fertile landscapes. Sixteenth to nineteenth century European travellers in the Syrian Euphrates basin reported on an abundance of animals living in the area, many of which have become rare or even extinct. Species like gazelle, onager and the now-extinct Arabian ostrich lived in the steppe bordering the Euphrates valley, while the valley itself was home to the wild boar. Carnivorous species include the wolf, the golden jackal, the red fox, the leopard and the lion. The Syrian brown bear can be found in the mountains of Southeast Turkey. The presence of Eurasian beaver has been attested in the bone assemblage of the prehistoric site of Tell Abu Hureyra in Syria, but the beaver has never been sighted in historical times.

== River ==

The Hindiya Barrage on the Iraqi Euphrates, based on plans by British civil engineer William Willcocks and finished in 1913, was the first modern water diversion structure built in the Tigris–Euphrates river system. The Hindiya Barrage was followed in the 1950s by the Ramadi Barrage and the nearby Abu Dibbis Regulator, which serve to regulate the flow regime of the Euphrates and to discharge excess flood water into the depression that is now Lake Habbaniyah. Iraq&#x27;s largest dam on the Euphrates is the Haditha Dam; a earth-fill dam creating Lake Qadisiyah. Syria and Turkey built their first dams in the Euphrates in the 1970s. The Tabqa Dam in Syria was completed in 1973 while Turkey finished the Keban Dam, a prelude to the immense Southeastern Anatolia Project, in 1974. Since then, Syria has built two more dams in the Euphrates, the Freedom Dam and the Tishrin Dam, and plans to build a fourth dam – the Halabiye Dam – between Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor. The Tabqa Dam is Syria&#x27;s largest dam and its reservoir (Lake Assad) is an important source of irrigation and drinking water. It was planned that should be irrigated from Lake Assad, but in 2000 only had been realized. Syria also built three smaller dams on the Khabur and its tributaries.

With the implementation of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (&quot;&quot;, or &quot;GAP&quot;) in the 1970s, Turkey launched an ambitious plan to harness the waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates for irrigation and hydroelectricity production and provide an economic stimulus to its southeastern provinces. GAP affects a total area of and approximately 7 million people; representing about 10 percent of Turkey&#x27;s total surface area and population, respectively. When completed, GAP will consist of 22 dams – including the Keban Dam – and 19 power plants and provide irrigation water to of agricultural land, which is about 20 percent of the irrigable land in Turkey. C. of this irrigated land is located in the Euphrates basin. By far the largest dam in GAP is the Atatürk Dam, located c. northwest of Şanlıurfa. This dam was completed in 1992; thereby creating a reservoir that is the third-largest lake in Turkey. With a maximum capacity of , the Atatürk Dam reservoir is large enough to hold the entire annual discharge of the Euphrates. Completion of GAP was scheduled for 2010 but has been delayed because the World Bank has withheld funding due to the lack of an official agreement on water sharing between Turkey and the downstream states on the Euphrates and the Tigris.

Apart from barrages and dams, Iraq has also created an intricate network of canals connecting the Euphrates with Lake Habbaniyah, Lake Tharthar, and Abu Dibbis reservoir; all of which can be used to store excess floodwater. Via the Shatt al-Hayy, the Euphrates is connected with the Tigris. The largest canal in this network is the Main Outfall Drain or so-called &quot;Third River;&quot; constructed between 1953 and 1992. This canal is intended to drain the area between the Euphrates and the Tigris south of Baghdad to prevent soil salinization from irrigation. It also allows large freight barges to navigate up to Baghdad.

=== Environmental and social effects ===

The construction of the dams and irrigation schemes on the Euphrates has had a significant impact on the environment and society of each riparian country. The dams constructed as part of GAP – in both the Euphrates and the Tigris basins – have affected 382 villages and almost 200,000 people have been resettled elsewhere. The largest number of people was displaced by the building of the Atatürk Dam, which alone affected 55,300 people. A survey among those who were displaced showed that the majority were unhappy with their new situation and that the compensation they had received was considered insufficient. The flooding of Lake Assad led to the forced displacement of c. 4,000 families, who were resettled in other parts of northern Syria as part of a now abandoned plan to create an &quot;Arab belt&quot; along the borders with Turkey and Iraq.

Apart from the changes in the discharge regime of the river, the numerous dams and irrigation projects have also had other effects on the environment. The creation of reservoirs with large surfaces in countries with high average temperatures has led to increased evaporation; thereby reducing the total amount of water that is available for human use. Annual evaporation from reservoirs has been estimated at in Turkey, in Syria and in Iraq. Water quality in the Iraqi Euphrates is low because irrigation water tapped in Turkey and Syria flows back into the river, together with dissolved fertilizer chemicals used on the fields. The salinity of Euphrates water in Iraq has increased as a result of upstream dam construction, leading to lower suitability as drinking water. The many dams and irrigation schemes, and the associated large-scale water abstraction, have also had a detrimental effect on the ecologically already fragile Mesopotamian Marshes and on freshwater fish habitats in Iraq.

The inundation of large parts of the Euphrates valley, especially in Turkey and Syria, has led to the flooding of many archaeological sites and other places of cultural significance. Although concerted efforts have been made to record or save as much of the endangered cultural heritage as possible, many sites are probably lost forever. The combined GAP projects on the Turkish Euphrates have led to major international efforts to document the archaeological and cultural heritage of the endangered parts of the valley. Especially the flooding of Zeugma with its unique Roman mosaics by the reservoir of the Birecik Dam has generated much controversy in both the Turkish and international press. The construction of the Tabqa Dam in Syria led to a large international campaign coordinated by UNESCO to document the heritage that would disappear under the waters of Lake Assad. Archaeologists from numerous countries excavated sites ranging in date from the Natufian to the Abbasid period, and two minarets were dismantled and rebuilt outside the flood zone. Important sites that have been flooded or affected by the rising waters of Lake Assad include Mureybet, Emar and Abu Hureyra. A similar international effort was made when the Tishrin Dam was constructed, which led, among others, to the flooding of the important Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site of Jerf el Ahmar. An archaeological survey and rescue excavations were also carried out in the area flooded by Lake Qadisiya in Iraq. Parts of the flooded area have recently become accessible again due to the drying up of the lake, resulting not only in new possibilities for archaeologists to do more research, but also providing opportunities for looting, which has been rampant elsewhere in Iraq in the wake of the 2003 invasion.

== Religion ==
=== Islam ===
In Islamic tradition, a hadith of Prophet Muhammad states that the Last Hour will not occur until the Euphrates River uncovers a mountain of gold, over which people will fight. Ninety-nine out of every one hundred individuals engaged in this conflict will perish, with each person hoping to be the one who secures the treasure. The hadith also advises that whoever finds this gold should refrain from taking any of it. This event is considered one of the minor signs of the approaching Day of Judgment.

=== Christianity ===
In the Christian Bible, the Euphrates River is mentioned in Revelation 16:12, in the final book of the New Testament. Author, John of Patmos writes about the Euphrates river drying up as part of a series of events that foretell the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

The river Phrath mentioned in Genesis 2:14 is also identified as the Euphrates.

== History ==

=== Palaeolithic to Chalcolithic periods ===
The early occupation of the Euphrates basin was limited to its upper reaches; that is, the area that is popularly known as the Fertile Crescent. Acheulean stone artifacts have been found in the Sajur basin and in the El Kowm oasis in the central Syrian steppe; the latter together with remains of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; that were dated to 450,000 years old. In the Taurus Mountains and the upper part of the Syrian Euphrates valley, early permanent villages such as Abu Hureyra – at first occupied by hunter-gatherers but later by some of the earliest farmers, Jerf el Ahmar, Mureybet and Nevalı Çori became established from the eleventh millennium BCE onward. In the absence of irrigation, these early farming communities were limited to areas where rainfed agriculture was possible, that is, the upper parts of the Syrian Euphrates as well as Turkey. Late Neolithic villages, characterized by the introduction of pottery in the early 7th millennium BCE, are known throughout this area. Occupation of lower Mesopotamia started in the 6th millennium and is generally associated with the introduction of irrigation, as rainfall in this area is insufficient for dry agriculture. Evidence for irrigation has been found at several sites dating to this period, including Tell es-Sawwan. During the 5th millennium BCE, or late Ubaid period, northeastern Syria was dotted by small villages, although some of them grew to a size of over . In Iraq, sites like Eridu and Ur were already occupied during the Ubaid period. Clay boat models found at Tell Mashnaqa along the Khabur indicate that riverine transport was already practiced during this period. The Uruk period, roughly coinciding with the 4th millennium BCE, saw the emergence of truly urban settlements across Mesopotamia. Cities like Tell Brak and Uruk grew to over in size and displayed monumental architecture. The spread of southern Mesopotamian pottery, architecture and sealings far into Turkey and Iran has generally been interpreted as the material reflection of a widespread trade system aimed at providing the Mesopotamian cities with raw materials. Habuba Kabira on the Syrian Euphrates is a prominent example of a settlement that is interpreted as an Uruk colony.

=== Ancient history ===

During the Jemdet Nasr (3600–3100 BCE) and Early Dynastic periods (3100–2350 BCE), southern Mesopotamia experienced a growth in the number and size of settlements, suggesting strong population growth. These settlements, including Sumero-Akkadian sites like Sippar, Uruk, Adab and Kish, were organized in competing city-states. Many of these cities were located along canals of the Euphrates and the Tigris that have since dried up, but that can still be identified from remote sensing imagery. A similar development took place in Upper Mesopotamia, Subartu and Assyria, although only from the mid 3rd millennium and on a smaller scale than in Lower Mesopotamia. Sites like Ebla, Mari and Tell Leilan grew to prominence for the first time during this period.

Large parts of the Euphrates basin were for the first time united under a single ruler during the Akkadian Empire (2335–2154 BC) and Ur III empires, which controlled – either directly or indirectly through vassals – large parts of modern-day Iraq and northeastern Syria. Following their collapse, the Old Assyrian Empire (1975–1750 BCE) and Mari asserted their power over northeast Syria and northern Mesopotamia, while southern Mesopotamia was controlled by city-states like Isin, Kish and Larsa before their territories were absorbed by the newly emerged state of Babylonia under Hammurabi in the early to mid 18th century BCE.

In the second half of the 2nd millennium BCE, the Euphrates basin was divided between Kassite Babylon in the south and Mitanni, Assyria and the Hittite Empire in the north, with the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1020 BC) eventually eclipsing the Hittites, Mitanni and Kassite Babylonians. Following the end of the Middle Assyrian Empire in the late 11th century BCE, struggles broke out between Babylonia and Assyria over the control of the Iraqi Euphrates basin. The Neo-Assyrian Empire (935–605 BC) eventually emerged victorious out of this conflict and also succeeded in gaining control of the northern Euphrates basin in the first half of the 1st millennium BCE.

In the centuries to come, control of the wider Euphrates basin shifted from the Neo-Assyrian Empire (which collapsed between 612 and 599 BC) to the short lived Median Empire (612–546 BC) and equally brief Neo-Babylonian Empire (612–539 BC) in the last years of the 7th century BC, and eventually to the Achaemenid Empire (539–333 BC). The Achaemenid Empire was in turn overrun by Alexander the Great, who defeated the last king Darius III and died in Babylon in 323 BCE.

Subsequent to this, the region came under the control of the Seleucid Empire (312–150 BC), Parthian Empire (150–226 AD) (during which several Neo-Assyrian states such as Adiabene came to rule certain regions of the Euphrates), and was fought over by the Roman Empire, its succeeding Byzantine Empire and the Sassanid Empire (226–638 AD), until the Islamic conquest of the mid 7th century AD. The Battle of Karbala took place near the banks of this river in 680 AD.

In the north, the river served as a border between Greater Armenia (331 BC–428 AD) and Lesser Armenia (the latter became a Roman province in the 1st century BC).

=== Modern era ===
After World War I, the borders in Southwest Asia were redrawn in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), when the Ottoman Empire was partitioned. Clause 109 of the treaty stipulated that the three riparian states of the Euphrates (at that time Turkey, France for its Syrian mandate and the United Kingdom for its mandate of Iraq) had to reach a mutual agreement on the use of its water and on the construction of any hydraulic installation. An agreement between Turkey and Iraq signed in 1946 required Turkey to report to Iraq on any hydraulic changes it made on the Tigris–Euphrates river system, and allowed Iraq to construct dams on Turkish territory to manage the flow of the Euphrates.
The river featured on the coat of arms of Iraq from 1932 to 1959.
Turkey and Syria completed their first dams on the Euphrates – the Keban Dam and the Tabqa Dam, respectively – within one year of each other and filling of the reservoirs commenced in 1975. At the same time, the area was hit by severe drought and river flow toward Iraq was reduced from in 1973 to in 1975. This led to an international crisis during which Iraq threatened to bomb the Tabqa Dam. An agreement was eventually reached between Syria and Iraq after intervention by Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union. A similar crisis, although not escalating to the point of military threats, occurred in 1981 when the Keban Dam reservoir had to be refilled after it had been almost emptied to temporarily increase Turkey&#x27;s hydroelectricity production. In 1984, Turkey unilaterally declared that it would ensure a flow of at least per second, or per year, into Syria, and in 1987 a bilateral treaty to that effect was signed between the two countries. Another bilateral agreement from 1989 between Syria and Iraq settles the amount of water flowing into Iraq at 60 percent of the amount that Syria receives from Turkey. In 2008, Turkey, Syria and Iraq instigated the Joint Trilateral Committee (JTC) on the management of the water in the Tigris–Euphrates basin and on 3 September 2009 a further agreement was signed to this effect.
On 15 April 2014, Turkey began to reduce the flow of the Euphrates into Syria and Iraq. The flow was cut off completely on 16 May 2014 resulting in the Euphrates terminating at the Turkish–Syrian border. This was in violation of an agreement reached in 1987 in which Turkey committed to releasing a minimum of of water per second at the Turkish–Syrian border.

During the Syrian civil war and the Iraqi Civil War, much of the Euphrates was controlled by the Islamic State from 2014 until 2017, when the terrorist group began losing land and was eventually defeated territorially in Syria at the Battle of Baghouz and in Iraq in the Western Iraq offensive respectively.

== Economy ==

Throughout history, the Euphrates has been of vital importance to those living along its course. With the construction of large hydropower stations, irrigation schemes, and pipelines capable of transporting water over large distances, many more people now depend on the river for basic amenities such as electricity and drinking water than in the past. Syria&#x27;s Lake Assad is the most important source of drinking water for the city of Aleppo, to the west of the river valley. The lake also supports a modest state-operated fishing industry. Through a newly restored power line, the Haditha Dam in Iraq provides electricity to Baghdad.

<text>Estonian ( ) is a Finnic language of the Uralic family and the official language of Estonia. It is written in the Latin script and is the first language of the majority of the country&#x27;s population; it is also an official language of the European Union. Estonian is spoken natively by about 1.1 million people: 922,000 people in Estonia and 160,000 elsewhere.

==Classification==
Estonian belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family. Other Finnic languages include Finnish and some minority languages spoken around the Baltic Sea and in northwestern Russia. Estonian is typically subclassified as a Southern Finnic language, and it is the second-most-spoken language among all the Finnic languages. Alongside Finnish, Hungarian and Maltese, Estonian is one of the four official languages of the European Union that are not Indo-European languages. 

In terms of linguistic morphology, Estonian is a predominantly agglutinative language. The loss of word-final sounds is extensive, and this has made its inflectional morphology markedly more fusional, especially with respect to noun and adjective inflection. The transitional form from an agglutinating to a fusional language is a common feature of Estonian typologically over the course of history with the development of a rich morphological system.

Word order is considerably more flexible than in English, but the basic order is subject–verb–object.

==History==
The speakers of the two major historical languages spoken in Estonia, North and South Estonian, are thought by some linguists to have arrived in Estonia in at least two different migration waves over two millennia ago, both groups having spoken considerably different vernacular; South Estonian might be a Finnic language rather than a variety of Estonian. Modern standard Estonian evolved in the 18th and 19th centuries based on the dialects of northern Estonia.

During the Medieval and Early Modern periods, Estonian accepted many loanwords from Germanic languages, mainly from Middle Low German (Middle Saxon) and, after the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, from the Standard German language. 


Estonia&#x27;s oldest written records of the Finnic languages date from the 13th century. The &quot;Originates Livoniae&quot; in the &quot;Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot; contains Estonian place names, words and fragments of sentences.

===Estonian literature===

The earliest extant samples of connected (north) Estonian are the so-called Kullamaa prayers dating from 1524 and 1528. In 1525 the first book published in Estonian was printed. The book was a Lutheran manuscript, which never reached the reader and was destroyed immediately after publication.

The first extant Estonian book is a bilingual German-Estonian translation of the Lutheran catechism by S.Wanradt and J.Koell dating to 1535, during the Protestant Reformation period. An Estonian grammar book to be used by priests was printed in German in 1637. The New Testament was translated into the variety of South Estonian called Võro in 1686 (northern Estonian, 1715). The two languages were united based on Northern Estonian by Anton thor Helle.

Writings in Estonian became more significant in the 19th century during the Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750–1840).

The birth of native Estonian literature was during the period 1810–1820, when the patriotic and philosophical poems by Kristjan Jaak Peterson were published. Peterson, who was the first student to acknowledge his Estonian origin at the then German-language University of Dorpat, is commonly regarded as a herald of Estonian national literature and considered the founder of modern Estonian poetry. His birthday, March 14, is celebrated in Estonia as Mother Tongue Day. A fragment from Peterson&#x27;s poem &quot;Kuu&quot; expresses the claim reestablishing the birthright of the Estonian language:

:&quot;Kas siis selle maa keel&quot;
:&quot;Laulutuules ei või&quot;
:&quot;Taevani tõustes üles&quot;
:&quot;Igavikku omale otsida?&quot;

In English:
:&quot;Can the language of this land&quot;
:&quot;In the wind of incantation&quot;
:&quot;Rising up to the heavens&quot;
:&quot;Not seek for eternity?&quot;
:::&quot;Kristjan Jaak Peterson&quot;
In the period from 1525 to 1917, 14,503 titles were published in Estonian; by comparison, between 1918 and 1940, 23,868 titles were published.

In modern times A. H. Tammsaare, Jaan Kross, and Andrus Kivirähk are Estonia&#x27;s best-known and most translated writers.

Estonians lead the world in book ownership, owning on average 218 books per house, and 35% of Estonians owning 350 books or more (as of 2018). 

===Official language===
Writings in Estonian became significant only in the 19th century with the spread of the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, during the Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750–1840). Although Baltic Germans at large regarded the future of Estonians as being a fusion with themselves, the Estophile educated class admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13th century.

When the Republic of Estonia was established in 1918, Estonian became the official language of the newly independent country. Immediately after World War II, in 1945, over 97% of the then population of Estonia self-identified as native ethnic Estonians and spoke the language.

When Estonia was invaded and reoccupied by the Soviet army in 1944, the status of Estonian effectively changed to one of the two official languages (Russian being the other one). Many immigrants from Russia entered Estonia under Soviet encouragement. In the 1970s, the pressure of bilingualism for Estonians was intensified. Although teaching Estonian to non-Estonians in local schools was formally compulsory, in practice, the teaching and learning of Estonian by Russian-speakers was often considered unnecessary by the Soviet authorities.
In 1991, with the restoration of Estonia&#x27;s independence, Estonian went back to being the only official language in Estonia. Since 2004, when Estonia joined the European Union, Estonian is also one of the (now 24) official languages of the EU.

The return of former Soviet immigrants to their countries of origin at the end of the 20th century has brought the proportion of native Estonian-speakers in Estonia now back above 70%. Large parts of the first- and second-generation immigrants in Estonia have now adopted Estonian (over 50% as of the 2022 census).

== Dialects ==


The Estonian dialects are divided into two groups – the northern and southern dialects, historically associated with the cities of Tallinn in the north and Tartu in the south, in addition to a distinct &quot;kirderanniku&quot; dialect, Northeastern coastal Estonian.

The northern group consists of the or central dialect that is also the basis for the standard language, the or western dialect, roughly corresponding to Lääne County and Pärnu County, the (islands&#x27; dialect) of Saaremaa, Hiiumaa, Muhu and Kihnu, and the or eastern dialect on the northwestern shore of Lake Peipus.

One of the pronunciation features of the Saaremaa dialect is the lack of the &#x27;õ&#x27; vowel. A five-metre monument erected in 2020, marking the &quot;border&quot; between the vowels &#x27;õ&#x27; and &#x27;ö&#x27;, humorously makes reference to this fact.

South Estonian consists of the Tartu, Mulgi, Võro and Seto varieties. These are sometimes considered either variants of South Estonian or separate languages altogether. Also, Seto and Võro distinguish themselves from each other less by language and more by their culture and their respective Christian confession.

==Writing system==
===Alphabet===
Estonian employs the Latin script as the basis for its alphabet. The script adds the letters &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;, &quot;ü&quot;, and &quot;õ&quot;, plus the later additions &quot;š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot;. The letters &quot;c&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are limited to proper names of foreign origin, and &quot;f&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;š&quot;, and &quot;ž&quot; appear in loanwords and foreign names only. &quot;Ö&quot; and &quot;Ü&quot; are pronounced similarly to their equivalents in Swedish and German. Unlike in standard German but like Swedish (when followed by &#x27;r&#x27;) and Finnish, &quot;Ä&quot; is pronounced [æ], as in English &quot;mat&quot;. The vowels Ä, Ö and Ü are clearly separate phonemes and inherent in Estonian, although the letter shapes come from German. The letter &quot;õ&quot; denotes , unrounded , or a close-mid back unrounded vowel. It is almost identical to the Bulgarian ъ and the Vietnamese ơ, and is also used to transcribe the Russian ы.
Additionally &quot;C&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot; are used in writing foreign proper names. They do not occur in Estonian words, and are not officially part of the alphabet. Including all the foreign letters, the alphabet consists of the following 32 letters:

===Orthography===
Although the Estonian orthography is generally guided by phonemic principles, with each grapheme corresponding to one phoneme, there are some historical and morphological deviations from this: for example preservation of the morpheme in declension of the word (writing b, g, d in places where p, k, t is pronounced) and in the use of &#x27;i&#x27; and &#x27;j&#x27;. Where it is very impractical or impossible to type &quot;š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot;, they are replaced by &quot;sh&quot; and &quot;zh&quot; in some written texts, although this is considered incorrect. Otherwise, the &quot;h&quot; in &quot;sh&quot; represents a voiceless glottal fricative, as in &quot;Pasha&quot; (&quot;pas-ha&quot;); this also applies to some foreign names.

Modern Estonian orthography is based on the &quot;Newer orthography&quot; created by Eduard Ahrens in the second half of the 19thcentury based on Finnish orthography. The &quot;Older orthography&quot; it replaced was created in the 17thcentury by Bengt Gottfried Forselius and Johann Hornung based on standard German orthography. Earlier writing in Estonian had, by and large, used an &quot;ad hoc&quot; orthography based on Latin and Middle Low German orthography. Some influences of the standard German orthography – for example, writing &#x27;W&#x27;/&#x27;w&#x27; instead of &#x27;V&#x27;/&#x27;v&#x27; – persisted well into the 1930s.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
There are 9 vowels and 36 diphthongs, 28 of which are native to Estonian.[1] All nine vowels can appear as the first component of a diphthong, but only /ɑ e i o u/ occur as the second component. A vowel characteristic of Estonian is the unrounded back vowel /ɤ/, which may be close-mid back, close back, or close-mid central.
===Consonants===
Word-initial &quot;b, d, g&quot; occur only in loanwords and some old loanwords are spelled with &quot;p, t, k&quot; instead of etymological &quot;b, d, g&quot;: &quot;pank&quot; &#x27;bank&#x27;. Word-medially and word-finally, &quot;b, d, g&quot; represent short plosives /p, t, k/ (may be pronounced as partially voiced consonants), &quot;p, t, k&quot; represent half-long plosives /pː, tː, kː/, and &quot;pp, tt, kk&quot; represent overlong plosives /pːː, tːː, kːː/; for example: &quot;kabi&quot; /kɑpi/ &#x27;hoof&#x27; — &quot;kapi&quot; /kɑpːi/ &#x27;wardrobe [gen sg] — &quot;kappi&quot; /kɑpːːi/ &#x27;wardrobe [ptv sg]&#x27;.

Before and after &quot;b, p, d, t, g, k, s, h, f, š, z, ž&quot;, the sounds [p], [t], [k] are written as &quot;p, t, k&quot;, with some exceptions due to morphology or etymology.

Representation of palatalised consonants is inconsistent, and they are not always indicated.

ŋ is an allophone of /n/ before /k/.

While peripheral Estonian dialects are characterized by various degrees of vowel harmony, central dialects have almost completely lost the feature. Since the standard language is based on central dialects, it has no vowel harmony either. In the standard language, the front vowels occur exclusively on the first or stressed syllable, although vowel harmony is still apparent in older texts.

==Grammar==

Typologically, Estonian represents a transitional form from an agglutinating language to a fusional language. The canonical word order is SVO (subject–verb–object), although often debated among linguists.

In Estonian, nouns and pronouns do not have grammatical gender, but nouns and adjectives decline in fourteen cases: nominative, genitive, partitive, illative, inessive, elative, allative, adessive, ablative, translative, terminative, essive, abessive, and comitative, with the case and number of the adjective always agreeing with that of the noun (except in the terminative, essive, abessive and comitative, where there is agreement only for the number, the adjective being in the genitive form). Thus the illative for &quot;kollane maja&quot; (&quot;a yellow house&quot;) is &quot;kollasesse majja&quot; (&quot;into a yellow house&quot;), but the terminative is &quot;kollase majani&quot; (&quot;as far as a yellow house&quot;). With respect to the Proto-Finnic language, elision has occurred; thus, the actual case marker may be absent, but the stem is changed, cf. &quot;maja – majja&quot; and the Ostrobothnia dialect of Finnish &quot;maja – majahan&quot;.

The verbal system has no distinct future tense (the present tense serves here) and features special forms to express an action performed by an undetermined subject (the &quot;impersonal&quot;).

==Vocabulary==

Although Estonian and the Germanic languages have very different origins and the vocabulary is considered quite different from that of the Indo-European family, one can identify many similar words in Estonian and English, for example. This is primarily because Estonian has borrowed nearly one-third of its vocabulary from Germanic languages, mainly from Low Saxon (Middle Low German) during the period of German rule, and High German (including standard German). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22–25 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent. Prior to the wave of new loanwords from English in the 20th and 21st centuries, historically, Swedish and Russian were also sources of borrowings but to a much lesser extent. In borrowings, often &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;p&#x27; are interchangeable, for example &#x27;baggage&#x27; becomes &#x27;pagas&#x27;, &#x27;lob&#x27; (to throw) becomes &#x27;loopima&#x27;. The initial letter &#x27;s&#x27; before another consonant is often dropped, for example &#x27;skool&#x27; becomes &#x27;kool&#x27;, &#x27;stool&#x27; becomes &#x27;tool&#x27;.

===&quot;Ex nihilo&quot; lexical enrichment===
Estonian language planners such as Ado Grenzstein (a journalist active in Estonia from the 1870s to the 1890s) tried to use formation &quot;ex nihilo&quot; (&quot;Urschöpfung&quot;); i.e. they created new words out of nothing.

The most well-known reformer of Estonian, Johannes Aavik (1880–1973), used creations &quot;ex nihilo&quot; (cf. &#x27;free constructions&#x27;, Tauli 1977), along with other sources of lexical enrichment such as derivations, compositions and loanwords (often from Finnish; cf. Saareste and Raun 1965: 76). In Aavik&#x27;s dictionary (1921) lists approximately 4000 words. About 40 of the 200 words created by Johannes Aavik allegedly &quot;ex nihilo&quot; are in common use today. Examples are * &quot;ese&quot; &#x27;object&#x27;, * &quot;kolp&quot; &#x27;skull&#x27;, * &quot;liibuma&quot; &#x27;to cling&#x27;, * &quot;naasma&quot; &#x27;to return, come back&#x27;, * &quot;nõme&quot; &#x27;stupid, dull&#x27;. 

Many of the coinages that have been considered (often by Aavik himself) as words concocted &quot;ex nihilo&quot; could well have been influenced by foreign lexical items; for example, words from Russian, German, French, Finnish, English and Swedish. Aavik had a broad classical education and knew Ancient Greek, Latin and French. Consider &quot;roim&quot; &#x27;crime&#x27; versus English &quot;crime&quot; or &quot;taunima&quot; &#x27;to condemn, disapprove&#x27; versus Finnish &quot;tuomita&quot; &#x27;to condemn, to judge&#x27; (these Aavikisms appear in Aavik&#x27;s 1921 dictionary). These words might be better regarded as a peculiar manifestation of morpho-phonemic adaptation of a foreign lexical item.

== Example text ==
Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Estonian and English:

:&quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

<text>E-Prime (short for English-Prime or English Prime, sometimes É or E′) denotes a restricted form of English in which authors avoid all forms of the verb &quot;to be&quot;.

E-Prime excludes forms such as &quot;be&quot;, &quot;being&quot;, &quot;been&quot;, present tense forms (&quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;are&quot;), past tense forms (&quot;was&quot;, &quot;were&quot;) along with their negative contractions (&quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;wasn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;weren&#x27;t&quot;), and nonstandard contractions such as &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;&#x27;twas&quot;. E-Prime also excludes contractions such as &quot;I&#x27;m&quot;, &quot;we&#x27;re&quot;, &quot;you&#x27;re&quot;, &quot;he&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;she&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;they&#x27;re&quot;, &quot;there&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;here&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;where&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;when&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;why&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;how&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;who&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;what&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;that&#x27;s&quot;.

Some scholars claim that E-Prime can clarify thinking and strengthen writing, while others doubt its utility.

==History==
D. David Bourland Jr., who had studied under Alfred Korzybski, devised E-Prime as an addition to Korzybski&#x27;s general semantics in the late 1940s. Bourland published the concept in a 1965 essay entitled &quot;A Linguistic Note: Writing in E-Prime&quot; (originally published in &quot;General Semantics Bulletin&quot;). The essay quickly generated controversy within the general semantics field, partly because practitioners of general semantics sometimes saw Bourland as attacking the verb ″&quot;to be&quot;″ as such, and not just certain usages.

Bourland collected and published three volumes of essays in support of his innovation. The first (1991), co-edited by Paul Dennithorne Johnston, bore the title: &quot;To Be or Not: An E-Prime Anthology&quot;. For the second, &quot;More E-Prime: To Be or Not II&quot;, published in 1994, he added a third editor, Jeremy Klein. Bourland and Johnston then edited a third book, &quot;E-Prime III: a third anthology&quot;, published in 1997.

==Functions of &quot;to be&quot;==
In English, the verb &#x27;to be&#x27; (also known as the &quot;copula&quot;) has several distinct functions:

* identity: &quot;noun-phrase copula definite-noun&quot;
** &quot;The cat is my only pet.&quot;
* class membership: &quot;definite-noun copula noun-phrase&quot;
** &quot;Garfield is a cat.&quot;
* class inclusion: &quot;noun-phrase copula noun-phrase&quot;
** &quot;A cat is an animal.&quot;
* predication: &quot;noun-phrase copula adjective&quot;
** &quot;The cat is furry.&quot;
* ownership: &quot;noun-phrase copula possessive-noun&quot;
** &quot;The cat is theirs.&quot;
* auxiliary: &quot;noun-phrase copula verb-phrase&quot;
** &quot;The cat is sleeping.&quot; with the copula being part of the progressive aspect with the present participle
** &quot;The cat is being bitten by the dog.&quot; with the copula being part of the passive with the past participle of a transitive verb
* existence: &quot;medial-proadverb-of-location copula noun-phrase&quot;
** &quot;There is a cat.&quot;
* location: &quot;noun-phrase copula location-phrase&quot;
** &quot;The cat is nowhere to be found.&quot;

Bourland sees specifically the &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;predication&quot; functions as pernicious but advocates the exclusion of all forms for the sake of simplicity. In the case of the &quot;existence&quot; form or the &quot;location&quot; form, terms such as &quot;exist&quot;, &quot;sit&quot; or &quot;lie&quot; could substitute for the copula.

Some ergative verbs may substitute the copula, including &quot;taste&quot;, &quot;feel&quot;, &quot;smell&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;, &quot;grow&quot;, &quot;hinge&quot;, &quot;remain&quot;, &quot;rest&quot;, &quot;stay&quot;, &quot;reside&quot;, and &quot;turn&quot;, among others.

==Examples==
One could rewrite the functions of &quot;to be&quot; as follows:

* &quot;The cat is my only pet&quot;: &quot;I have only a pet cat&quot;.
* &quot;The cat is Garfield&quot;: &quot;I call my cat Garfield&quot;.
* &quot;Garfield is a cat&quot;: &quot;Garfield belongs to the cat species&quot;.
* &quot;A cat is an animal&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Cat&#x27; denotes an animal&quot;.
* &quot;The cat is furry&quot;: &quot;The cat feels furry&quot; / &quot;The cat looks furry&quot; / &quot;The cat has fur&quot;.
* &quot;The cat is sleeping&quot;: &quot;The cat currently lies asleep&quot;.
* &quot;The dog is chasing the cat&quot;: &quot;At present, the dog chases the cat&quot;.
* &quot;There is a cat&quot;: &quot;A cat exists&quot;.
* &quot;The cat is on the mat&quot;: &quot;The cat currently sits on the mat&quot;.
* &quot;The cat is here&quot;: anything context-specific: &quot;I see/hear/smell/sense/suspect (the presence of) the cat here&quot;

==Rationale==
Bourland and other advocates also suggest that use of E-Prime leads to a less dogmatic style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict.

Kellogg and Bourland describe misuse of the verb &quot;to be&quot; as creating a &quot;deity mode of speech&quot;, allowing &quot;even the most ignorant to transform their opinions magically into god-like pronouncements on the nature of things&quot;.

==Psychological effects==

While teaching at the University of Florida, Alfred Korzybski counseled his students to
eliminate the infinitive and verb forms of &quot;to be&quot; from their vocabulary, whereas a second group continued to use &quot;I am,&quot; &quot;You are,&quot; &quot;They are&quot; statements as usual. For example, instead of saying, &quot;I am depressed,&quot; a student was asked to eliminate that emotionally primed verb and to say something else, such as, &quot;I feel depressed when ...&quot; or &quot;I tend to make myself depressed about ...&quot;

Korzybski observed improvement &quot;of one full letter grade&quot; by &quot;students who did not generalize by using that infinitive&quot;.

Albert Ellis advocated the use of E-Prime when discussing psychological distress to encourage framing these experiences as temporary (see also Solution focused brief therapy) and to encourage a sense of agency by specifying the subject of statements. According to Ellis, rational emotive behavior therapy &quot;has favored E-Prime more than any other form of psychotherapy and I think it is still the only form of therapy that has some of its main books written in E-Prime&quot;. However, Ellis did not always use E-Prime because he believed it interferes with readability.

==Criticisms==
Many authors have questioned E-Prime&#x27;s effectiveness at improving readability and reducing prejudice (Lakoff, 1992; Murphy, 1992; Parkinson, 1992; Kenyon, 1992; French, 1992, 1993; Lohrey, 1993). These authors observed that communication under the copula ban can remain obscure and imply prejudice, while losing important speech patterns, such as identities and identification. Further, prejudices and judgments may become more difficult to notice or refute.

Various arguments against E-Prime (in the context of general semantics) have been conjectured:

* &quot;Effective writing techniques&quot; are not relevant to general semantics as a discipline, and therefore it should not be promoted as general semantics practice. E-Prime does not distinguish statements that disobey the principles of general semantics from statements that do not. It lacks consistency with the other tenets of general semantics and should not be included into the discipline.
* The advocates of E-Prime have not proven that it is easier to exclude the verb &quot;to be&quot; than to eliminate only the &quot;is&quot; of identity and the &quot;is&quot; of predication. It may well be easier to do the latter for many people. &quot;To be&quot; statements convey not only identity but also asymmetrical relations (&quot;X heights more than Y&quot;); negation (&quot;A differs from B&quot;); location (&quot;Another castle contains the princess&quot;); auxiliary (&quot;He goes to the store&quot;) etc., forms that would also have to be excluded.
* The elimination of a whole class of sentences results in fewer alternatives and is likely to make writing less, rather than more, interesting. One can improve bad writing more by reducing use of the verb &#x27;to be&#x27; than by excluding it.
* The context often ameliorates the possible harmful effects from the use of the &quot;is&quot; of identity and the &quot;is&quot; of predication, so it is not necessary to eliminate all such sentences. For example, &quot;He is a judge&quot; in response to a question about what someone does for a living would not be questionable, although &quot;He works as a judge&quot; would be an equivalent E-Prime sentence.
* Excluding &quot;to be&quot; has little effect on eliminating identity. For example, a statement of apparently equal identification, &quot;The silly ban on copula continues,&quot; can be made without the copula assuming an identity rather than asserting it, consequently hampering our awareness of it.
* Identity-in-the-language is not the same as the far more important identity-in-reaction (identification). General semantics cuts the link between the two through the practice of silence on the objective levels, adopting a self-reflexive attitude, e.g., &quot;as I see it&quot; &quot;it seems to me&quot; etc., and by the use of quotation marks—without using E-Prime. One of the best languages for time-binding is mathematics, which relies heavily on the notion of equivalence and equality. For the purposes of time-binding, it may be better to cut the link between identity-in-the-language and identity-in-reaction.

According to an article (written in E-Prime and advocating a role for E-Prime in ESL and EFL programs) published by the Office of English Language Programs of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in the State Department of the United States, &quot;Requiring students to avoid the verb to be on every assignment would deter students from developing other fundamental skills of fluent writing.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, an elliptic curve is a smooth, projective, algebraic curve of genus one, on which there is a specified point . An elliptic curve is defined over a field and describes points in , the Cartesian product of with itself. If the field&#x27;s characteristic is different from 2 and 3, then the curve can be described as a plane algebraic curve which consists of solutions for:

:formula_1

for some coefficients and in . The curve is required to be non-singular, which means that the curve has no cusps or self-intersections. (This is equivalent to the condition , that is, being square-free in .) It is always understood that the curve is really sitting in the projective plane, with the point being the unique point at infinity. Many sources define an elliptic curve to be simply a curve given by an equation of this form. (When the coefficient field has characteristic 2 or 3, the above equation is not quite general enough to include all non-singular cubic curves; see below.)

An elliptic curve is an abelian variety – that is, it has a group law defined algebraically, with respect to which it is an abelian group – and serves as the identity element.

If , where is any polynomial of degree three in with no repeated roots, the solution set is a nonsingular plane curve of genus one, an elliptic curve. If has degree four and is square-free this equation again describes a plane curve of genus one; however, it has no natural choice of identity element. More generally, any algebraic curve of genus one, for example the intersection of two quadric surfaces embedded in three-dimensional projective space, is called an elliptic curve, provided that it is equipped with a marked point to act as the identity.

Using the theory of elliptic functions, it can be shown that elliptic curves defined over the complex numbers correspond to embeddings of the torus into the complex projective plane. The torus is also an abelian group, and this correspondence is also a group isomorphism.

Elliptic curves are especially important in number theory, and constitute a major area of current research; for example, they were used in Andrew Wiles&#x27;s proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. They also find applications in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and integer factorization.

An elliptic curve is &quot;not&quot; an ellipse in the sense of a projective conic, which has genus zero: see elliptic integral for the origin of the term. However, there is a natural representation of real elliptic curves with shape invariant as ellipses in the hyperbolic plane formula_2. Specifically, the intersections of the Minkowski hyperboloid with quadric surfaces characterized by a certain constant-angle property produce the Steiner ellipses in formula_2 (generated by orientation-preserving collineations). Further, the orthogonal trajectories of these ellipses comprise the elliptic curves with , and any ellipse in formula_2 described as a locus relative to two foci is uniquely the elliptic curve sum of two Steiner ellipses, obtained by adding the pairs of intersections on each orthogonal trajectory. Here, the vertex of the hyperboloid serves as the identity on each trajectory curve.

Topologically, a complex elliptic curve is a torus, while a complex ellipse is a sphere.

==Elliptic curves over the real numbers==

Although the formal definition of an elliptic curve requires some background in algebraic geometry, it is possible to describe some features of elliptic curves over the real numbers using only introductory algebra and geometry.

In this context, an elliptic curve is a plane curve defined by an equation of the form

:formula_1

after a linear change of variables ( and are real numbers). This type of equation is called a Weierstrass equation, and said to be in Weierstrass form, or Weierstrass normal form.

The definition of elliptic curve also requires that the curve be non-singular. Geometrically, this means that the graph has no cusps, self-intersections, or isolated points. Algebraically, this holds if and only if the discriminant, formula_6, is not equal to zero.

: formula_7

The discriminant is zero when formula_8.

(Although the factor −16 is irrelevant to whether or not the curve is non-singular, this definition of the discriminant is useful in a more advanced study of elliptic curves.)

The real graph of a non-singular curve has &quot;two&quot; components if its discriminant is positive, and &quot;one&quot; component if it is negative. For example, in the graphs shown in figure to the right, the discriminant in the first case is 64, and in the second case is −368. Following the convention at Conic_section#Discriminant, &quot;elliptic&quot; curves require that the discriminant is negative.

==The group law==
When working in the projective plane, the equation in homogeneous coordinates becomes :

:formula_9

This equation is not defined on the line at infinity, but we can multiply by formula_10 to get one that is :

:formula_11

This resulting equation is defined on the whole projective plane, and the curve it defines projects onto the elliptic curve of interest. To find its intersection with the line at infinity, we can just posit formula_12. This implies formula_13, which in a field means formula_14. formula_15 on the other hand can take any value, and thus all triplets formula_16 satisfy the equation. In projective geometry this set is simply the point formula_17, which is thus the unique intersection of the curve with the line at infinity.

Since the curve is smooth, hence continuous, it can be shown that this point at infinity is the identity element of a group structure whose operation is geometrically described as follows:

Since the curve is symmetric about the -axis, given any point , we can take to be the point opposite it. We then have formula_18, as formula_19 lies on the -plane, so that formula_20 is also the symmetrical of formula_19 about the origin, and thus represents the same projective point.

If and are two points on the curve, then we can uniquely describe a third point in the following way. First, draw the line that intersects and . This will generally intersect the cubic at a third point, . We then take to be , the point opposite .

This definition for addition works except in a few special cases related to the point at infinity and intersection multiplicity. The first is when one of the points is . Here, we define , making the identity of the group. If we only have one point, thus we cannot define the line between them. In this case, we use the tangent line to the curve at this point as our line. In most cases, the tangent will intersect a second point and we can take its opposite. If and are opposites of each other, we define . Lastly, If is an inflection point (a point where the concavity of the curve changes), we take to be itself and is simply the point opposite itself, i.e. itself.

Let be a field over which the curve is defined (that is, the coefficients of the defining equation or equations of the curve are in ) and denote the curve by . Then the -rational points of are the points on whose coordinates all lie in , including the point at infinity. The set of -rational points is denoted by . is a group, because properties of polynomial equations show that if is in , then is also in , and if two of , , are in , then so is the third. Additionally, if is a subfield of , then is a subgroup of .

===Algebraic interpretation===

The above groups can be described algebraically as well as geometrically. Given the curve over the field (whose characteristic we assume to be neither 2 nor 3), and points and on the curve, assume first that (case &quot;1&quot;). Let be the equation of the line that intersects and , which has the following slope:

:formula_22

The line equation and the curve equation intersect at the points , , and , so the equations have identical values at these values.

:formula_23

which is equivalent to

:formula_24

Since , , and are solutions, this equation has its roots at exactly the same values as

:formula_25

and because both equations are cubics they must be the same polynomial up to a scalar. Then equating the coefficients of in both equations

:formula_26

and solving for the unknown . 

:formula_27

 follows from the line equation

:formula_28

and this is an element of , because is.

If , then there are two options: if (case &quot;3&quot;), including the case where (case &quot;4&quot;), then the sum is defined as 0; thus, the inverse of each point on the curve is found by reflecting it across the -axis.

If , then and (case &quot;2&quot; using as ). The slope is given by the tangent to the curve at (&quot;x&quot;&quot;P&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&quot;P&quot;).
:formula_29

A more general expression for formula_30 that works in both case 1 and case 2 is

:formula_31

as formula_32, then formula_33, so formula_34.

The functional equation is

:formula_35

As we are only interested in the behaviour of formula_36, we can use a reduced zeta function

:formula_37

:formula_38

and so

:formula_39

which leads directly to the local L-functions

:formula_40

The Sato–Tate conjecture is a statement about how the error term formula_41 in Hasse&#x27;s theorem varies with the different primes &quot;q&quot;, if an elliptic curve E over Q is reduced modulo q. It was proven (for almost all such curves) in 2006 due to the results of Taylor, Harris and Shepherd-Barron, and says that the error terms are equidistributed.

Elliptic curves over finite fields are notably applied in cryptography and for the factorization of large integers. These algorithms often make use of the group structure on the points of &quot;E&quot;. Algorithms that are applicable to general groups, for example the group of invertible elements in finite fields, F*&quot;q&quot;, can thus be applied to the group of points on an elliptic curve. For example, the discrete logarithm is such an algorithm. The interest in this is that choosing an elliptic curve allows for more flexibility than choosing &quot;q&quot; (and thus the group of units in F&quot;q&quot;). Also, the group structure of elliptic curves is generally more complicated.

==Elliptic curves over a general field==
Elliptic curves can be defined over any field &quot;K&quot;; the formal definition of an elliptic curve is a non-singular projective algebraic curve over &quot;K&quot; with genus 1 and endowed with a distinguished point defined over &quot;K&quot;.

If the characteristic of &quot;K&quot; is neither 2 nor 3, then every elliptic curve over &quot;K&quot; can be written in the form
:formula_42

after a linear change of variables. Here &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are elements of &quot;K&quot; such that the right hand side polynomial &quot;x&quot;3 − &quot;px&quot; − &quot;q&quot; does not have any double roots. If the characteristic is 2 or 3, then more terms need to be kept: in characteristic 3, the most general equation is of the form
:formula_43

for arbitrary constants &quot;b&quot;2, &quot;b&quot;4, &quot;b&quot;6 such that the polynomial on the right-hand side has distinct roots (the notation is chosen for historical reasons). In characteristic 2, even this much is not possible, and the most general equation is

:formula_44

provided that the variety it defines is non-singular. If characteristic were not an obstruction, each equation would reduce to the previous ones by a suitable linear change of variables.

One typically takes the curve to be the set of all points (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) which satisfy the above equation and such that both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are elements of the algebraic closure of &quot;K&quot;. Points of the curve whose coordinates both belong to &quot;K&quot; are called &quot;K&quot;-rational points.

Many of the preceding results remain valid when the field of definition of &quot;E&quot; is a number field &quot;K&quot;, that is to say, a finite field extension of Q. In particular, the group &quot;E(K)&quot; of &quot;K&quot;-rational points of an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; defined over &quot;K&quot; is finitely generated, which generalizes the Mordell–Weil theorem above. A theorem due to Loïc Merel shows that for a given integer &quot;d&quot;, there are (up to isomorphism) only finitely many groups that can occur as the torsion groups of &quot;E&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) for an elliptic curve defined over a number field &quot;K&quot; of degree &quot;d&quot;. More precisely, there is a number &quot;B&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) such that for any elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; defined over a number field &quot;K&quot; of degree &quot;d&quot;, any torsion point of &quot;E&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) is of order less than &quot;B&quot;(&quot;d&quot;). The theorem is effective: for &quot;d&quot; &gt; 1, if a torsion point is of order &quot;p&quot;, with &quot;p&quot; prime, then
:formula_45

As for the integral points, Siegel&#x27;s theorem generalizes to the following: Let &quot;E&quot; be an elliptic curve defined over a number field &quot;K&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; the Weierstrass coordinates. Then there are only finitely many points of &quot;E(K)&quot; whose &quot;x&quot;-coordinate is in the ring of integers &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot;.

The properties of the Hasse–Weil zeta function and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture can also be extended to this more general situation.

==Elliptic curves over the complex numbers==
The formulation of elliptic curves as the embedding of a torus in the complex projective plane follows naturally from a curious property of Weierstrass&#x27;s elliptic functions. These functions and their first derivative are related by the formula

:formula_46

Here, and are constants; is the Weierstrass elliptic function and its derivative. It should be clear that this relation is in the form of an elliptic curve (over the complex numbers). The Weierstrass functions are doubly periodic; that is, they are periodic with respect to a lattice ; in essence, the Weierstrass functions are naturally defined on a torus . This torus may be embedded in the complex projective plane by means of the map

:formula_47

This map is a group isomorphism of the torus (considered with its natural group structure) with the chord-and-tangent group law on the cubic curve which is the image of this map. It is also an isomorphism of Riemann surfaces from the torus to the cubic curve, so topologically, an elliptic curve is a torus. If the lattice is related by multiplication by a non-zero complex number to a lattice , then the corresponding curves are isomorphic. Isomorphism classes of elliptic curves are specified by the -invariant.

The isomorphism classes can be understood in a simpler way as well. The constants and , called the modular invariants, are uniquely determined by the lattice, that is, by the structure of the torus. However, all real polynomials factorize completely into linear factors over the complex numbers, since the field of complex numbers is the algebraic closure of the reals. So, the elliptic curve may be written as

:formula_48

One finds that
:formula_49

and

:formula_50 given by formula_51 where formula_19 is the neutral point of formula_53 and formula_54 given by formula_55

To see that formula_56, note that the original isogeny formula_57 can be written as a composite

:formula_58

and that since formula_57 is of degree formula_60, formula_61 is multiplication by formula_60 on formula_63

Alternatively, we can use the smaller Picard group formula_64, a quotient of formula_65 The map formula_66 descends to an isomorphism, formula_67 The dual isogeny is

:formula_68

Note that the relation formula_56 also implies the conjugate relation formula_70 Indeed, let formula_71 Then formula_72 But formula_73 is surjective, so we must have formula_74

==Algorithms that use elliptic curves==
Elliptic curves over finite fields are used in some cryptographic applications as well as for integer factorization. Typically, the general idea in these applications is that a known algorithm which makes use of certain finite groups is rewritten to use the groups of rational points of elliptic curves.

<text>Equidae (commonly known as the horse family) is the taxonomic family of horses and related animals, including the extant horses, asses, and zebras, and many other species known only from fossils. The family evolved more than 50 million years ago, in the Eocene epoch, from a small, multi-toed ungulate into larger, single-toed animals. All extant species are in the genus &quot;Equus&quot;, which originated in North America. Equidae belongs to the order Perissodactyla, which includes the extant tapirs and rhinoceros, and several extinct families. It is more specifically grouped within the superfamily Equoidea, the only other family being the extinct Palaeotheriidae.

The term equid refers to any member of this family, including any equine.

==Evolution==


The oldest known fossils assigned to Equidae were found in North America, and date from the early Eocene epoch, 54 million years ago. They were once assigned to the genus &quot;Hyracotherium&quot;, but the type species of that genus is now regarded as a palaeothere. The other species have been split off into different genera. These early equids were fox-sized animals with three toes on the hind feet, and four on the front feet. They were herbivorous browsers on relatively soft plants, and already adapted for running. The complexity of their brains suggest that they already were alert and intelligent animals. Later species reduced the number of toes, and developed teeth more suited for grinding up grasses and other tough plant food.

The equids, like other perissodactyls, are hindgut fermenters. They have evolved specialized teeth that cut and shear tough plant matter to accommodate their fibrous diet. Their seemingly inefficient digestion strategy is a result of their size at the time of its evolution, as they would have already had to be relatively large mammals to be supported on such a strategy.

The family became relatively diverse during the Miocene epoch, with many new species appearing. By this time, equids were more truly horse like, having developed the typical body shape of the modern animals. Many of these species bore the main weight of their bodies on their central third toe, with the others becoming reduced and barely touching the ground, if at all. The sole surviving genus, &quot;Equus&quot;, had evolved by the early Pleistocene epoch, and spread rapidly through the world.

<doc id="10235" wikidata="Q580318" url="?curid=10235" title="ELIZA">
<text>ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program developed from 1964 to 1967 at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum. Created to explore communication between humans and machines, ELIZA simulated conversation by using a pattern matching and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program, but had no representation that could be considered really understanding what was being said by either party. Whereas the ELIZA program itself was written (originally) in MAD-SLIP, the pattern matching directives that contained most of its language capability were provided in separate &quot;scripts&quot;, represented in a lisp-like representation. The most famous script, DOCTOR, simulated a psychotherapist of the Rogerian school (in which the therapist often reflects back the patient&#x27;s words to the patient), and used rules, dictated in the script, to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. As such, ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots (&quot;chatbot&quot; modernly) and one of the first programs capable of attempting the Turing test.

ELIZA&#x27;s creator, Weizenbaum, intended the program as a method to explore communication between humans and machines. He was surprised and shocked that some people, including Weizenbaum&#x27;s secretary, attributed human-like feelings to the computer program. Many academics believed that the program would be able to positively influence the lives of many people, particularly those with psychological issues, and that it could aid doctors working on such patients&#x27; treatment. While ELIZA was capable of engaging in discourse, it could not converse with true understanding. However, many early users were convinced of ELIZA&#x27;s intelligence and understanding, despite Weizenbaum&#x27;s insistence to the contrary. The original ELIZA source-code had been missing since its creation in the 1960s as it was not common to publish articles that included source code at that time. However, more recently the MAD-SLIP source-code has now been discovered in the MIT archives and published on various platforms, such as the Internet Archive. The source-code is of high historical interest since it demonstrates not only the specificity of programming languages and techniques at that time, but also the beginning of software layering and abstraction as a means of achieving sophisticated software programming.

==Overview==

Joseph Weizenbaum&#x27;s ELIZA, running the DOCTOR script, created a conversational interaction somewhat similar to what might take place in the office of &quot;a [non-directive] psychotherapist in an initial psychiatric interview&quot; and to &quot;demonstrate that the communication between man and machine was superficial&quot;. While ELIZA is best known for acting in the manner of a psychotherapist, the speech patterns are due to the data and instructions supplied by the DOCTOR script. ELIZA itself examined the text for keywords, applied values to said keywords, and transformed the input into an output; the script that ELIZA ran determined the keywords, set the values of keywords, and set the rules of transformation for the output. Weizenbaum chose to make the DOCTOR script in the context of psychotherapy to &quot;sidestep the problem of giving the program a data base of real-world knowledge&quot;, allowing it to reflect back the patient&#x27;s statements in order to carry the conversation forward. The result was a somewhat intelligent-seeming response that reportedly deceived some early users of the program.

Weizenbaum named his program ELIZA after Eliza Doolittle, a working-class character in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (also appearing in the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, which was based on the play and was hugely popular at the time). According to Weizenbaum, ELIZA&#x27;s ability to be &quot;incrementally improved&quot; by various users made it similar to Eliza Doolittle, since Eliza Doolittle was taught to speak with an upper-class accent in Shaw&#x27;s play. However, unlike the human character in Shaw&#x27;s play, ELIZA is incapable of learning new patterns of speech or new words through interaction alone. Edits must be made directly to ELIZA&#x27;s active script in order to change the manner by which the program operates.

Weizenbaum first implemented ELIZA in his own SLIP list-processing language, where, depending upon the initial entries by the user, the illusion of human intelligence could appear, or be dispelled through several interchanges. Some of ELIZA&#x27;s responses were so convincing that Weizenbaum and several others have anecdotes of users becoming emotionally attached to the program, occasionally forgetting that they were conversing with a computer. Weizenbaum&#x27;s own secretary reportedly asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and ELIZA could have a real conversation. Weizenbaum was surprised by this, later writing: &quot;I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.&quot;

In 1966, interactive computing (via a teletype) was new. It was 11 years before the personal computer became familiar to the general public, and three decades before most people encountered attempts at natural language processing in Internet services like Ask.com or PC help systems such as Microsoft Office Clippit. Although those programs included years of research and work, ELIZA remains a milestone simply because it was the first time a programmer had attempted such a human-machine interaction with the goal of creating the illusion (however brief) of human–&quot;human&quot; interaction.

At the ICCC 1972, ELIZA was brought together with another early artificial-intelligence program named PARRY for a computer-only conversation. While ELIZA was built to speak as a doctor, PARRY was intended to simulate a patient with schizophrenia.

==Design and implementation==

Weizenbaum originally wrote ELIZA in MAD-SLIP for CTSS on an IBM 7094 as a program to make natural-language conversation possible with a computer. To accomplish this, Weizenbaum identified five &quot;fundamental technical problems&quot; for ELIZA to overcome: the identification of key words, the discovery of a minimal context, the choice of appropriate transformations, the generation of responses in the absence of key words, and the provision of an editing capability for ELIZA scripts. Weizenbaum solved these problems and made ELIZA such that it had no built-in contextual framework or universe of discourse. However, this required ELIZA to have a script of instructions on how to respond to inputs from users.

ELIZA starts its process of responding to an input by a user by first examining the text input for a &quot;keyword&quot;. A &quot;keyword&quot; is a word designated as important by the acting ELIZA script, which assigns to each keyword a precedence number, or a RANK, designed by the programmer. If such words are found, they are put into a &quot;keystack&quot;, with the keyword of the highest RANK at the top. The input sentence is then manipulated and transformed as the rule associated with the keyword of the highest RANK directs. For example, when the DOCTOR script encounters words such as &quot;alike&quot; or &quot;same&quot;, it would output a message pertaining to similarity, in this case &quot;In what way?&quot;, as these words had high precedence number. This also demonstrates how certain words, as dictated by the script, can be manipulated regardless of contextual considerations, such as switching first-person pronouns and second-person pronouns and vice versa, as these too had high precedence numbers. Such words with high precedence numbers are deemed superior to conversational patterns and are treated independently of contextual patterns.

Following the first examination, the next step of the process is to apply an appropriate transformation rule, which includes two parts: the &quot;decomposition rule&quot; and the &quot;reassembly rule&quot;. First, the input is reviewed for syntactical patterns in order to establish the minimal context necessary to respond. Using the keywords and other nearby words from the input, different disassembly rules are tested until an appropriate pattern is found. Using the script&#x27;s rules, the sentence is then &quot;dismantled&quot; and arranged into sections of the component parts as the &quot;decomposition rule for the highest-ranking keyword&quot; dictates. The example that Weizenbaum gives is the input &quot;You are very helpful&quot;, which is transformed to &quot;I are very helpful&quot;. This is then broken into (1) empty (2) &quot;I&quot; (3) &quot;are&quot; (4) &quot;very helpful&quot;. The decomposition rule has broken the phrase into four small segments that contain both the keywords and the information in the sentence.

The decomposition rule then designates a particular reassembly rule, or set of reassembly rules, to follow when reconstructing the sentence. The reassembly rule takes the fragments of the input that the decomposition rule had created, rearranges them, and adds in programmed words to create a response. Using Weizenbaum&#x27;s example previously stated, such a reassembly rule would take the fragments and apply them to the phrase &quot;What makes you think I am (4)&quot;, which would result in &quot;What makes you think I am very helpful?&quot;. This example is rather simple, since depending upon the disassembly rule, the output could be significantly more complex and use more of the input from the user. However, from this reassembly, ELIZA then sends the constructed sentence to the user in the form of text on the screen.

These steps represent the bulk of the procedures that ELIZA follows in order to create a response from a typical input, though there are several specialized situations that ELIZA/DOCTOR can respond to. One Weizenbaum specifically wrote about was when there is no keyword. One solution was to have ELIZA respond with a remark that lacked content, such as &quot;I see&quot; or &quot;Please go on&quot;. The second method was to use a &quot;MEMORY&quot; structure, which recorded prior recent inputs, and would use these inputs to create a response referencing a part of the earlier conversation when encountered with no keywords. This was possible due to Slip&#x27;s ability to tag words for other usage, which simultaneously allowed ELIZA to examine, store, and repurpose words for usage in outputs.

While these functions were all framed in ELIZA&#x27;s programming, the exact manner by which the program dismantled, examined, and reassembled inputs is determined by the operating script. The script is not static and can be edited, or a new one created, as is necessary for the operation in the context needed. This would allow the program to be applied in multiple situations, including the well-known DOCTOR script, which simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist.

A Lisp version of ELIZA, based on Weizenbaum&#x27;s CACM paper, was written shortly after that paper&#x27;s publication by Bernie Cosell. A BASIC version appeared in &quot;Creative Computing&quot; in 1977 (although it was written in 1973 by Jeff Shrager). This version, which was ported to many of the earliest personal computers, appears to have been subsequently translated into many other versions in many other languages. Shrager claims not to have seen either Weizenbaum&#x27;s or Cosell&#x27;s versions.

In 2021, Jeff Shrager searched MIT&#x27;s Weizenbaum archives, along with MIT archivist Myles Crowley, and found files labeled Computer Conversations. These included the complete source code listing of ELIZA in MAD-SLIP, with the DOCTOR script attached. The Weizenbaum estate gave permission to open-source this code under a Creative Commons CC0 public domain license. The code and other information can be found on the ELIZAGEN site. The 1965 source code has been dated as part of a software archaeology project which brings together researchers from USC, University of Sussex, Oxford, and Stanford U. who have worked together to unravel the complicated history of ELIZA. 

In December 2024, Rupert Lane, with the assistance of several other engineers who had been studying the original MAD-SLIP ELIZA, brought up the original ELIZA and demonstrated that the implementation of ELIZA based on the discovered code can reproduce almost exactly the published conversations with ELIZA from Weizenbaum&#x27;s 1966 paper. This original ELIZA was reconstructed using the vast majority of the 1965 version of the source code: approximately 96% of the functions. This was run on a version of the original MIT CTSS running on a 7094 emulator, both of the latter due to David Pitts. 

Another version of Eliza popular among software engineers is the version that comes with the default release of GNU Emacs, and which can be accessed by typing codice_1 from most modern Emacs implementations.

=== Pseudocode ===
From Figure 15.5, Chapter 15 of Speech and Language Processing (third edition).
 function ELIZA GENERATOR(user &quot;sentence&quot;) returns &quot;response&quot;
 Let &quot;w&quot; be the word in &quot;sentence&quot; that has the highest keyword rank
 if &quot;w&quot; exists
 Let r be the highest ranked rule for w that matches sentence
 &quot;response&quot; ← Apply the transform in &quot;r&quot; to &quot;sentence&quot;
 if w = &#x27;my&#x27;
 &quot;future&quot; ← Apply a transformation from the ‘memory’ rule list to &quot;sentence&quot;
 Push &quot;future&quot; onto the memory queue
 else (no keyword applies)
 Either
 &quot;response&quot; ← Apply the transform for the NONE keyword to &quot;sentence&quot;
 Or
 &quot;response&quot; ← Pop the oldest response from the memory queue
 Return &quot;response&quot;

==Response and legacy==
Lay responses to ELIZA were disturbing to Weizenbaum and motivated him to write his book &quot;Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation&quot;, in which he explains the limits of computers, as he wants to make clear his opinion that the anthropomorphic views of computers are just a reduction of human beings or any life form for that matter. In the independent documentary film &quot;Plug &amp; Pray&quot; (2010) Weizenbaum said that only people who misunderstood ELIZA called it a sensation.

David Avidan, who was fascinated with future technologies and their relation to art, desired to explore the use of computers for writing literature. He conducted several conversations with an APL implementation of ELIZA and published them – in English, and in his own translation to Hebrew – under the title &quot;My Electronic Psychiatrist – Eight Authentic Talks with a Computer&quot;. In the foreword, he presented it as a form of constrained writing.

There are many programs based on ELIZA in different programming languages. For MS-DOS computers, some Sound Blaster cards came bundled with Dr. Sbaitso, which functions like the DOCTOR script. Other versions adapted ELIZA around a religious theme, such as ones featuring Jesus (both serious and comedic), and another Apple II variant called &quot;I Am Buddha&quot;. The 1980 game &quot;The Prisoner&quot; incorporated ELIZA-style interaction within its gameplay. In 1988, the British artist and friend of Weizenbaum Brian Reffin Smith created two art-oriented ELIZA-style programs written in BASIC, one called &quot;Critic&quot; and the other &quot;Artist&quot;, running on two separate Amiga 1000 computers and showed them at the exhibition &quot;Salamandre&quot; in the Musée du Berry, Bourges, France. The visitor was supposed to help them converse by typing in to &quot;Artist&quot; what &quot;Critic&quot; said, and vice versa. The secret was that the two programs were identical. GNU Emacs formerly had a codice_2 command that simulates a session between ELIZA and Zippy the Pinhead. The Zippyisms were removed due to copyright issues, but the DOCTOR program remains.

ELIZA has been referenced in popular culture and continues to be a source of inspiration for programmers and developers focused on artificial intelligence. It was also featured in a 2012 exhibit at Harvard University titled &quot;Go Ask A.L.I.C.E.&quot;, as part of a celebration of mathematician Alan Turing&#x27;s 100th birthday. The exhibit explores Turing&#x27;s lifelong fascination with the interaction between humans and computers, pointing to ELIZA as one of the earliest realizations of Turing&#x27;s ideas.

ELIZA won a 2021 Legacy Peabody Award. A 2023 preprint reported that ELIZA beat OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-3.5, the model used by ChatGPT at the time, in a Turing test study. However, it did not outperform GPT-4 or real humans.

=== Eliza Effect ===
The Eliza effect borrowed its name from ELIZA the chatbot. This effect is first defined in &quot;Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models and the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought&quot; as humans’ assumption of which computer programs understand the user inputs and make analogies. However, it has no permanent knowledge but “handling a list of ‘assertions’.”

This misunderstanding can potentially manipulate and misinform users. When interacting and communicating with chatbots, users can be overly confident in the reliability of the chatbots’ answers. Other than misinforming, the chatbot&#x27;s human-mimicking nature can also cause severe consequences, especially for younger users who lack a sufficient understanding of the chatbot&#x27;s mechanism.

==In popular culture==
In 1969, George Lucas and Walter Murch incorporated an Eliza-like dialogue interface in their screenplay for the feature film &quot;THX-1138&quot;. Inhabitants of the underground future world of THX, when stressed, would retreat to &quot;confession booths&quot; and initiate a one-sided Eliza-formula conversation with a Jesus-faced computer who claimed to be &quot;OMM&quot;.

Frederik Pohl&#x27;s science-fiction novel Gateway has the narrator undergo therapy at a praxis run by an AI that performs the task of a Freudian therapist, which he calls &quot;Sigfrid von Shrink&quot;. The novel contains a few pages of (nonsensical) machine code illustrating Sigfrid&#x27;s internal processes.

ELIZA influenced a number of early computer games by demonstrating additional kinds of interface designs. Don Daglow claims he wrote an enhanced version of the program called &quot;Ecala&quot; on a DEC PDP-10 minicomputer at Pomona College in 1973.

The 2011 video game &quot;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&quot; and the 2016 sequel &quot;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided&quot; features an artificial-intelligence Picus TV Network newsreader named Eliza Cassan.

In Adam Curtis&#x27;s 2016 documentary, &quot;HyperNormalisation&quot;, ELIZA was referenced in relationship to post-truth.

The twelfth episode of the American sitcom &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;, aired in January 2018, included the protagonist &quot;conversing&quot; with ELIZA, hoping to resolve a domestic issue.

On August 12, 2019, independent game developer Zachtronics published a visual novel called &quot;Eliza&quot;, about an AI-based counseling service inspired by ELIZA.

In &quot;A Murder at the End of the World&quot;, the anthropomorphic LLM-powered character Ray cites ELIZA as an example of how some may seek refuge in a non-human therapist.

In Jan. 2025 The satirical BBC Interviewer Philomena Cunk (portrayed by Diane Morgan) briefly discussed ELIZA.

== Concerns ==

=== Bias ===
When ELIZA was created in 1966, it was meant predominantly for white, male, individuals with high education. This exclusivity was especially prevalent during the creation and testing stages of the bot, which marginalized the experience of those intended users and those who did not fit into the characteristics mentioned. Although this chatbot was meant to mimic human conversation with the goal of making the user think it is human, and those users would typically converse with others like them, ELIZA was named after a female character and programmed to give more feminine responses. Joseph Weizenbaum, the creator of ELIZA, has reflected upon and critiqued how ELIZA and other chatbots of the sort reinforce gender stereotypes. In particular, Weizenbaum reflects on how the script ELIZA is programmed to follow mimics a therapist&#x27;s nurturing and feminine qualities. He criticizes this decision by acknowledging that when technologies such as chatbots are created in such a way, they reinforce the idea that emotional and nurturing jobs are inherently feminine.

=== Accuracy and responsiveness ===
ELIZA&#x27;s design, while a pioneering chatbot of its time, unveils the need to reevaluate the Turing Test&#x27;s relevance in assessing AI capabilities.

In a study titled “Does GPT-4 Pass the Turing Test?” by University of California, San Diego researchers Cameron R. Jones and Benjamin K. Bergen where they explored the performance of various AI models, including ELIZA, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, alongside human participants in imitating human conversation, they ended up highlighting several factors that contributed to ELIZA&#x27;s surprising performance. First factor was its conservative response style that minimized the risk of providing misleading or incorrect information that could have exposed that it&#x27;s a machine since ELIZA was processed to build its response around a single keyword from users which meant that its accuracy was limited to syntactic response built upon predefined patterns. Further, researchers observed an absence of characteristic traits that were found in modern AI - such as helpfulness or excessive verbosity - that led them to view ELIZA as an uncooperative human. Ultimately, the researchers, Cameron R. Jones and Benjamin K. Bergen from UC San Diego, pointed out how the Turing Test that led to ELIZA&#x27;s roar need to be critically reevaluated in the light of findings about both current and historical AI systems as ELIZA&#x27;s role in the case of ongoing conversation seems to be relevant only because of the parameters put forward by the Turing Test in 1949 which was initially thought of as an experiment and not an actual test. In the same research, they - Cameron R. Jones and Benjamin K. Bergen from UC San Diego - also observed how ELIZA ignores grammatical structure and the context of the sentence. This causes an issue as ELIZA suffers from the inability to parse sentence structures that leads to less meaningful responses. This could also stem from its knowledge gap about the topic being discussed. Unlike modern models, due to this ELIZA could not put things into a broader context. ELIZA&#x27;s responsiveness is scripted and seems rigid and the reason is rooted in its underlying design, thus, changing its programming would not change its response patterns and sentence handling, rather would add more to its complexity as seen in the information shared by University of Birmingham’s excerpt &quot;What ELIZA lacks&quot; that say when a user states “&quot;Computers worry me,&quot;” ELIZA cannot relate this to any broader context, and often can generalize between the previous statement and “&quot;I’m not worried much by computers&quot;”. This calls for an AI capable of meaningful guidance.

<doc id="10236" wikidata="Q3048939" url="?curid=10236" title="ELIZA effect">
<text>In computer science, the ELIZA effect is a tendency to project human traits — such as experience, semantic comprehension or empathy — onto rudimentary computer programs having a textual interface. ELIZA was a symbolic AI chatbot developed in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum and imitating a psychotherapist. Many early users were convinced of ELIZA&#x27;s intelligence and understanding, despite its basic text-processing approach and the explanations of its limitations.

== History ==
The effect is named for ELIZA, the 1966 chatbot developed by MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum. When executing Weizenbaum&#x27;s &quot;DOCTOR&quot; script, ELIZA simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist, largely by rephrasing the &quot;patients replies as questions:

: Human: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.
: ELIZA: Your boyfriend made you come here?
: Human: He says I&#x27;m depressed much of the time.
: ELIZA: I am sorry to hear you are depressed.
: Human: It&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m unhappy.
: ELIZA: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy?

Though designed strictly as a mechanism to support &quot;natural language conversation&quot; with a computer, ELIZA&#x27;s &quot;DOCTOR&quot; script was found to be surprisingly successful in eliciting emotional responses from users who, in the course of interacting with the program, began to ascribe understanding and motivation to the program&#x27;s output. As Weizenbaum later wrote, &quot;I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.&quot; Indeed, ELIZA&#x27;s code had not been designed to evoke this reaction in the first place. Upon observation, researchers discovered users unconsciously assuming ELIZA&#x27;s questions implied interest and emotional involvement in the topics discussed, even when they consciously knew that ELIZA did not simulate emotion.

Although the effect was first named in the 1960s, the tendency to understand mechanical operations in psychological terms was noted by Charles Babbage. In proposing what would later be called a carry-lookahead adder, Babbage remarked that he found such terms convenient for descriptive purposes, even though nothing more than mechanical action was meant.

== Characteristics ==
In its specific form, the ELIZA effect refers only to &quot;the susceptibility of people to read far more understanding than is warranted into strings of symbols—especially words—strung together by computers&quot;. A trivial example of the specific form of the Eliza effect, given by Douglas Hofstadter, involves an automated teller machine which displays the words &quot;THANK YOU&quot; at the end of a transaction. A naive observer might think that the machine is actually expressing gratitude; however, the machine is only printing a preprogrammed string of symbols.

More generally, the ELIZA effect describes any situation where, based solely on a system&#x27;s output, users perceive computer systems as having &quot;intrinsic qualities and abilities which the software controlling the (output) cannot possibly achieve&quot; or &quot;assume that [outputs] reflect a greater causality than they actually do&quot;. In both its specific and general forms, the ELIZA effect is notable for occurring even when users of the system are aware of the determinate nature of output produced by the system.

From a psychological standpoint, the ELIZA effect is the result of a subtle cognitive dissonance between the user&#x27;s awareness of programming limitations and their behavior towards the output of the program.

== Significance ==
The discovery of the ELIZA effect was an important development in artificial intelligence, demonstrating the principle of using social engineering rather than explicit programming to pass a Turing test.

ELIZA convinced some users into thinking that a machine was human. This shift in human-machine interaction marked progress in technologies emulating human behavior. Two groups of chatbots are distinguished by William Meisel as &quot;general personal assistants&quot; and &quot;specialized digital assistants&quot;. General digital assistants have been integrated into personal devices, with skills like sending messages, taking notes, checking calendars, and setting appointments. Specialized digital assistants &quot;operate in very specific domains or help with very specific tasks&quot;. Weizenbaum considered that not every part of the human thought could be reduced to logical formalisms and that &quot;there are some acts of thought that ought to be attempted only by humans&quot;.

When chatbots are anthropomorphized, they tend to portray gendered features as a way through which we establish relationships with the technology. &quot;Gender stereotypes are instrumentalised to manage our relationship with chatbots&quot; when human behavior is programmed into machines. Feminized labor, or women&#x27;s work, automated by anthropomorphic digital assistants reinforces an &quot;assumption that women possess a natural affinity for service work and emotional labour&quot;. In defining our proximity to digital assistants through their human attributes, chatbots become gendered entities.

== Incidents ==
As artificial intelligence has advanced, a number of internationally notable incidents underscore the extent to which the ELIZA effect is realized.

In June 2022, Google engineer Blake Lemoine claimed that the large language model LaMDA had become sentient, hiring an attorney on its behalf after the chatbot requested he do so. Lemoine&#x27;s claims were widely pushed back by experts and the scientific community. After a month of paid administrative leave, he was dismissed for violation of corporate policies on intellectual property. Lemoine contends he &quot;did the right thing by informing the public&quot; because &quot;AI engines are incredibly good at manipulating people&quot;.

In February 2023, Luka made abrupt changes to its Replika chatbot following a demand from the Italian Data Protection Authority, which cited &quot;real risks to children&quot;. However, users worldwide protested when the bots stopped responding to their sexual advances. Moderators in the Replika subreddit even posted support resources, including links to suicide hotlines. Ultimately, the company reinstituted erotic roleplay for some users.

In March 2023, a Belgian man killed himself after chatting for six weeks on the app Chai. The chatbot model was originally based on GPT-J and had been fine-tuned to be &quot;more emotional, fun and engaging&quot;. The bot, ironically having the name Eliza as a default, encouraged the father of two to kill himself, according to his widow and his psychotherapist. In an open letter, Belgian scholars responded to the incident fearing &quot;the risk of emotional manipulation&quot; by human-imitating AI.

<doc id="10237" wikidata="Q864127" url="?curid=10237" title="Exponentiation by squaring">
<text>In mathematics and computer programming, exponentiating by squaring is a general method for fast computation of large positive integer powers of a number, or more generally of an element of a semigroup, like a polynomial or a square matrix. Some variants are commonly referred to as square-and-multiply algorithms or binary exponentiation. These can be of quite general use, for example in modular arithmetic or powering of matrices. For semigroups for which additive notation is commonly used, like elliptic curves used in cryptography, this method is also referred to as double-and-add.

==Basic method==

===Recursive version===
The method is based on the observation that, for any integer formula_1, one has:
formula_2

If the exponent is zero then the answer is 1. If the exponent is negative then we can reuse the previous formula by rewriting the value using a positive exponent. That is,
formula_3

Together, these may be implemented directly as the following recursive algorithm:

 In: a real number x; an integer n
 Out: xn
 exp_by_squaring(x, n)
 if n &lt; 0 then
 return exp_by_squaring(1 / x, -n);
 else if n = 0 then 
 return 1;
 else if n is even then 
 return exp_by_squaring(x * x, n / 2);
 else if n is odd then 
 return x * exp_by_squaring(x * x, (n - 1) / 2);
 end function 

In each recursive call, the least significant digits of the binary representation of is removed. It follows that the number of recursive calls is formula_4 the number of bits of the binary representation of . So this algorithm computes this number of squares and a lower number of multiplication, which is equal to the number of in the binary representation of . This logarithmic number of operations is to be compared with the trivial algorithm which requires multiplications.

This algorithm is not tail-recursive. This implies that it requires an amount of auxiliary memory that is roughly proportional to the number of recursive calls -- or perhaps higher if the amount of data per iteration is increasing.

The algorithms of the next section use a different approach, and the resulting algorithms needs the same number of operations, but use an auxiliary memory that is roughly the same as the memory required to store the result.

===With constant auxiliary memory===

The variants described in this section are based on the formula
:formula_5

If one applies recursively this formula, by starting with , one gets eventually an exponent equal to , and the desired result is then the left factor.

This may be implemented as a tail-recursive function:

 Function exp_by_squaring(x, n)
 return exp_by_squaring2(1, x, n)
 Function exp_by_squaring2(y, x, n)
 if n &lt; 0 then return exp_by_squaring2(y, 1 / x, -n);
 else if n = 0 then return y;
 else if n is even then return exp_by_squaring2(y, x * x, n / 2);
 else if n is odd then return exp_by_squaring2(x * y, x * x, (n - 1) / 2).
The iterative version of the algorithm also uses a bounded auxiliary space, and is given by
 Function exp_by_squaring_iterative(x, n)
 if n &lt; 0 then
 x := 1 / x;
 n := -n;
 if n = 0 then return 1
 y := 1;
 while n &gt; 1 do
 if n is odd then
 y := x * y;
 n := n - 1;
 x := x * x;
 n := n / 2;
 return x * y
The correctness of the algorithm results from the fact that formula_6 is invariant during the computation; it is formula_7 at the beginning; and it is formula_8 at the end.

These algorithms use exactly the same number of operations as the algorithm of the preceding section, but the multiplications are done in a different order.

==Computational complexity==

A brief analysis shows that such an algorithm uses formula_9 squarings and at most formula_9 multiplications, where formula_11 denotes the floor function. More precisely, the number of multiplications is one less than the number of ones present in the binary expansion of &quot;n&quot;. For &quot;n&quot; greater than about 4 this is computationally more efficient than naively multiplying the base with itself repeatedly.

Each squaring results in approximately double the number of digits of the previous, and so, if multiplication of two &quot;d&quot;-digit numbers is implemented in O(&quot;d&quot;&quot;k&quot;) operations for some fixed &quot;k&quot;, then the complexity of computing &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is given by

: formula_12

==2&quot;k&quot;-ary method==
This algorithm calculates the value of &quot;xn&quot; after expanding the exponent in base 2&quot;k&quot;. It was first proposed by Brauer in 1939. In the algorithm below we make use of the following function &quot;f&quot;(0) = (&quot;k&quot;, 0) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) = (&quot;s&quot;, &quot;u&quot;), where &quot;m&quot; = &quot;u&quot;·2&quot;s&quot; with &quot;u&quot; odd.

Algorithm:

;Input: An element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, a parameter &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0, a non-negative integer and the precomputed values formula_13.

;Output: The element &quot;xn&quot; in &quot;G&quot;

 y := 1; i := l - 1
 while i ≥ 0 do
 (s, u) := f(ni)
 for j := 1 to k - s do
 y := y2
 y := y * xu
 for j := 1 to s do
 y := y2
 i := i - 1
 return y

For optimal efficiency, &quot;k&quot; should be the smallest integer satisfying

: formula_14

==Sliding-window method==
This method is an efficient variant of the 2&quot;k&quot;-ary method. For example, to calculate the exponent 398, which has binary expansion (110 001 110)2, we take a window of length 3 using the 2&quot;k&quot;-ary method algorithm and calculate 1, x3, x6, x12, x24, x48, x49, x98, x99, x198, x199, x398.
But, we can also compute 1, x3, x6, x12, x24, x48, x96, x192, x199, x398, which saves one multiplication and amounts to evaluating (110 001 110)2

Here is the general algorithm:

Algorithm:

;Input: An element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, a non negative integer , a parameter &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0 and the pre-computed values formula_15.

;Output: The element &quot;xn&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;.

Algorithm:

 y := 1; i := l - 1
 while i &gt; -1 do
 if ni = 0 then
 y := y2
 i := i - 1
 else
 s := max{i - k + 1, 0}
 while ns = 0 do
 s := s + 1
 for h := 1 to i - s + 1 do
 y := y2
 u := (ni, ni-1, ..., ns)2
 y := y * xu
 i := s - 1
 return y

==Montgomery&#x27;s ladder technique==
Many algorithms for exponentiation do not provide defence against side-channel attacks. Namely, an attacker observing the sequence of squarings and multiplications can (partially) recover the exponent involved in the computation. This is a problem if the exponent should remain secret, as with many public-key cryptosystems. A technique called &quot;Montgomery&#x27;s ladder&quot; addresses this concern.

Given the binary expansion of a positive, non-zero integer &quot;n&quot; = (&quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1...&quot;n&quot;0)2 with &quot;n&quot;k−1 = 1, we can compute &quot;xn&quot; as follows:
 x1 = x; x2 = x2
 for i = k - 2 to 0 do
 if ni = 0 then
 x2 = x1 * x2; x1 = x12
 else
 x1 = x1 * x2; x2 = x22
 return x1

The algorithm performs a fixed sequence of operations (up to log &quot;n&quot;): a multiplication and squaring takes place for each bit in the exponent, regardless of the bit&#x27;s specific value. A similar algorithm for multiplication by doubling exists.

This specific implementation of Montgomery&#x27;s ladder is not yet protected against cache timing attacks: memory access latencies might still be observable to an attacker, as different variables are accessed depending on the value of bits of the secret exponent. Modern cryptographic implementations use a &quot;scatter&quot; technique to make sure the processor always misses the faster cache.

==Fixed-base exponent==
There are several methods which can be employed to calculate &quot;xn&quot; when the base is fixed and the exponent varies. As one can see, precomputations play a key role in these algorithms.

===Yao&#x27;s method===
Yao&#x27;s method is orthogonal to the -ary method where the exponent is expanded in radix and the computation is as performed in the algorithm above. Let , , , and be integers.

Let the exponent be written as
: formula_16
where formula_17 for all formula_18.

Let .

Then the algorithm uses the equality
: formula_19

Given the element of , and the exponent written in the above form, along with the precomputed values , the element is calculated using the algorithm below:

 y = 1, u = 1, j = h - 1
 while j &gt; 0 do
 for i = 0 to w - 1 do
 if ni = j then
 u = u × xbi
 y = y × u
 j = j - 1
 return y

If we set and , then the values are simply the digits of in base . Yao&#x27;s method collects in &quot;u&quot; first those that appear to the highest power ; in the next round those with power are collected in as well etc. The variable &quot;y&quot; is multiplied times with the initial , times with the next highest powers, and so on.
The algorithm uses multiplications, and elements must be stored to compute .

===Euclidean method===
The Euclidean method was first introduced in &quot;Efficient exponentiation using precomputation and vector addition chains&quot; by P.D Rooij.

This method for computing formula_20 in group , where is a natural integer, whose algorithm is given below, is using the following equality recursively:
: formula_21
where formula_22.
In other words, a Euclidean division of the exponent by is used to return a quotient and a rest .

Given the base element in group , and the exponent formula_23 written as in Yao&#x27;s method, the element formula_20 is calculated using formula_25 precomputed values formula_26 and then the algorithm below.

 Begin loop
 
 Break loop 
 
 End loop;

The algorithm first finds the largest value among the and then the supremum within the set of .
Then it raises to the power , multiplies this value with , and then assigns the result of this computation and the value modulo .

==Further applications==
The approach also works with semigroups that are not of characteristic zero, for example allowing fast computation of large exponents modulo a number. Especially in cryptography, it is useful to compute powers in a ring of integers modulo. For example, the evaluation of
would take a very long time and much storage space if the naïve method of computing and then taking the remainder when divided by 2345 were used. Even using a more effective method will take a long time: square 13789, take the remainder when divided by 2345, multiply the result by 13789, and so on.

Applying above &quot;exp-by-squaring&quot; algorithm, with &quot;*&quot; interpreted as (that is, a multiplication followed by a division with remainder) leads to only 27 multiplications and divisions of integers, which may all be stored in a single machine word. Generally, any of these approaches will take fewer than modular multiplications.

The approach can also be used to compute integer powers in a group, using either of the rules
:.

The approach also works in non-commutative semigroups and is often used to compute powers of matrices.

More generally, the approach works with positive integer exponents in every magma for which the binary operation is power associative.

==Signed-digit recoding==
In certain computations it may be more efficient to allow negative coefficients and hence use the inverse of the base, provided inversion in is &quot;fast&quot; or has been precomputed. For example, when computing , the binary method requires multiplications and squarings. However, one could perform squarings to get and then multiply by to obtain .

To this end we define the signed-digit representation of an integer in radix as
: formula_27

&quot;Signed binary representation&quot; corresponds to the particular choice and formula_28. It is denoted by formula_29. There are several methods for computing this representation. The representation is not unique. For example, take : two distinct signed-binary representations are given by formula_30 and formula_31, where formula_32 is used to denote . Since the binary method computes a multiplication for every non-zero entry in the base-2 representation of , we are interested in finding the signed-binary representation with the smallest number of non-zero entries, that is, the one with &quot;minimal&quot; Hamming weight. One method of doing this is to compute the representation in non-adjacent form, or NAF for short, which is one that satisfies formula_33 and denoted by formula_34. For example, the NAF representation of 478 is formula_35. This representation always has minimal Hamming weight. A simple algorithm to compute the NAF representation of a given integer formula_36 with formula_37 is the following:
 for to do
 

Another algorithm by Koyama and Tsuruoka does not require the condition that formula_38; it still minimizes the Hamming weight.

==Alternatives and generalizations==

Exponentiation by squaring can be viewed as a suboptimal addition-chain exponentiation algorithm: it computes the exponent by an addition chain consisting of repeated exponent doublings (squarings) and/or incrementing exponents by &quot;one&quot; (multiplying by &quot;x&quot;) only. More generally, if one allows &quot;any&quot; previously computed exponents to be summed (by multiplying those powers of &quot;x&quot;), one can sometimes perform the exponentiation using fewer multiplications (but typically using more memory). The smallest power where this occurs is for &quot;n&quot; = 15:

: formula_39 (squaring, 6 multiplies),
: formula_40 (optimal addition chain, 5 multiplies if &quot;x&quot;3 is re-used).

In general, finding the &quot;optimal&quot; addition chain for a given exponent is a hard problem, for which no efficient algorithms are known, so optimal chains are typically used for small exponents only (e.g. in compilers where the chains for small powers have been pre-tabulated). However, there are a number of heuristic algorithms that, while not being optimal, have fewer multiplications than exponentiation by squaring at the cost of additional bookkeeping work and memory usage. Regardless, the number of multiplications never grows more slowly than Θ(log &quot;n&quot;), so these algorithms improve asymptotically upon exponentiation by squaring by only a constant factor at best.

<doc id="10238" wikidata="Q373027" url="?curid=10238" title="Exon">
<text>An exon is any part of a gene that will form a part of the final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. The term &quot;exon&quot; refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature RNA. Just as the entire set of genes for a species constitutes the genome, the entire set of exons constitutes the exome.

==History==
The term &quot;exon&quot; derives from the expressed region and was coined by American biochemist Walter Gilbert in 1978: &quot;The notion of the cistron... must be replaced by that of a transcription unit containing regions which will be lost from the mature messengerwhich I suggest we call introns (for intragenic regions)alternating with regions which will be expressedexons.&quot;

This definition was originally made for protein-coding transcripts that are spliced before being translated. The term later came to include sequences removed from rRNA and tRNA, and other ncRNA and it also was used later for RNA molecules originating from different parts of the genome that are then ligated by trans-splicing.

== Contribution to genomes and size distribution ==
Although unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast have either no introns or very few, metazoans and especially vertebrate genomes have a large fraction of non-coding DNA. For instance, in the human genome only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. This can provide a practical advantage in omics-aided health care (such as precision medicine) because it makes commercialized whole exome sequencing a smaller and less expensive challenge than commercialized whole genome sequencing. The large variation in genome size and C-value across life forms has posed an interesting challenge called the C-value enigma.

Across all eukaryotic genes in GenBank, there were (in 2002), on average, 5.48 exons per protein coding gene. The average exon encoded 30-36 amino acids. While the longest exon in the human genome is 11555 bp long, several exons have been found to be only 2 bp long. A single-nucleotide exon has been reported from the &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; genome. In humans, like protein coding mRNA, most non-coding RNA also contain multiple exons

==Structure and function==
In protein-coding genes, the exons include both the protein-coding sequence and the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR). Often the first exon includes both the 5′-UTR and the first part of the coding sequence, but exons containing only regions of 5′-UTR or (more rarely) 3′-UTR occur in some genes, i.e. the UTRs may contain introns. Some non-coding RNA transcripts also have exons and introns.

Mature mRNAs originating from the same gene need not include the same exons, since different introns in the pre-mRNA can be removed by the process of alternative splicing.

Exonization is the creation of a new exon, as a result of mutations in introns.

==Experimental approaches using exons==
Exon trapping or &#x27;gene trapping&#x27; is a molecular biology technique that exploits the existence of the intron-exon splicing to find new genes. The first exon of a &#x27;trapped&#x27; gene splices into the exon that is contained in the insertional DNA. This new exon contains the ORF for a reporter gene that can now be expressed using the enhancers that control the target gene. A scientist knows that a new gene has been trapped when the reporter gene is expressed.

Splicing can be experimentally modified so that targeted exons are excluded from mature mRNA transcripts by blocking the access of splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) to pre-mRNA using Morpholino antisense oligos. This has become a standard technique in developmental biology. Morpholino oligos can also be targeted to prevent molecules that regulate splicing (e.g. splice enhancers, splice suppressors) from binding to pre-mRNA, altering patterns of splicing.

==Common misuse of the term==

Common incorrect uses of the term &quot;exon&quot; are that &#x27;exons code for protein&#x27;, or &#x27;exons code for amino-acids&#x27; or &#x27;exons are translated&#x27;. However, these sorts of definitions only cover protein-coding genes, and omit those exons that become part of a non-coding RNA or the untranslated region of an mRNA. Such incorrect definitions still occur in overall reputable secondary sources.

<text>The &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill was a major environmental disaster that occurred in Alaska&#x27;s Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989. The spill occurred when &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;, an oil supertanker owned by Exxon Shipping Company, bound for Long Beach, California, struck Prince William Sound&#x27;s Bligh Reef, west of Tatitlek, Alaska at 12:04 a.m. The tanker spilled more than (or 37,000 tonnes) of crude oil over the next few days.

The &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; spill is the second largest in U.S. waters, after the 2010 &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill, in terms of volume of oil released. Prince William Sound&#x27;s remote location, accessible only by helicopter, plane, or boat, made government and industry response efforts difficult and made existing response plans especially hard to implement. The region is a habitat for salmon, sea otters, seals, and seabirds. The oil, extracted from the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, eventually affected of coastline, of which were heavily or moderately oiled.

==Spill==
&quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; was carrying of oil, of which approximately were spilled into the Prince William Sound.

The ship docked at the Valdez Marine Terminal at 11:30 p.m. on March 22, 1989. Loading of crude oil was completed late in the day on the 23rd. The tanker left the terminal at 9:12 p.m., March 23, 1989 (the deck log shows that it was clear of the dock at 9:21p.m.), loaded with 53,094,510 gallons (1,264,155 barrels) of crude oil. Captain Joseph Hazelwood retired to his cabin at 9:25p.m. Harbor pilot William Murphy and Third Mate Gregory Cousins were accompanied by a single tug for the passage through the Valdez Narrows – a journey of about 7 miles. The pilot left the bridge shortly after the vessel left the narrows, at 11:24p.m. At this point, the captain was called to the bridge. Cousins helped the pilot disembark from the vessel, leaving the captain as the only officer on the bridge. At 11:25p.m. &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; reported that the pilot had left. The third mate advised traffic control and decided to deviate from the predetermined traffic lane to avoid small icebergs; a common occurrence since the Columbia Glacier calved such icebergs nearby. The vessel was placed on a due south course and set on autopilot. At 11:47p.m. the vessel left the traffic lane&#x27;s eastern boundary.

Third Mate Cousins had been on duty for 6 hours and was scheduled to be relieved by Second Mate Lloyd LeCain Jr. However, due to the long hours that the second mate had worked, Cousins was reluctant to wake him, and remained on duty. Cousins was the only officer on the bridge for most of the night, in violation of company policy. At around midnight on March 24 Cousins began to maneuver the vessel into the traffic lanes. At the same time, the lookout reported that the Bligh Reef light appeared far off the starboard bow at 45 degrees – this was problematic given that the light should have been off the port side. Cousins ordered a course change as the ship was in danger. Captain Hazelwood was phoned by Cousins, but before their conversation could finish, the ship grounded. At 12:04a.m., accompanied by what the helmsman and Cousins described as &quot;a bumpy ride&quot; and &quot;six very sharp jolts&quot; respectively, the ship ran aground on Bligh Reef.

Carried by its own momentum, the ship ended up perched on its middle on a pinnacle of rock. 8 out of 11 cargo holds were punctured. 5.8 million gallons of oil drained from the ship within 3 hours and 15 minutes. 30 minutes after numerous attempts to dislodge the ship under her own power, Captain Hazelwood radioed the Coast Guard informing them of the grounding. For more than 45 minutes after the grounding, the captain attempted to maneuver free of the reef despite being informed by First Mate James Kunkel that the vessel was not structurally sound without the reef supporting it.

Multiple factors have been identified as contributing to the incident:

* Exxon Shipping Company failed to supervise the master (ship&#x27;s captain) and provide a rested and sufficient crew for &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;. The NTSB found this practice was widespread throughout the industry, prompting a safety recommendation to Exxon and to the industry.
* The third mate failed to properly maneuver the vessel, possibly due to fatigue or excessive workload.
* Exxon Shipping Company failed to properly maintain the Raytheon Collision Avoidance System (RAYCAS) radar, which, if functional, would have indicated to the third mate an impending collision with the Bligh Reef by detecting the radar reflector placed on the next rock inland from Bligh Reef for the purpose of keeping ships on course. This cause was brought forward by Greg Palast and is not presented in the official accident report.

Captain Hazelwood, who was widely reported to have been drinking heavily that night, was not at the controls when the ship struck the reef. Exxon blamed Hazelwood for the grounding of the tanker, but he accused the corporation of making him a scapegoat. 
In a 1990 trial he was charged with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, and piloting a vessel while intoxicated, but was cleared of the three charges. He was convicted of misdemeanor negligent discharge of oil. 21 witnesses testified that he did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol around the time of the accident.

Journalist Greg Palast stated in 2008:
Other factors, according to an MIT course entitled &quot;Software System Safety&quot; by Professor Nancy G. Leveson, included:
# Ships were not informed that the previous practice of the Coast Guard tracking ships out to Bligh Reef had ceased.
# The oil industry promised, but never installed, state-of-the-art iceberg monitoring equipment.
# &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; was sailing outside the normal sea lane to avoid small icebergs thought to be in the area.
# Coast Guard vessel inspections in Valdez were not performed, and the number of staff was reduced.
# Lack of available equipment and personnel hampered the spill cleanup.
This disaster resulted in International Maritime Organization introducing comprehensive marine pollution prevention rules (MARPOL) through various conventions. The rules were ratified by member countries and, under International Ship Management rules, the ships are being operated with a common objective of &quot;safer ships and cleaner oceans.&quot;

In 2009, Captain Hazelwood offered a &quot;heartfelt apology&quot; to the people of Alaska, suggesting he had been wrongly blamed for the disaster: &quot;The true story is out there for anybody who wants to look at the facts, but that&#x27;s not the sexy story and that&#x27;s not the easy story,&quot; he said. Hazelwood said he felt Alaskans always gave him a fair shake.

==Clean-up and major effects ==
Chemical dispersant, a surfactant and solvent mixture, was applied to the slick by a private company on March 24 with a helicopter, but the helicopter missed the target area. Scientific data on its toxicity were either thin or incomplete. In addition, public acceptance of new, widespread chemical treatment was lacking. Landowners, fishing groups, and conservation organizations questioned the use of chemicals on hundreds of miles of shoreline when other alternatives might have been available.&quot;

According to a report by David Kirby for TakePart, the main component of the Corexit formulation used during cleanup, 2-butoxyethanol, was identified as &quot;one of the agents that caused liver, kidney, lung, nervous system, and blood disorders among cleanup crews in Alaska following the 1989 &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; spill&quot;. It is now known that while 2-butoxyethanol is indeed a respiratory irritant that can be acutely toxic, animal studies did not find it to be mutagenic, and no studies suggest it to be a human carcinogen.

Mechanical cleanup was started shortly afterward using booms and skimmers, but the skimmers were not readily available during the first 24 hours following the spill, and thick oil and kelp tended to clog the equipment. Despite civilian insistence for a complete cleanup, only 10% of total oil was actually completely cleaned. Exxon was widely criticized for its slow response to cleaning up the disaster and John Devens, the mayor of Valdez, said his community felt betrayed by Exxon&#x27;s inadequate response to the crisis. More than 11,000 Alaska residents, along with some Exxon employees, worked throughout the region to try to restore the environment.

Though the clean-up effort was diligent it failed to contain the majority of the oil that had spilled and that has been blamed heavily upon Exxon. On November 26, 1984, Ronald A. Kreizenbeck (Director, Alaska Operations Office) informed the Coast Guard that the EPA suspected, due to a recent site-visitation during an &#x27;Annual Marine Drill&#x27; that the Port of Valdez was not prepared to &quot;efficiently respond to a major spill event&quot;. In the letter, he stated that &quot;[it] appears that the Vikoma boom and/or deployment vessels used may not be adequate to handle the harsh environmental conditions of Port Valdez&quot;.
Because Prince William Sound contained many rocky coves where the oil was collected, the decision was made to displace it with high-pressure hot water. However, this also displaced and destroyed the microbial populations on the shoreline; many of these organisms (e.g. plankton) are the basis of the coastal marine food chain, and others (e.g., certain bacteria and fungi) are capable of facilitating the biodegradation of oil. At the time, both scientific advice and public pressure was to clean everything, but since then, a much greater understanding of natural and facilitated remediation processes has developed, due somewhat in part to the opportunity presented for study by the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; spill.

Both long-term and short-term effects of the oil spill have been studied. Immediate effects include the deaths of between 100,000 and 250,000 seabirds, at least 2,800 sea otters, approximately 12 river otters, 300 harbor seals, 247 bald eagles, and 22 orcas, and an unknown number of salmon and herring.

Nine years after the disaster, evidence of negative oil spill effects on marine birds was found in the following species: cormorants, goldeneyes, mergansers, murres and pigeon guillemots.

Although the volume of oil has declined considerably, with oil remaining only about 0.14–0.28% of the original spilled volume, studies suggest that the area of oiled beach has changed little since 1992. A study by the National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA in Juneau, determined that by 2001 approximately 90 tonnes of oil remained on beaches in Prince William Sound in the sandy soil of the contaminated shoreline, with annual loss rates declining from 68% per year prior to 1992, to 4% per year after 2001.
The remaining oil lasting far longer than anticipated has resulted in more long-term losses of species than had been expected. Laboratory experiments found that at levels as low as one part per billion, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are toxic for salmon and herring eggs. Species as diverse as sea otters, harlequin ducks, and orcas suffered immediate and long-term losses. Oiled mussel beds and other tidal shoreline habitats may take up to 30 years to recover.

ExxonMobil denied concerns over the remaining oil, stating that they anticipated the remaining fraction would not cause long-term ecological impacts. According to the conclusions of ExxonMobil&#x27;s study: &quot;We&#x27;ve done 350 peer-reviewed studies of Prince William Sound, and those studies conclude that Prince William Sound has recovered, it&#x27;s healthy and it&#x27;s thriving.&quot;

On March 24, 2014, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the spill, NOAA scientists reported that some species seem to have recovered, with the sea otter the latest creature to return to pre-spill numbers. Scientists who have monitored the spill area for the last 25 years report that concern remains for one of two pods of local orca whales, with fears that one pod may eventually die out. Federal scientists estimate that between 16,000 and 21,000 US gallons (61 to 79 m3) of oil remains on beaches in Prince William Sound and up to 450 miles (725 km) away. Some of the oil does not appear to have biodegraded at all. A USGS scientist who analyses the remaining oil along the coastline states that it remains among rocks and between tide marks. &quot;The oil mixes with seawater and forms an emulsion...Left out, the surface crusts over but the inside still has the consistency of mayonnaise – or mousse.&quot; Alaska state senator Berta Gardner is urging Alaskan politicians to demand that the US government force ExxonMobil to pay the final $92 million (£57 million) still owed from the court settlement. The major part of the money would be spent to finish cleaning up oiled beaches and attempting to restore the crippled herring population.

As of 2012, the indirect and long-term sublethal effects of oil on shorebirds had been measured in relatively few studies.

==Litigation and cleanup costs==
In October 1989, Exxon filed a suit against the State of Alaska, claiming that the state had interfered with Exxon&#x27;s attempts to clean up the spill by refusing to approve the use of dispersant chemicals until the night of the 26th. The State of Alaska disputed this claim, stating that there was a long-standing agreement to allow the use of dispersants to clean up spills, thus Exxon did not require permission to use them, and that, in fact, Exxon had not had enough dispersant on hand to effectively handle a spill of the size created by &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;.

Exxon filed claims in October 1990 against the Coast Guard, asking to be reimbursed for cleanup costs and damages awarded to plaintiffs in any lawsuits filed by the State of Alaska or the federal government against Exxon. The company claimed that the Coast Guard was &quot;wholly or partially responsible&quot; for the spill, because they had granted mariners&#x27; licenses to the crew of the Valdez, and because they had given &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; permission to leave regular shipping lanes to avoid ice. They also reiterated the claim that the Coast Guard had delayed cleanup by refusing to give permission to immediately use chemical dispersants on the spill.

Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster&#x27;s effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75 million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5 billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven&#x27;s share could have been as high as $750 million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement, and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.

In the case of &quot;Exxon v. Baker&quot;, an Anchorage jury awarded $287 million for actual damages and $5 billion for punitive damages. To protect itself in case the judgment was affirmed, Exxon obtained a $4.8 billion credit line from J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., who created the first modern credit default swap so that they would not have to hold as much money in reserve against the risk of Exxon&#x27;s default.

Meanwhile, Exxon appealed the ruling, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the trial judge, Russel Holland, to reduce the punitive damages. On December 6, 2002, Holland announced that he had reduced the damages to $4 billion, which he concluded was justified by the facts of the case and was not grossly excessive. Exxon appealed again and the case returned to Holland to be reconsidered in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling in a similar case. Holland increased the punitive damages to $4.5 billion, plus interest.

After more appeals, in December 2006 the damages award was cut to $2.5 billion. The court of appeals cited recent Supreme Court rulings relative to limits on punitive damages.

Exxon appealed again. On May 23, 2007, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied ExxonMobil&#x27;s request for a third hearing and let stand its ruling that Exxon owed $2.5 billion in punitive damages. Exxon then appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. On February 27, 2008, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments. Justice Samuel Alito, who at the time owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in Exxon stock, recused himself from the case. In a decision issued June 25, 2008, written by Justice David Souter, the court vacated the $2.5 billion award and remanded the case back to the lower court, finding that the damages were excessive with respect to maritime common law. Exxon&#x27;s actions were deemed &quot;worse than negligent but less than malicious.&quot; The punitive damages were further reduced to an amount of $507.5 million. The Court&#x27;s ruling was that maritime punitive damages should not exceed the compensatory damages, supported by a precedent dating from 1818. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy has decried the ruling as &quot;another in a line of cases where this Supreme Court has misconstrued congressional intent to benefit large corporations.&quot;

Exxon&#x27;s official position was that punitive damages greater than $25 million were not justified because the spill resulted from an accident, and because Exxon spent an estimated $2 billion cleaning up the spill and a further $1 billion to settle related civil and criminal charges. Attorneys for the plaintiffs contended that Exxon bore responsibility for the accident because the company &quot;put a drunk in charge of a tanker in Prince William Sound.&quot; Exxon recovered a significant portion of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;.

As of December 15, 2009, Exxon had paid the entire $507.5 million in punitive damages, including lawsuit costs, plus interest, which were further distributed to thousands of plaintiffs. This amount was one-tenth of the original punitive damages, Exxon remained hugely profitable, the process of payment was drawn out over decades, and long term damage continues and is not funded by Exxon. Hence, the Exxon spill is often cited as shorthand for corporate responsibility for societal damage not being enforced adequately.

==Political consequences and reforms==
===Coast Guard report===
A 1989 report by the Coast Guard&#x27;s U.S. National Response Center summarized the event and made many recommendations, including that neither Exxon, Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the State of Alaska, nor the federal government were prepared for a spill of this magnitude.

===Oil Pollution Act of 1990===
In response to the spill, the United States Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA). The legislation included a clause that prohibits any vessel that, after March 22, 1989, has caused an oil spill of more than in any marine area, from operating in Prince William Sound.

In April 1998, the company argued in a legal action against the federal government that the ship should be allowed back into Alaskan waters. Exxon claimed OPA was effectively a bill of attainder, a regulation that was unfairly directed at Exxon alone. In 2002, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Exxon. As of 2002, OPA had prevented 18 ships from entering Prince William Sound.

OPA also set a schedule for the gradual phase-in of a double hull design, providing an additional layer between the oil tanks and the ocean. While a double hull would likely not have prevented the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; disaster, a Coast Guard study estimated that it would have cut the amount of oil spilled by 60 percent.

&quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; was towed to San Diego, arriving on July 10. Repairs began on July 30. Approximately of steel were removed and replaced. In June 1990, the tanker, renamed &quot;Exxon Mediterranean&quot;, left the harbor after $30 million of repairs. In 1993, owned by SeaRiver Maritime, it was named &quot;S/R Mediterranean&quot;, then in 2005 &quot;Mediterranean&quot;. In 2008 the vessel was acquired by a Hong Kong company that operated her as &quot;Dong Fang Ocean&quot;, then in 2011 renamed her &quot;Oriental Nicety&quot;. In August 2012, she was beached at Alang, and dismantled.

===Alaska regulations===
In the aftermath of the spill, Alaska governor Steve Cowper issued an executive order requiring two tugboats to escort every loaded tanker from Valdez out through Prince William Sound to Hinchinbrook Entrance. As the plan evolved in the 1990s, one of the two routine tugboats was replaced with a Escort Response Vehicle (ERV). Tankers at Valdez are no longer single-hulled. Congress enacted legislation requiring all tankers to be double-hulled as of 2015.

==Economic and Native impact==
In 1991, following the collapse of populations of local marine species (particularly clams, herring, and seals), the Chugach Alaska Corporation, an Alaska Native Corporation, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It has since recovered.

According to several studies funded by the state of Alaska, the spill had both short-term and long-term economic effects. These included the loss of recreational sports, fisheries, reduced tourism, and an estimate of what economists call &quot;existence value&quot;, which is the value to the public of a pristine Prince William Sound.

The economy of the city of Cordova, Alaska was adversely affected after the spill damaged stocks of salmon and herring in the area. The village of Chenega was transformed into an emergency base and media outlet. The local villagers had to cope with a tripling of their population from 80 to 250. When asked how they felt about the situation, a village councilor noted that they were too shocked and busy to be depressed; others emphasized the human costs of leaving children unattended while their parents worked to clean up. Many Alaska Natives were worried that too much time was spent on the fishery and not enough on the land that supports subsistence hunting.

In 2010, CNN reported on studies concluding that many oil spill cleanup workers involved in the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; response had subsequently become sick, and warned those exposed to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to take heed. Anchorage lawyer Dennis Mestas found that this was true for 6,722 of 11,000 worker files he was able to inspect, despite access to the records being controlled by Exxon. Exxon denied this in a statement to CNN:

Environmental activists and State officials became concerned that BP would use similar techniques to minimize liability and de-emphasize health impacts: 

==Reactions==
In 1992, Exxon released a video titled &quot;Scientists and the Alaska Oil Spill&quot; for distribution to schools. Critics said the video misrepresented the clean-up process.

In December 1994, the Unabomber assassinated Burson-Marsteller executive Thomas J. Mosser, accusing him of having &quot;helped Exxon clean up its public image after the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; incident&quot;.

=== In popular culture ===
Several weeks after the spill, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired a pointed sketch featuring Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman, and Victoria Jackson as cleanup workers struggling to scrub the oil off of animals and rocks on a beach in Prince William Sound.

In the &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; episode, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Happy Sack&quot;, Rocko and his dog, Spunky are grocery shopping when the announcer informs everyone of a &quot;spill in the seafood section&quot;, represented by a giant oil tanker labeled &quot;Noxxon Valdez&quot;.

In the 1995 film &quot;Waterworld&quot;, &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; is the flagship of the movie&#x27;s villain, &quot;The Deacon,&quot; the leader of a band of scavenging raiders. In the ship is a portrait of their patron saint, Joseph Hazelwood.

&quot;On Deadly Ground&quot;, directed and starring Steven Seagal, involved environments threatened by oil factories in Alaska; in obvious reference to the Exxon Valdez oil spill.

&quot;Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home&quot;, sequel to &quot;Free Willy&quot;, features an oil spill plot line that echoes the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; spill.

The book &quot;Prince William&quot; by Gloria Rand is set on the Exxon Valdez incident, involving a young girl named Denny who assists in the environmental cleanup effort; starting with an oil-covered baby seal whom she saves and befriends.

In the seventeenth episode of &quot;&quot;, &quot;Speed Demons&quot;, both Superman and the Flash fight against Weather Wizard when he interrupts their charity race to test his weather machine; demonstrating his power by creating a storm off the coast of Australia which causes an oil tanker to crash and rupturing its hull, releasing an oil spill which begins to contaminate the ocean in a manner similar to the Exxon Valdez incident. Thankfully, it is stopped when Superman and the Flash intervene; the former sealing the rupture shut with his heat-ray vision and the latter using his speed to extract the oil from the ocean by its atoms to return it to the ship.

In the second Forrest Gump novel, &quot;Gump and Co.&quot; by Winston Groom, Gump commandeers &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; and accidentally crashes it.

Composer Jonathan Larson wrote a song called &quot;Iron Mike&quot; about the oil spill. The song is written in the style of a sea shanty. It was first professionally recorded by George Salazar for the album &quot;The Jonathan Larson Project&quot;.

The 1992 made-for-television film &quot;Dead Ahead: The Exxon Valdez Disaster&quot;, produced by HBO, dramatized the oil spill disaster.

In season 2, episode 8, of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, entitled &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, Walter White tells Jesse Pinkman that Jesse&#x27;s friend Badger, who had been caught in a drug deal with their methamphetamine and placed under arrest, is going to spill [information] like the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;.

<text>Édouard de Pomiane was the pen-name of Édouard Alexandre Pozerski (20 April 1875 – 26 January 1964), a French scientist, radio broadcaster and food writer. He pursued his academic career under his real name, but was known to the public under his pseudonym for his books and broadcasts about food.

Born in Paris to Polish exiles, Pozerski was educated in his native city and became an academic scientist, specialising in biology and medicine and particularly food chemistry and dietetics. As a hobby, which turned into a parallel career, he wrote for and lectured to a wide, non-academic audience under the Pomiane pseudonym, explaining the science behind cooking techniques and propounding the virtues of simpler cooking than that of classic French haute cuisine.

His admirers have included the food writers Elizabeth David and Richard Olney and the chef Raymond Blanc. Pomiane is credited with inspiring the generation of French chefs who introduced nouvelle cuisine in the 1960s, a simpler style of cooking than haute cuisine.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Pomiane, whose real name was Édouard Alexandre Pozerski, was born in Montmartre, in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, on 20 April 1875. His parents were Édouard Pozerski and his wife Olympe Bielaiew. They were Polish nationalists who had fled to France after taking part in the 1863 Polish uprising against Russia. Olympe, the daughter of a Russian general, had escaped to France under sentence of death and Édouard had served a sentence in a penal colony in Siberia. In Paris their son grew up within the Polish exile community, attending the École polonaise – an establishment described by another Franco-Polish cookery writer, Ali-Bab, as one of ferocious austerity – and then the Lycée Condorcet.

After graduating in natural sciences, Pozerski joined Albert Dastre&#x27;s laboratory at the Sorbonne as an unpaid volunteer. He supported himself by teaching mathematics, and wrote a doctoral thesis on digestive fermentation. In 1901, at the Academy of Sciences, Emile Duclaux, director of the Pasteur Institute, consulted his colleague Dastre about creating a post of (staff member who prepares students for forthcoming examinations) in the newly created physiology department of the institute. Dastre recommended Pozerski, who joined Duclaux&#x27;s staff in May 1901.

Pozerski developed a new category of his subject, naming it Gastrotechnology – the scientific explanation of established principles of cookery. The food writer Elizabeth David, an admirer of Pomiane&#x27;s books, wrote in 1967, &quot;Many before him had attempted to explain cookery in scientific terms and had succeeded only in turning both science and cookery into the deadliest of bores&quot;. 

Pozerski was twice married. In July 1906 he married Marie Tourtchine. His second wife was Charlotte Raymonde Watier, a fellow scientist with whom he collaborated on a couple of scientific papers. They had one daughter, Wanda.

===First World War and 1920s===
During the First World War Pozerski served as a medical adjutant and, after various front-line postings, ended the war serving in an advanced mobile surgical unit, and receiving the Croix de Guerre. During the war he began the writing of (Eating Well to Live Well). After the war he resumed his research at the Pasteur Institute in his small laboratory there, but post-war inflation left him in need of extra income, and for a while he had second jobs, playing the violin in the orchestra of a local cinema and working as an examiner for a large pharmacy on the Right Bank. He was able to give up these activities with the success of his teaching of gastrotechnology, and he returned to his research work.

His academic work did not distract Pozerski – in his capacity as Édouard de Pomiane – from his hobby and second profession of writing and talking about food. was published in 1922 by the Académie Française with a preface by a fellow gastronome, Ali-Bab, (also of Polish family and from a medical background). He published articles and gave lectures, and from 1923 to 1929, starred in weekly programmes on Radio Paris, in which he recounted stories about his culinary experiences and provided recipes illustrating his precepts. In a biographical sketch, M. M. Pack writes &quot;Despite the fact that he was neither French nor a trained chef, these broadcasts contributed to his reputation as one of the most popular and widely respected cooks in France at the time, and made him, arguably, the food world’s first media personality&quot;.

===Later years===
In 1940 Pozerski reached the age of retirement from the Pasteur Institute, but he continued his work in a small laboratory set up for him in the attic. During the German occupation of France during the Second World War he organised public lectures and cooking demonstrations at the Institute to help people with cooking and eating under the severe rationing then in force. He demonstrated how to make the most of what food was available, how to derive the most nutritional value from it, how to make the best use of unrationed foods, and energy-efficient cooking techniques. Pack comments that titles of the books Pomiane published during the war reflect his concerns, such as (Cooking and Restrictions) and (Eating Anyway).

After his official retirement from the Pasteur Institute Pozerski continued his lectures for the Institute of Food Hygiene and acted as guide for visitors to the Pasteur Institute. An obituarist wrote:
Pozersky died in Paris on 26 January 1964 at the age of 88.

==Works==
Pozerski published more than 200 articles, notes and scientific books, and, as Édouard de Pomiane, he published more than twenty books about food and cookery:

:Source: &quot;Culinary Biographies.
Some of Pomiane&#x27;s works were published in translation. The French first edition of lists translations of his works published in London (&quot;Good Fare&quot;, 1932), Berlin ( and , 1935), Zurich (, 1935) Prague (, 1936) and Warsaw (, 1936).

Later English translations include &quot;Cooking with Pomiane&quot; (1962), a compilation of recipes and essays taken from his radio shows. In her foreword, Elizabeth David writes that Pomiane, &quot;like all good teachers, makes light of his learning, and so makes learning easy for his readers. He takes the mystique out of cookery processes and still contrives to leave us with the magic&quot;. &quot;French Cooking in Ten Minutes, or Adapting to the Rhythm of Modern Life&quot; was published in English in 1977. In 1985 his 1929 was published in English as &quot;The Jews of Poland: Recollections and Recipes&quot;. The translator, Josephine Bacon, described it as &quot;...the only memoir of Polish Jewry between the wars written by a non-Jew, the only authentic collection of Polish-Jewish recipes, the only kosher cookbook ever written by a non-Jew&quot;.

==Reputation and legacy==
David titled her biographical sketch of him, &quot;Pomiane, Master of the Unsacrosanct&quot;, because he was a continual rebel against culinary orthodoxy and in particular the excess and over-richness of classical haute cuisine. He urged restraint and the greater use of vegetables and less excessive use of meat and fish. He propounded the virtues of simplicity in cooking, writing in the preface to :
In David&#x27;s words:

Pomiane&#x27;s precepts were a strong influence on the generation of French chefs who introduced nouvelle cuisine in the 1960s and 1970s. Other admirers have included the food writer Richard Olney and the chef Raymond Blanc; the latter names Pomaine as his hero – &quot;one of the first people to have queried the establishment, the static traditions and the taboos of French cuisine. He wanted to make cooking accessible, demystify it and especially to associate it with an act of loving and giving&quot;.

Pomiane also explained in easily comprehensible terms the science behind culinary techniques. David comments, &quot;In cooking, the possibility of muffing a dish is always with us. Nobody can eliminate that. What de Pomiane did by explaining the cause, was to banish the &quot;fear&quot; of failure&quot;. 

In 1995 BBC Television broadcast a six-part series called &quot;French Cooking in Ten Minutes&quot;, &quot;As much a drama as a cookery series, it dramatises Édouard de Pomiane&#x27;s 1930s culinary classic, &quot;Cooking in Ten Minutes&quot;&quot;.
