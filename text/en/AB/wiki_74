<text>The Detroit River is an international river in North America. The river, which forms part of the border between the U.S. state of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario, flows west and south for from Lake St. Clair to Lake Erie as a strait in the Great Lakes system. The river divides the metropolitan areas of Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario—an area collectively referred to as Detroit–Windsor. The Ambassador Bridge, the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel, and the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel connect the cities.

The river&#x27;s English name comes from the French (translated as &quot;River of the Strait&quot;). The Detroit River has served an important role in the history of Detroit and Windsor, and is one of the world&#x27;s busiest waterways. It is an important transportation route connecting Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior to Lake Erie and eventually to Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Erie Canal. When Detroit underwent rapid industrialization at the turn of the 20th century, the Detroit River became notoriously polluted and toxic. Since the late 20th century, however, a vast restoration effort has been undertaken because of the river&#x27;s ecological importance.

In the early 21st century, the river today has a wide variety of economic and recreational uses. There are numerous islands in the Detroit River, and much of the lower portion of the river is part of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. The portion of the river in the city of Detroit has been organized into the Detroit International Riverfront and the William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor. The Detroit River is designated both an American Heritage River and a Canadian Heritage River—the only river to have this dual designation.

==Geography==

The Detroit River flows for from Lake St. Clair to Lake Erie. By definition, this classifies it as both a river and a strait — a strait being a narrow passageway connecting two large bodies of water, which is how the river earned its name from early French settlers. However, today, the Detroit River is rarely referred to as a strait, because bodies of water referred to as straits are typically much wider relative to their length. The river forms the southern portion of the waterway connecting Lake Huron to the north and Lake Erie to the south, with other portions including the St. Clair River and Lake St. Clair.

The Detroit River is only wide. It begins with an east-to-west flow from Lake St. Clair, but curves and runs north to south. The deepest portion of the Detroit River is in its northern portion. At its source, the river is at an elevation of above sea level. The river is relatively level, dropping only before entering Lake Erie at . As the river contains no dams and no locks, it is easily navigable by even the smallest of vessels. The watershed basin for the Detroit River is approximately . 

Since the river is fairly short, it has few tributaries, the largest being the River Rouge in Michigan; this is four times longer than the Detroit River and contains most of the watershed. The only other major American tributary to the Detroit River is the much smaller Ecorse River. Tributaries on the Canadian side include Little River, Turkey Creek, and the River Canard. The discharge for the Detroit River is relatively high for a river of its size. The river&#x27;s discharge averaged over the year is , and the river&#x27;s flow is relatively constant.

The Detroit River forms a major element of the international border between the United States and Canada. The river on the American side is all under the jurisdiction of Wayne County, Michigan, and the Canadian side is under the administration of Essex County, Ontario. The largest city along the Detroit River is Detroit, and most of the population along the river lives in Michigan. The Detroit River has two automobile traffic crossings connecting the United States and Canada: the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel. Both of these are strongly protected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The upper portion of the river is one of the two places where a Canadian city lies directly south of an American city. In this case, the city of Detroit is directly north of the city of Windsor, Ontario. The only other location where this occurs is Fort Erie, Ontario, which lies south of several cities in Niagara County, New York. The cities and communities southwest of Detroit along the American side of the river are popularly referred to as the Downriver area, because those areas are said to be &quot;down the river&quot; from Detroit. Several of these communities do not border the Detroit River but the term &quot;Downriver&quot; refers broadly to the cluster of 18 suburban communities that lie to the southwest of the city of Detroit and to the west of the Detroit River.
===Islands===

The Detroit River contains 31 charted islands. The majority of the islands are located on the American side of the river. Many of the islands are small and uninhabited, and none are divided by the international border, as the two countries do not share a land border along the river. Grosse Ile is the largest and most populated of all islands, and Fighting Island is the largest Canadian island. Most islands are located in the southern portion of the river.

==History==

Europeans first recorded navigating the Detroit River in the 17th century. The Iroquois traded furs with the Dutch colonists at New Amsterdam by traveling through the Detroit River. The French later claimed the area for New France. The famed sailing ship &quot;Le Griffon&quot; reached the mouth of the Detroit River in mid-August 1679 on its maiden voyage through the Great Lakes. Later, when the French began settling in the area, they navigated the river using canoes made of birch or elm bark. Handcrafted vessels were a common mode of travel across the river, and pirogues and bateaux were also used. 

As the North American fur trade intensified, European settlers expanded their trade westward into uncharted territories. French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac sailed up the Detroit River on July 23, 1701. The next day, he established Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit, which developed as Detroit. The French named the river as &quot;Rivière Détroit&quot;. &quot;Détroit&quot; is French for &quot;strait&quot;. The river was known literally as the &quot;River of the Strait&quot;.

When Great Britain defeated the French in the Seven Years&#x27; War (known as the French and Indian War on the American front), it took over control of the Detroit River, as well as other French territory east of the Mississippi River. The newly formed United States claimed this territory during the American Revolution, but the British did not transfer it until 1796. 

During the War of 1812, the Detroit River served as a major barrier between the American Michigan Territory and British Upper Canada, especially during the Battle of Fort Detroit in August 1812. Detroit briefly fell to the British. After the completion of the Erie Canal in 1817, which opened up easier travel to Lake Erie from the East Coast of the United States, connecting the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and the port of New York City, the Detroit River became a route for many migrating settlers traveling to northern Michigan. Detroit rapidly attracted a share of new residents. Following the Patriot War, in which British regulars and Michigan militia nearly came to armed conflict on the ice-covered Detroit River, the United States built Fort Wayne at Detroit to counter Britain&#x27;s riverside Fort Malden at Amherstburg across the river.

The Detroit River served as a final stop on the Underground Railroad and was the most active entry point along the United States–Canada border for fugitive slaves. 

Escaping slaves often chose to cross through the Detroit River rather than flee to Mexico because of the river&#x27;s location near free states made it less risky than traveling through slaveholding states that border Mexico. The strong Underground Railroad networks in the Canadian border region also assisted Blacks hoping to flee from the U.S. once the Fugitive Slave Act was strengthened in 1850. Canada also granted legal immigration status to Blacks, while Mexico did not for many years. 

Individuals and organizations assisted escaping slaves hoping to cross the Detroit River from the United States into Canada. The Second Baptist Church of Detroit and First Baptist Church of Amherstburg coordinated ferrying thousands of Blacks across the Detroit River into Canada, and Detroit&#x27;s Colored Vigilant Committee assisted over 1,500 fugitives in crossing into Canada. Famous abolitionists and Underground Railroad conductors including George DeBaptiste and William Lambert worked individually and with these organizations to assist fleeing slaves and condemn slavery.  

There was considerable transnational fluidity between the Canadian and American sides of the river until the middle of the 19th century. The 1833 Blackburn Riots in Detroit, which erupted after slave hunters detained couple Lucie and Thornton Blackburn, marked the end of hundreds of years of a nearly porous border between Canada and the United States on the Detroit River. Detroit&#x27;s African American population protested and helped the Blackburns escape across the Detroit River to Upper Canada, where the British colonial government in Canada declared former slaves could not be extradited to be returned to their owners. With their freedom in Canada secured, crossing the Detroit River out of the United States became an imperative for escaping slaves. 

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Union feared the seceded Confederate States of America (CSA) would plan a northerly attack from Canada, which was controlled by the British Empire and remained neutral in the war. The Union feared the CSA would cross the Detroit River to launch this attack. For that reason, Union forces regularly patrolled the Detroit River and the fortification at Fort Wayne improved, although it was far removed from any major combat. A Confederate plot to capture the U.S. Navy warship, USS &quot;Michigan&quot;, and liberate Confederate prisoners from Johnson Island, in western Lake Erie, was narrowly averted only after the Confederates had captured two passenger steamships.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Detroit&#x27;s industrialization took off on an unprecedented scale. The Detroit River became the world&#x27;s busiest commercial river and in 1908 was dubbed &quot;the Greatest Commercial Artery on Earth&quot; by &quot;The Detroit News&quot;. In 1907, the Detroit River carried 67,292,504 tons (61 billion kg) of shipping commerce through Detroit to markets all over the world. By comparison, London shipped 18,727,230 tons (16 billion kg), and New York shipped 20,390,953 tons (18 billion kg).

===Prohibition===

From 1920 to 1933, the United States (US) enforced the Prohibition era. The sale, manufacture, and transportation of alcohol for consumption were nationally banned. Detroit, as the largest city bordering Canada, where alcohol remained legal during Prohibition, became the center of a new industry known as rum-running, smuggling liquor into the US.

No bridges connected Ontario, Canada and Michigan, US, until the Ambassador Bridge was finished in 1929 and the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel in 1930. Smugglers used boats of varying sizes to transport alcohol across the river during the summer, and during the winter months, rum-runners traveled back and forth across the frozen Detroit River by car. In some cases, overloaded cars fell through the ice. In the 21st century, car parts from this era are occasionally still found on the bottom of the river. Rum-running in Windsor and production of bootleg liquor became common practices. American mobsters such as the Purple Gang of Detroit used violence to control the route known as the &quot;Detroit-Windsor Funnel,&quot; and continue to gain lucrative returns from the trade. The name parodied the newly built tunnel between the cities and nations. The Detroit River, Lake St. Clair, and the St. Clair River are estimated to have carried 75% of all liquor smuggled into the United States during Prohibition. Government officials were unable or unwilling to deter the flow.

The rum-running industry died when prohibition was repealed in 1933 by the Twenty-first Amendment.

===Submerged objects===
Because of the booming businesses and long history of Metro Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, the Detroit River has been the site of many artifacts, some lost with sunken ships and others abandoned, such as murder weapons or stolen bronze statues. A DMC DeLorean has also been recovered from the river. The artifacts recovered are well preserved due to the river&#x27;s fresh water but low visibility makes them difficult to find.

A 1940s-era bronze statue depicting a classical nude woman was originally installed to overlook a reflecting pool in the Grosse Pointe War Memorial. It was nicknamed &quot;The Nude,&quot; and, in 2001, was believed to have been successfully stolen for display in some art collector&#x27;s private cache. During a police diving exercise near a submerged Jeep, the statue was found in 2009, restored, and returned to the memorial.

Anchors from the &quot;SS Greater Detroit,&quot; a luxury steamship that toured the Detroit River from 1924 to 1950, and the famed &quot;SS Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, a lake freighter that sank in a terrible 1975 storm, have notably both been recovered from the river. The 6,000-pound anchor of the &quot;SS Greater Detroit&quot; was raised in November 2016. It was installed at the Detroit/Wayne County Port Authority Building. The lost anchor of the &quot;SS Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was recovered during a July 1992 project, and the anchor was installed in the yard of the Dossin Great Lakes Museum on Belle Isle.

Since the 1980s, divers have recovered a total of six 1700s-era cannons from the river. The last was found in 2011 near the Cobo Center. They are believed to have been part of the pre-War of 1812 inventory kept by the British garrison in this area. Historians believe another three cannon may still be in the river. Inventory documents record a total of 17 cannons and 14 have been accounted for. It is believed that the British dragged the cannons onto the frozen river so they would sink with the spring thaw, and be kept from use by the American enemy. Another seven, larger cannons may have fallen off a barge closer to Amherstburg, Ontario, and may yet be found in the river.

===Pollution and conservation efforts===

Much of the land that surrounds the Detroit River is urbanized and, in some places, has been used for industrial purposes for more than 100 years. There has been excessive water pollution of the river from the long-term, unregulated dumping of chemicals, industrial waste, garbage, and sewage. Much of the Detroit River and its shoreline were polluted and unsafe for recreational use. Thousands of migrating birds died each year because of the oil slicks and contaminated water around the mouth of the Detroit River at Lake Erie. The river&#x27;s oxygen levels were depleted to the point where fish could not inhabit its waters. Because this pollution often drained into and affected Lake Erie, the lake was considered &quot;dead&quot; and unable to support aquatic life.

In 1961, a congressional order founded the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge. That began the government&#x27;s placing tighter restrictions on industries; substantial government funding at various levels has been allocated to clean up the river. In this early period, opponents believed that such efforts would adversely affect Detroit&#x27;s industry and economy. In 1970, toxic levels of mercury in the water resulted in the total closing of the fishing industry in the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River, and Lake Erie. Finally, a massive conservation effort was initiated to clean up the Detroit River. For years, the multi-million dollar cost of removing pollutants from the river and the political influence of nearby industries, hindered conservation efforts.

In 1998, the Detroit River was designated as an American Heritage River by the US Environmental Protection Agency and in 2001 as a Canadian Heritage River.  It is the only river in North America to have such dual designations.

In 2001, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was absorbed into the larger Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, a cooperative effort between the United States and Canada to preserve the area as an ecological refuge. The millions of dollars spent since that time to dredge pollutants out of the Detroit River has led to a remarkable restoration, although problems remain. Today, many species of native animals that had been driven out by human development are returning to the area. The river is home to a growing number of bird species such as eagles (including reintroduced bald eagles), ospreys, and peregrine falcons. Large numbers of lake whitefish, sturgeon, silver bass, black bass, salmon, perch, and walleye are again thriving in the river. 

The Detroit River and its recovery efforts were listed as a Michigan State Historic Site in 2007. A historic marker was erected along the river in a park that now serves as the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge visitor center in the city of Trenton.

==Economy==

The Detroit River is used for shipping and trading. The earliest use of the river for these economic activities was the shipping of furs for trade as early as the 17th century. By the time the fur trade decreased, Michigan had begun to exploit the lumber-rich areas of Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Detroit turned into a major industrial region, largely because of the Detroit River. The only way a ship could travel out of the upper Great Lakes system was to travel down the Detroit River. From there, ships could travel anywhere in the world out of the St. Lawrence Seaway or the Erie Canal to New York City. At the beginning of the 20th century, the automotive industry boomed, and the many manufacturers imported abundant supplies of iron ore, sand, limestone and wood.

The Detroit River provides substantial revenue for the local economies. A 1991 study showed $20.1 million came from sales related to waterfowl hunting along the Detroit River. The same year, bird watching, photography, and other non-consumptive uses of waterfowl contributed another $192.8 million to Michigan&#x27;s economy. Local economies benefit through boating registrations and fishing licenses. It is estimated walleye fishing alone brings in $1 million to the economy of communities along the lower Detroit River each spring. Other fish caught by recreational fisherman include white bass, bluegill, crappie, freshwater drum, smallmouth bass, northern pike and muskie. There are over 800,000 recreation boats in Michigan, and more than half of them are regularly used on or near the Detroit River. Popular river destinations in Detroit include the Detroit International Riverfront and Belle Isle Park — both of which host events throughout the year. Several restaurants on the river have docks for boaters. Tour boats and dinner cruises travel through the sights of Detroit and the undeveloped islands downriver. Cruise ships support tourism on the Great Lakes and dock at the Port Detroit passenger terminal downtown. The iconic Renaissance Center is on the banks of the Detroit River.

==Bridges and crossings==
According to a 2004 study, 150,000 jobs and $13 billion in annual production depend on the river crossings connecting Detroit to Windsor. In 2004, the American trade with Ontario alone was $407 billion, in which 28% ($113.3 billion) crossed the Detroit River.

There are two automobile traffic routes that completely cross the river: the Detroit–Windsor tunnel and the privately owned Ambassador Bridge, both of which connect Detroit, Michigan, to Windsor, Ontario. A railway tunnel and a commercial truck ferry service also travel between Detroit and Windsor. In Michigan, there are two bridges connecting the mainland to Grosse Ile, as well as the MacArthur Bridge that connects the mainland Detroit to Belle Isle. All ports of entry on the American side are secured by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Canadian side is secured by the Canada Border Services Agency; all areas between the American ports of entry and on the American side of the river are secured by the United States Border Patrol.

The Gordie Howe International Bridge is a new bridge project which began construction in 2019; it will directly connect Highway 401 in Canada to Interstate 75 in the United States.

<text>Dsungaripterus is a genus of dsungaripterid pterosaur which lived during the Early Cretaceous in what is now China and possibly South Korea. Its fossils come from the Wuerho Pterosaur Fauna group (WPF) of the Tugulu Group, comprising sections of the (Lianmuqin and Shengjinkou Formations) of the Junggar Basin. Both formations have seen various age estimates, with data suggest at least some of the WPF dates to the middle Valanginian, but the upper and lower bounds of these pterosaur bearing deposits remains unclear.

==Description==

&quot;Dsungaripterus weii&quot; had a wingspan of . Like most dsungaripteroids it had a rather robust skeleton with thick walls and stouty bodily proportions, suggesting a mostly terrestrial lifestyle. The flight style of these animals is unclear, but it was probably punctuated by abrupt landings and extensive flapping.

The skull of &quot;Dsungaripterus&quot;, measuring over long, bore a low bone crest that ran down from the base of the skull to halfway to the beak. &quot;Dsungaripterus&quot;&#x27;s head and neck were together almost long. Its most notable feature are its long, narrow, upcurved jaws with a pointed tip. It had no teeth in the front part of its jaws, which were probably used to remove prey from cracks in rocks and/or the sandy, muddy inland environments it inhabited. It had knobbly flat teeth more to the back of the jaw that were well suited for crushing the armor of shellfish or other hard objects. Thus, it is commonly interpreted that dsungaripterids were durophagous and possibly piscivorous pterosaurs. Additionally, &quot;Dsungaripterus&quot; also had a palate similar to that of azhdarchoids.

==History of discovery==

&quot;Dsungaripterus&quot; was described in 1964 named by Yang Zhongjian. The genus name combines a reference to the Junggar Basin with a Latinized Greek &quot;pteron&quot;, &quot;wing&quot;. The type species is &quot;Dsungaripterus weii&quot;, the specific name honoring paleontologist C.M. Wei of the Palaeontological Division, Institute of Science, Bureau of Petroleum of Xinjiang. The holotype is IVPP V-2776, a partial skull and skeleton from the Lianmuqin Formation. In 1973, more material has been found within the Shengjinkou Formation, which includes almost complete skulls.

In 1980 Peter Galton renamed &quot;Pterodactylus brancai&quot; (Reck 1931) from the Tendaguru Formation into &quot;Dsungaripterus brancai&quot;, but the identification is now commonly rejected. In 1982 Natasha Bakhurina named a new species, &quot;Dsungaripterus parvus&quot;, based on a smaller skeleton from Mongolia. Later, this was renamed into &quot;Phobetor&quot;, a preoccupied name, and in 2009 concluded to be identical to &quot;Noripterus&quot;. A dsungaripterid wing finger phalanx was reported in 2002 from the Hasandong Formation of South Korea, and was identified in 2015 and 2018 as &quot;Dsungaripterus&quot;? cf. &quot;D. weii&quot;.

==Classification==
&quot;Dsungaripterus&quot; was classified by Yang as a member of the Dsungaripteridae. Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Andres and colleagues in 2014. They recovered &quot;Dsungaripterus&quot; within the clade Dsungaripteromorpha (a subgroup within the Azhdarchoidea), more specifically within the Dsungaripteridae, sister taxon to &quot;Domeykodactylus&quot;. Their cladogram is shown below.

In 2019, a different topology, this time by Kellner and colleagues, was published. In this study, &quot;Dsungaripterus&quot; was recovered outside the Azhdarchoidea, within the larger group Tapejaroidea, sister taxon to &quot;Noripterus&quot;. The cladogram of the analysis is shown below.

Huffman was born on May 10, 1945, in Berwyn, Illinois, to Clarence and Opal Huffman (née Dippel).

Huffman married casting director Phyllis Huffman (&quot;nee&quot; Grennan) in 1967, whom he had met as a student at Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri. The couple had two sons and remained married until Huffman&#x27;s death in 1985.

Huffman was an avid sailor, recreational painter, and country‐and‐western guitarist.

==Murder==
On the morning of February 27, 1985, 16-year-old Genaro Samano Villanueva was taken into San Diego police custody after attempting to steal a radio from a car near his home. Released into the custody of his high school vice principal, Villanueva left school and went to Balboa Park. There he was spotted by Canadian tourist Jack Beamer prowling around inside the motor home of Beamer&#x27;s friends. After Beamer accosted him, Villanueva fled the scene.

Huffman, who was cast in the play &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; at the Old Globe Theatre and was set to begin work on the television miniseries &quot;North and South&quot; the following week, had visited the theatre shortly before noon to share cookies with the cast and crew and was sitting in his van near the theatre playing his bagpipes when he saw Beamer confront Villanueva. He gave chase in his vehicle, parking the van near the Spreckels Organ Pavilion and following Villanueva into the park. When he caught up with Villanueva, the two became involved in a physical altercation, during which Villanueva stabbed Huffman twice in the chest with a screwdriver. Huffman died of exsanguination, likely within 30 to 45 seconds. His body was found less than an hour later in a Palm Canyon crevice by a group of children, although it was not positively identified until later that night.

On March 2 and 3, Crime Stoppers produced a reenactment of the crime that was shown on San Diego television and published in several national newspapers. The Canadian tourists whose motor home was burglarized saw Huffman&#x27;s photo and death announcement in the newspaper and called police.

Villanueva was arrested on March 12 after a police officer recognized Villanueva from a composite sketch given to police by the Canadian tourist. On June 24, 1986, Villanueva was sentenced to 26 years to life in prison and admitted to the California State Prison, Centinela. On December 9, 2011, he was denied parole for 15 years.

<text>Dagome iudex is one of the earliest historical documents relating to Poland. Although Poland is not mentioned by name, it refers to &quot;Dagome&quot; and &quot;Ote&quot; (Mieszko I and his wife, Oda von Haldensleben) and their sons in 991, placing their land (called &quot;Civitas Schinesghe&quot;) under the protection of the Apostolic See. The document&#x27;s name derives from its opening words.

==History==
The &quot;Dagome iudex&quot; survives in the form of a summary, completed . It was found in a register compiled by a curial cardinal during the papacy of Gregory VII.

Most historians believe that the word &quot;Dagome&quot; is a melding of two names: the Christian &quot;Dago&quot;, for &quot;Dagobert&quot; (Mieszko&#x27;s hypothetical baptismal name), and the &quot;Me,&quot; for pagan &quot;Mieszko.&quot; The Latin word (&quot;judge&quot;) could refer to &quot;prince.&quot; Another interpretation is that &quot;Dagome iudex&quot; is a corruption of &quot;Ego Mesco dux&quot; (&quot;I, Prince Mieszko&quot;). In the Vatican copy, the e of Dagome might have an &quot;s adscriptum&quot; (similar to cedilla), although the Vatican copyist read &quot;iudex&quot; literally, relating it to Sardinia and its four &quot;judges&quot;.

Place names are misspelled by the writer who made the summary. He was apparently unaware that the document related to territory later called Poland.

The boundaries of the &quot;Gniezno&quot; state are described as those that extended to the &quot;Long Sea&quot; (the Baltic), Prussia, Rus&#x27;, Kraków, Moravia and the Oder River. Lesser Poland is included by the mention of its capital, Kraków (&quot;craccoa&quot;). Between &quot;alemura&quot;, probably Olomouc and Upper Lusatia region of the Milceni (&quot;terra mileze&quot;) a straightened border could include Silesia.

The text seems to use &quot;civitas schinesghe&quot; as a synonym of Greater Poland. Otherwise, the boundary description would be more logical if &quot;schenisghe&quot; meant the city of Szczecin. Of the other regions and places in Mieszko&#x27;s territory, it mentioned only Kraków and Lusatia, both without &quot;fines&quot; (border). The regions outside Mieszko&#x27;s rule, &quot;pruzze&quot; (Prussia) and &quot;russe&quot; (Ruthenia) were mentioned with the word &quot;fines&quot;.

The &quot;Dagome iudex&quot; is of critical importance to Polish history, since it provided a general description of the future Polish state in that period. It, however, left many questions unanswered. First, it did not explain &quot;why&quot; Mieszko I placed his state under the Pope&#x27;s protection. Also, it is unclear why the document did not mention Mieszko&#x27;s eldest son, Bolesław I the Brave. Instead, his sons by his second wife (except the third), Oda, were mentioned instead. Finally, Mieszko I is not referred to as &quot;Dagome&quot; in any other document.

Historians suppose that Bolesław&#x27;s absence from the document might be explained by an old custom whereby children received their inheritance as soon as they reached the age of majority. Thus, Bolesław the Brave might have received Kraków as his part of his father&#x27;s legacy before the &quot;Dagome iudex&quot; was written.

==Text of the &quot;Dagome iudex&quot;==

* In Latin:

* In English translation:

: &quot;Also in another volume from the times of Pope John XV, Dagome, lord, and Ote, lady, and their sons Misico and Lambert (I do not know of which nation those people are, but I think they are Sardinians, for those are ruled by four judges) were supposed to give to Saint Peter one state in whole which is called Schinesghe, with all its lands in borders which run along the long sea, along Prussia to the place called Rus, thence to Kraków and from said Kraków to the River Oder, straight to a place called Alemure, and from said Alemure to the land of Milczanie, and from the borders of that people to the Oder and from that, going along the River Oder, ending at the earlier mentioned city of Schinesghe.&quot;

==Notes==

Notes based on interpretations by the Polish historian Gerard Labuda:

&quot;a.&quot; When Lusatia came in sight of medieval writers, the lived only in Lower Lusatia, the Milceni in Upper Lusatia. Later on, the term &quot;Lusatia&quot; (Lausitz, Lužice) was spread to the south. Therefore, nowaday&#x27;s term Lusatian Mountains does not totally fit with the history of settlement.

&quot;b.&quot; &quot;Dagome&quot; is commonly identified as Mieszko I. However, the question remains open whether this was a misspelling or his Christian name. If the latter, it might correspond to the names &quot;Dago&quot;, &quot;Dagon&quot; or &quot;Dagobert&quot;.

&quot;c.&quot; In classical Latin, the term &quot;iudex&quot; was used to refer to &quot;a person who is ordered to do some work on behalf of others&quot; and was identical in meaning to the Byzantine &quot;archont&quot;. However, in medieval Latin &quot;iudex&quot; could also mean a sovereign ruler. Princes of Slavic tribes were sometimes referred to as &quot;iudices&quot;. Nevertheless, some historians claim that this was a misspelling of the Latin &quot;dux&quot; (&quot;duke&quot; or &quot;prince&quot;).

&quot;d.&quot; Literally, &quot;lady-senator&quot;. Cf. &quot;senate&quot;.

&quot;e.&quot; It is unclear why Bolesław I the Brave, Mieszko&#x27;s eldest son and his successor, is not mentioned while the children from Mieszko&#x27;s marriage to Ote are.

&quot;f.&quot; Scribe&#x27;s note, only in the Vatican copy; the four is written non-classical as iiii.

&quot;g.&quot; The origin of the name &quot;Schinesghe&quot; is unclear. Some historians argue that it is a corruption of &quot;Gniezno&quot;, then Poland&#x27;s capital. Others identify it with the town of Szczecin.

&quot;h.&quot; &quot;Long sea&quot;: Some historians identify it with the Baltic Sea, others with the province of Pomerania (the Baltic coast), a part of Poland ca. 990.

&quot;i.&quot; &quot;Alemure&quot; might be the city of Olomouc, in Moravia. However, this is uncertain.

<text>Sir Derek Alton Walcott OM (23 January 1930 – 17 March 2017) was a Saint Lucian poet and playwright. 

He received the 1992 Nobel Prize in Literature. His works include the Homeric epic poem &quot;Omeros&quot; (1990), which many critics view &quot;as Walcott&#x27;s major achievement.&quot; In addition to winning the Nobel Prize, Walcott received many literary awards over the course of his career, including an Obie Award in 1971 for his play &quot;Dream on Monkey Mountain&quot;, a MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius&quot; award, a Royal Society of Literature Award, the Queen&#x27;s Medal for Poetry, the inaugural OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature, the 2010 T. S. Eliot Prize for his book of poetry &quot;White Egrets&quot; and the Griffin Trust For Excellence in Poetry Lifetime Recognition Award in 2015.

==Early life and childhood==
Walcott was born and raised in Castries, Saint Lucia, in the West Indies, the son of Alix (Maarlin) and Warwick Walcott. He had a twin brother, the playwright Roderick Walcott, and a sister, Pamela Walcott. His family is of English, Dutch and African descent, reflecting the complex colonial history of the island that he explores in his poetry. His mother, a teacher, loved the arts and often recited poetry around the house. His father was a civil servant and a talented painter. He died when Walcott and his brother were one year old, and were left to be raised by their mother. Walcott was brought up in Methodist schools. His mother, who was a teacher at a Methodist elementary school, provided her children with an environment where their talents could be nurtured. Walcott&#x27;s family was part of a minority Methodist community, who felt overshadowed by the dominant Catholic culture of the island established during French colonial rule.

As a young man Walcott trained as a painter, mentored by Harold Simmons, whose life as a professional artist provided an inspiring example for him. Walcott greatly admired Cézanne and Giorgione and sought to learn from them. Walcott&#x27;s painting was later exhibited at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York City, along with the art of other writers, in a 2007 exhibition named &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Brush: Paintings and Drawing by Writers&quot;.

He studied as a writer, becoming &quot;an elated, exuberant poet madly in love with English&quot; and strongly influenced by modernist poets such as T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Walcott had an early sense of a vocation as a writer. In the poem &quot;Midsummer&quot; (1984), he wrote:

&lt;poem&gt;
Forty years gone, in my island childhood, I felt that 
the gift of poetry had made me one of the chosen, 
that all experience was kindling to the fire of the Muse.&lt;/poem&gt;

At 14, Walcott published his first poem, a Miltonic, religious poem, in the newspaper &quot;The Voice of St Lucia&quot;. An English Catholic priest condemned the Methodist-inspired poem as blasphemous in a response printed in the newspaper. By 19, Walcott had self-published his first two collections with the aid of his mother, who paid for the printing: &quot;25 Poems&quot; (1948) and &quot;Epitaph for the Young: XII Cantos&quot; (1949). He sold copies to his friends and covered the costs. He later commented:

I went to my mother and said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to publish a book of poems, and I think it&#x27;s going to cost me two hundred dollars.&quot; She was just a seamstress and a schoolteacher, and I remember her being very upset because she wanted to do it. Somehow she got it—a lot of money for a woman to have found on her salary. She gave it to me, and I sent off to Trinidad and had the book printed. When the books came back I would sell them to friends. I made the money back.

The influential Bajan poet Frank Collymore critically supported Walcott&#x27;s early work.

After attending high school at Saint Mary&#x27;s College, he received a scholarship to study at the University College of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica.

==Career ==
After graduation, Walcott moved to Trinidad in 1953, where he became a critic, teacher and journalist. He founded the Trinidad Theatre Workshop in 1959 and remained active with its board of directors.

Exploring the Caribbean and its history in a colonialist and post-colonialist context, his collection &quot;In a Green Night: Poems 1948–1960&quot; (1962) attracted international attention. His play &quot;Dream on Monkey Mountain&quot; (1970) was produced on NBC-TV in the United States the year it was published. Makak is the protagonist in this play; and &quot;Makak&quot;s condition represents the condition of the colonized natives under the oppressive forces of the powerful colonizers&quot;. In 1971 it was produced by the Negro Ensemble Company off-Broadway in New York City; it won an Obie Award that year for &quot;Best Foreign Play&quot;. The following year, Walcott won an OBE from the British government for his work.

He was hired as a teacher by Boston University in the United States, where he founded the Boston Playwrights&#x27; Theatre in 1981. That year he also received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in the United States. Walcott taught literature and writing at Boston University for more than two decades, publishing new books of poetry and plays on a regular basis. Walcott retired from his position at Boston University in 2007. He became friends with other poets, including the Russian expatriate Joseph Brodsky, who lived and worked in the U.S. after being exiled in the 1970s, and the Irishman Seamus Heaney, who also taught in Boston.

Walcott&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Omeros&quot; (1990), which loosely echoes and refers to characters from the &quot;Iliad&quot;, has been critically praised as his &quot;major achievement.&quot; The book received praise from publications such as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, which chose &quot;Omeros&quot; as one of its &quot;Best Books of 1990&quot;.

Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992, the second Caribbean writer to receive the honour after Saint-John Perse, who was born in Guadeloupe, received the award in 1960. The Nobel committee described Walcott&#x27;s work as &quot;a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment&quot;. He won an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2004.

His later poetry collections include &quot;Tiepolo&#x27;s Hound&quot; (2000), illustrated with copies of his watercolours; &quot;The Prodigal&quot; (2004), and &quot;White Egrets&quot; (2010), which received the T. S. Eliot Prize and the 2011 OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature.

Derek Walcott held the Elias Ghanem Chair in Creative Writing at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in 2007. In 2008, Walcott gave the first Cola Debrot Lectures In 2009, Walcott began a three-year distinguished scholar-in-residence position at the University of Alberta. In 2010, he became Professor of Poetry at the University of Essex.

As a part of St Lucia&#x27;s Independence Day celebrations, in February 2016, he became one of the first knights of the Order of Saint Lucia.

==Writing==

===Themes===
Methodism and spirituality have played a significant role from the beginning in Walcott&#x27;s work. He commented: &quot;I have never separated the writing of poetry from prayer. I have grown up believing it is a vocation, a religious vocation.&quot; Describing his writing process, he wrote: &quot;the body feels it is melting into what it has seen… the &#x27;I&#x27; not being important. That is the ecstasy... Ultimately, it&#x27;s what Yeats says: &#x27;Such a sweetness flows into the breast that we laugh at everything and everything we look upon is blessed.&#x27; That&#x27;s always there. It&#x27;s a benediction, a transference. It&#x27;s gratitude, really. The more of that a poet keeps, the more genuine his nature.&quot; He also notes: &quot;if one thinks a poem is coming on... you do make a retreat, a withdrawal into some kind of silence that cuts out everything around you. What you&#x27;re taking on is really not a renewal of your identity but actually a renewal of your anonymity.&quot;

===Influences===
Walcott said that his writing was influenced by the work of the American poets Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop, who were also friends.

===Playwriting===
He published more than twenty plays, the majority of which have been produced by the Trinidad Theatre Workshop and have also been widely staged elsewhere. Many of them address, either directly or indirectly, the liminal status of the West Indies in the post-colonial period. Through poetry he also explores the paradoxes and complexities of this legacy.

===Essays===
In his 1970 essay &quot;What the Twilight Says: An Overture&quot;, discussing art and theatre in his native region (from &quot;Dream on Monkey Mountain and Other Plays&quot;), Walcott reflects on the West Indies as a colonized space. He discusses the problems for an artist of a region with little in the way of truly Indigenous forms, and with little national or nationalist identity. He states: &quot;We are all strangers here... Our bodies think in one language and move in another&quot;. The epistemological effects of colonization inform plays such as &quot;Ti-Jean and his Brothers&quot;. Mi-Jean, one of the eponymous brothers, is shown to have much information but truly knows nothing. Every line Mi-Jean recites is rote knowledge gained from the coloniser; he is unable to synthesize it or apply it to his life as a colonised person.

Walcott notes of growing up in West Indian culture:

What we were deprived of was also our privilege. There was a great joy in making a world that so far, up to then, had been undefined... My generation of West Indian writers has felt such a powerful elation at having the privilege of writing about places and people for the first time and, simultaneously, having behind them the tradition of knowing how well it can be done—by a Defoe, a Dickens, a Richardson.

Walcott identified as &quot;absolutely a Caribbean writer&quot;, a pioneer, helping to make sense of the legacy of deep colonial damage. In such poems as &quot;The Castaway&quot; (1965) and in the play &quot;Pantomime&quot; (1978), he uses the metaphors of shipwreck and Crusoe to describe the culture and what is required of artists after colonialism and slavery: both the freedom and the challenge to begin again, salvage the best of other cultures and make something new. These images recur in later work as well. He writes: &quot;If we continue to sulk and say, Look at what the slave-owner did, and so forth, we will never mature. While we sit moping or writing morose poems and novels that glorify a non-existent past, then time passes us by.&quot;

==&quot;Omeros&quot;==

Walcott&#x27;s epic book-length poem &quot;Omeros&quot; was published in 1990 to critical acclaim. The poem very loosely echoes and references Homer and some of his major characters from &quot;The Iliad&quot;. Some of the poem&#x27;s major characters include the island fishermen Achille and Hector, the retired English officer Major Plunkett and his wife Maud, the housemaid Helen, the blind man Seven Seas (who symbolically represents Homer), and the author himself.

Although the main narrative of the poem takes place on the island of St. Lucia, where Walcott was born and raised, Walcott also includes scenes from Brookline, Massachusetts (where Walcott was living and teaching at the time of the poem&#x27;s composition), and the character Achille imagines a voyage from Africa onto a slave ship that is headed for the Americas; also, in Book Five of the poem, Walcott narrates some of his travel experiences in a variety of cities around the world, including Lisbon, London, Dublin, Rome, and Toronto.
Composed in a variation on &quot;terza rima&quot;, the work explores the themes that run throughout Walcott&#x27;s oeuvre: the beauty of the islands, the colonial burden, the fragmentation of Caribbean identity, and the role of the poet in a post-colonial world.

In this epic, Walcott speaks in favour of unique Caribbean cultures and traditions to challenge the modernity that existed as a consequence of colonialism.

===Criticism and praise===
Walcott&#x27;s work has received praise from major poets including Robert Graves, who wrote that Walcott &quot;handles English with a closer understanding of its inner magic than most, if not any, of his contemporaries&quot;, and Joseph Brodsky, who praised Walcott&#x27;s work, writing: &quot;For almost forty years his throbbing and relentless lines kept arriving in the English language like tidal waves, coagulating into an archipelago of poems without which the map of modern literature would effectively match wallpaper. He gives us more than himself or &#x27;a world&#x27;; he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language.&quot; Walcott noted that he, Brodsky, and the Irish poet Seamus Heaney, who all taught in the United States, were a band of poets &quot;outside the American experience&quot;.

The poetry critic William Logan critiqued Walcott&#x27;s work in a &quot;New York Times&quot; book review of Walcott&#x27;s &quot;Selected Poems&quot;. While he praised Walcott&#x27;s writing in &quot;Sea Grapes&quot; and &quot;The Arkansas Testament&quot;, Logan had mostly negative things to say about Walcott&#x27;s poetry, calling &quot;Omeros&quot; &quot;clumsy&quot; and &quot;Another Life&quot; &quot;pretentious&quot;. Logan concluded with: &quot;No living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished than Walcott, though few individual poems seem destined to be remembered.&quot;

Most reviews of Walcott&#x27;s work are more positive. For instance, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; review of &quot;The Poetry of Derek Walcott&quot;, Adam Kirsch had high praise for Walcott&#x27;s oeuvre, describing his style in the following manner:

By combining the grammar of vision with the freedom of metaphor, Walcott produces a beautiful style that is also a philosophical style. People perceive the world on dual channels, Walcott&#x27;s verse suggests, through the senses and through the mind, and each is constantly seeping into the other. The result is a state of perpetual magical thinking, a kind of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; world where concepts have bodies and landscapes are always liable to get up and start talking.

Kirsch calls &quot;Another Life&quot; Walcott&#x27;s &quot;first major peak&quot; and analyzes the painterly qualities of Walcott&#x27;s imagery from his earliest work through to later books such as &quot;Tiepolo&#x27;s Hound&quot;. Kirsch also explores the post-colonial politics in Walcott&#x27;s work, calling him &quot;the postcolonial writer par excellence&quot;. Kirsch calls the early poem &quot;A Far Cry from Africa&quot; a turning point in Walcott&#x27;s development as a poet. Like Logan, Kirsch is critical of &quot;Omeros&quot;, which he believes Walcott fails to successfully sustain over its entirety. Although &quot;Omeros&quot; is the volume of Walcott&#x27;s that usually receives the most critical praise, Kirsch believes &quot;Midsummer&quot; to be his best book.

In 2013 Dutch filmmaker Ida Does released &quot;Poetry is an Island&quot;, a feature documentary film about Walcott&#x27;s life and the ever-present influence of his birthplace of St Lucia.

==Personal life==
In 1954 Walcott married Fay Moston, a secretary, and they had a son, the St. Lucian painter Peter Walcott. The marriage ended in divorce in 1959. Walcott married a second time to Margaret Maillard in 1962, who worked as an almoner in a hospital. Together they had two daughters, Elizabeth Walcott-Hackshaw and Anna Walcott-Hardy, before divorcing in 1976. In 1976, Walcott married for a third time, to actress Norline Metivier; they divorced in 1993. His companion until his death was Sigrid Nama, a former art gallery owner.

Walcott was also known for his passion for travelling to countries around the world. He split his time between New York, Boston, and St. Lucia, and incorporated the influences of different locations into his pieces of work.

==Allegations of sexual harassment==
In 1982, a Harvard sophomore accused Walcott of sexual harassment in September 1981. She alleged that after she refused a sexual advance from him, she was given the only C in the class. In 1996 a student at Boston University sued Walcott for sexual harassment and &quot;offensive sexual physical contact&quot;. The two reached a settlement.

In 2009, Walcott was a leading candidate for the position of Oxford Professor of Poetry. He withdrew his candidacy after reports of the accusations against him of sexual harassment from 1981 and 1996.

When the media learned that pages from an American book on the topic were sent anonymously to a number of Oxford academics, this aroused their interest in the university&#x27;s decisions. Ruth Padel, also a leading candidate, was elected to the post. Within days, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that she had alerted journalists to the harassment cases. Under severe media and academic pressure, Padel resigned. Padel was the first woman to be elected to the Oxford post, and some journalists attributed the criticism of her to misogyny and a gender war at Oxford. They said that a male poet would not have been so criticized, as she had reported published information, not rumour.

Numerous respected poets, including Seamus Heaney and Al Alvarez, published a letter of support for Walcott in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement,&quot; and criticized the press furore. Other commentators suggested that both poets were casualties of the media interest in an internal university affair because the story &quot;had everything, from sex claims to allegations of character assassination&quot;. Simon Armitage and other poets expressed regret at Padel&#x27;s resignation.

==Death==

Walcott died at his home in Cap Estate, St. Lucia, on 17 March 2017. He was 87. He was given a state funeral on Saturday, 25 March, with a service at the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Castries and burial at Morne Fortune.

==Legacy==
In 1993, a public square and park located in central Castries, Saint Lucia, was named Derek Walcott Square. A documentary film, &quot;Poetry Is an Island: Derek Walcott&quot;, by filmmaker Ida Does, was produced to honour him and his legacy in 2013.

The Saint Lucia National Trust acquired Walcott&#x27;s childhood home at 17 Chaussée Road, Castries, in November 2015, renovating it before opening it to the public as Walcott House in January 2016.

In 2019, Arrowsmith Press, in partnership with The Derek Walcott Festival in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, and the Boston Playwrights&#x27; Theatre, began awarding the annual Derek Walcott Prize for Poetry to a full-length book of poems by a living poet who is not a US citizen published in the previous calendar year.

In January 2020, the Sir Arthur Lewis Community College in St. Lucia announced that Walcott&#x27;s books on Caribbean Literature and poetry have been donated to its Library.

<doc id="8946" wikidata="Q1345443" url="?curid=8946" title="Decipherment">
<text>In philology and linguistics, decipherment is the discovery of the meaning of the symbols found in extinct languages and/or alphabets. Decipherment is possible with respect to languages and scripts. One can also study or try to decipher how spoken languages that no longer exist were once pronounced, or how living languages used to be pronounced in prior eras.

Notable examples of decipherment include the decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts and the decipherment of cuneiform. A notable decipherment in recent years is that of the Linear Elamite script. Today, at least a dozen languages remain undeciphered. Historically speaking, decipherments do not come suddenly through single individuals who &quot;crack&quot; ancient scripts. Instead, they emerge from the incremental progress brought about by a broader community of researchers.

Decipherment should not be confused with cryptanalysis, which aims to decipher special written codes or ciphers used in intentionally concealed secret communication (especially during war). It should also not be confused with determining the meaning of ambiguous text in a known language (interpretation).

== Categories ==
According to Gelb and Whiting, the approach of decipherment depends on four categories of situations in an undeciphered language:

* Type O: known writing and known language. Although decipherment in this case is trivial, useful information can be gleaned when a known language is written in an alphabet other than the one it is commonly written in. Studying the writing of the Phoenician or Sumerian languages in the Greek alphabet allows information about pronunciation and vocalization to be gleaned that cannot be obtained when studying the expression of these languages in their normal writing system.
* Type I: unknown writing and known language. Deciphered languages in this category include Phoenician, Ugaritic, Cypriot, and Linear B. In this situation, alphabetic systems are the easiest to decipher, followed by syllabic languages, and finally the most difficult being logo-syllabic.
* Type II: known writing and unknown language. An example is Linear A. Strictly speaking, this situation is not one of decipherment but of linguistic analysis. Decipherment in this category is considered extremely difficult to achieve on the basis of internal information only.
* Type III: unknown writing and unknown language. Examples include the Archanes script and the Archanes formula, Phaistos disk, Cretan hieroglyphs, and Cypro-Minoan syllabary. When this situation occurs in an isolated culture and without the availability of outside information, decipherment is typically considered impossible.

== Methods ==
There is no single recipe or linear method for decipherment, however: instead, philologists and linguists must rely on a set of heuristic devices that have been established. Broadly, it is important to be familiar with the relevant texts where the script or language occurs in, access to accurate drawings or photographs of these texts, information about their relative chronology, and background information on where the texts occur in (their geography, perhaps being found in the context of a funerary monument, etc). 

These methods can be divided into approaches utilizing external or internal information.

=== External information ===
Many successful decipherments have proceeded from the discovery of external information, a common example being through the use of multilingual inscriptions, such as the Rosetta Stone (with the same text in three scripts: Demotic, hieroglyphic, and Greek) that enabled the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphic. In principle, multilingual text may be insufficient for a decipherment as translation is not a linear and reversible process, but instead represents an encoding of the message in a different symbolic system. Translating a text from one language into a second, and then from the second language back into the first, rarely reproduces exactly the original writing. Likewise, unless a significant number of words are contained in the multilingual text, limited information can be gleaned from it.

=== Internal information ===
Internal approaches are multi-step: one must first ensure that the writing they are looking at represents real writing, as opposed to a grouping of pictorial representations or a modern-day forgery without further meaning. This is commonly approached with methods from the field of grammatology. Prior to decipherment of meaning, one can then determine the number of distinct graphemes (which, in turn, allows one to tell if the writing system is alphabetic, syllabic, or logo-syllabic; this is because such writing systems typically do not overlap in the number of graphemes they use), the sequence of writing (whether it be from left to right, right to left, top to bottom, etc.), and the determination of whether individual words are properly segmented when the alphabet is written (such as with the use of a space or a different special mark) or not. If a repetitive schematic arrangement can be identified, this can help in decipherment. For example, if the last line of a text has a small number, it can be reasonably guessed to be referring to the date, where one of the words means &quot;year&quot; and, sometimes, a royal name also appears. Another case is when the text contains many small numbers, followed by a word, followed by a larger number; here, the word likely means &quot;total&quot; or &quot;sum&quot;. After one has exhausted the information that can be inferentially derived from probable content, they must transition to the systematic application of statistical tools. These include methods concerning the frequency of appearance of each symbol, the order in which these symbols typically appear, whether some symbols appear at the beginning or end of words, etc. There are situations where orthographic features of a language make it difficult if not impossible to decipher specific features (especially without certain outside information), such as when an alphabet does not express double consonants. Additional, and more complex methods, also exist. Eventually, the application of such statistical methods becomes exceedingly laborious, in which computers might be used to apply them automatically.

=== Computational approaches ===
Computational approaches towards the decipherment of unknown languages began to appear in the late 1990s. Typically, there are two types of computational approaches used in language decipherment: approaches meant to produce translations in known languages, and approaches used to detect new information that might enable future efforts at translation. The second approach is more common, and includes things such as the detection of cognates or related words, discovery of the closest known language, word alignments, and more.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on methods utilizing artificial intelligence for the decipherment of lost languages, especially through natural language processing (NLP) methods. Proof-of-concept methods have independently re-deciphered Ugaritic and Linear B using data from similar languages, in this case Hebrew and Ancient Greek.

== Deciphering pronunciation ==
Related to attempts to decipher the meaning of languages and alphabets, include attempts to decipher how extinct writing systems, or older versions of contemporary writing systems (such as English in the 1600s) were pronounced. Several methods and criteria have been developed in this regard. Important criteria include (1) Rhymes and the testimony of poetry (2) Evidence from occasional spellings and misspellings (3) Interpretations of material in one language from authors in foreign languages (4) Information obtained from related languages (5) Grammatical changes in spelling over time.

For example, analysis of poetry focuses on the use of wordplay or literary techniques between words that have a similar sound. Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; contains wordplay that relies on a similar sound between the words &quot;soul&quot; and &quot;soles&quot;, allowing confidence that the similar pronunciation between the terms today also existed in Shakespeare&#x27;s time. Another common source of information on pronunciation is when earlier texts use rhyme, such as when consecutive lines in poetry end in the similar or the same sound. This method does have some limitations however, as texts may use rhymes that rely on visual similarities between words (such as &#x27;love&#x27; and &#x27;remove&#x27;) as opposed to auditory similarities, and that rhymes can be imperfect. Another source of information about pronunciation comes from explicit description of pronunciations from earlier texts, as in the case of the &quot;Grammatica Anglicana&quot;, such as in the following comment about the letter &lt;o&gt;: &quot;In the long time it naturally soundeth sharp, and high; as in chósen, hósen, hóly, fólly [. . .] In the short time more flat, and a kin to u; as còsen, dòsen, mòther, bròther, lòve, pròve&quot;. Another example comes from detailed comments on pronunciations of Sanskrit from the surviving works of Sanskrit grammarians.

== Challenges ==
Many challenges exist in the decipherment of languages, including when:

* When it is not known which language is closest to it.
* When the words in the script are not clearly segmented, like in some Iberian languages.
* When the writing system is not known. In specific, if there is little certainty towards the number of graphemes that exist in a certain writing system, it cannot be determined if that system is an alphabet, a syllabry, a logosyllabry, or something else.
* When the reading direction is not known. For example, it may not be clear if a writing system is meant to be read from left to right, or from right to left.
* When it is not known if a script uses punctuation or spaces between words.
* When the language of a script subject to decipherment efforts is not known.
* When there is a small dataset available to learn about the properties of a script. This could lead to issues such as an incomplete vocabulary being known for the script.
* When the typical order between subjects, objects, and verbs is not known.
* When it is not known whether or how certain words can change their form.
* When it is not known when multiple symbols are used to represent the same sound, syllable, word, concept, or idea (allographs).
* When it is not clear how the penmanship or the style of writing of a particular scribe relates to the style of writing of another scribe working in the same text (the same letters or words might be written in a way that looks different), in which case it is difficult to correlate information across multiple examples of the use of the writing system.
* When it is not known if certain words change their meaning depending on the context they appear in (homonyms).
* When the context of discovery of a writing is not known. This is because information about the location out of which a writing system came from can provide valuable information about its relationship to known languages.
* When adequate digital datasets for documented writing systems is not available, limiting the ability to use computational methods for decipherment.
* When sufficient hardware resources, such as high performance computing, is not available (which might be necessary for more energy-intensive computational methods).

== Relationship to cryptanalysis ==
Decipherment overlaps with another technical field known as cryptanalysis, a field that aims to decipher writings used in secret communication, known as ciphertext. A famous case of this was in the cryptanalysis of the Enigma during the World War II. Many other ciphers from past wars have only recently been cracked. Unlike in language decipherment, however, actors using ciphertext intentionally lay obstacles to prevent outsiders from uncovering the meaning of the communication system.

== History ==
Interest in ancient scripts and dead languages began to arise by the Renaissance, if not earlier. Extensive information began to be collected about these scripts in the 16th and 17th centuries, and a typology of writing was established in the 17th century. The first serious decipherments, however, did not take place until the 18th century. In 1754, Swinton and Barthélemy independently deciphered the Aramaic script as represented in Palmyrene inscriptions from the 3rd century AD. In 1787, Silvestre de Sacy deciphered the Sasanian script, which was the script used in Ancient Persia to write down the Middle Iranian language used in the Sasanian empire. Both decipherments relied on bilingual texts where Greek was included as the second script. It was also in the 18th century when the methodological framework for deciphering scripts and languages began to be established. For example, in 1714, Leibniz advocated that parallel content in bilingual inscriptions could be specified by correlating where personal names occur in both inscriptions. By the 19th century, the prerequisites for decipherment began to become widely available. These included extensive knowledge about the scripts themselves, adequate editions of known texts from that script, philological skills, and the ability to reconstruct linguistic forms from the limited available evidence. The 19th century saw two major successes in decipherment: that of Egyptian hieroglyphic and cuneiform.

<text>The Decca Navigator System was a hyperbolic radio navigation system that allowed ships and aircraft to determine their position by using radio signals from a dedicated system of static radio transmitters. The system used phase comparison between pairs of low frequency signals between 70 and 129 kHz, as opposed to pulse timing systems like Gee and LORAN. This made it much easier to design receivers using 1940s electronics, and operation was simplified by giving a direct readout of Decca coordinates without the complexity of a cathode-ray tube and highly skilled operator.

The system was invented and developed by Decca in the UK. It was first deployed by the Royal Navy during World War II for the vital task of clearing the minefields to enable the D-Day landings. The Allied forces needed an accurate system not known to the Germans and thus free of jamming. After the war, it came off the secret list and was commercially developed by the Decca Company and deployed around UK and later used in many areas around the world. At its peak there were about 180 transmitting stations using &quot;chains&quot; of three or four transmitters each to allow position fixing by plotting intersecting electronic lines. Decca&#x27;s primary use was for ship navigation in coastal waters, offering much better accuracy than the competing LORAN system. Fishing vessels were major post-war users, but it was also used on some aircraft, including a very early (1949) application of moving map displays. The system was deployed extensively in the North Sea and was used by helicopters operating to oil platforms.

The opening of the more accurate Loran-C system to civilian use in 1974 offered stiff competition, but Decca was well established by this time and continued operations to 2000. Decca Navigator, along with Loran and similar systems, was eventually replaced by the GPS in 2000, when that became available for public use.

== Principles of operation ==
=== Overview ===
The Decca Navigator System consisted of individual groups of land-based radio transmitters organised into &quot;chains&quot; of three or four stations. Each chain consisted of a master station and three (occasionally two) secondary stations, termed Red, Green and Purple. Ideally, the secondaries would be positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with the master at the centre. The baseline length, that is, the master–secondary distance, was typically .

Each station transmitted a continuous wave signal; comparing the relative phases of the signals from the master and one of the secondaries produced a relative phase measure that was presented on a clock-like display. The phase difference was caused by the relative distance between the stations as seen by the receiver. As the receiver moves these distances change and those changes are represented by the movement of the hands on the displays.

If one selects a particular phase difference, say 30 degrees, and plots all the locations where that phase difference occurs, the result is a set of hyperbolic &quot;lines of position&quot; called a &quot;pattern&quot;. As there were three secondaries there were three patterns, also termed Red, Green and Purple. The patterns were drawn on nautical charts as a set of hyperbolic lines in the appropriate colour.

Navigators determined their location by reading the phase difference from two or more of the patterns from the displays. They could then look at the chart to find where the two closest charted hyperbolas crossed. The accuracy of this measurement was improved by choosing the set of two patterns that resulted in the lines crossing at as close to a right angle as possible.

=== Detailed principles of operation ===
When two stations transmit at the phase-locked frequency, the difference in phase between the two signals is constant along a hyperbolic locus. However, if two stations transmit on the same frequency, it is impossible for the receiver to separate them. Instead, each chain was allocated a nominal frequency, known as 1&quot;f&quot;, and each station in the chain transmitted at a harmonic of this base frequency, as follows:

The frequencies given are those for Chain 5B, known as the English Chain, but all chains used similar frequencies between 70 kHz and 129 kHz.

Decca receivers multiplied the signals received from the Master and each Slave by different values to arrive at a common frequency (least common multiple, LCM) for each Master/Slave pair, as follows:

It was phase comparison at this common frequency that resulted in the hyperbolic lines of position. The interval between two adjacent hyperbolas on which the signals are in phase was called a &quot;lane&quot;. Since the wavelength of the common frequency was small compared with the distance between the Master and Slave stations there were many possible lines of position for a given phase difference, and so a unique position could not be arrived at by this method.

Other receivers, typically for aeronautical applications, divided the transmitted frequencies down to the basic frequency (1&quot;f&quot;) for phase comparison, rather than multiplying them up to the LCM frequency.

=== Lanes and zones ===

Early Decca receivers were fitted with three rotating &quot;Decometers&quot; that indicated the phase difference for each pattern. Each Decometer, which could be read to a resolution of a centilane, drove a second indicator that counted the number of lanes traversed – each 360 degrees of phase difference was one lane traversed. In this way, assuming the point of departure was known, a more or less distinct location could be identified.

The lanes were grouped into &quot;zones&quot;, with 18 green, 24 red, or 30 purple lanes in each zone. This meant that on the baseline (the straight line between the Master and its Slave) the zone width was the same for all three patterns of a given chain. Typical lane and zone widths on the baseline are shown in the table below (for chain 5B):

The lanes were numbered 0 to 23 for red, 30 to 47 for green and 50 to 79 for purple. The zones were labelled A to J, repeating after J. A Decca position coordinate could thus be written: Red I 16.30; Green D 35.80. Later receivers incorporated a microprocessor and displayed a position in latitude and longitude.

=== Multipulse ===
&quot;Multipulse&quot; provided an automatic method of lane and zone identification by using the same phase comparison techniques described above on lower frequency signals.

The nominally continuous wave transmissions were in fact divided into a 20-second cycle, with each station in turn simultaneously transmitting all four Decca frequencies (5&quot;f&quot;, 6&quot;f&quot;, 8&quot;f&quot; and 9&quot;f&quot;) in a phase-coherent relationship for a brief period of 0.45 seconds each cycle. This transmission, known as Multipulse, allowed the receiver to extract the 1&quot;f&quot; frequency and so to identify the lane that the receiver was in (to a resolution of a zone).

As well as transmitting the Decca frequencies of 5&quot;f&quot;, 6&quot;f&quot;, 8&quot;f&quot; and 9&quot;f&quot;, an 8.2&quot;f&quot; signal, known as Orange, was also transmitted. The beat frequency between the 8.0&quot;f&quot; (Red) and 8.2&quot;f&quot; (Orange) signals allowed a 0.2&quot;f&quot; signal to be derived and so resulted in a hyperbolic pattern in which one cycle (360°) of phase difference equates to 5 zones.

Assuming that one&#x27;s position was known to this accuracy, this gave an effectively unique position.

=== Range and accuracy ===
During daylight, ranges of around could be obtained, reducing at night to 200 to , depending on propagation conditions.

The accuracy depended on:
* Width of the lanes
* Angle of cut of the hyperbolic lines of position
* Instrumental errors
* Propagation errors (for example, skywave)

By day these errors could range from a few meters on the baseline up to a nautical mile at the edge of coverage. At night, skywave errors were greater and, on receivers without multipulse capabilities, it was not unusual for the position to jump a lane, sometimes without the navigator knowing.

Although in the days of differential GPS this range and accuracy may appear poor, in its day the Decca system was one of the few, if not the only, position fixing system available to many mariners. Since the need for an accurate position is less when the vessel is further from land, the reduced accuracy at long ranges was not a great problem.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
In 1936 William J. O&#x27;Brien, an engineer, contracted tuberculosis that put his career on hold for a period of two years. During this period he had the idea of position fixing by means of phase comparison of continuous wave transmissions. This was not the first such system, but O&#x27;Brien apparently developed his version without knowledge of the others, and made several advancements in the art that would prove useful. He initially imagined the system being used for aircraft testing, specifically the accurate calculation of ground speed. Some experiments were carried out in California in 1938, selecting frequencies with harmonic &quot;beats&quot; that would allow for station identification in a network of transmitters. Both the U.S. Army and Navy considered the idea too complicated and work ended in 1939.

O’Brien&#x27;s friend, Harvey F. Schwarz, was chief engineer of the Decca Record company in England. In 1939 O’Brien sent him details of the system so it could be put forward to the British military. Initially Robert Watson-Watt reviewed the system but he did not follow it up, deeming it too easily jammed (and likely due to the existing work on the Gee system, being carried out by Watt&#x27;s group). However, in October 1941 the British Admiralty Signal Establishment (ASE) became interested in the system, which was then classified as &quot;Admiralty Outfit QM&quot;. The first marine trials were conducted between Anglesey and the Isle of Man, at frequencies of 305/610 kHz, on 16 September 1942.

Further trials were conducted in the northern Irish Sea in April 1943 at 70/130 kHz. It was decided that the original frequencies were not ideal, and a new system using a 14 kHz inter-signal spacing was selected. This led to the common 5, 6, 8 and 9&quot;f&quot; frequencies, used throughout the life of the Decca system. 7&quot;f&quot; was reserved for a Loran-C-like extension, but never developed. A follow-up test was carried out in the Irish Sea in January 1944 to test a wide variety of upgrades and production equipment. By this time the competing Gee system was known to the Admiralty and the two systems were tested head-to-head under the code names QM and QH. QM was found to have better sea-level range and accuracy, which led to its adoption.

===D-Day landings===

A three-station trial was held in conjunction with a large-scale assault and landing exercise in the Moray Firth in February/March 1944. The success of the trials and the relative ease of use and accuracy of the system resulted in Decca receiving an order for 27 &quot;Admiralty Outfit QM&quot; receivers. The receiver consisted of an electronics unit with two dials and was known to its operators as the &quot;Blue Gasmeter Job&quot;. A Decca chain was set up, consisting of a master station at Chichester and slaves at Swanage and Beachy Head. A fourth decoy transmitter was located in the Thames Estuary as part of the deception that the invasion would be focussed on the Calais area.
21 minesweepers and other vessels were fitted with &quot;Admiralty Outfit QM&quot; and, on 5 June 1944, 17 of these ships used it to accurately navigate across the English Channel and to sweep the minefields in the planned areas. The swept areas were marked with buoys in preparation for the Normandy Landings.

After the initial ship tests, Decca conducted tests in cars, driving in the Kingston By-Pass area to verify receiver accuracy. In the car installation, it was found possible to navigate within an individual traffic lane. The company entertained high hopes that the system could be used in aircraft, to permit much more precise navigation in the critical airspace around airports and urban centres where traffic density was highest.

=== Commercial deployment ===

After the end of World War II the Decca Navigator Co. Ltd. was formed (1945) and the system expanded rapidly, particularly in areas of British influence; at its peak it was deployed in many of the world&#x27;s major shipping areas. More than 15,000 receiving sets were in use aboard ships in 1970. There were 4 chains around England, 1 in Ireland and 2 in Scotland, 12 in Scandinavia (5 each in Norway and Sweden and 1 each in Denmark and Finland), a further 4 elsewhere in northern Europe and 2 in Spain.

Canada was another early user, with branch offices set up in Toronto in 1953. The first chain was installed in southwest Newfoundland in 1956 as part of a joint Canada-US Navy surveying program. This led to commercial deployments the next year in Nova Scotia and an inland system for air traffic in the busy Quebec City-Montreal area. A fourth chain covering eastern Newfoundland was added in 1958. When meetings in Montreal in 1958 led to VOR and DME being selected as the standard aviation navigation systems, the Montreal system was moved eastward to cover the Anticosti Island area of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the western Newfoundland chain was later repositioned to better cover the Cabot Strait. A series of chains was also proposed to cover the Northwest Passage had oil tanker traffic used the area, but this never came to be. Another was briefly set up covering Lake Ontario in 1971 for the International Field Year for the Great Lakes. The last Canadian chain shut down in 1986, after Loran-C became widespread.

In the late 1950s an experimental Decca chain was set up in the United States, in the New York area, to be used for navigating the Vertol 107 helicopters of New York Airways. These helicopters were operating from the principal local airports—Idlewild Airport on Long Island, Newark Airport in New Jersey, LaGuardia Airport in the Borough of Queens, nearer to Manhattan, and a site on the top of the (then) PanAm Building on Park Avenue. Use of Decca was essential because its signals could be received down to sea level, were not subject to the line-of-sight limitations of VOR/DME and did not suffer the slant-range errors that create problems with VOR/DME close to the transmitters. The Decca installations in the New York Airways helicopters included the unique Decca &#x27;roller map&#x27; displays that enabled the pilot to see his or her position at a glance, a concept infeasible with VOR/DME.

This chain installation was considered highly controversial at the time, for political reasons. This led to the U.S. Coast Guard, under instructions from the Treasury Department to which it reported, banning the use of Decca receivers in ships entering New York harbour for fear that the system might create a de facto standard (as it had become in other areas of the world). It also served to protect the marketing interests of the Hoffman Electronics division of ITT, a principal supplier of VOR/DME systems, that Decca might have been poised to usurp.

This situation was exacerbated by the workload problems of the Air Traffic Controllers Association (ATCA), under its executive director Francis McDermott, whose members were forced to use radar data on aircraft positions, relaying those positions by radio to the aircraft from their control locations. An example of the problem, cited by experts, was the collision of a Douglas DC8 and a Lockheed Constellation over Staten Island, New York, that—according to some experts—could have been avoided if the aircraft had been Decca-equipped and could not only have determined their positions more precisely but would not have suffered from the rho-theta position errors inherent in VOR/DME.

Other chains were established in Japan (6 chains); Namibia and South Africa (5 chains); India and Bangladesh (4 chains); North-West Australia (2 chains); the Persian Gulf (1 chain with stations in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and a second chain in the north of the Gulf with stations in Iran) and the Bahamas (1 chain). Four chains were planned for Nigeria but only two were built and these did not enter into public service. Two chains in Vietnam were used during the Vietnam War for helicopter navigation, with limited success.
During the Cold War period, following WWII, the R.A.F. established a confidential chain in Germany. The Master station was in Bad Iburg near Osnabrück and there were two Slaves. The purpose of this chain was to provide accurate air navigation for the corridor between Western Germany and Berlin in the event that a mass evacuation of allied personnel may be required. In order to maintain secrecy, frequencies were changed at irregular intervals.

=== Decca, Racal, and the closedown ===
The headquarters of Decca Navigator were at New Malden, Surrey, just off the Kingston by-pass. There was a Decca School, at Brixham, Devon, where employees were sent on courses from time to time. Racal, the UK weapons and communications company, acquired Decca in 1980. Merging Decca&#x27;s radar assets with their own, Racal began selling off the other portions of the company, including avionics and Decca Navigator.

A significant amount of income from the Decca system was due to the receivers being leased to users, not sold outright. This guaranteed predictable annual income. When the patents on the original technology lapsed in the early 1980s, new receivers were quickly built by a number of companies. In particular, Aktieselskabet Dansk Philips (&#x27;Danish Philips&#x27;, &quot;ap&quot;) introduced receivers that could be purchased outright, and were much smaller and easier to use than the current Decca counterparts. The &quot;ap&quot; versions directly output the longitude and latitude to two decimals (originally in datum ED50 only) instead of using the &quot;deco meter&quot; displays, offering accuracy better than ±9.3 m, much better than the Decca units. This also eliminated the need for the special charts printed with Decca lanes and zones.

Decca sued ap for infringement and, in the ensuing court battle, Decca lost the monopoly. That signalled the beginning of the end for the company. Income dwindled and eventually, the UK Ministry of Transport stepped in, having the lighthouse authorities take responsibility for operating the system in the early 1990s.

A ruling from the European Union forced the UK government to withdraw funding. The general lighthouse authority ceased Decca transmissions at midnight on 31 March 2000. The Irish chain provided by Bórd Iascaigh Mhara continued transmitting until 19 May 2000. Japan continued operating their Hokkaidō chain until March 2001, the last Decca chain in operation.

== Other applications ==

=== Delrac ===
In the immediate post-war era, Decca began studying a long-range system like Decca, but using much lower frequencies to enable reception of skywaves at long distances. In February 1946 the company proposed a system with two main stations located at Shannon Airport in Ireland and Gander International Airport in Newfoundland (today part of Canada). Together, these stations would provide navigation over the main great circle route between London and New York. A third station in Bermuda would provide general ranging information to measure progress along the main track.

Work on this concept continued, and in 1951 a modified version was presented that offered navigation over very wide areas. This was known as Delrac, short for &quot;Decca Long Range Area Cover&quot;. A further development, including features of the General Post Office&#x27;s POPI system, was introduced in 1954, proposing 28 stations that provided worldwide coverage. The system was predicted to offer accuracy at range 95% of the time. Further development was ended in favour of the Dectra system.

=== Dectra ===
In the early 1960s the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA), as part of a wider ICAO effort, began the process of introducing a standard long-range radio navigation system for aviation use. Decca proposed a system that could offer both high accuracy at short ranges and transatlantic navigation with less accuracy, using a single receiver. The system was known as Dectra, short for &quot;Decca Track&quot;.

Unlike the Delrac system, Dectra was essentially the normal Decca Navigator system with the modification of several existing transmitter sites. These were located at the East Newfoundland and Scottish chains, which were equipped with larger antennas and high-power transmitters, broadcasting 20 times as much energy as normal chain stations. Given that the length of the chain baselines did not change, and were relatively short, at long distance the signal offered almost no accuracy. Instead, Dectra operated as a track system; aircraft would navigate by keeping themselves within the signal defined by a particular Decca lane.

The main advantage of Dectra compared to other systems being proposed for the RTCA solution was that it could be used for both medium-range navigation over land, as well as long-range navigation over the Atlantic. In comparison, the VOR/DME system that ultimately won the competition offered navigation over perhaps a 200-mile radius, and could not offer a solution to the long-distance problem. Additionally, as the Decca system provided an X and Y location, as opposed to the angle-and-range VOR/DME, Decca proposed offering it with their Decca Flight Log moving map display to further improve ease of navigation. In spite of these advantages, the RTCA ultimately chose VOR/DME for two primary reasons; VOR offered coverage over about the same range as Decca, about 200 miles, but did so with a single transmitter instead of Decca&#x27;s four, and Decca&#x27;s frequencies proved susceptible to interference from static due to lightning, while VOR&#x27;s higher frequencies were not quite as sensitive.

Decca continued to propose that Dectra be used for the long-range role. In 1967 they installed another transmitter in Iceland to provide ranging along the Scotland-Newfoundland track, with a second proposed to be installed on the Azores. They also installed Dectra receivers with Omnitrac computers and a lightweight version of the Flight Log on a number of commercial airliners, notably a BOAC Vickers VC10. The Omnitrac could take inputs from Decca (and Dectra), Loran-C, VOR/DME, an air data computer and doppler radars and combine them all to produce a latitude/longitude output along with bearing, distance-to-go, bearing and an autopilot coupling. Their efforts to standardize this were eventually abandoned as inertial navigation systems began to be installed for these needs.

===Hi-Fix===
A more accurate system named Hi-Fix was developed using signalling in the 1.6 MHz range. It was used for specialised applications such as precision measurements involved with oil-drilling and by the Royal Navy for detailed mapping and surveying of coasts and harbours. The Hi-Fix equipment was leased for a period with temporary chains established to provide coverage of the area required, Hi-Fix was commercialised by Racal Survey in the early 1980s. An experimental chain was installed with coverage of central London and receivers placed in London buses and other vehicles to demonstrate an early vehicle location and tracking system. Each vehicle would report its location automatically via a conventional VHF two-way radio link, the data added to a voice channel.

Another application was developed by the Bendix Pacific division of Bendix Corporation, with offices in North Hollywood, California, but not deployed: PFNS—Personal Field Navigation System—that would enable individual soldiers to ascertain their geographic position, long before this capability was made possible by the satellite-based GPS (Global Positioning System).

A further application of the Decca system was implemented by the U.S. Navy in the late 1950s and early 1960s for use in the Tongue of the Ocean/Eleuthera Sound area near The Bahamas, separating the islands of Andros and New Providence. The application was for sonar studies made possible by the unique characteristics of the ocean floor.

An interesting characteristic of the Decca VLF signal discovered on BOAC, later British Airways, test flights to Moscow, was that the carrier switching could not be detected even though the carrier could be received with sufficient strength to provide navigation. Such testing, involving civilian aircraft, is quite common and may well not be in the knowledge of a pilot.

The &#x27;low frequency&#x27; signalling of the Decca system also permitted its use on submarines. One &#x27;enhancement&#x27; of the Decca system was to offer the potential of keying the signal, using Morse code, to signal the onset of nuclear war. This option was never taken up by the UK government. Messages were clandestinely sent, however, between Decca stations thereby bypassing international telephone calls, especially in non-UK chains.

<text>Dana Tyrone Rohrabacher ( ; born June 21, 1947) is an American former politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1989 to 2019. A Republican, he represented for the last three terms of his House tenure. Rohrabacher was defeated by Democrat Harley Rouda in 2018. Rohrabacher has expressed strong pro-Russia and pro-Putin opinions which have raised questions about his relationship with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. &quot;Politico&quot; dubbed him as &quot;Putin&#x27;s favorite congressman&quot;.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Dana Tyrone Rohrabacher was born on June 21, 1947, in Coronado, California, the son of Doris M. (née Haring) and Donald Tyler Rohrabacher. Rohrabacher graduated from Palos Verdes High School in Palos Verdes Estates, California, attended Los Angeles Harbor College, and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history at California State University, Long Beach in 1969. He received his master&#x27;s degree in American Studies at the University of Southern California.

While in graduate school and during the early 1970s, Rohrabacher had a side activity as a folk singer. He was also a writer for the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;.

Rohrabacher served as assistant press secretary to Ronald Reagan during his 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns. Rohrabacher then worked as a speechwriter and special assistant to President Reagan from 1981 to 1988. During his tenure at the White House, Rohrabacher played a leading role in the formulation of the Reagan Doctrine.

Rohrabacher left the Reagan administration in 1988 to pursue Dan Lungren&#x27;s recently vacated House seat. With his friend Oliver North&#x27;s fundraising help, Rohrabacher won the Republican primary with a plurality of 35%. He won the general election with 64% of the vote. He twice experienced serious primary competition, in 1992 and 1998. After redistricting, he won a three-candidate primary election in 1992 with a plurality of 48%. In 1998, he won an open primary with 54% of the vote.

==== 2018 ====

In March 2018, CNN reported that Erik Prince, a former intern of Rohrabacher while he was freshman congressman in 1990 and very close ally of Rohrabacher, hosted a fundraiser at Prince&#x27;s Virginia home with expected attendees including Oliver North on March 18, 2018. On October 12, 2018, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Super PAC closely associated with House Speaker Paul Ryan, had passed over Rohrabacher in its initial round of broadcast television advertising across Southern California. Rohrabacher&#x27;s campaign denied this, saying that CLF had spent &quot;about $2.4 million and they have an additional $1 million in media buys scheduled&quot; for Rohrabacher.

Democrat Harley Rouda defeated Rohrabacher on Election Day.

===Tenure===

====Election fraud and conviction====
Rohrabacher was charged with improper use of campaign contributions in connection with a 1995 state assembly election. Rohrabacher provided some of his campaign funds to his campaign manager (and future wife), Rhonda Carmony, to promote a decoy Democratic candidate to draw away votes from another Democratic candidate. Rohrabacher was found guilty and fined $50,000.
====Payment for 30-year-old screenplay====
On November 4, 2005, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Rohrabacher was paid $23,000 for a 30-year-old screen play he had written. At issue was whether the producer paid him for the screenplay or for introductions to congressional and federal officials. Rohrabacher said that the introductions were made in good faith, were nothing that was not done regularly for legitimate causes, and that the introductions had only become an issue because of Joseph Medawar&#x27;s alleged misdeeds. In May 2006, Rohrabacher announced through his press secretary that he would return the $23,000 (~$ in ). The decision was made public shortly before Medawar took responsibility in a United States District Court for bilking $3.4 million from about 50 investors.

====2011 visit to Iraq====
During a trip to Iraq in June 2011, Rohrabacher said that when Iraq becomes a wealthy nation, it should pay back the US for all the money it had spent since the Iraq invasion. Rohrabacher also commented that he would be holding a hearing with the Sub-Committee on Oversight and Investigations into whether Iraq committed &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; during an attack on Camp Ashraf in April 2011. The incident left 34 residents killed and over 300 wounded. The delegation was denied access to the camp by Iraqi government, citing their sovereignty. Rohrabacher&#x27;s delegation was subsequently asked to leave the country.

====2012 FBI warning====
Rohrabacher was warned in 2012 in a secure room at the Capitol building by an agent from the FBI that Russian spies may have been trying to recruit him to act on Russia&#x27;s behalf as an &quot;agent of influence&quot;, after he met with a member of the Russian foreign ministry privately in Moscow. Following the ISIS terrorist attacks in Tehran on June 7, 2017, in which 17 innocent civilians were killed, he suggested that the attack could be viewed as &#x27;a good thing&#x27;, and surmised that President Trump might have been behind the coordination of this terrorist attack. An article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; suggested that there was serious concern in the State Department of ties between Rohrabacher and the Russian government.

====Jack Wu====
In June 2015, Rohrabacher released a statement accusing former treasurer of his reelection committee, Jack Wu, of embezzling more than $170,000 from his campaign. Rohrabacher&#x27;s attorney, Charles H. Bell Jr., stated that the congressman had filed criminal charges against Wu with the Orange County district attorney and state attorney general.

====2016 consideration for Secretary of State====
Following the election of Donald Trump in 2016, Rohrabacher was on the shortlist for Secretary of State along with Mitt Romney and eventual pick Rex Tillerson.

Rohrabacher chaired the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee of the House Science Committee from 1997 until January 2005; he received a two-year waiver to serve beyond the six-year term limit.

As a senior member of the International Relations Committee, Rohrabacher led the effort to deny Most Favored Nation trading status to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, citing that nation&#x27;s dismal human rights record and opposition to democracy. His subcommittee assignments were East Asia and Pacific, and Middle East and South Asia.

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Cannabis Caucus
* Congressional Human Rights Caucus
* United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus

==Foreign and security policy positions==
In foreign policy, Rohrabacher supported withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan, called for Trump to punish Turkish President Erdoğan on embassy violence, sided with Russia in the Russia–Georgia war, and gave a qualified defense of the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

===Russia===
Rohrabacher has expressed strong pro-Russia and pro-Putin opinions&lt;ref name=&quot;Tau_Nicholas_Hughes_9/15/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which have raised questions about his relationship with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. &quot;Politico&quot; and others have dubbed him &quot;Putin&#x27;s favorite congressman&quot;.

Early in Rohrabacher&#x27;s congressional career in 1990 or 1991, KGB agent and deputy mayor of Saint Petersburg Vladimir Putin and two other Russians entered Rohrabacher&#x27;s congressional office in Washington, D.C. In a 2013 interview, Rohrabacher asserted that he and Putin later became close friends.

According to Erik Prince, Prince, as an intern on Rohrabacher&#x27;s staff, travelled around the world on fact finding missions to support Rohrabacher&#x27;s interests.

Rohrabacher called the Russian banker Aleksandr Torshin, a Putin ally, &quot;sort of the conservatives&#x27; favorite Russian&quot;.

On September 8, 2008, at a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee meeting, Rohrabacher argued that the Georgians had initiated a recent military confrontation in the ongoing Russia–Georgia war.

In 2012, the FBI warned Rohrabacher that his support for Russia&#x27;s interests was allowing Russia to cultivate him for its purposes.

In February 2013, Rohrabacher gave a speech urging the right to self-determination for the Baloch people in Pakistan at an UNPO conference in London.

In April 2014, he tweeted that &quot;If majority of people legally residing in Alaska want to be part of Russia then it&#x27;s OK with me.&quot;

In April 2016, Rohrabacher and a member of his staff, Paul Behrends, traveled to Russia and returned with Yuri Chaika&#x27;s confidential talking points memo about incriminating information on Democratic donors. The talking points paper used at the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016 by Natalia Veselnitskaya was very similar to the document Rohrabacher had obtained from Chaika in April.

Rohrabacher is known for his longtime friendship with Putin and for his defense of &quot;the Russian point of view&quot;. On June 15, 2016, then-House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told a group of Republicans, &quot;&#x27;There&#x27;s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump. Swear to God&#x27;&quot;. Then-House Speaker Paul Ryan ended the conversation by saying &quot;&#x27;No leaks. This is how we know we&#x27;re a real family here&#x27;&quot;. The Republicans present were sworn to secrecy. Brendan Buck, counselor to Paul Ryan, initially denied these reports, but was then told that &quot;The Washington Post&quot; had a recording. After the recording was leaked by the &quot;Post&quot; in May 2017, McCarthy said the comment was intended as a joke.

Around that time, Rohrabacher planned—in his capacity as chair of the Europe subcommittee—to hold a hearing on the Magnitsky Act, which bars certain Russian officials from entering the United States or holding any financial assets in American banks. Rohrabacher reportedly wanted Bill Browder, the American-born investor who had lobbied for the act&#x27;s passage after what he claims was the illegal appropriation of his hedge fund&#x27;s assets and the subsequent murder of his Russian lawyer, to testify. Rohrabacher planned to subject him to what was described as a &quot;show trial&quot;. In addition to questioning Browder closely and skeptically about his claims, Rohrabacher intended to show a feature-length documentary film critical of the Magnitsky claims. Another scheduled witness was Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, a longtime lobbyist against the Magnitsky Act who attended the June 9 Trump Tower meeting. In July 2017, Browder testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that persons supporting the interests of foreign governments or acting on their behalf, especially Russia, must comply with Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) requirements, and that no one behind the screening of the Andrei Nekrasov film had met the disclosure filings under FARA.

When Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce learned of Rohrabacher&#x27;s plans, he canceled the hearing and forbade Rohrabacher from showing the film. In its stead, he held a full committee hearing on U.S.–Russia relations at which Rohrabacher was allowed to submit some of the pro-Russian claims into evidence. The film was ultimately shown at the Newseum, and an intern in Rohrabacher&#x27;s office who later worked for the Trump transition team sent emails promoting the film from the subcommittee offices.

After Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Rohrabacher defended his approach to improving Russian–American relations. He had previously met at least twice with Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet spy &quot;who met with President Trump&#x27;s son, son-in-law and campaign manager in June 2016&quot;, to discuss Russian sanctions.

In a May 2017 interview with CNN, Rohrabacher said, &quot;&#x27;We have a huge double standard with Russia when it comes to prisoners and other things&#x27;&quot;. Rohrabacher added that interference by the Russian intelligence services&#x27; in the 2016 U.S. election was the same as the National Security Agency (NSA) bugging German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s phone.

In July 2017, Rohrabacher voted to impose sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

On 16 August 2017, Rohrabacher visited Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and told him that Trump would pardon him on the condition that he would agree to say that Russia was not involved in the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leaks. At his extradition hearings in 2020, Assange&#x27;s defense team alleged in court that this offer was made &quot;on instructions from the president&quot;. Trump and Rohrabacher subsequently said they had never spoken about the offer, and Rohrabacher said he had made the offer on his own initiative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowcott_Borger_19/2/2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mai-Duc_17/8/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs placed restrictions on Rohrabacher&#x27;s ability to use committee money to pay for foreign travel due to concerns over his interest in Russia.

On November 21, 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Rohrabacher had come under scrutiny from special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee for his close ties to the Kremlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fandos_11/21/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Fox Business Channel on August 24, 2018, Rohrabacher attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions because Sessions had refused to fire Robert Mueller and shut down the Russia collusion investigation. He said: &quot;&#x27;The fact that Jeff Sessions has not quit is a disloyalty to this president and to the country, the fact is, if he disagrees with what the president wants him to do, he should resign&#x27;&quot;.

In February 2020, Rohrabacher told Yahoo News that his goal during his 2017 meeting with Julian Assange was to find evidence for a widely debunked conspiracy theory that WikiLeaks&#x27; real source was not Russian intelligence agents for the DNC emails but former DNC staffer Seth Rich. Stephanie Grisham, a White House spokesperson for President Trump, stated that Trump barely knew Rohrabacher and had not spoken with Rohrabacher &quot;&#x27;on this subject or almost any subject&#x27;&quot;.

On February 19, 2020, Edward Fitzgerald, Julian Assange&#x27;s attorney, asserted at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court in London that Rohrabacher had been sent on behalf of President Trump in August 2017 to offer Assange a pardon from Trump if Assange could release material to show that Russian intelligence was not involved in the 2016 United States election interference.

===Terrorism===
In 2006, Rohrabacher chaired the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the U.S. House Committee on International Relations, which investigated whether the Oklahoma City bombers had assistance from foreign sources; the committee determined there was no conclusive evidence of a foreign connection. In the 113th Congress, Rohrabacher was chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats.

Speaking about Islam, he said during a hearing in April 2013, &quot;I hope we all work together against a religion that will motivate people to murder children and other threats to us as a civilization.&quot;

In the wake of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Rohrabacher put out a press release stating that he felt &quot;outrage&quot; and a &quot;renewed commitment to defeat and destroy the radical Islamic movement that fosters such mayhem.&quot; He stressed that Americans must &quot;be sure not to label all Muslims as terrorist murderers.&quot; Rohrabacher met Seddique Mateen, the father of the shooter, in 2014 during routine meetings with constituents. He called Mateen an &quot;estranged individual.&quot;

In a statement to clarify his position, Rohrabacher wrote that he opposes &quot;the use of force against unarmed civilians no matter who is the victim or who is doing the killing&quot; but he is also against &quot;Iran&#x27;s vicious Mullah monarchy&quot; and &quot;when it comes to Sunni terrorists or Shiite terrorists, I prefer them to target each other rather than any other victims, especially innocent civilians and Americans.&quot; He added that it will &quot;require support for those proud Iranians who want to win their freedom and heritage from Mullahs and are willing to fight for it. That does not include Isis, but it may include a lot of Iranians who see blowing up Khomeini&#x27;s mausoleum as an expression of freedom from the yolk [sic] of Islamic terror.&quot;

===Defense of interrogation techniques and extraordinary rendition===
On April 17, 2007, during a House hearing on trans-Atlantic relations, Rohrabacher defended the Bush administration&#x27;s program of extraordinary rendition. He said that the unfair treatment of one innocent suspect is an acceptable &quot;unfortunate consequence&quot; of holding others who would otherwise be free to commit terror acts. After he received boos and groans from the gallery, Rohrabacher responded, &quot;Well, I hope it&#x27;s your families, I hope it&#x27;s your families that suffer the consequences,&quot; and &quot;I hope it&#x27;s your family members that die.&quot; Rohrabacher was subsequently interrupted by protesters wearing orange jumpsuits who were removed from the gallery. For his comment that imprisoning and torturing one innocent person was a fair price to pay for locking up 50 terrorists who would &quot;go out and plant a bomb and kill 20,000 people&quot;, on April 25 Rohrabacher was named &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot;.

===Afghanistan===
Rohrabacher&#x27;s interest in Afghanistan extends back at least to the late 1980s, before his time in office, when he entered the country in the company of Afghan mujahideen fighters who were fighting Soviet occupation forces. Reportedly, these fighters &quot;actually engaged Soviet troops in combat near the city of Jalalabad during the two months Rohrabacher was with them.&quot; In the years after the Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989), Rohrabacher said his &quot;passion&quot; was to bring back the country&#x27;s exiled king, Muhammad Zahir Shah.

In 2003, Rohrabacher defended the new Afghan constitution against those who saw in it mainly empowerment of warlords, saying:

Rohrabacher has since become a proponent of withdrawing from Afghanistan. He protested against the troop build-up in Afghanistan by President Obama, saying &quot;If the Taliban is going is be defeated, it&#x27;s got to be by the Afghan people themselves, not by sending more U.S. troops, which could actually be counterproductive.&quot; When Congressman Jim McGovern offered an amendment in 2011 requiring the Pentagon to draw up an exit plan from Afghanistan, Rohrabacher was just one of six Republicans to sign on. Rohrabacher voted for McGovern&#x27;s Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, requiring an exit plan from Afghanistan. The bill failed by a 204–215 margin.

Rohrabacher was against former President Obama&#x27;s gradual drawdown of troops, instead supporting a full withdrawal. Saying &quot;If we&#x27;re going to leave, we should leave.&quot; Rohrabacher has said that &quot;The centralized system of government foisted upon the Afghan people is not going to hold after we leave.&quot; And &quot;So let&#x27;s quit prolonging the agony and inevitable. Karzai&#x27;s regime is corrupt and non representative of Afghanistan&#x27;s tribal culture. This failed strategy is not worth one more drop of American blood. Under the current strategy, our military presence alienates more Afghans that it pacifies. So if you&#x27;re going to pull the plug, then we need to get the hell out now.&quot; Rohrabacher has repeatedly raised high-level concerns in the US Congress and Washington, D.C., about the significant corruption in Afghanistan, including the Kabul Bank scandal, where hundreds of millions of U.S. taxpayers&#x27; dollars allegedly disappeared in a short period of time at the apparent hands of close Karzai family members, including brothers Mahmoud Karzai (a.k.a. Mahmood Karzai) and Ahmed Wali Karzai. Rohrabacher worked to bring attention to the systemic corruption in the Karzai government and cut U.S. taxpayers&#x27; funding for these wasteful projects and programs, involving corruption within the Hamid Karzai government.

In April 2012, CNN reported that &quot;A top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee was asked by the State Department not to go to Afghanistan because President Hamid Karzai objected to the visit. ... Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, told Security Clearance he was readying to travel with five other Republicans from Dubai to Afghanistan&#x27;s capital, Kabul, when the State Department requested he stay behind.&quot;

===Bosnia and Kosovo independence===

Rohrabacher was opposed to the involvement of American ground troops in the Yugoslav Wars. He advocated for the direct bombing of the military on Yugoslav soil, criticizing the ineffectiveness of western forces against the Bosnian Serbs. (NATO was limited to small fixed attacks, as these Serbs penetrated UN safe areas and attacked Bosniak forces.) Rohrabacher said they &quot;should bomb Serbia&#x27;s military infrastructure, in Serbia – get that, in Serbia – rather than dropping a couple of duds on tents, which only proves the West&#x27;s gutlessness, and emboldens Serbian cutthroats.&quot; Rohrabacher considered the events in Bosnia to constitute genocide. In 1995, Rohrabacher personally visited Sarajevo in Bosnia, criticizing the devastation Serb forces inflicted on the city, saying &quot;This is a loss to all mankind, not just to the people of Sarajevo.&quot; He also encountered vagabond children asking for money.

In 2001, the leader of the Albanian American Civic League ethnic lobby group, Joseph J. DioGuardi, praised Rohrabacher for his support to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a militia that was once labeled by Bill Clinton&#x27;s special envoy to the Balkans Robert Gelbard as a terrorist organization, saying &quot;He was the first member of Congress to insist that the United States arm the Kosova Liberation Army, and one of the few members who to this day publicly supports the independence of Kosova.&quot; Also in 2001, Rohrabacher gave a speech in support of American equipping the KLA with weaponry, comparing it to French support of America in the Revolutionary War, saying &quot;Based on our own experience, the Kosova Liberation Army should have been armed. ... If the U.S. had armed the KLA in 1998, we would not be where we are today. The &#x27;freedom fighters&#x27; would have secured their freedom and Kosova would be independent.&quot;

=== China ===
After a reconnaissance flight over the Spratly Islands in 1998, Rohrabacher said, &quot;We can&#x27;t ignore this bullying by the Communist Chinese in the Spratlys. The presence of the Chinese military troops...is not only a concern of the Philippines. It is also a concern of the U.S. and other democratic countries in the world.&quot;

In July 1999, Rohrabacher led the House floor in opposition to legislation normalizing trade ties between the United States and China. The following year, as the House weighed another China trade bill, Rohrabacher said the trade bill was a giveaway to a select number of American billionaires and the Beijing regime, adding that President Bill Clinton could call &quot;communist China &#x27;our strategic partner&#x27; until his face turns blue, but it won&#x27;t make them any less red.&quot;

In 2011 interviews, Rohrabacher described the Chinese government under the leadership of Hu Jintao as &quot;a gangster regime that murders its own people&quot; and described the Chinese government as Nazis.

In December 2016, after President-elect Trump had a phone call with President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen, Rohrabacher said the call had &quot;showed the dictators in Beijing that he&#x27;s not a pushover&quot; and that China &quot;has had an enormously aggressive foreign policy&quot;.

====Organ harvesting in China====

In 2012 Rohrabacher stated,

and

===Iraq War===
Rohrabacher voted in support of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq in 2002, a position that he later said was &quot;a mistake&quot;.

===Iran===
In August 2012, Rohrabacher noted on his official website that he had written a letter addressed to the U.S. State Department, noting his support of U.S. sponsorship of separatist movements in Iran. This elicited criticism from the Iranian-American community, which included challenging Rohrabacher&#x27;s understanding of the historical background alluded to in his letter to the Department of State.

In June 2017, a day after an ISIL attack in Tehran, during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Rohrabacher stated: &quot;Isn&#x27;t it a good thing for us to have the United States finally backing up Sunnis who will attack Hezbollah and the Shiite threat to us, isn&#x27;t that a good thing?&quot; This comment was strongly criticized by the National Iranian American Council, which wrote, &quot;Rohrabacher has a long history of bizarre and offensive statements on Iran, but his callousness toward the Iranian victims of ISIS terror might be his most callous and extreme thus far.&quot;

Rohrabacher supported removing the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations; it was included on the list from 1997 to 2012.

===Aid to Pakistan===
In May 2011, in the wake of Osama Bin Laden&#x27;s death, Rohrabacher introduced a bill to stop aid to Pakistan, stating that members of the government and of Pakistan&#x27;s security force, the ISI, were either sheltering Bin Laden or completely incompetent. &quot;We can no longer afford this foolishness. ... The time has come for us to stop subsidizing those who actively oppose us. Pakistan has shown itself not to be America&#x27;s ally.&quot; Rohrabacher also demanded the return of the US helicopter that crashed in the operation to kill Bin Laden, stating &quot;If this is not done immediately, it is probable, given Pakistan&#x27;s history, that our technology has already found its way into the hands of the Communist Chinese military that is buying, building, and stealing the necessary military technology to challenge the United States.&quot;

In June 2017, while speaking to Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Tina Kaidanow, Rohrabacher said, &quot;We need to go on the record here, in this part of our government, to say that we&#x27;re not going to be providing weapons systems to Pakistan that we&#x27;re afraid are going to shoot down our own people. And we know they&#x27;re engaged in terrorism.&quot;

===Support for Mohiuddin Ahmed===
In 2007, Rohrabacher supported Mohiuddin Ahmed, a detainee in the U.S., who was said to be involved in an attempted coup in Bangladesh, during which several people were murdered. He was convicted of the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first President of Bangladesh. Bangladesh&#x27;s extradition request was halted as Rohrabacher voiced concern about his legal rights, saying that he should be sent somewhere with no death penalty. His support was applauded by both Amnesty International and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Mohiuddin Ahmed was found guilty of being a participant in the assassinations and was executed on January 28, 2010.

===Taiwan===

After President-elect Donald Trump answered a congratulatory phone call from democratically elected President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen on December 2, 2016, Rohrabacher said Trump&#x27;s phone call with Taiwan&#x27;s president was &quot;terrific&quot; because of the diplomatic warning it sent to China. &quot;He showed the dictators in Beijing that he&#x27;s not a pushover.&quot; He emphasized, &quot;China has had an enormously aggressive foreign policy and by him actually going to Taiwan, he&#x27;s showing the people in Beijing that they cannot have this aggressive foreign policy and expect to be treated just the same by an American president.&quot;

===Ukraine===
Rohrabacher gave a &quot;qualified defense&quot; of the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014. On March 6, 2014, he was one of 23 members of the House of Representatives to vote against a $1 billion loan guarantee to support the new government of Ukraine. On March 11, 2014, Rohrabacher voted &quot;present&quot;, the only member to do so, on a resolution condemning Russian military actions in Ukraine; the resolution passed 402-7. Commenting on the issue, he stated, &quot;Starting with our own American Revolution, groups of people have declared themselves, rightfully, to be under a different government or a government of their choosing. People forget that&#x27;s what our Declaration of Independence is all about.&quot; He also said, &quot;The sanctions are an abomination of hypocrisy. This is ridiculous: What we were doing with the violence and military action we took to secure the Kosovars&#x27; right to self-determination was far more destructive and had far more loss of life than what Putin&#x27;s done trying to ensure the people of Crimea are not cut off from what they would choose as their destiny with Russia.&quot;

===Uzbekistan===
During a US Congressional delegation&#x27;s visit to Uzbekistan in February 2013, Rohrabacher made several controversial statements. The chief among those statements was that the United States should treat Uzbekistan like Saudi Arabia by disregarding the former&#x27;s human rights abuses in achieving America&#x27;s national interests, particularly in selling armaments and drones to Uzbekistan.

===North Macedonia===
In 2017, in an interview for an Albanian TV channel Vizion Plus Rohrabacher suggested that Macedonia &quot;is not a country&quot; and that the &quot;Kosovars and Albanians from Macedonia should be part of Kosovo and the rest of Macedonia should be part of Bulgaria or any other country to which they believe they are related&quot;, which provoked a response from the Macedonian foreign ministry which accused him of inflaming &quot;nationalistic rhetoric&quot;.

=== Turkey ===
In the wake of the clashes at the Turkish Ambassador&#x27;s Residence in May 2017, Rohrabacher called Donald Trump to never invite Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan again to the United States, and to bar Americans from purchasing Turkish government debt.

=== Eritrea ===
In August 2017, Rohrabacher proposed amending the Department of Defense budget whereby the United States would establish military ties with Eritrea. Rohrabacher suggested that the two countries should cooperate in fighting the War on Terror, curbing Iranian influence in the Yemeni Civil War, and securing the Red Sea region. At the time of Rohrabacher&#x27;s proposal, Eritrea was subject to international sanctions due to its alleged support of Al-Shabaab in Somalia, and to U.S. sanctions against the Eritrean Navy following an alleged shipment of North Korean military hardware to Eritrea.

=== Julian Assange ===
In August 2017, Rohrabacher attended a meeting in London with Julian Assange organized and attended by right-wing political activist Charles C. Johnson. Rohrabacher said that the discussion was about the possibility of a presidential pardon in exchange for Assange supplying information on the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee, which were published by WikiLeaks before the 2016 presidential election. In October 2017, Rohrabacher and Johnson met with Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) to discuss Assange supplying information about the source of leaked emails. However, Assange responded to news accounts of the meeting, tweeting, &quot;WikiLeaks never has and never will reveal a source. Offers have been made to me—not the other way around. I do not speak to the public through third parties.&quot;

===Other foreign policy===

In March 2005, Rohrabacher introduced HR 1061, the American Property Claims Against Ethiopia Act, which would &quot;prohibit United States assistance to the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia until the Ethiopian government returns all property of United States citizens&quot;. The bill was introduced by Rohrabacher at the behest of Gebremedhin Berhane, a former Eritrean national and friend of the Rohrabacher family, after his business was expropriated by the Ethiopian government.

On March 7, 2006, Rohrabacher introduced HR 4895, an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, &quot;to limit the provision of the United States military assistance and the sale, transfer, or licensing of United States military equipment or technology to Ethiopia&quot;.

During an appearance on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Show&quot;, Rohrabacher accused Barack Obama of allowing violence in Iran to get out of hand because he did not speak forcefully enough against the country&#x27;s leadership. He also said that Gorbachev tore down the Berlin Wall because Reagan told him to (&quot;Tear down this wall&quot;).

In early 2010, he went to Honduras to commend the election of the new president. His entourage included a group of Californian property investors and businessmen, a dealer in rare coins, and CEOs from San Diego biofuels corporation (which is headed by a family friend).

Rohrabacher voted to repeal Obamacare, disputed evidence of man-made global warming, was a staunch opponent of illegal immigration, and favored the legalization of cannabis.

Rohrabacher had drawn public criticism for some of his positions. His controversial statements included the conspiracy theory, first promoted by the politically-biased conspiracy theory website InfoWars, that Democrats secretly organized the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville to provoke violence by the alt-right to discredit President Trump.

He had been a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.

===National Endowment for the Arts===
In 1990, Rohrabacher opposed the National Endowment of the Arts and joined Mel Hancock in demanding its abolition. In a February letter to other members of Congress, Rohrabacher sent a photograph by artist and AIDS activist David Wojnarowicz.

In April, liberal constitutional rights group People for the American Way announced its intent to launch a newspaper advert campaign against Rohrabacher. Western vice president of the organization Michael Hudson stated, &quot;&#x27;Americans overwhelmingly reject censorship of the arts and support the NEA&#x27;&quot;. Rohrabacher welcomed the announcement, stating that his constituents &quot;don&#x27;t want federal dollars to go to sacrilegious or obscene art&#x27;&quot; and that it would help voters to understand the issue. Explaining his position, Rohrabacher stated that he did not believe &quot;&#x27;anyone should be prevented from seeing what they want to see or painting what they want to paint...on their own time and their own dime. But if you get a government subsidy, that&#x27;s another question&#x27;&quot;.

In October, the House passed a bill to reauthorize funds for the NEA with the directive that the organization could not fund obscene art. Rohrabacher introduced an amendment that would include specific guidelines on the kind of art projects that could not be funded, such as works that were sexually explicit or denigrated the American flag or religions; the amendment was rejected by a vote of 249-175. Rohrabacher stated his amendment was supposed to ensure that the federal government was &quot;&quot;not subsidizing obscenity, child pornography, attacks on religion, desecration of the American flag or any other of the outrages we have seen in the past&#x27;&quot;. By the time the House passed the bill, Rohrabacher had become known as &quot; the House&#x27;s most outspoken critic of the NEA&quot;.

===Race quotas===
In October 1991, Rohrabacher wrote a letter to the civil rights division of the Education Department after seven Filipino students complained to the media that they were denied admission to the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Rohrabacher requested the department conduct a federal civil rights investigation on what seemed to be &quot;a quota based upon race that illegally discriminates against Filipino-Americans and possibly applicants of other races&quot;. UCSD vice chancellor for undergraduate affairs Joseph Watson refuted the letter, dismissing Rohrabacher as &quot;wrong when he says that 40% of admissions are reserved for certain races&quot;. He stated that the school ranks all applicants using a grade-based formula. Watson charged Rohrabacher with fanning hysteria over discrimination: &quot;The Rohrabacher approach is to play to public fears that something fishy is going on. We don&#x27;t want anyone to feel we&#x27;re not giving everyone a fair and equitable review that can stand up to any scrutiny.&quot;

===Impeachment of Bill Clinton===

In November 1997, Rohrabacher was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Rohrabacher voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Rohrabacher voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the majority of votes needed to be adopted).

===Firearms===
In 2018, Sacha Baron Cohen&#x27;s television program &quot;Who Is America?&quot; premiered, showing Rohrabacher supporting a hoax &quot;kinderguardians program&quot; which supported training toddlers with firearms. Rohrabacher claims that he never spoke to Cohen, that he was taken out of context, and that he spoke, &quot;broadly of making sure young people could get training in self-defense&quot;.

===Global warming===
Rohrabacher doubts the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by humans. During a congressional hearing on climate change on February 8, 2007, Rohrabacher mused that previous warming cycles may have been caused by carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by &quot;dinosaur flatulence&quot;: &quot;Politico&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that on May 25, 2011, Rohrabacher expressed further skepticism regarding the existence of man-made global warming and suggested that, if global warming is an issue, a possible solution could be clear-cutting rain forests, and replanting. These reports sparked strong criticism by some scientists, including Oliver Phillips, a geography professor at the University of Leeds. They noted the consensus that intact forests act as net absorbers of carbon, reducing global warming.

Rohrabacher does not believe that global warming is a problem. At a town hall meeting with the Newport Mesa Tea Party in August 2013, Rohrabacher said &quot;global warming is a total fraud&quot; and part of a &quot;game plan&quot; by liberals to &quot;create global government&quot;.

===Healthcare===
On May 4, 2017, Rohrabacher voted in favor of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and passing the American Health Care Act. During his 2018 re-election campaign, Rohrabacher pledged to protect protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. Rohrabacher voted for his party&#x27;s Obamacare replacement bill that included state waivers from rules that prohibit charging higher prices to people with pre-existing conditions.

===Immigration===
Rohrabacher was an advocate for the state of California&#x27;s Proposition 187, which prohibited illegal immigrants from acquiring government services. In 2004, he sponsored an amendment that would have prohibited federal reimbursement of hospital-provided emergency care and certain transportation services to undocumented aliens unless the hospital provided information about the aliens&#x27; citizenship, immigration status, financial data, and employer to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Aliens who were in the country illegally would receive reimbursement only after they were deported. The proposed bill was defeated, 331–88.

In 2005, Rohrabacher opined that the Republican Party was split on the issue of immigration: &quot;There are those of us who identify with the national wing and patriotic wing of the party who have always been adamant on the illegal immigration issues. And, on the other side, you have those people who believe in the business and global marketplace concept. So, you have a party with two different views on one of the major issues of the day.&quot;

In early 2008, Rohrabacher endorsed Mitt Romney in the Republican presidential primary, citing his positions on stemming illegal immigration and criticizing John McCain. About McCain, he said: &quot;He&#x27;s been the enemy of those of us who have stemmed the flow of illegals into our country, whereas Romney has made some very tough commitments.&quot;

In 2011, Rohrabacher proposed the bill H.R. 787 known as the &quot;No Social Security for Illegal Immigrants Act of 2011&quot;. The bill: &quot;Amends title II of the Social Security Act to exclude from creditable wages and self-employment income any wages earned for services by aliens performed in the United States, and self-employment income derived from a trade or business conducted in the United States, while the alien was not authorized to be so employed or to perform a function or service in such a trade or business.&quot;

In 2013, an 18-year-old student visited Rohrabacher&#x27;s office to discuss immigration reform. At some point their conversation became disagreeable, and the student said the congressman yelled at her: &quot;I hate illegals!&quot; He also allegedly threatened to deport her family. Rohrabacher&#x27;s spokesperson has disputed both statements, averring that it was actually the student who started the confrontation by yelling at the spokesperson and telling her to &quot;butt out&quot;.

In September 2017, Rohrabacher supported the Trump administration&#x27;s rescinding of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, saying that those &quot;in Congress must work to prevent such cynical loopholes from being created again by executive fiat&quot; despite their possible empathy for the immigrants.

The organization NumbersUSA has given Rep. Rohrabacher an A+ rating in accordance to his stance on illegal immigration.

===LGBT issues===
Rohrabacher has drawn controversy over his views on LGBT rights. He opposed same-sex marriage and endorsed Proposition 8, the ballot initiative in 2008 that would have prohibited same-sex marriage in California, during a debate at Orange Coast College, stating he &quot;would suggest not changing the definition of marriage in our society to make a small number of people feel more comfortable&quot;.

Rohrabacher voted in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment in both 2004 and 2006, a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would have defined marriage as between a man and a woman and forbade states from recognizing or legalizing same-sex marriage. After the Supreme Court issued its decision in &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; in 2013, that legalized same-sex marriage in California, Rohrabacher criticized the decision, stating that the decision was &quot;not based on the merits of the issue but on a technicality&quot;. However, Rohrabacher has appeared to have endorsed the idea of leaving marriage to religious institutions only, stating on Twitter that churches should be solely responsible for conducting marriages but that the government should only recognize them.

In May 2018, Rohrabacher provoked severe criticism after telling a meeting of the Orange County Association of Realtors that homeowners &quot;should be able to make a decision not to sell their home to someone (if) they don&#x27;t agree with their lifestyle.&quot; Though the statement did not explicitly refer to LGBT people, it was widely interpreted as such. LGBT groups denounced Rohrabacher for the remarks, and the National Association of Realtors, which had previously donated to Rohrabacher&#x27;s re-election campaigns, condemned Rohrabacher, halted all of its financial support for him and repudiated its past donations to him. After Rohrabacher&#x27;s constituents unseated him in favor of Harley Rouda, &quot;The Advocate&quot; praised the results and condemned Rohrabacher.

Despite criticism from the LGBT community later in his career, early in his political career, Rohrabacher supported a proposal by gays to move to a rural California county and take leadership roles. Rohrabacher&#x27;s &quot;California Libertarian Alliance endorsed the project. &#x27;Your main resources are the freedom you offer plus the environment you are locating in,&#x27; Dana Rohrabacher, one of the libertarian group’s founders and later speechwriter to then-President Reagan, wrote in a letter to GLF. &#x27;The economic goods are perfect for some kind of a combination ski gambling resort.&#x27;&quot; 

===Cannabis===

Rohrabacher supported the legalization of cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes. He spoke against the policy of cannabis prohibition as early as May 2013, calling it a &quot;colossal failure&quot; in an op-ed penned for the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;. He further outlined his views in a May 2014 op-ed in &quot;National Review&quot;, arguing that the prohibition of cannabis has incurred a number of undesirable costs upon free society, such as an increase in gang violence, soaring incarceration rates, unconstitutional seizure of private property through civil forfeiture, corruption and militarization of police forces, and negative impacts on minority communities and relationships with Latin-American countries. Rohrabacher has called on fellow Republicans to reconsider their stance towards cannabis, citing core conservative principles such as limited government, individual liberty, respect for the Tenth Amendment, and respect for the doctor–patient relationship that Rohrabacher says lend support to loosening current laws. He also notes conservative leaders such as Milton Friedman, William F. Buckley, and Grover Norquist that have espoused similar drug policy views. In April 2016, Rohrabacher announced his endorsement of California&#x27;s Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act.

Rohrabacher is a strong proponent of states&#x27; rights when it comes to cannabis policy. He has introduced the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment for a number of years beginning in 2003, to prohibit the Justice Department from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical cannabis laws. The amendment passed the House for the first time in May 2014, becoming law in December 2014 as part of an omnibus spending bill. Additional legislation that Rohrabacher has introduced includes the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act and the Veterans Equal Access Act. Rohrabacher has called on the DEA / DOJ to remove cannabis from the list of Schedule I drugs. In February 2017, Rohrabacher co-founded the Congressional Cannabis Caucus – along with Reps. Don Young (R–AK), Jared Polis (D–CO), and Earl Blumenauer (D–OR) – to help advance policy change regarding cannabis at the federal level. Rohrabacher earned an &quot;A+&quot; rating from NORML for his voting record regarding cannabis-related matters.

===Patent reform===
Rohrabacher was an opponent of the America Invents Act, a bill that is attempting to change the current Patent System. Rohrabacher opposes changing from a &quot;first to invent system&quot; to a &quot;first to file system&quot; saying it &quot;hurts the little guy&quot;. Rohrabacher commented: &quot;Make no mistake, &#x27;first to file&#x27; weakens patent protection. It is likely to make vulnerable individual and small inventors, who don&#x27;t have an army of lawyers on retainer. These &#x27;little guys&#x27; have been the lifeblood of American progress and competitiveness for more than 200 years. Our system was designed to protect individual rights, and it has worked for all – not just the corporate elite.&quot; Rohrabacher went on to comment in a &quot;Politico&quot; op-ed: &quot;We&#x27;re told this is necessary to harmonize with Japanese and European patent law. But those systems were established by elitists and economic shoguns interested in corporate power, not individual rights.&quot;

===Space===
Rohrabacher was chairman of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics from 1997 to January 2005 and has been active on space-related issues. In 2000, Space.com described Rohrabacher as &quot;a strident advocate for supremacy in space, a philosophy shaped along a winding road from libertarian activist to White House speech writer in the Reagan administration&quot;. In 2007, Rohrabacher introduced a bill that would direct NASA to develop a strategy &quot;for deflecting and mitigating potentially hazardous near-Earth objects&quot;. Rohrabacher has applauded the Apollo astronauts, calling them unofficial ambassadors. Rohrabacher stated &quot;I applaud their efforts and accomplishments over the past fifty years. And I encourage all Americans to join with me in thanking them for their accomplishments and for the international role they have played in serving as unofficial Ambassadors to the world on our behalf.&quot;

On July 18, 2017, Rohrabacher asked a panel of space experts testifying before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology if civilizations could have existed on Mars in the past. Kenneth Farley, a project scientist on NASA&#x27;s Mars Rover 2020 Project, said: &quot;I would say that is extremely unlikely.&quot;

===Tax reform===
Rohrabacher voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Despite efforts made by Republicans to change the bill to be more generous regarding cap deductions on new home mortgages, Rohrabacher remained staunch at voting nay on the bill, as the more than half of the new mortgages in his district are above the $750,000 cap. He stated on his Facebook page that &quot;Due to the pressure of several members like me, the bill was improved, but not enough for my constituents.&quot;

===2020 presidential election===

After leaving office, Rohrabacher participated in &quot;Stop the Steal&quot; rallies in support of Donald Trump. On January 6, 2021, Rohrabacher was filmed breaching a United States Capitol Police barricade during the January 6 United States Capitol attack, although he was not charged with an offense.

==Post-congressional endeavors==
In May 2019, Rohrabacher announced his appointment to the advisory board of BudTrader.com, a company that provides cannabis-related advertising services.

==Personal life==

Rohrabacher has been married to his wife, Rhonda Carmony, since 1997. In 2004, they became parents of triplets.

Rohrabacher is Protestant. He was described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;an avid surfer&quot;.

Rohrabacher revealed in May 2016 that he uses a cannabis-infused topical rub to treat his arthritis pain, allowing him to sleep through the night. The product is legal under California state law, but remains a banned substance under federal law.

In December 2018, a month after losing his bid for re-election, Rohrabacher announced that he intended to move to Maine and to write film scripts.

<text>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military. Originally known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the agency was created on February 7, 1958, by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik 1 in 1957. By collaborating with academia, industry, and government partners, DARPA formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, often beyond immediate U.S. military requirements. The name of the organization first changed from its founding name, ARPA, to DARPA, in March 1972, changing back to ARPA in February 1993, then reverted to DARPA in March 1996.

&quot;The Economist&quot; has called DARPA &quot;the agency that shaped the modern world,&quot; with technologies like &quot;Moderna&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccine ... weather satellites, GPS, drones, stealth technology, voice interfaces, the personal computer and the internet on the list of innovations for which DARPA can claim at least partial credit.&quot; Its track record of success has inspired governments around the world to launch similar research and development agencies.

DARPA is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management. DARPA comprises approximately 220 government employees in six technical offices, including nearly 100 program managers, who together oversee about 250 research and development programs.
Rob McHenry is the current acting director.

==History==
===Early history (1958–1969)===
The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was suggested by the President&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Committee to President Dwight D. Eisenhower in a meeting called after the launch of Sputnik. ARPA was formally authorized by President Eisenhower in 1958 for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements. The two relevant acts are the Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force) (Public Law 85-325) and Department of Defense Directive 5105.15, in February 1958. It was placed within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and counted approximately 150 people. Its creation was directly attributed to the launching of Sputnik and to U.S. realization that the Soviet Union had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology. Initial funding of ARPA was $520 million. ARPA&#x27;s first director, Roy Johnson, left a $160,000 management job at General Electric for an $18,000 job at ARPA. Herbert York from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was hired as his scientific assistant.

Johnson and York were both keen on space projects, but when NASA was established later in 1958 all space projects and most of ARPA&#x27;s funding were transferred to it. Johnson resigned and ARPA was repurposed to do &quot;high-risk&quot;, &quot;high-gain&quot;, &quot;far out&quot; basic research, a posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the nation&#x27;s scientists and research universities. ARPA&#x27;s second director was Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, who resigned in early 1961 and was succeeded by Jack Ruina who served until 1963. Ruina, the first scientist to administer ARPA, managed to raise its budget to $250 million. It was Ruina who hired J. C. R. Licklider as the first administrator of the Information Processing Techniques Office, which played a vital role in creation of ARPANET, the basis for the future Internet.

Additionally, the political and defense communities recognized the need for a high-level Department of Defense organization to formulate and execute R&amp;D projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their laboratories. In pursuit of this mission, DARPA has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs.

From 1958 to 1965, ARPA&#x27;s emphasis centered on major national issues, including space, ballistic missile defense, and nuclear test detection. During 1960, all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the military space programs to the individual services.

This allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the Project Defender (defense against ballistic missiles), Project Vela (nuclear test detection), and Project AGILE (counterinsurgency R&amp;D) programs, and to begin work on computer processing, behavioral sciences, and materials sciences. The DEFENDER and AGILE programs formed the foundation of DARPA sensor, surveillance, and directed energy R&amp;D, particularly in the study of radar, infrared sensing, and x-ray/gamma ray detection.

ARPA at this point (1959) played an early role in Transit (also called NavSat) a predecessor to the Global Positioning System (GPS). &quot;Fast-forward to 1959 when a joint effort between DARPA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory began to fine-tune the early explorers&#x27; discoveries. TRANSIT, sponsored by the Navy and developed under the leadership of Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite positioning system.&quot;

During the late 1960s, with the transfer of these mature programs to the Services, ARPA redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of relatively small, essentially exploratory research programs. The agency was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972, and during the early 1970s, it emphasized direct energy programs, information processing, and tactical technologies.

Concerning information processing, DARPA made great progress, initially through its support of the development of time-sharing. All modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the Multics system, developed by a cooperation among Bell Labs, General Electric and MIT, which DARPA supported by funding Project MAC at MIT with an initial two-million-dollar grant.

DARPA supported the evolution of the ARPANET (the first wide-area packet switching network), Packet Radio Network, Packet Satellite Network and ultimately, the Internet and research in the artificial intelligence fields of speech recognition and signal processing, including parts of Shakey the robot. DARPA also supported the early development of both hypertext and hypermedia. DARPA funded one of the first two hypertext systems, Douglas Engelbart&#x27;s NLS computer system, as well as The Mother of All Demos. DARPA later funded the development of the Aspen Movie Map, which is generally seen as the first hypermedia system and an important precursor of virtual reality.

===Later history (1970–1980)===
The Mansfield Amendment of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense research (through ARPA/DARPA) only to projects with direct military application.

The resulting &quot;brain drain&quot; is credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry. Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as Xerox PARC.

Between 1976 and 1981, DARPA&#x27;s major projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space technology, tactical armor and anti-armor programs, infrared sensing for space-based surveillance, high-energy laser technology for space-based missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, advanced cruise missiles, advanced aircraft, and defense applications of advanced computing.

Many of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services, such as the foundation technologies in automatic target recognition, space-based sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO), later known as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), now titled the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).

===Recent history (1981–present)===
During the 1980s, the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft-related programs, including the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) or Hypersonic Research Program. The Strategic Computing Program enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the Vietnam War. In addition, DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small, lightweight satellites (LIGHTSAT) and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing, submarine technology, and armor/anti-armor.

In 1981, two engineers, Robert McGhee and Kenneth Waldron, started to develop the Adaptive Suspension Vehicle (ASV) nicknamed the &quot;Walker&quot; at the Ohio State University, under a research contract from DARPA. The vehicle was 17 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 10.5 feet high, and had six legs to support its three-ton aluminum body, in which it was designed to carry cargo over difficult terrains. However, DARPA lost interest in the ASV, after problems with cold-weather tests.

On February 4, 2004, the agency shut down its so called &quot;LifeLog Project&quot;. The project&#x27;s aim would have been, &quot;to gather in a single place just about everything an individual says, sees or does&quot;.

On October 28, 2009, the agency broke ground on a new facility in Arlington County, Virginia a few miles from The Pentagon.

In fall 2011, DARPA hosted the 100-Year Starship Symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel.

On June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA announced that it planned to build new X-planes with NASA&#x27;s plan setting to create a whole series of X planes over the next 10 years.

Between 2014 and 2016, DARPA shepherded the first machine-to-machine computer security competition, the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC),
bringing a group of top-notch computer security experts to search for security vulnerabilities, exploit them, and create fixes that patch those vulnerabilities in a fully automated fashion. It is one of DARPA prize competitions to spur innovations.

In June 2018, DARPA leaders demonstrated a number of new technologies that were developed within the framework of the GXV-T program. The goal of this program is to create a lightly armored combat vehicle of not very large dimensions, which, due to maneuverability and other tricks, can successfully resist modern anti-tank weapon systems.

In September 2020, DARPA and the US Air Force announced that the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) are ready for free-flight tests within the next year.

Victoria Coleman became the director of DARPA in November 2020.

In recent years, DARPA officials have contracted out core functions to corporations. For example, during fiscal year 2020, Chenega ran physical security on DARPA&#x27;s premises, System High Corp. carried out program security, and Agile Defense ran unclassified IT services. General Dynamics runs classified IT services. Strategic Analysis Inc. provided support services regarding engineering, science, mathematics, and front office and administrative work.

==Organization==

===Current program offices===
DARPA has six technical offices that manage the agency&#x27;s research portfolio, and two additional offices that manage special projects. All offices report to the DARPA director, including:
* The Defense Sciences Office (DSO): DSO identifies and pursues high-risk, high-payoff research initiatives across a broad spectrum of science and engineering disciplines and transforms them into important, new game-changing technologies for U.S. national security. Current DSO themes include novel materials and structures, sensing and measurement, computation and processing, enabling operations, collective intelligence, and global change. 
* The Information Innovation Office (I2O) aims to ensure U.S. technological superiority in all areas where information can provide a decisive military advantage.
* The Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) core mission is the development of high-performance, intelligent microsystems and next-generation components to ensure U.S. dominance in Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Electronic Warfare (EW), and Directed Energy (DE). The effectiveness, survivability, and lethality of systems that relate to these applications depend critically on microsystems and components.
* The Strategic Technology Office (STO) mission is to focus on technologies that have a global theater-wide impact and that involve multiple Services.
* The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) engages in high-risk, high-payoff advanced military research, emphasizing the &quot;system&quot; and &quot;subsystem&quot; approach to the development of aeronautic, space, and land systems as well as embedded processors and control systems
* The Biological Technologies Office (BTO) fosters, demonstrates, and transitions breakthrough fundamental research, discoveries, and applications that integrate biology, engineering, and computer science for national security. Created in April 2014 by then Director Arati Prabhakar, taking programs from the MTO and DSO offices.

===Former offices===
* The Adaptive Execution Office (AEO) was created in 2009 by the DARPA Director, Regina Dugan. The office&#x27;s four project areas included technology transition, assessment, rapid productivity and adaptive systems. AEO provided the agency with robust connections to the warfighter community and assisted the agency with the planning and execution of technology demonstrations and field trials to promote adoption by the warfighter, accelerating the transition of new technologies into DoD capabilities.
* Information Awareness Office: 2002–2003
* The Advanced Technology Office (ATO) researched, demonstrated, and developed high payoff projects in maritime, communications, special operations, command and control, and information assurance and survivability mission areas.
* The Special Projects Office (SPO) researched, developed, demonstrated, and transitioned technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges. SPO investments ranged from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems. SPO developed technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. SPO developed significantly more cost-effective ways to counter proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAVs, and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance. SPO invested in novel space technologies across the spectrum of space control applications including rapid access, space situational awareness, counterspace, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures.
* The Office of Special Development (OSD) in the 1960s developed a real-time remote sensing, monitoring, and predictive activity system on trails used by insurgents in Laos, Cambodia, and the Republic of Vietnam. This was done from an office in Bangkok, Thailand, that was ostensibly established to catalog and support the Thai fishing fleet, of which two volumes were published. This is a personal recollection without a published citation. A report on the ARPA group under which OSD operated is found here. 
A 1991 reorganization created several offices which existed throughout the early 1990s:
* The Electronic Systems Technology Office combined areas of the Defense Sciences Office and the Defense Manufacturing Office. This new office will focus on the boundary between general-purpose computers and the physical world, such as sensors, displays and the first few layers of specialized signal-processing that couple these modules to standard computer interfaces.
* The Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office and the Computing Systems office will have responsibility associated with the Presidential High-Performance Computing Initiative. The Software office will also be responsible for &quot;software systems technology, machine intelligence and software engineering.&quot;
* The Land Systems Office was created to develop advanced land vehicle and anti-armor systems, once the domain of the Tactical Technology Office.
* The Undersea Warfare Office combined areas of the Advanced Vehicle Systems and Tactical Technology offices to develop and demonstrate submarine stealth and counter-stealth and automation.

A 2010 reorganization merged two offices:
* The Transformational Convergence Technology Office (TCTO) and the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) were combined in 2010 to form the Information Innovation Office (I2O).
** TCTO&#x27;s mission was to develop new crosscutting capabilities from a broad range of emerging technological and social trends, particularly in areas related to computing and computing-reliant subareas of the life sciences, social sciences, manufacturing, and commerce.
** IPTO focused on inventing the sensing, networking, computing, and software technologies vital to ensuring DOD military superiority.

<doc id="8958" wikidata="Q332130" url="?curid=8958" title="Dunstan">
<text>Dunstan ( – 19 May 988), was an English bishop and Benedictine monk. He was successively Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, Bishop of Worcester, Bishop of London and Archbishop of Canterbury, later canonised. His work restored monastic life in England and reformed the English Church. His 11th-century biographer Osbern, himself an artist and scribe, states that Dunstan was skilled in &quot;making a picture and forming letters&quot;, as were other clergy of his age who reached senior rank.

Dunstan served as an important minister of state to several English kings. He was the most popular saint in England for nearly two centuries, having gained fame for the many stories of his greatness, not least among which were those concerning his famed cunning in defeating the Devil.

==Early life (909–943)==
===Birth and relatives===
According to Dunstan&#x27;s earliest biographer, known only as &#x27;B&#x27;, his parents were called Heorstan and Cynethryth and they lived near Glastonbury. B states that Dunstan was &quot;&quot;oritur&quot; in the days of King Æthelstan, 924 to 939. &quot;Oritur&quot;&quot; has often been taken to mean &quot;born&quot;, but this is unlikely as another source states that he was ordained during Æthelstan&#x27;s reign, and he would have been under the minimum age of 30 if he was born no earlier than 924. It is more likely that &quot;oritur&quot; should be taken as &quot;emerged&quot; and that he was born around 910. B states that he was related to Ælfheah the Bald, the Bishop of Winchester and Cynesige, Bishop of Lichfield. According to a later biographer, Adelard of Ghent, he was a nephew of Athelm, Archbishop of Canterbury, but this is less certain as it is not mentioned by B, who should have known as he had been a member of Dunstan&#x27;s household.

===School to the king&#x27;s court===
As a young boy, Dunstan studied under the Irish monks who then occupied the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey. Accounts tell of his youthful optimism and of his vision of the abbey being restored. While still a boy, Dunstan was stricken with a near-fatal illness and effected a seemingly miraculous recovery. Even as a child, he was noted for his devotion to learning and for his mastery of many kinds of artistic craftsmanship. With his parents&#x27; consent he was tonsured, received minor orders and served in the ancient church of St Mary. He became so well known for his devotion to learning that he is said to have been summoned by Athelm to enter his service. He was later appointed to the court of King Æthelstan.
Dunstan soon became a favourite of the king and was the envy of other members of the court. A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with witchcraft and black magic. The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a cesspool. He managed to crawl out and make his way to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his kinsman Ælfheah, Bishop of Winchester.

The bishop tried to persuade him to become a monk, but Dunstan was doubtful whether he had a vocation to a celibate life. The answer came in the form of an attack of swelling tumours all over Dunstan&#x27;s body. This ailment was so severe that it was thought to be leprosy. It was more probably some form of blood poisoning caused by being beaten and thrown in the cesspool. Whatever the cause, it changed Dunstan&#x27;s mind. He took Holy Orders in 943, in the presence of Ælfheah, and returned to live the life of a hermit at Glastonbury. Against the old church of St Mary he built a small cell long and deep. It was there that Dunstan studied, worked at his art, and played on his harp. It is at this time, according to a late 11th-century legend, that the Devil is said to have tempted Dunstan and to have been held by the face with Dunstan&#x27;s tongs.

==Monk and abbot (943–957)==
===Life as a monk===

Dunstan worked as a silversmith and in the scriptorium while he was living at Glastonbury. It is thought likely that he was the artist who drew the well-known image of Christ with a small kneeling monk beside him in the &quot;Glastonbury Classbook&quot;, &quot;one of the first of a series of outline drawings which were to become a special feature of Anglo-Saxon art of this period.&quot; Dunstan became famous as a musician, illuminator, and metalworker. Lady Æthelflæd, King Æthelstan&#x27;s niece, made Dunstan a trusted adviser and on her death, she left a considerable fortune to him. He used this money later in life to foster and encourage a monastic revival in England. About the same time, his father Heorstan died and Dunstan inherited his fortune as well. He became a person of great influence, and on the death of King Æthelstan in 940, the new King, Edmund, summoned him to his court at Cheddar and made him a minister.

Again, royal favour fostered jealousy among other courtiers and again Dunstan&#x27;s enemies succeeded in their plots. The King was prepared to send Dunstan away. There were then at Cheddar certain envoys from the &quot;Eastern Kingdom&quot;, which probably meant East Anglia. Dunstan implored the envoys to take him with them when they returned to their homes. They agreed to do so, but it never happened. The story is recorded:

===Abbot of Glastonbury===
Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, went to work at once on the task of reform. He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by establishing Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of &#x27;Edgar&#x27;s Establishment of the Monasteries&#x27; (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan&#x27;s first biographer, who had been a member of the community at Glastonbury. Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.

Nevertheless, not all the members of Dunstan&#x27;s community at Glastonbury were monks who followed the Benedictine Rule. In fact, Dunstan&#x27;s first biographer, &#x27;B.&#x27;, was a cleric who eventually joined a community of canons at Liège after leaving Glastonbury.
Dunstan&#x27;s first care was to rebuild the Church of St. Peter, rebuild the cloister, and re-establish the monastic enclosure. The secular affairs of the house were committed to his brother, Wulfric, &quot;so that neither himself nor any of the professed monks might break enclosure.&quot; A school for the local youth was founded and soon became the most famous of its time in England. A substantial extension of the irrigation system on the surrounding Somerset Levels was also completed.

Within two years of Dunstan&#x27;s appointment, in 946, King Edmund was assassinated. His successor was Eadred. The policy of the new government was supported by the Queen mother, Eadgifu of Kent, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Oda, and by the East Anglian nobles, at whose head was the powerful ealdorman Æthelstan the &quot;Half-king&quot;. It was a policy of unification and conciliation with the Danish half of the kingdom. The goal was a firm establishment of royal authority. In ecclesiastical matters it favoured the spread of Catholic observance, the rebuilding of churches, the moral reform of the clergy and laity, and the end of the religion of the Danes in England. These policies made Dunstan popular in the North of England, but unpopular in the South. Against all these reforms were the nobles of Wessex, who included most of Dunstan&#x27;s own relatives, and who had an interest in maintaining established customs. For nine years Dunstan&#x27;s influence was dominant, during which time he twice refused the office of bishop (that of Winchester in 951 and Crediton in 953), affirming that he would not leave the king&#x27;s side so long as the king lived and needed him.

===Changes in fortune===

In 955, Eadred died, and the situation was at once changed. Eadwig, the elder son of Edmund, who then came to the throne, was a headstrong youth wholly devoted to the reactionary nobles. According to one legend, the feud with Dunstan began on the day of Eadwig&#x27;s coronation, when he failed to attend a meeting of nobles. When Dunstan eventually found the young monarch, he was cavorting with a noblewoman named Ælfgifu and her mother, and refused to return with the bishop. Infuriated by this, Dunstan dragged Eadwig back to the royal gathering.

Later realising that he had provoked the king, Dunstan saw that his life was in danger. He fled England and crossed the channel to Flanders, where he found himself ignorant of the language and of the customs of the locals. The count of Flanders, Arnulf I, received him with honour and lodged him in the Abbey of Mont Blandin, near Ghent. This was one of the centres of the Benedictine revival in that country, and Dunstan was able for the first time to observe the strict observance that had seen its rebirth at Cluny at the beginning of the century. His exile was not of long duration. Before the end of 957, the Mercians and Northumbrians revolted and drove out Eadwig, choosing his brother Edgar as king of the country north of the Thames. The south remained faithful to Eadwig. At once Edgar&#x27;s advisers recalled Dunstan.

== Bishop and archbishop (957–978) ==
===Bishop of Worcester and of London===
On Dunstan&#x27;s return, Archbishop Oda consecrated him a bishop and, on the death of Coenwald of Worcester at the end of 957, Oda appointed Dunstan to the see.

In the following year the see of London became vacant and was conferred on Dunstan, who held it simultaneously with Worcester. In October 959, Eadwig died and his brother Edgar was readily accepted as ruler of Wessex. One of Eadwig&#x27;s final acts had been to appoint a successor to Archbishop Oda, who died on 2 June 958. The chosen candidate was Ælfsige of Winchester, but he died of cold in the Alps as he journeyed to Rome for the pallium. In his place Eadwig then nominated one of his supporters, the Bishop of Wells, Byrhthelm. As soon as Edgar became king, he reversed this second choice on the ground that Byrhthelm had not been able to govern even his first diocese properly. The archbishopric was then conferred on Dunstan.

===Archbishop of Canterbury===
Dunstan went to Rome in 960, and received the pallium from Pope John XII. On his journey there, Dunstan&#x27;s acts of charity were so lavish as to leave nothing for himself and his attendants. His steward complained, but Dunstan seems to have suggested that they trust in Jesus Christ.

On his return from Rome, Dunstan at once regained his position as virtual prime minister of the kingdom. By his advice Ælfstan was appointed to the Bishopric of London, and Oswald to that of Worcester. In 963, Æthelwold, the Abbot of Abingdon, was appointed to the See of Winchester. With their aid and with the ready support of King Edgar, Dunstan pushed forward his reforms in the English Church. The monks in his communities were taught to live in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and Dunstan actively enforced the law of celibacy whenever possible. He forbade the practices of simony (selling ecclesiastical offices for money) and ended the custom of clerics appointing relatives to offices under their jurisdiction. Monasteries were built, and in some of the great cathedrals, monks took the place of the secular canons; in the rest the canons were obliged to live according to rule. The parish priests were compelled to be qualified for their office; they were urged to teach parishioners not only the truths of the Christian faith, but also trades to improve their position. The state saw reforms as well. Good order was maintained throughout the realm and there was respect for the law. Trained bands policed the north, and a navy guarded the shores from Viking raids.

In 973, Dunstan&#x27;s statesmanship reached its zenith when he officiated at the coronation of King Edgar. Edgar was crowned at Bath in an imperial ceremony planned not as the initiation, but as the culmination of his reign (a move that must have taken a great deal of preliminary diplomacy). This service, devised by Dunstan himself and celebrated with a poem in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; forms the basis of the present-day British coronation ceremony. There was a second symbolic coronation held later. This was an important step, as other kings of Britain came and gave their allegiance to Edgar at Chester. Six kings in Britain, including the kings of Scotland and of Strathclyde, pledged their faith that they would be the king&#x27;s liege-men on sea and land.

Edgar ruled as a strong and popular king for 16 years. Edgar&#x27;s reign, and implicitly his governing partnership with Dunstan, was praised by early chroniclers and historians who regarded it as a golden age. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; caveated the acclaim with one complaint, criticising the high level of immigration that took place at that time. It would appear from William of Malmesbury&#x27;s later history that the objection was limited to the mercenary seaman, employed from around the North Sea littoral, to assist in the defence of the country.

In 975, Edgar was succeeded by his eldest son Edward &quot;the Martyr&quot;. His accession was disputed by his stepmother, Ælfthryth, who wished her own son Æthelred to reign. Through the influence of Dunstan, Edward was chosen and crowned at Winchester. Edgar&#x27;s death had encouraged the reactionary nobles, and at once there was a determined attack upon the monks, the protagonists of reform. Throughout Mercia they were persecuted and deprived of their possessions. Their cause, however, was supported by Æthelwine, the ealdorman of East Anglia, and the realm was in serious danger of civil war. Three meetings of the Witan were held to settle these disputes, at Kyrtlington, at Calne, and at Amesbury. At the second of them the floor of the hall where the Witan was sitting gave way, and all except Dunstan, who clung to a beam, fell into the room below; several men were killed.

==Final years (978–88)==
In March 978, King Edward was assassinated at Corfe Castle, possibly at the instigation of his stepmother, and Æthelred the Unready became king. The coronation took place on Low Sunday 31 March 978. According to William of Malmsesbury, writing over a century later, when the young king took the usual oath to govern well, Dunstan addressed him in solemn warning. He criticised the violent act whereby he became king and prophesied the misfortunes that were shortly to fall on the kingdom, but Dunstan&#x27;s influence at court was ended. Dunstan retired to Canterbury, to teach at the cathedral school.

Only three more public acts are known. In 980, Dunstan joined Ælfhere of Mercia in the solemn translation of the relics of King Edward, soon to be regarded as a saint, from their grave at Wareham to a shrine at Shaftesbury Abbey. In 984, he persuaded King Æthelred to appoint Ælfheah as Bishop of Winchester in succession to Æthelwold. In 986, Dunstan induced the king, by a donation of 100 pounds of silver, to stop his persecution of the See of Rochester.

Dunstan&#x27;s retirement at Canterbury consisted of long hours, both day and night, spent in private prayer, as well as his regular attendance at Mass and the daily office. He visited the shrines of St Augustine and St Æthelberht. He worked to improve the spiritual and temporal well-being of his people, to build and restore churches, to establish schools, to judge suits, to defend widows and orphans, to promote peace, and to enforce respect for purity. He practised his crafts, made bells and organs and corrected the books in the cathedral library. He encouraged and protected European scholars who came to England, and was active as a teacher of boys in the cathedral school. On Ascension Day 988, Dunstan said Mass and preached three times to the people: at the Gospel, at the benediction, and after the Agnus Dei. In this last address, he announced his impending death and wished his congregation well. That afternoon he chose the spot for his tomb, then went to his bed. His strength failed rapidly, and on Saturday morning, 19 May, he caused the clergy to assemble. Mass was celebrated in his presence, then he received Extreme Unction and the Viaticum, and died. Dunstan&#x27;s final words are reported to have been, &quot;He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord: He hath given food to them that fear Him.&quot;

The English people accepted him as a saint shortly thereafter. He was formally canonised in 1029. That year at the Synod of Winchester, St Dunstan&#x27;s feast was ordered to be kept solemnly throughout England.

==Legacy==
Until Thomas Becket&#x27;s fame overshadowed Dunstan&#x27;s, he was the favourite saint of the English people. Dunstan had been buried in his cathedral. In 1180 his relics were translated to a tomb on the south side of the high altar, when that building was restored after being partially destroyed by a fire in 1174.

The monks of Glastonbury used to claim that during the sack of Canterbury by the Danes in 1012, Dunstan&#x27;s body had been carried for safety to their abbey. This story was disproved by Archbishop William Warham, who opened the tomb at Canterbury in 1508. They found Dunstan&#x27;s relics still to be there. However, his shrine was destroyed during the English Reformation.

===Patronage and feast day===
Dunstan became patron saint of English goldsmiths and silversmiths because he worked as a silversmith making church plate. The Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church mark his feast day on 19 May. Dunstan is also honoured in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 19 May.

In 2023, a pastoral area of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton was named in honour of Dunstan.

===In literature and folklore===
English literature contains many references to him: for example, in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens, and in this folk rhyme: 
&lt;poem&gt;St Dunstan, as the story goes,
Once pull&#x27;d the devil by the nose
With red-hot tongs, which made him roar,
That he was heard three miles or more.&lt;/poem&gt;

This folk story is already shown in an initial in the &quot;Life of Dunstan&quot; in the Canterbury &quot;Passionale&quot;, from the second quarter of the 12th century (British Library, Harley MS 315, f. 15v.).
Daniel Anlezark has tentatively suggested that Dunstan may be the medieval author of the poem &quot;Solomon and Saturn&quot;, citing the style, word choice, and Hiberno-Latin used in the texts. However, Clive Tolley examines this claim from a linguistic point-of-view and disagrees with Anlezark&#x27;s claim.

Another story relates how Dunstan nailed a horseshoe to the Devil&#x27;s foot when he was asked to re-shoe the Devil&#x27;s cloven hoof. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is over the door. This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.

A further legend relating to Dunstan and the Devil seeks to explain the phenomena of Franklin nights, late frosts which occur around his Feast Day. The story goes that Dunstan was a great brewer and negotiated an agreement whereby the Devil could blast the blossom of local apple trees with frost, damaging the cider crop so that Dunstan&#x27;s own beer would sell more readily.

===An East London saint===
As Bishop of London, Dunstan was also Lord of the Manor of Stepney, and may, like subsequent bishops, have lived there. Dunstan is recorded as having founded (or rebuilt) Stepney&#x27;s church, in 952 AD. This church was dedicated to All Saints, but was rededicated to Dunstan after his canonisation in 1029, making Dunstan the patron saint of Stepney.

<text>Deprogramming is a controversial tactic that seeks to dissuade someone from &quot;strongly held convictions&quot; such as religious beliefs. Deprogramming purports to assist a person who holds a particular belief system—of a kind considered harmful by those initiating the deprogramming—to change those beliefs and sever connections to the group associated with them. Typically, people identifying themselves as deprogrammers are hired by a person&#x27;s relatives, often parents of adult children. The subject of the deprogramming is usually forced to undergo the procedure, which might last days or weeks, against their will.

Methods and practices of deprogramming are varied but have often involved kidnapping and false imprisonment, which have sometimes resulted in criminal convictions. The practice has led to controversies over freedom of religion, civil rights, criminality, and the use of violence. Proponents of deprogramming present the practice as a necessary counter-measure to the systematic &quot;brainwashing&quot; procedures allegedly employed by religious groups, which they claim deprive the individual of their capacity for free choice.

==Background==
In the United States in the early 1970s, there was an increasing number of New Religious Movements. Ted Patrick, the &quot;father of deprogramming&quot;, formed an organization he called &quot;The Citizens&#x27; Freedom Foundation&quot; and began offering &#x27;deprogramming&#x27; services to people who wanted to break a family member&#x27;s connection to an NRM. Patrick&#x27;s methods involved abduction, physical restraint, detention over days or weeks while maintaining a constant presence with the victim, food and sleep deprivation, prolonged verbal and emotional abuse, and desecration of the symbols of the victim&#x27;s faith.

Deprogrammers justified their actions by applying a theory of &quot;brainwashing&quot; to New Religious Movements. Brainwashing theory denied the possibility of authentic spiritual choice for an NRM member, proposing instead that such individuals were subject to systematic mind control programs that overrode their capacity for independent volition. Ted Patrick&#x27;s theory of brainwashing was that individuals were hypnotized by brainwaves projected from a recruiter&#x27;s eyes and fingertips, after which the state was maintained by constant indoctrination, a totalistic environment, and self-hypnosis. Most academic research, however, indicated that the reasons for people joining, remaining in, or leaving NRMs were complex, varied from group to group and individual to individual, and generally reflected the continued presence of a capacity for individual responsibility and choice.

The Citizens&#x27; Freedom Foundation, which later became known as the Cult Awareness Network, became the most prominent group in the emerging national anti-cult movement of the 1970s and 80s. The anti-cult movement lobbied for state and national legislative action to legitimize its activities, and although this had very limited success, the movement was nevertheless able to forge alliances with a number of governmental agencies. This was primarily on the back of its propagation of the brainwashing/mind control ideology, which succeeded in turning affiliation with NRMs into an issue of public—rather than private—concern and gave a pseudo-legitimacy to the anti-cultists more extreme claims and actions.

Although the CFF and CAN were in favor of deprogramming, they distanced themselves from the practice from the late 1970s onwards. Despite this apparent repudiation, however, they continued the practice. CFF and CAN referred thousands of paying clients to activist members who kept lists of deprogrammers. The total number that occurred is unknown, but in 1980 Ted Patrick claimed to have been hired over 2000 times as a professional abductor. Many other operators emerged both during and after the period in which he was active, many of them trained by him. The practice of deprogramming was an integral part of the anti-cult ideology and economy, and was seen as an effective response to the demand emanating from people who wanted a family member extracted, but it also clashed with the need for anti-cult organizations to present themselves as &quot;educational&quot; associations (the CFF, for example, received tax-exempt status as an educational trust). This, along with its tenuous legal and moral status, meant that deprogramming tended to be publicly disavowed, while its practice continued clandestinely.

== Use of violence ==
Deprogramming became a controversial practice due to the violent and illegal nature of some of its methods. Various academics have commented on the practice. Sociologist Anson D. Shupe and others wrote that deprogramming is comparable to exorcism in both methodology and manifestation. Professor of Sociology and Judicial Studies James T. Richardson described deprogramming as a &quot;private, self-help process whereby participants in unpopular new religious movements (NRMs) were forcibly removed from the group, incarcerated, and put through radical resocialization processes that were supposed to result in their agreeing to leave the group.&quot; Law professor Douglas Laycock, author of &quot;Religious Liberty: The Free Exercise Clause&quot;, wrote:

Beginning in the 1970s, many parents responded to the initial conversion with &quot;deprogramming.&quot; The essence of deprogramming was to physically abduct the convert, isolate him and physically restrain him, and barrage him with continuous arguments and attacks against his new religion, threatening to hold him forever until he agreed to leave it.

Deprogrammers generally operated on the presumption that the people they were paid to extract from religious organizations were victims of mind control or brainwashing. Since the theory was that such individuals were incapable of rational thought, extreme measures were thought to be justified for their own good, up to and including the use of criminal violence. Ted Patrick was eventually tried and convicted of multiple felonies relating to kidnapping and false imprisonment of deprogramming subjects.

Violence of one degree or another is common to all anecdotal accounts of deprogramming. There are numerous testimonies from people who describe being threatened with a gun, beaten, denied food and sleep, and sexually assaulted. In these accounts, the deprogramming usually begins with the victim being forced into a vehicle and taken to a place where they are isolated from everyone but their captors. Told that they would not be released until they renounce their beliefs, they are then subjected to days and sometimes weeks of verbal, emotional, psychological, and/or physical pressure until the demands of their abductors are satisfied.

According to sociologist Eileen Barker, &quot;One does not have to rely on the victims for stories of violence: Ted Patrick, one of the most notorious deprogrammers used by CAGs [cult-awareness groups] (who has spent several terms in prison for his exploits) openly boasts about some of the violence he employed.&quot; A number of other prominent members of &quot;cult-awareness groups&quot; have been convicted of violent crimes committed in the course of deprogrammings.

Carol Giambalvo, who worked for the Cult Awareness Network in the 1980s (later advocating for &quot;voluntary exit counseling&quot; and &quot;thought reform consultation&quot;) said that although abductions certainly occurred, the more common practice was to forcefully detain people in their own homes, or in a cabin or motel room. Giambalvo tells of &quot;horror stories&quot; of restraint, beatings, use of handcuffs and weapons, sexual abuse, and even rape, although she claims that these were only used in a minority of cases and that deprogramming &quot;helped to free many individuals&quot;.

==Rationale and effectiveness==
Carol Giambalvo described the reasoning behind deprogramming thus:It was believed that the hold of the brainwashing over the cognitive processes of a cult member needed to be broken – or &quot;snapped&quot; as some termed it – by means that would shock or frighten the cultist into thinking again. For that reason, in some cases cult leader&#x27;s pictures were burned or there were highly confrontational interactions between deprogrammers and cultist. What was often sought was an emotional response to the information, the shock, the fear, and the confrontation.

Another associate of Ted Patrick, Sylvia Buford, identified five stages in the deprogramming which would, ideally, bring the subject to a recognition of their condition:
# Discrediting the authority figure
# Presenting contradictions - comparing the ideology with the reality; for example, &quot;How can he preach love when he exploits people?&quot;
# The breaking point, at which the subject begins to accept the deprogrammer&#x27;s position and begins doubting the ideology
# Self-expression: the subject begins to voice criticisms and complaints against the cult.
# Identification and transference: the subject begins to identify with the deprogrammers, thinking as an opponent of the cult rather than as a member.

According to Giambalvo and others, however, deprogramming frequently failed completely to achieve the desired outcome and often caused significant harm. While some advocates claimed a high success rate, studies show that natural attrition rates are actually higher than those achieved by deprogramming interventions.

Professor of psychiatry Saul V. Levine suggests that it is doubtful that deprogramming helps many people and goes on to say that it actually causes harm to the victim by the very nature of deprogramming. For deprogramming to work, the victim must be convinced that they joined a religious group against their will. They then must renounce responsibility and accept that in some mysterious way that their minds were controlled. He argues that deprogramming destroys a person&#x27;s identity and is likely to create permanent anxiety about freedom of choice and leave the deprogrammed subject dependent upon the guidance and advice of others.

The Dialog Center International (DCI) a major Christian counter-cult organization founded in 1973 by a Danish professor of missiology and ecumenical theology, Johannes Aagaard, rejects deprogramming, believing that it is counterproductive, ineffective, and can harm the relationship between a cult member and concerned family members.

==Government==
Deprogrammers have sometimes operated with overt or tacit support of law enforcement and judicial officials. Richardson sees government involvement in deprogramming as existing on a continuum from implicit approval to active involvement. In the United States, where there are First Amendment protections for religious groups, government officials and agencies frequently &quot;turned a blind eye&quot; to the activities of deprogrammers. In China, government agencies have at times promoted activities resembling deprogramming to enforce official views of &quot;correct&quot; beliefs and behaviors, for example in the suppression of the Falun Gong movement. This can involve &quot;vigorous, even violent, efforts to dissuade people from participating in groups deemed unacceptable to the government&quot; and have been &quot;given legal sanction by the passage of laws that make illegal the activities or even the beliefs of the unpopular movement or group being targeted&quot;.

In the United States—in New York, Kansas, Nebraska, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon and Texas—lawmakers unsuccessfully attempted to legalize involuntary deprogramming, either through a deprogramming bill or conservatorship legislation. In New York, two bills were actually passed by the legislature (in 1980 and 1981), but both were vetoed by Governor Hugh Carey because of their violation of religious and other constitutional freedoms. In other states the bills failed to pass the legislature.

==Controversy and related issues==

In the United States, from the mid-1970s and throughout the 1980s mind control was a widely accepted theory in public opinion, and the vast majority of newspaper and magazine accounts of deprogrammings assumed that recruits&#x27; relatives were well justified to seek conservatorships and to hire deprogrammers.

One disturbing aspect from a civil rights point of view, was that people hiring deprogrammers would use deception or other ethically questionable methods—including kidnapping—to get their relative into deprogrammers&#x27; hands, without allowing them any recourse to a lawyer or psychiatrist of their own choosing. Previously, there would be a sanity hearing first, and only then a commitment to an asylum or involuntary therapy. But with deprogramming, judges routinely granted parents legal authority over their adult children without a hearing.

Critics contend that deprogramming and exit counseling begin with a false premise. Lawyers for some groups who have lost members due to deprogramming, as well as some civil liberties advocates, sociologists and psychologists, argue that it is not the religious groups but rather the deprogrammers who are the ones who deceive and manipulate people.

During the 1990s, deprogrammer Rick Ross was sued by Jason Scott, a former member of a Pentecostal group called the Life Tabernacle Church, after an unsuccessful deprogramming attempt. In 1995, the jury awarded Scott US$875,000 in compensatory damages and US$2,500,000 in punitive damages against Ross, which were later settled for US$5,000 and 200 hours of services. More significantly, the jury also found that the leading anti-cult group known as the Cult Awareness Network (CAN) was a co-conspirator in the crime and fined CAN around US$1,000,000 in punitive damages, forcing the group into bankruptcy. This case is often seen as effectively closing the door on the practice of involuntary deprogramming in the United States.

==Referral and kickback system==
Anti-cult groups play a central role in maintaining the underground network of communications, referrals, transportation, and housing necessary for continued deprogramming.

The Cult Awareness Network operated a referral scheme (NARDEC) in which they would refer people to deprogrammers in return for a &quot;kickback&quot; in the form of a donation or as a commission. Deprogrammers such as Rick Alan Ross, Steven Hassan and Carol Giambalvo were among the CAN-referred deprogrammers.

==Historical examples==
==Exit counseling==
Proponents of &quot;Exit counseling&quot; distinguish it from coercive forms of deprogramming. The fundamental difference is that involuntary deprogramming involves forced confinement of the individual whereas in exit counseling they are free to leave at any time. The absence of physical coercion is thought to increase the likelihood of establishing a rapport and of not alienating, enraging or terrifying the subject. Exit counsellors are typically brought in during a &quot;family Intervention&quot;, where they explain their role and seek to change the subject&#x27;s attitude to their religious group through reasoning and persuasion.

Langone, writing in 1993, estimated that deprogramming costs typically rise to at least US$10,000 (roughly $ after accounting for inflation), compared to exit counseling which typically costs US$2,000 to US$4,000 (roughly $ to $8,000 after accounting for inflation), although cases requiring extensive research of little-known groups can cost much more. Deprogramming, especially when it fails, also entails considerable legal risk and psychological risk (for example, a permanent alienation of the subject from their family). In exit counseling, these psychological and legal risks are reduced. Although deprogrammers prepare family members (other than the subject) for the process, exit counselors tend to work with such family members directly, expecting those requesting the intervention to contribute to the process. Exit counseling requires that families establish a reasonable and respectful level of communication with their loved one before the program itself can begin. Because deprogramming relies on coercion (which is illegal except in the case of conservatorship and is generally viewed as unethical) deprogrammers&#x27; critiques of the religious organization tend to be less credible to the subject than the arguments of exit counselors.

<doc id="8964" wikidata="Q901233" url="?curid=8964" title="Daily Planet">
<text>The Daily Planet is a fictional newspaper appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Superman. The newspaper was first mentioned in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #9 (November 13, 1939) – Underworld Politics, War on Crime. The &quot;Daily Planet&quot; building&#x27;s distinguishing feature is the enormous globe that sits on top of the building.

Based in the fictional city of Metropolis, the paper employs Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Perry White as its editor-in-chief. The building&#x27;s original features were inspired by the Old Toronto Star Building where Superman&#x27;s co-creator, Joe Shuster, was a newsboy when the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; was still called the &quot;Daily Star&quot;. Shuster has claimed that Metropolis was visually inspired by Toronto. Over the years, however, Metropolis has come to serve as an analogue to New York City.

==Fictional history==
===Golden and Silver Age===

When Superman first appeared in comics (specifically 1938&#x27;s &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1), his alter ego Clark Kent worked for a newspaper named the &quot;Daily Star&quot;, under editor George Taylor. Joe Shuster named the &quot;Daily Star&quot; after the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; newspaper in Toronto, Ontario, which had been the newspaper that Shuster&#x27;s parents received and for which Shuster had worked as a newsboy. It was not until later years that the fictional paper became the &quot;Daily Planet.&quot; (The real-world newspaper was called the &quot;Evening Star&quot; prior to 1899; the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; is now known as the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.)

While choosing a name for the fictitious newspaper, consideration was given to combining the names of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; (another Toronto newspaper) and the &quot;Daily Star&quot; to become &quot;The Daily Globe&quot;. But when the comic strip appeared, the newspaper&#x27;s name was permanently made the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; to avoid a name conflict with real newspapers. In &quot;Superman&quot; #5 (Summer 1940), the publisher of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; is shown to be Burt Mason, a man who is determined to print the truth even when corrupt politician Alex Evell threatens him. In &quot;Superman&quot; #6 (September–October 1940), Mason gives free printing equipment to &quot;The Gateston Gazette&quot; after its editor, Jim Tirrell, is killed and its equipment is destroyed by racketeers that Tirrell insisted on reporting.

When DC made use of its multiverse means of continuity tracking between the early 1960s and mid-1980s, it was declared that the &quot;Daily Star&quot; was the newspaper&#x27;s name in the Golden Age or &quot;Earth-Two&quot; versions of Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, while the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; was used in the Silver Age or &quot;Earth-One&quot; versions. The Clark Kent of Earth-Two eventually became the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily Star&quot;, something his Earth-One counterpart did not achieve.
In the Silver and Bronze Age universes, Clark&#x27;s first contact with the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; came when reporter (and future editor) Perry White came to Smallville to write a story about Superboy, and wound up getting an interview where the Boy of Steel first revealed his extraterrestrial origins. The story resulted in Perry earning a Pulitzer Prize. During Clark Kent&#x27;s years in college, Perry White was promoted to editor-in-chief upon the retirement of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;&#x27;s previous editor, the Earth-One version of George Taylor.

After graduating from Metropolis University with a degree in journalism, Clark Kent went to work at the &quot;Planet&quot;, and quickly met Lois Lane (who had been working there for some time already). After Clark was hired, Jimmy Olsen joined the paper&#x27;s staff.

In 1971, the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; was purchased by Morgan Edge, president of the Galaxy Broadcasting System. Edge proceeded to integrate Metropolis television station WGBS-TV&#x27;s studios into the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; building, and named Clark Kent as the anchor for the WGBS evening news. Eventually, Clark&#x27;s former schoolmate from Smallville Lana Lang joined Clark as a co-anchor.

After the 1985–1986 miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, many of these elements, including Morgan Edge buying the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, were retroactively changed or eliminated from the Superman canon.

===Post-Crisis===
In the post-Crisis comics&#x27; canon, years before Clark or Lois began working for the paper, Lex Luthor owned the &quot;Daily Planet.&quot; When Luthor, deciding to sell the paper, began taking bids for the &quot;Planet&quot;, Perry White convinced an international conglomerate, TransNational Enterprises, to buy the paper. They agreed to this venture with only one stipulation: that Perry White would become editor-in-chief. White had served as the &quot;Planet&quot; editor-in-chief ever since, barring the few times he was absent. During those times people such as Sam Foswell and Clark Kent have looked after the paper. Franklin Stern, an old friend of White&#x27;s, became the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;&#x27;s publisher.
The &quot;Planet&quot; saw its share of rough times during White&#x27;s tenure. For example, it had many violent worker strikes. The building itself, along with most of the city, was destroyed during the &quot;Fall of Metropolis&quot; storyline; it is only much later that it was restored by the efforts of various superheroes. The &quot;Planet&quot; building sustained heavy damages after the villain Doomsday&#x27;s rampage. Later, Franklin Stern decided to put the paper up for sale. Lex Luthor, disliking the heavy criticism of himself and his company that the &quot;Planet&quot; became noted for, purchased the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and subsequently closed the paper down. Luthor fired every employee of the newspaper except for four people: Simone D&#x27;Neige, Dirk Armstrong, Jimmy Olsen, and Lois Lane. As a final insult, Luthor saw to it that the &quot;Planet&quot; globe was unceremoniously dumped in the Metropolis landfill. In the &quot;Planet&quot;&#x27;s place emerged &quot;LexCom,&quot; a news-oriented Internet website that primarily catered to Luthor&#x27;s views of &quot;quality journalism.&quot;

After Lois Lane made a deal with Luthor where, in exchange for him returning the &quot;Planet&quot; to Perry, she would kill one story of his choosing with no questions asked, Luthor sold the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; to Perry White for the token sum of one dollar. The paper was quickly reinstated, rehiring all of its old staff. Sometime later, ownership of the &quot;Planet&quot; fell into the hands of Bruce Wayne, where it has remained ever since. In the &quot;&quot; storyline, it is named a subsidiary of Wayne Entertainment.

During the &quot;Y2K&quot; storyline (involving the city of Metropolis being infused with futuristic technology thanks to a descendant of the villain Brainiac), the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; building was &quot;upgraded&quot; along with the rest of Metropolis, and a holographic globe replaced the physical one. Eventually due to temporal instabilities caused by the B13 Virus, Metropolis and the Daily Planet building, globe and all, were restored to their former states.

In the current comics and media spinoffs, the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; is presented as a thoroughly modern news operation, including operating an Internet website much like most large newspapers. The &quot;Planet&quot;&#x27;s reporters also have access to the best modern equipment to aid their work, though Perry White has often been shown as still favoring his manual typewriter. In 2008, it was said that Clark (at least in this era/continuity) uses a typewriter at his desk due to his powers causing minor interference in regular desktop computers.

During this era, the &quot;Planet&quot;&#x27;s major competitors in Metropolis include the tabloid newspaper the &quot;Daily Star&quot;, WGBS-TV (which also employed Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant for a time), and Lex Luthor&#x27;s various media operations. A contemporary publication is &quot;Newstime&quot; Magazine, where Clark Kent worked as the editor for a time. The publisher of &quot;Newstime&quot; is Colin Thornton, who is secretly the demon Satanus, an enemy of Superman&#x27;s.

===&quot;Superman: Birthright&quot;===
In the &quot;&quot; limited series, the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;&#x27;s publisher was Quentin Galloway, an abrasive overbearing loudmouth who bullied Jimmy Olsen, and later Clark Kent, before being told off by Lois Lane, whom Galloway could not fire because of her star status. This was meant to be a new origin for Superman but one that applied to the Post-Crisis continuity, so later &quot;Planet&quot; history concerning Luthor temporarily owning it and other events still applied.

===Post-Infinite Crisis===
During the story &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, parts of the Post-Crisis history were altered. These changes were explained gradually over the next several years. The 2009 mini-series &quot;&quot; clarified the earlier history of the &quot;Planet&quot; in the new continuity. The story established that while Lex Luthor, in the revised history, owns every media in Metropolis and uses it to enforce his public image as a wealthy benefactor, the &quot;Planet&quot; had always stood free, refusing him ownership and even condemning his actions in editorials signed by Perry White himself. As a result, when Clark Kent is first inducted into the &quot;Planet&quot;, the newspaper was almost bankrupt, dilapidated and unable to afford new reporters. This changed after Superman begins his career. Thanks to Superman granting exclusive interviews and photographs to Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen when he debuts, the paper&#x27;s circulation increased 700%.

General Sam Lane (Lois&#x27; father) attempted to capture Superman, seeing him as an alien threat. When he failed to do so, he forcibly shut down the &quot;Planet&quot; as part of an attempt to force Perry White and Lois to turn over any information they had on Superman that they haven&#x27;t released to the public. Eventually, Superman turned the public to his favor and Sam Lane was seen in a bad light after his soldier John Corben AKA Metallo ruthlessly endangered civilians. These events lead to the people of Metropolis no longer looking at Lex Luthor as a savior and &quot;The Daily Planet&quot; becomes the city&#x27;s top-selling paper, as well as a major player in media.

In &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #2, the villain Clayface triggers an explosion in The &quot;Daily Planet&quot; building, greatly damaging the offices, leaving many injured and at least one person dead. Lois Lane is hospitalized. Despite the chaos of &quot;Final Crisis&quot; and more than half of humanity being enslaved by evil, the newspaper continues to spread news and inform the public via a printing press in Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude. In &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #7, it is shown functioning once again.

===The New 52===

With the reboot of DC&#x27;s line of comics in 2011, the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; was shown in the &quot;Superman&quot; comics as being bought by Morgan Edge and merged with the Galaxy Broadcasting System, similar to the Silver/Bronze Age continuity. In &quot;Action Comics&quot;, it is revealed that in the new history/universe, Clark Kent begins his journalism career in Metropolis roughly six years before Galaxy Broadcasting merges with the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Along with being a writer for &quot;The Daily Star&quot;, partly because editor George Taylor was a friend of his adopted parents, Clark is an active blogger who speaks against political corruption and reports on the troubles of everyday citizens who are not often the focus of news media. While working at the &quot;Star&quot;, Clark meets &quot;Planet&quot; photographer Jimmy Olsen and the two become friends despite working at rival publications. Clark is also a great fan of Lois Lane&#x27;s work at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, eventually meeting her through Jimmy. Months after Superman makes his public debut, Clark leaves &quot;The Daily Star&quot; on good terms and accepts a position at &quot;The Daily Planet&quot;.

After the merger with Galaxy Broadcasting, Lois was promoted to run the TV division, with Clark acting as an on-the-scene reporter for the TV division. Clark is later assigned the &quot;Superman beat.&quot; But after rising tension between himself and Lois, as well as with Galaxy Broadcasting head Morgan Edge, Clark concludes that the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; is now more concerned with ratings and internet page views than actual journalism. He quits and goes off to begin an independent, internet news site with fellow journalist Cat Grant. Though Lois and Jimmy consider this to be a bad and risky decision, they continue to act as Clark&#x27;s friends and confidants, offering aid when they can.

At the conclusion of the New 52, following the New 52 Superman&#x27;s death, Lex Luthor buys the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.

<doc id="8965" wikidata="Q5275961" url="?curid=8965" title="Digital Private Network Signalling System">
<text>The Digital Private Network Signalling System (DPNSS) is a network protocol used on digital trunk lines for connecting to PABX. It supports a defined set of inter-networking facilities.

DPNSS was originally defined by British Telecom. The specification for the protocol is defined in BTNR188. The specification currently comes under the Network Interoperability Consultative Committee.

==History==
DPNSS was developed in the early 1980s by BT, or its forerunner, Post Office Telecommunications in recognition that the emerging Digital Private Circuit Primary Rate product &#x27;Megastream&#x27; had to address the market for both data and voice, the latter being significantly greater because of the market for PBXs. At the time, BT dictated what signalling could be used on its leased lines and, whilst it only had a minority interest in the sales of PBXs, was requested by the PBX manufacturers to produce a standard to prevent the creation of a plethora of conflicting PBX protocols being developed. Under the liberalization rules of the day (1979), BT was barred from manufacturing, selling or supplying PBXs of more than 200 extensions. Digital (PCM-based) PBXs were just starting to come into the marketplace with the Plessey PDX (a licensed version of the ROLM CBX) and the GEC SL1 (a licensed version of the Northern Telecom SL1). It was recognised that corporate customers would wish to network these systems across the country. At the time, &#x27;CAS&#x27; inter node signaling was slow and inter-register signaling MF5, developed from PSTN signalling protocols, was complex and would not support sufficient features.
The support for DPNSS as BT&#x27;s own signalling protocol also differentiated BT&#x27;s private circuit&#x27;s services from those of its emerging rival Mercury Communications.
DPNSS was an active (and successful) collaboration between PBX manufacturers and BT which started relatively slowly (BT &amp; Plessey) but quickly snowballed with MITEL, GEC, Ericsson, Philips and eventually Nortel all joining to create a powerful and feature rich protocol.
BT and some of the UK manufacturers championed DPNSS into ECMA and CCITT (ITU) but it was eventually deprecated by the standards bodies in favour of Q931 and QSig. Nevertheless, the elegance of the protocol and its compatibility with PBX features ensured the adoption DPNSS actually grew in Europe, compared to the much slower take-up of Qsig.
There were also attempts (during 1984) to take DPNSS into North America. Unfortunately the structures for the creation of standards in North America seemed to prevent manufacturer collaboration as a route forward and the ANSI standards body was not interested in creating PBX interworking standards.
Version 1 of BTNR188 (DPNSS) was issued in 1983; the last version of DPNSS to be released 6 in 1995 included compatibility with ISDN features released in V5. A lightweight version of DPNSS &#x27;APNSS&#x27; was developed using analogue trunks (Sometimes compressed) and a modem to support D channel signalling.

==Overview of the Protocol==
Layer 1(CCITT) ITU-G703 defines the physical and electrical interface. G704 defines the Frame structure of the 2,048 Mbs sent across the link. G732 defines the allocation of that frame structure into the 32 discrete 64 Kbit &#x27;channels&#x27;, of which 0 is used for alignment of the frames and 16 is (by convention only) allocated to common channel signalling. Speech is carried as G711.
Layer 2 Timeslot 16, 64Kbs operates as HDLC LAPB, to support up to 60 PVCs or DLCs (data link connections) (30 directly associated with the bearer channels and 30 for unrelated messages) as the specification describes them. Therefore, at maximum operation, each potential traffic channel can have two simultaneous data channels available for messages. Note that HDLC operates as a statistical multiplexing system. When traffic deltas are low, a single call establishment message will have access to the full 64Kbs (allowing for overheads).
DPNSS is a layer 3 protocol functioning as common channel signalling. The functionality is divided into Levels (confusingly nothing to do with OSI layers.) Levels 1-6 deal with simple call establishment (make call/break call) and are the minimum requirements by which a PBX can be said to be DPNSS compatible. The remaining levels are allocated to telephony features, supplementary services or to administrative features. Note that support of &#x27;levels&#x27; by a PBX is not necessarily incremental. Some levels are interdependent but a PBX may omit support of some levels (above 6) and support others.

DPNSS is a compelled protocol in that each instruction issued must be met with an appropriate response from the other PBX otherwise the message is re-transmitted (until timer expiry). This means that when interworking two PBXs features invoked on PBX A must be acknowledged by PBX B even if that feature is not supported.
DPNSS carries its protocol messages as short strings of IA5 text. It is therefore much easier to interpret in its native form than Q931/Qsig or H323/H450 and a precursor to the plain language format of SIP.

==Practical Considerations==
As HDLC can operate successfully in quite poor (errored) data environments, DPNSS will work over a 2 Mbit/s link running without proper synchronisation (plesiochronously) and over poor quality connections (including badly terminated connectors). When setting up PBXs to run a DPNSS connection one end must be defined as the primary or &#x27;A&#x27; end. This is a protocol requirement and has nothing to do with link synchronisation. However, such badly synchronised links were frowned upon because of the problems associated with sending faxes and/or other modem based communication which were not specifically identified within the protocol.

==DPNSS and VoIP==
For a protocol that began life in the 1980s, DPNSS is natively a long way from VoIP. However, many of the hybrid VoIP PBXs available from manufacturers worldwide provide on-board DPNSS trunk cards. Where they do not, a protocol converter is necessary. Commercially available equipment offers the ability to convert from DPNSS to Q.Sig. Note that it is also possible to tunnel DPNSS and its associated PCM (G711) over an IP network. This can be point to point where the IP network carries packetised voice N x 64 Kbs speech and a separate IP signalling channel to carry the notional 64 Kbs of DPNSS signalling. A more sophisticated solution uses intelligence on the edge of the IP network to route voice to the correct node. This is a Voice VPN.
Note that this should not be confused with the pre-VOIP &#x27;Voice VPN&#x27; deployed by routing calls intelligently in a TDM switching platform, often Nortel DMS100 and customers PBX nodes.

==Criticisms==
Some critics of DPNSS suggest that it is too loosely defined and allows too much latitude in its interpretation of message formats and timers. It is also sometimes mistakenly believed that DPNSS is semi proprietary and that it is only possible to connect PBXs from the same manufacturer. i.e. Siemens will connect to Siemens, Mitel to Mitel etc. Experience indicates that this is not the case and BT&#x27;s FeatureNet platform (Nortel&#x27;s DMS100) running DPNSS, has interconnected successfully to many PBX types available in the UK. In addition, as part of the first commercial implementation of DPNSS (in the Government Telephone Network or GTN in 1983), BT insisted that the core of the network be made from PBXs of different manufacture to prove the interoperability in real life.

<text>Digital Access Signalling System 2 (DASS2) is an obsolescent protocol defined by British Telecom (BT) for digital links to PSTN based on ISDN. Although still available on request, it has been superseded by ETS 300 102 (&quot;EuroISDN&quot;).

DASS2 is an improved version over DASS1, based on experiences with DPNSS. 

In the UK, the ISDN concept was first introduced to customers by BT with their
DASS2 connections. DASS2 (Digital Access Signalling System) is a BT-designed
signalling standard, and was introduced before the Q.931 standard was finalised
by the international community. British Telecom used the term ISDN when
describing their DASS2 lines.

DASS2 lines are provided to customers on a 2 Mbit/s link and can handle 30 simultaneous calls (64 kbit/s each). DASS2 is still offered by BT and other UK carriers. Q.931 is the name of the CCITT document that describes the agreed signalling format for International ISDN. CCITT had previously been known as &quot;International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee&quot;. The organisation set out the internationally agreed standards for telecommunications, and subsequently evolved into the ITU. In the United Kingdom, the Q.931-based protocol is ETS 300 102 (also known as EuroISDN). This is a very close implementation of the original CCITT specification. It is a 2 Mbit/s service as
with DASS2, but the feature capability is far greater and has negated the problems associated with DASS2, including echo problems and circuit spikes. In the UK, both DASS 2 and EuroISDN (ETS 300 102) lines are available to customers with EuroISDN as the preferred signalling type. Customers normally choose the desired signalling system, as this will be dictated by their CPE (Customer Premises Equipment),
usually a PABX.

Most modern PABXs can handle many different types of signalling system, however
the trend seems to be away from the DASS2 (which is no longer being developed by
BT and has been known to deny problems with their DASS2 circuits), and towards the internationally recognised Q.931 standard, which is utilised by many countries&#x27; telephony service providers.

The CCITT specify the standards for the layers 1, 2 and 3 signalling messages. Layer 3 messages are the messages which actually control the call setup, teardown, and routing.

The layer 3 messages or &quot;call control messages&quot; are the minimum messages that must be understood by the interfacing equipment. Individual service providers may
publish their own documentation which details further messages that will be
transported in addition to Q.931 messages. There are a number of additional
European documents that cover supplementary services. These cover features that may be instigated by exchanges via the ISDN and require a higher degree of layer 3 implementation.

<text>Devanagari ( ; in script: , , ) is an Indic script used in the Indian subcontinent. It is a left-to-right abugida (a type of segmental writing system), based on the ancient &quot;Brāhmī&quot; script. It is one of the official scripts of the Republic of India and Nepal. It was developed and in regular use by the 8th century CE and achieved its modern form by 1000 CE. The Devanāgarī script, composed of 48 primary characters, including 14 vowels and 34 consonants, is the fourth most widely adopted writing system in the world, being used for over 120 languages, the most popular of which is Hindi ().

The orthography of this script reflects the pronunciation of the language. Unlike the Latin alphabet, the script has no concept of letter case, meaning the script is a unicameral alphabet. It is written from left to right, has a strong preference for symmetrical, rounded shapes within squared outlines, and is recognisable by a horizontal line, known as a , that runs along the top of full letters. In a cursory look, the Devanāgarī script appears different from other Indic scripts, such as Bengali-Assamese or Gurmukhi, but a closer examination reveals they are very similar, except for angles and structural emphasis.

Among the languages using it as a primary or secondary script are Marathi, Pāḷi, Sanskrit, Hindi, Boro, Nepali, Sherpa, Prakrit, Apabhramsha, Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Braj Bhasha, Chhattisgarhi, Haryanvi, Magahi, Nagpuri, Rajasthani, Khandeshi, Bhili, Dogri, Kashmiri, Maithili, Konkani, Sindhi, Nepal Bhasa, Mundari, Angika, Bajjika and Santali. The Devanāgarī script is closely related to the Nandināgarī script commonly found in numerous ancient manuscripts of South India, and it is distantly related to a number of Southeast Asian scripts.

== Etymology ==
 is formed by the addition of the word () to the word (). is an adjective derived from (), a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;town&quot; or &quot;city&quot;, and literally means &quot;urban&quot; or &quot;urbane&quot;. The word (implicitly modifying , &quot;script&quot;) was used on its own to refer to a North Indian script, or perhaps a number of such scripts, as Al-Biruni attests in the 11th century; the form is attested later, at least by the 18th century. The name of the Nandināgarī script is also formed by adding a prefix to the generic script name . The precise origin and significance of the prefix remains unclear.

== History ==
Devanāgarī is part of the Brahmic family of scripts of India, Nepal, Tibet, and Southeast Asia. It is a descendant of the 3rd century BCE Brāhmī script, which evolved into the Nagari script which in turn gave birth to Devanāgarī and Nandināgarī. Devanāgarī has been widely adopted across India and Nepal to write Sanskrit, Marathi, Hindi, Central Indo-Aryan languages, Konkani, Boro, and various Nepalese languages.

Some of the earliest epigraphic evidence attesting to the developing Sanskrit Nāgarī script in ancient India is from the 1st to 4th century CE inscriptions discovered in Gujarat. Variants of script called , recognisably close to Devanāgarī, are first attested from the 1st century CE Rudradaman inscriptions in Sanskrit, while the modern standardised form of Devanāgarī was in use by about 1000 CE. Medieval inscriptions suggest widespread diffusion of Nāgarī-related scripts, with biscripts presenting local script along with the adoption of Nāgarī scripts. For example, the mid 8th-century Pattadakal pillar in Karnataka has text in both Siddha Matrika script, and an early Telugu-Kannada script; while, the Kangra Jawalamukhi inscription in Himachal Pradesh is written in both Sharada and Devanāgarī scripts.

The Nāgarī script was in regular use by the 7th century CE, and it was fully developed by about the end of first millennium. The use of Sanskrit in Nāgarī script in medieval India is attested by numerous pillar and cave-temple inscriptions, including the 11th-century Udayagiri inscriptions in Madhya Pradesh, and an inscribed brick found in Uttar Pradesh, dated to be from 1217 CE, which is now held at the British Museum. The script&#x27;s prototypes and related versions have been discovered with ancient relics outside India, in places such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Indonesia. In East Asia, the script (considered as the closest precursor to Nāgarī) was in use by Buddhists. Nāgarī has been the of the Indic scripts. It has long been used traditionally by religiously educated people in South Asia to record and transmit information, existing throughout the land in parallel with a wide variety of local scripts (such as Moḍī, Kaithi, and Mahajani) used for administration, commerce, and other daily uses.

Sharada remained in parallel use in Kashmir. An early version of Devanāgarī is visible in the Kutila inscription of Bareilly dated to VS 1049 (992 CE), which demonstrates the emergence of the horizontal bar to group letters belonging to a word. One of the oldest surviving Sanskrit texts from the early post-Maurya period consists of 1,413 Nāgarī pages of a commentary by Patanjali, with a composition date of about 150 BCE, the surviving copy transcribed about 14th century CE.

In Sinja Valley, mid-western Nepal where the Nepali language originates from, the earliest examples of the Devanagari script from the 13th century were found on the cliffs and in nearby Dullu.

=== East Asia ===
In the 7th century, under the rule of Songtsen Gampo of the Tibetan Empire, Thonmi Sambhota was sent to Nepal to open marriage negotiations with a Nepali princess and to find a writing system suitable for the Tibetan language. He then invented the Tibetan script based on the Nāgarī used in Kashmir. He added 6 new characters for sounds that did not exist in Sanskrit.

Other scripts closely related to Nāgarī (such as Siddhaṃ) were introduced throughout East and Southeast Asia from the 7th to the 10th centuries CE: notably in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Japan.

Most of the Southeast Asian scripts have roots in Dravidian scripts, but a few found in south-central regions of Java and isolated parts of southeast Asia resemble Devanāgarī or its prototypes. The Kawi script in particular is similar to the Devanāgarī in many respects, though the morphology of the script has local changes. The earliest inscriptions in the Devanāgarī-like scripts are from around the 10th century CE, with many more between the 11th and 14th centuries.

Some of the old-Devanāgarī inscriptions are found in Hindu temples of Java, such as the Prambanan temple. The Ligor and the Kalasan inscriptions of central Java, dated to the 8th century, are also in the Nāgarī script of north India. According to the epigraphist and Asian Studies scholar Lawrence Briggs, these may be related to the 9th century copper plate inscription of Devapaladeva (Bengal) which is also in early Devanāgarī script. The term kawi in Kawi script is a loan word from (poetry). According to anthropologists and Asian studies scholars John Norman Miksic and Goh Geok Yian, the 8th century version of early Nāgarī or Devanāgarī script was adopted in Java, Bali, and Khmer around the 8th–9th centuries, as evidenced by the many contemporaneous inscriptions of this period.

== Letters ==
The letter order of Devanāgarī, like nearly all Brāhmic scripts, is based on phonetic principles that consider both the manner and place of articulation of the consonants and vowels they represent. This arrangement is usually referred to as the (&quot;garland of letters&quot;). The format of Devanāgarī for Sanskrit serves as the prototype for its application, with minor variations or additions, to other languages.

=== Vowels ===
The vowels and their arrangement are:

# Arranged with the vowels are two consonantal diacritics, the final nasal and the final fricative (called and ). notes of the in Sanskrit that &quot;there is some controversy as to whether it represents a homorganic nasal stop , a nasalised vowel, a nasalised semivowel, or all these according to context&quot;. The represents post-vocalic voiceless glottal fricative , in Sanskrit an allophone of , or less commonly , usually in word-final position. Some traditions of recitation append an echo of the vowel after the breath: . considers the along with letters and for the &quot;largely predictable&quot; velar and palatal nasals to be examples of &quot;phonetic overkill in the system&quot;.
# Another diacritic is the / . describes it as a &quot;more emphatic form&quot; of the , &quot;sometimes used to mark a true [vowel] nasalization&quot;. In a new Indo-Aryan language such as Hindi the distinction is formal: the indicates vowel nasalisation while the indicates a homorganic nasal preceding another consonant: e.g., &quot;laughter&quot;, &quot;the Ganges&quot;. When an has a vowel diacritic above the top line, that leaves no room for the (&quot;moon&quot;) stroke , which is dispensed with in favour of the lone dot: &quot;am&quot;, but &quot;are&quot;. Some writers and typesetters dispense with the &quot;moon&quot; stroke altogether, using only the dot in all situations.
# The ( ) (usually transliterated with an apostrophe) is a Sanskrit punctuation mark for the elision of a vowel in sandhi: ( ← + ) (&quot;this one&quot;). An original long vowel lost to coalescence is sometimes marked with a double : ( ← + ) &quot;always, the self&quot;. In Hindi, states that its &quot;main function is to show that a vowel is sustained in a cry or a shout&quot;: . In Madhyadeshi languages like Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Maithili, etc. which have &quot;quite a number of verbal forms that end in that inherent vowel&quot;, the is used to mark the &quot;non-&quot;elision of word-final inherent , which otherwise is a modern orthographic convention: &quot;sit&quot; versus 
# The syllabic consonants , , and are specific to Sanskrit and not included in the of other languages. The sound represented by has also been largely lost in the modern languages, and its pronunciation now ranges from (Hindi) to (Marathi).
# is not an actual phoneme of Sanskrit, but rather a graphic convention included among the vowels in order to maintain the symmetry of short–long pairs of letters.
# There are non-regular formations of , , and .
# There are two more vowels in Marathi, and , that respectively represent [], similar to the RP English pronunciation of in &quot;act&quot;, and [], similar to the RP pronunciation of in &quot;cot&quot;. These vowels are sometimes used in Hindi too, as in (&quot;dollar&quot;). IAST transliteration is not defined. In ISO 15919, the transliteration is and , respectively.
# Kashmiri Devanagari uses letters like , , , , , , , to represent its vowels (see Kashmiri language#Devanagari).

=== Consonants ===
The table below shows the consonant letters (in combination with inherent vowel ) and their arrangement. To the right of the Devanāgarī letter it shows the Latin script transliteration using International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration, and the phonetic value (IPA) in Hindi.

* Additionally, there is (IPA: or ), the intervocalic lateral flap allophone of the voiced retroflex stop in Vedic Sanskrit, which is a phoneme in languages such as Marathi, Konkani, Garhwali, and Rajasthani.
* Beyond the Sanskritic set, new shapes have rarely been formulated. offers the following, &quot;In any case, according to some, all possible sounds had already been described and provided for in this system, as Sanskrit was the original and perfect language. Hence it was difficult to provide for or even to conceive &quot;other&quot; sounds, unknown to the phoneticians of Sanskrit&quot;. Where foreign borrowings and internal developments did inevitably accrue and arise in New Indo-Aryan languages, they have been ignored in writing, or dealt through means such as diacritics and ligatures (ignored in recitation).
** The most prolific diacritic has been the subscript dot () . Hindi uses it for the Persian, Arabic and English sounds /q/, /x/, /ɣ/, /z/, /ʒ/, and /f/, and for the allophonic developments /ɽ/ and . (Although could also exist, it is not used in Hindi.)
** Devanagari used to write Mahl dialect of Dhivehi uses nukta on , , , , , , to represent other Perso-Arabic phonemes (see Maldivian writing systems#Devanagari script for Mahl).
** Sindhi&#x27;s and Saraiki&#x27;s implosives are accommodated with a line attached below: , , , .
** Aspirated sonorants may be represented as conjuncts/ligatures with : , , , , , , .
** notes Marwari as using for (while represents ).
** When used to write Avestan, Devanagari uses letters like /ʒ/ to represent its sounds.

=== Vowel diacritics ===
The table below shows consonants with common vowel diacritics and their ISO 15919 transliteration. Vowels in their independent form on the top and in their corresponding dependent form (vowel sign) combined with the consonant &quot; on the bottom. &quot; is without any added vowel sign, where the vowel &quot; is inherent.


A vowel combines with a consonant in their diacritic form. For example, the vowel () combines with the consonant () to form the syllabic letter (), with halant (cancel sign) removed and added vowel sign which is indicated by diacritics. The vowel () combines with the consonant () to form () with halant removed. But the diacritic series of , , , (, respectively) is without any added vowel sign, as the vowel () is inherent.

 The combinations of all Sanskrit consonants and vowels, each in alphabetical order, are laid out in the () or () table. In the following table, the IAST transliteration of each combination will appear on mouseover:

=== Old forms ===
The following letter variants are also in use, particularly in older texts and in specific regions:

=== Conjunct consonants ===


As mentioned, successive consonants lacking a vowel in between them may physically join as a conjunct consonant or ligature. When Devanāgarī is used for writing languages other than Sanskrit, conjuncts are used mostly with Sanskrit words and loan words. Native words typically use the basic consonant and native speakers know to suppress the vowel when it is conventional to do so. For example, the native Hindi word is written (). The government of these clusters ranges from widely to narrowly applicable rules, with special exceptions within. While standardised for the most part, there are certain variations in clustering, of which the Unicode used on this page is just one scheme. The following are a number of rules:

* 24 out of the 36 consonants contain a vertical right stroke ( , , etc.). As first or middle fragments/members of a cluster (when letters are to be written as half pronounced), they lose that stroke. e.g. + = , + = , + = . In Unicode, as in Hindi, these consonants without their vertical stems are called &quot;half forms&quot;. appears as a different, simple ribbon-shaped fragment preceding , , , , and , causing these second members to be shifted down and reduced in size. Thus , , , , , and .
* as a first member takes the form of a curved upward dash above the final character or its diacritic. e.g. , , , . In Marathi and Nepali, as a first member of a conjunct also takes on an eyelash form when in front of glides and semivowels. e.g. , . As a final member with , , , , , , it is two lines together below the character pointed downwards. Thus , , , , , . Elsewhere as a final member it is a diagonal stroke extending leftwards and down. e.g. . is shifted up to make the conjunct .
* As first members, remaining characters lacking vertical strokes such as and may have their second member, reduced in size and lacking its horizontal stroke, placed underneath. , , and shorten their right hooks and join them directly to the following member.
* The conjuncts for and are not clearly derived from the letters making up their components. The conjunct for is ( + ) and for it is ( + ).

=== Accent marks ===
The pitch accent of Vedic Sanskrit is written with various symbols depending on shakha. In the Rigveda, is written with a bar below the line (), with a stroke above the line () while is unmarked.

=== Punctuation ===
The end of a sentence or half-verse may be marked with the &quot;&quot; symbol (called a , meaning &quot;bar&quot;, or called a , meaning &quot;full stop/pause&quot;). The end of a full verse may be marked with a double-, a &quot; symbol. A comma (called an &quot;, meaning &quot;short stop/pause&quot;) is used to denote a natural pause in speech. Punctuation marks of Western origin, such as the colon, semicolon, exclamation mark, dash, and question mark have been in use in Devanāgarī script since at least the 1900s, matching their use in European languages.

=== Fonts ===
A variety of Unicode fonts are in use for Devanāgarī. These include Akshar, Annapurna, Arial, CDAC-Gist Surekh, CDAC-Gist Yogesh, Chandas, Gargi, Gurumaa, Jaipur, Jana, Kalimati, Kanjirowa, Lohit Devanagari, Mangal, Kokila, ,Preeti, Raghu, Sanskrit2003, Santipur OT, Siddhanta, and Thyaka.

The form of Devanāgarī fonts vary with function. According to Harvard College for Sanskrit studies: 

The Google Fonts project has a number of Unicode fonts for Devanāgarī in a variety of typefaces in serif, sans-serif, display and handwriting categories.

== Numerals ==


== Transliteration ==

There are several methods of Romanisation or transliteration from Devanāgarī to the Roman script.

=== Hunterian system ===
The Hunterian system is the national system of romanisation in India, officially adopted by the Government of India.

=== ISO 15919 ===

A standard transliteration convention was codified in the ISO 15919 standard of 2001. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brāhmic graphemes to the Latin script. The Devanāgarī-specific portion is nearly identical to the academic standard for Sanskrit, IAST.

=== IAST ===
The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) is the academic standard for the romanisation of Sanskrit. IAST is the de facto standard used in printed publications, like books, magazines, and electronic texts with Unicode fonts. It is based on a standard established by the &quot;Congress of Orientalists&quot; at Athens in 1912. The ISO 15919 standard of 2001 codified the transliteration convention to include an expanded standard for sister scripts of Devanāgarī.

The National Library at Kolkata romanisation, intended for the romanisation of all Indic scripts, is an extension of IAST.

=== Harvard-Kyoto ===
Compared to IAST, Harvard-Kyoto looks much simpler. It does not contain all the diacritic marks that IAST contains. It was designed to simplify the task of putting large amount of Sanskrit textual material into machine readable form, and the inventors stated that it reduces the effort needed in transliteration of Sanskrit texts on the keyboard. This makes typing in Harvard-Kyoto much easier than IAST. Harvard-Kyoto uses capital letters that can be difficult to read in the middle of words.

=== ITRANS ===
ITRANS is a lossless transliteration scheme of Devanāgarī into ASCII that is widely used on Usenet. It is an extension of the Harvard-Kyoto scheme. In ITRANS, the word is written &quot;devanaagarii&quot; or &quot;devanAgarI&quot;. ITRANS is associated with an application of the same name that enables typesetting in Indic scripts. The user inputs in Roman letters and the ITRANS pre-processor translates the Roman letters into Devanāgarī (or other Indic languages). The latest version of ITRANS is version 5.30 released in July 2001. It is similar to Velthuis system and was created by Avinash Chopde to help print various Indic scripts with personal computers.

==== Velthuis ====
The disadvantage of the above ASCII schemes is case-sensitivity, implying that transliterated names may not be capitalised. This difficulty is avoided with the system developed in 1996 by Frans Velthuis for TeX, loosely based on IAST, in which case is irrelevant.

=== ALA-LC Romanisation ===
ALA-LC romanisation is a transliteration scheme approved by the Library of Congress and the American Library Association, and widely used in North American libraries. Transliteration tables are based on languages, so there is a table for Hindi, one for Sanskrit and Prakrit, etc.

=== WX ===

WX is a Roman transliteration scheme for Indian languages, widely used among the natural language processing community in India. It originated at IIT Kanpur for computational processing of Indian languages. The salient features of this transliteration scheme are as follows.
* Every consonant and every vowel has a single mapping into Roman. Hence it is a prefix code, advantageous from computation point of view.
* Lower-case letters are used for unaspirated consonants and short vowels, while capital letters are used for aspirated consonants and long vowels. While the retroflex stops are mapped to &#x27;t, T, d, D, N&#x27;, the dentals are mapped to &#x27;w, W, x, X, n&#x27;. Hence the name &#x27;WX&#x27;, a reminder of this idiosyncratic mapping.

== Encodings ==

=== ISCII ===
ISCII is an 8-bit encoding. The lower 128 codepoints are plain ASCII, the upper 128 codepoints are ISCII-specific.

It has been designed for representing not only Devanāgarī but also various other Indic scripts as well as a Latin-based script with diacritic marks used for transliteration of the Indic scripts.

ISCII has largely been superseded by Unicode, which has, however, attempted to preserve the ISCII layout for its Indic language blocks.

=== Unicode ===
The Unicode Standard defines four blocks for Devanāgarī: Devanagari (U+0900–U+097F), Devanagari Extended (U+A8E0–U+A8FF), Devanagari Extended-A (U+11B00–11B5F), and Vedic Extensions (U+1CD0–U+1CFF).


== Devanāgari keyboard layouts ==


=== InScript layout ===
InScript is the standard keyboard layout for Devanāgarī as standardized by the Government of India. It is inbuilt in all modern major operating systems. Microsoft Windows supports the InScript layout, which can be used to input unicode Devanāgarī characters. InScript is also available in some touchscreen mobile phones.

=== Typewriter ===
This layout was used on manual typewriters when computers were not available or were uncommon. For backward compatibility some typing tools like Indic IME still provide this layout.

=== Phonetic ===

Such tools work on phonetic transliteration. The user writes in the Latin alphabet and the IME automatically converts it into Devanāgarī. Some popular phonetic typing tools are Akruti, Baraha IME and Google IME.

The Mac OS X operating system includes two different keyboard layouts for Devanāgarī: one resembles the INSCRIPT/KDE Linux, while the other is a phonetic layout called &quot;Devanāgarī QWERTY&quot;.

Any one of the Unicode fonts input systems is fine for the Indic language Wikipedia and other wikiprojects, including Hindi, Bhojpuri, Marathi, and Nepali Wikipedia. While some people use InScript, the majority uses either Google phonetic transliteration or the input facility Universal Language Selector provided on Wikipedia. On Indic language wikiprojects, the phonetic facility provided initially was java-based, and was later supported by Narayam extension for phonetic input facility. Currently Indic language Wiki projects are supported by Universal Language Selector (ULS), that offers both phonetic keyboard (Aksharantaran, Marathi: , Hindi: ) and InScript keyboard (Marathi: ).

The Ubuntu Linux operating system supports several keyboard layouts for Devanāgarī, including Harvard-Kyoto, WX notation, Bolanagari and phonetic. The &#x27;remington&#x27; typing method in Ubuntu IBUS is similar to the Krutidev typing method, popular in Rajasthan. The &#x27;itrans&#x27; method is useful for those who know English (and the English keyboard) well but are not familiar with typing in Devanāgarī.

<text>A diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from a state or organization present in another state to represent the sending state or organization officially in the receiving or host state. In practice, the phrase usually denotes an embassy or high commission, which is the main office of a country&#x27;s diplomatic representatives to another country; it is usually, but not necessarily, based in the receiving state&#x27;s capital city. Consulates, on the other hand, are smaller diplomatic missions that are normally located in major cities of the receiving state (but can be located in the capital, typically when the sending country has no embassy in the receiving state). As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, an embassy may also be a nonresident permanent mission to one or more other countries.

The term embassy is sometimes used interchangeably with chancery, the physical office or site of a diplomatic mission. Consequently, the terms &quot;embassy residence&quot; and &quot;embassy office&quot; are used to distinguish between the ambassador&#x27;s residence and the chancery.

==Terminology==
A country may have several different types of diplomatic missions in another country.

;Embassy: Diplomatic mission generally located in the capital city of another country which offers a full range of services, including consular services.
;High commission: Embassy of a Commonwealth country located in another Commonwealth country.
;Permanent mission: Diplomatic mission to a major international organization.
;Consulate-general: Diplomatic mission located in a major city, usually other than the capital city, which provides a full range of consular services.
;Consulate: Diplomatic mission that is similar to a consulate general but may not provide a full range of services.
;Legation: Diplomatic representative office of lower rank than an embassy. Where an embassy was headed by an ambassador, a legation was headed by a minister. Ambassadors outranked ministers and had precedence at official events. Legations were originally the most common form of diplomatic mission, but they fell out of favor after World War II and were upgraded to embassies.
;Honorary Consul: A single person, not a diplomat or consular officer (civil servant), representing another country on an honorary basis with only a limited range of services. Not necessarily a citizen of the country he represents but in most of the cases a citizen of the host country.

The head of an embassy is known as an ambassador or high commissioner. The term &quot;embassy&quot; is commonly used also as a section of a building in which the work of the diplomatic mission is carried out, but strictly speaking, it is the diplomatic delegation itself that is the embassy, while the office space and the diplomatic work done is called the &quot;chancery&quot;. Therefore, the embassy operates in the chancery.

The members of a diplomatic mission can reside within or outside the building that holds the mission&#x27;s chancery, and their private residences enjoy the same rights as the premises of the mission as regards inviolability and protection.

All missions to the United Nations are known simply as &quot;permanent missions&quot;, while EU member states&#x27; missions to the European Union are known as &quot;permanent representations&quot;, and the head of such a mission is typically both a permanent representative and an ambassador. European Union missions abroad are known as EU delegations. Some countries have more particular nomenclature for their missions and staff: a Vatican mission is headed by a &quot;nuncio&quot; (Latin for &quot;envoy&quot;) and consequently known as an &quot;apostolic nunciature&quot;. Under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya&#x27;s missions used the name &quot;people&#x27;s bureau&quot;, headed by a secretary.

Missions between Commonwealth countries are known as &quot;high commissions&quot;, and their heads are high commissioners. Generally speaking, ambassadors and high commissioners are regarded as equivalent in status and function, and embassies and high commissions are both deemed to be diplomatic missions.

In the past, a diplomatic mission headed by a lower-ranking official (an &quot;envoy&quot; or &quot;minister resident&quot;) was known as a &quot;legation&quot;. Since the ranks of envoy and minister resident are effectively obsolete, the designation of &quot;legation&quot; is no longer among the diplomatic ranks used in diplomacy and international relations.

A consulate is similar to, but not the same as a diplomatic office, but with focus on dealing with individual persons and businesses, as defined by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. A consulate or consulate general is generally a representative of the embassy in locales outside of the capital city. For instance, the Philippines has its embassy to the United States in the latter&#x27;s capital, Washington, D.C., but also maintains seven consulates-general in major US cities. The person in charge of a consulate or consulate-general is known as a consul or consul-general, respectively. Similar services may also be provided at the embassy (to serve the region of the capital) in what is normally called a consular section.

In cases of dispute, it is common for a country to recall its head of mission as a sign of its displeasure. This is less drastic than cutting diplomatic relations completely, and the mission will still continue operating more or less normally, but it will now be headed by a &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; (usually the deputy chief of mission) who may have limited powers. A &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires ad interim&quot; also heads the mission during the interim between the end of one chief of mission&#x27;s term and the beginning of another.

==Extraterritoriality==

Contrary to popular belief, diplomatic missions sometimes do not enjoy full extraterritorial status and are generally not sovereign territory of the represented state. The sending state can give embassies sovereign status but this only happens with a minority of countries. Rather, the premises of an embassy remain under the jurisdiction of the host state while being afforded special privileges (such as immunity from most local laws) by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Diplomats themselves still retain full diplomatic immunity, and (as an adherent to the Vienna Convention) the authorities of the host country may not enter the premises of the mission (which means the head of mission&#x27;s residence) without permission of the represented country, even to put out a fire. International rules designate an attack on an embassy as an attack on the country it represents. The term &#x27;extraterritoriality&#x27; is often applied to diplomatic missions, but normally only in this broader sense.

As the host country&#x27;s authorities may not enter the representing country&#x27;s embassy without permission, embassies are sometimes used by refugees escaping from either the host country or a third country. For example, North Korean nationals, who would be arrested and deported from China upon discovery, have sought sanctuary at various third-country embassies in China. Once inside the embassy, diplomatic channels can be used to solve the issue and send the refugees to another country. See the list of people who took refuge in a diplomatic mission for a list of some notable cases.

Notable violations of embassy extraterritoriality include repeated invasions of the British Embassy in Beijing (1967), the hostage crisis at the American embassy in Tehran, Iran (1979–1981), and the hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador&#x27;s residence in Lima, Peru (1996–1997).

==Role==
The basic role of a diplomatic mission is to represent and safeguard the interests of the home country and its citizens in the host country. According to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which establishes the framework of diplomacy among sovereign states:The functions of a diplomatic mission consist, &quot;inter alia&quot;, in representing the sending State in the receiving State; protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, within the limits permitted by international law; negotiating with the Government of the receiving State; ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State, and reporting thereon to the Government of the sending State; promoting friendly relations between the sending State and the receiving State, and developing their economic, cultural and scientific relations.

Diplomatic missions between members of the Commonwealth of Nations are not called embassies, but high commissions, for Commonwealth nations share a special diplomatic relationship. It is generally expected that an embassy of a Commonwealth country in a non-Commonwealth country will do its best to provide diplomatic services to citizens from other Commonwealth countries if the citizen&#x27;s country does not have an embassy in that country. Canadian and Australian nationals enjoy even greater cooperation between their respective consular services, as outlined in the Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement. The same kind of procedure is also followed multilaterally by the member states of the European Union (EU). European citizens in need of consular help in a country without diplomatic or consular representation of their own country may turn to any consular or diplomatic mission of another EU member state (art. 23 TFEU).

==Multiple missions in a city==
Some cities may host more than one mission from the same country.

In Rome, many states maintain separate missions to both Italy and the Holy See. It is not customary for these missions to share premises nor personnel. At present, only the Iraqi and United States embassies to Italy and the Holy See share premises; however, separate ambassadors are appointed, one to each country. In the case of the UN&#x27;s Food Agencies, the sending country&#x27;s ambassador to the Italian Republic is usually accredited as permanent representative. The United States maintains a separate mission to the UN agencies, led by its own ambassador, but is located in the compound that houses its embassies to Italy and the Holy See.

Several cities host both embassies/consulates and permanent representatives to international organizations, such as New York City (United Nations), Washington, D.C. (Organization of American States), Jakarta (ASEAN) and Brussels (European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization).

In some cases, an embassy or consulate is divided between multiple locations in the same city. For example, the Bangladeshi Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, has two locations: one at Park Circus and another, opened later, at Mirza Ghalib Street, to reduce overcrowding.

==Non-diplomatic offices==
Governments of states not recognized by the receiving state and of territories that make no claim to be sovereign states may set up offices abroad that do not have official diplomatic status as defined by the Vienna Convention. Examples are the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Offices that represent the government of the Republic of China; Somaliland&#x27;s Representative Offices in London, Addis Ababa, Rome, Taipei, and Washington, D.C.; the Hong Kong and Macau economic and trade offices that represent the governments of those two territories. Such offices assume some of the non-diplomatic functions of diplomatic posts, such as promoting trade interests and providing assistance to its citizens and residents. They are nevertheless not diplomatic missions, their personnel are not diplomats and do not have diplomatic visas, although there may be legislation providing for personal immunities and tax privileges, as in the case of the Hong Kong offices in London and Toronto or the Macau office in Lisbon, for example.

<doc id="8971" wikidata="Q858065" url="?curid=8971" title="DEC Alpha">
<text>Alpha (original name Alpha AXP) is a 64-bit reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Alpha was designed to replace 32-bit VAX complex instruction set computers (CISC) and to be a highly competitive RISC processor for Unix workstations and similar markets.

Alpha was implemented in a series of microprocessors originally developed and fabricated by DEC. These microprocessors were most prominently used in a variety of DEC workstations and servers, which eventually formed the basis for almost all of their mid-to-upper-scale lineup. Several third-party vendors also produced Alpha systems, including PC form factor motherboards.

Operating systems that support Alpha included OpenVMS (formerly named OpenVMS AXP), Tru64 UNIX (formerly named DEC OSF/1 AXP and Digital UNIX), Windows NT (discontinued after NT 4.0; and prerelease Windows 2000 RC2), Linux (Debian, SUSE, Gentoo and Red Hat), BSD UNIX (NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD up to 6.x), Plan 9 from Bell Labs, and the L4Ka::Pistachio kernel. A port of Ultrix to Alpha was carried out during the initial development of the Alpha architecture, but was never released as a product.

The Alpha architecture was sold, along with most parts of DEC, to Compaq in 1998. Compaq, already an Intel x86 customer, announced that they would phase out Alpha in favor of the forthcoming Hewlett-Packard/Intel Itanium architecture, and sold all Alpha intellectual property to Intel, in 2001, effectively killing the product. Hewlett-Packard purchased Compaq in 2002, continuing development of the existing product line until 2004, and selling Alpha-based systems, largely to the existing customer base, until April 2007.

==History==

===PRISM===

Alpha emerged from an earlier RISC project named Parallel Reduced Instruction Set Machine (PRISM), itself the product of several earlier projects. PRISM was intended to be a flexible design, supporting Unix-like applications, and Digital&#x27;s existing VAX/VMS software, after minor conversion. A new operating system named MICA would support both ULTRIX and VAX/VMS interfaces on a common kernel, allowing software for both platforms to be easily ported to the PRISM architecture.

Started in 1985, the PRISM design was continually changed during its development in response to changes in the computer market, leading to lengthy delays in its introduction. It was not until the summer of 1987 that it was decided that it would be a 64-bit design, among the earliest such designs in a microprocessor format. In October 1987, Sun Microsystems introduced the Sun-4, their first workstation using their new SPARC processor. The Sun-4 runs about three to four times as fast as their latest Sun-3 designs using the Motorola 68020, and any Unix offering from DEC. The plans changed again; PRISM was realigned once again as a 32-bit part and aimed directly at the Unix market. This further delayed the design.

Having watched the PRISM delivery date continue to slip, and facing the possibility of more delays, a team in the Palo Alto office decided to design their own workstation using another RISC processor. After due diligence, they selected the MIPS R2000 and built a working workstation running Ultrix in a period of 90 days. This sparked off an acrimonious debate within the company, which came to a head in a July 1988 management meeting. PRISM appeared to be faster than the R2000, but the R2000 machines could be in the market by January 1989, a year earlier than PRISM. When this proposal was accepted, one of the two original roles for PRISM disappeared. The decision to make a VMS PRISM had already ended by this point, so there was no remaining role. PRISM was cancelled at the meeting.

===RISCy VAX===
As the meeting broke up, Bob Supnik was approached by Ken Olsen, who stated that the RISC chips appeared to be a future threat to their VAX line. He asked Supnik to consider what might be done with VAX to keep it competitive with future RISC systems.

This led to the formation of the &quot;RISCy VAX&quot; team. They initially considered three concepts. One was a cut-down version of the VAX instruction set architecture (ISA) that would run on a RISC-like system and leave more complex VAX instructions to system subroutines. Another concept was a pure RISC system that would translate existing VAX code into its own ISA on-the-fly and store it in a CPU cache. Finally, there was still the possibility of a much faster CISC processor running the complete VAX ISA. Unfortunately, all of these approaches introduced overhead and would not be competitive with a pure-RISC machine running native RISC code.

The group then considered hybrid systems that combined one of their existing VAX one-chip solution and a RISC chip as a coprocessor used for high-performance needs. These studies suggested that the system would inevitably be hamstrung by the lower-performance part and would offer no compelling advantage. It was at this point that Nancy Kronenberg pointed out that people ran VMS, not VAX, and that VMS only had a few hardware dependencies based on its modelling of interrupts and memory paging. There appeared to be no compelling reason why VMS could not be ported to a RISC chip as long as these small bits of the model were preserved. Further work on this concept suggested this was a workable approach.

Supnik took the resulting report to the Strategy Task Force in February 1989. Two questions were raised: could the resulting RISC design also be a performance leader in the Unix market, and should the machine be an open standard? And with that, the decision was made to adopt the PRISM architecture with the appropriate modifications. This became the &quot;EVAX&quot; concept, a follow-on to the successful CMOS CVAX implementation. When management accepted the findings, they decided to give the project a more neutral name, removing &quot;VAX&quot;, eventually settling on Alpha. The name was inspired by the use of &quot;Omega&quot; as the codename of an NVAX-based VAX 4000 model; &quot;Alpha&quot; was intended to signify the beginning of a new line (with reference to Alpha and Omega). Soon after, work began on a port of VMS to the new architecture.

===Alpha===
The new design uses most of the basic PRISM concepts, but was re-tuned to allow VMS and VMS programs to run at reasonable speed with no conversion at all. The primary Alpha instruction set architects were Richard L. Sites and Richard T. Witek. The PRISM&#x27;s Epicode was developed into the Alpha&#x27;s PALcode, providing an abstracted interface to platform- and processor implementation-specific features.

The main contribution of Alpha to the microprocessor industry, and the main reason for its performance, is not so much the architecture but rather its implementation. At that time (as it is now), the microchip industry was dominated by automated design and layout tools. The chip designers at Digital continued pursuing sophisticated manual circuit design in order to deal with the complex VAX architecture. The Alpha chips show that manual circuit design applied to a simpler, cleaner architecture allows for much higher operating frequencies than those that are possible with the more automated design systems. These chips caused a renaissance of custom circuit design within the microprocessor design community.

Originally, the Alpha processors were designated the &quot;DECchip 21x64&quot; series, with &quot;DECchip&quot; replaced in the mid-1990s with &quot;Alpha&quot;. The first two digits, &quot;21&quot; signifies the 21st century, and the last two digits, &quot;64&quot; signifies 64 bits. The Alpha was designed as 64-bit from the start and there is no 32-bit version. The middle digit corresponds to the generation of the Alpha architecture. Internally, Alpha processors were also identified by &quot;EV&quot; numbers, EV officially standing for &quot;Extended VAX&quot; but having an alternative humorous meaning of &quot;Electric Vlasic&quot;, giving homage to the Electric Pickle experiment at Western Research Lab. The number in the EV designations indicated the semiconductor process which the chip was designed for. For example, the EV4 processor used DEC&#x27;s CMOS-4 process.

In May 1997, DEC sued Intel for allegedly infringing on its Alpha patents in designing the original Pentium, Pentium Pro, and Pentium II chips. As part of a settlement, much of DEC&#x27;s chip design and fabrication business was sold to Intel. This included DEC&#x27;s StrongARM implementation of the ARM computer architecture, which Intel marketed as the XScale processors commonly used in Pocket PCs. The core of Digital Semiconductor, the Alpha microprocessor group, remained with DEC, while the associated office buildings went to Intel as part of the Hudson fab.

===Improved models===
The first few generations of the Alpha chips were some of the most innovative of their time.
* A pre-production model, designated &quot;EV3&quot;, was used in a prototype system named the &quot;Alpha Demonstration Unit&quot; (ADU). ADUs were used to port operating systems to the Alpha architecture. One key difference between the EV3 and later models was the absence of a floating-point unit.
* The first version, the &quot;Alpha 21064&quot; or &quot;EV4&quot;, is the first CMOS microprocessor whose operating frequency rivalled higher-powered ECL minicomputers and mainframes. 
* The second, &quot;21164&quot; or &quot;EV5&quot;, is the first microprocessor to place a large secondary cache on-chip.
* The third, &quot;21264&quot; or &quot;EV6&quot;, is the first microprocessor to combine both high operating frequency and the more complicated out-of-order execution microarchitecture. 
* The &quot;21364&quot; or &quot;EV7&quot; is the first high performance processor to have an on-chip memory controller. 
* The unproduced &quot;21464&quot; or &quot;EV8&quot; would have been the first to include simultaneous multithreading, but this version was canceled after the sale of DEC to Compaq. The &quot;Tarantula&quot; research project, which most likely would have been called &quot;EV9&quot;, would have been the first Alpha processor to feature a vector processor unit.

A persistent report attributed to DEC insiders suggests the choice of the &quot;AXP&quot; tag for the processor was made by DEC&#x27;s legal department, which was still smarting from the VAX trademark fiasco. After a lengthy search the tag &quot;AXP&quot; was found to be entirely unencumbered. Within the computer industry, a joke got started that the acronym &quot;AXP&quot; meant &quot;Almost eXactly PRISM&quot;.

==Design principles==
The Alpha architecture was intended to be a high-performance design. Digital intended the architecture to support a one-thousandfold increase in performance over twenty-five years. To ensure this, any architectural feature that impeded multiple instruction issue, clock rate or multiprocessing was removed. As a result, the Alpha does not have:

* Branch delay slots
* Suppressed instructions
* Byte load or store instructions (later added with the Byte Word Extensions (BWX))

===Condition codes===
The Alpha does not have condition codes for integer instructions to remove a potential bottleneck at the condition status register. Instructions resulting in an overflow, such as adding two numbers whose result does not fit in 64 bits, write the 32 or 64 least significant bits to the destination register. The carry is generated by performing an unsigned compare on the result with either operand to see if the result is smaller than either operand. If the test was true, the value one is written to the least significant bit of the destination register to indicate the condition.

==Registers==
The architecture defines a set of 32 integer registers and a set of 32 floating-point registers in addition to a program counter, two lock registers and a floating-point control register (FPCR). It also defines registers that were optional, implemented only if the implementation required them. Lastly, registers for PALcode are defined.

The integer registers are denoted by R0 to R31 and floating-point registers are denoted by F0 to F31. The R31 and F31 registers are hardwired to zero and writes to those registers by instructions are ignored. Digital considered using a combined register file, but a split register file was determined to be better, as it enables two-chip implementations to have a register file located on each chip and integer-only implementations to omit the floating-point register file containing the floating-point registers. A split register file was also determined to be more suitable for multiple instruction issue due to the reduced number of read and write ports. The number of registers per register file was also considered, with 32 and 64 being contenders. Digital concluded that 32 registers was more suitable as it required less die space, which improves clock frequencies. This number of registers was deemed not to be a major issue in respect to performance and future growth, as thirty-two registers could support at least eight-way instruction issue.

The program counter is a 64-bit register which contains a longword-aligned virtual byte address, that is, the low two bits of the program counter are always zero. The PC is incremented by four to the address of the next instruction when an instruction is decoded. A lock flag and locked physical address register are used by the load-locked and store-conditional instructions for multiprocessor support. The floating-point control register (FPCR) is a 64-bit register defined by the architecture intended for use by Alpha implementations with IEEE 754-compliant floating-point hardware.

==Data types==
In the Alpha architecture, a &quot;byte&quot; is defined as an 8-bit datum (octet), a &quot;word&quot; as a 16-bit datum, a &quot;longword&quot; as a 32-bit datum, a &quot;quadword&quot; as a 64-bit datum, and an &quot;octaword&quot; as a 128-bit datum.

The Alpha architecture originally defined six data types:

* Quadword (64-bit) integer
* Longword (32-bit) integer
* IEEE T-floating-point (double precision, 64-bit)
* IEEE S-floating-point (single precision, 32-bit)

To maintain a level of compatibility with the VAX, the 32-bit architecture that preceded the Alpha, two other floating-point data types are included:

* VAX G-floating point (double precision, 64-bit)
* VAX F-floating point (single precision, 32-bit)

VAX H-floating point (quad precision, 128-bit) was not supported, but another 128-bit floating-point option, X-floating point, is available on Alpha, but not VAX.&lt;br&gt;H and X have been described as similar, but not identical. Software emulation for H-floating is available from DEC, as is a source-code level converter named DECmigrate.

==Memory==
The Alpha has a 64-bit linear virtual address space with no memory segmentation. Implementations can implement a smaller virtual address space with a minimum size of 43 bits. Although the unused bits were not implemented in hardware such as TLBs, the architecture required implementations to check whether they are zero to ensure software compatibility with implementations with a larger (or full) virtual address space.

==Instruction formats==
The Alpha ISA has a fixed instruction length of 32 bits. It has six instruction formats.

The integer operate format is used by integer instructions. It contains a 6-bit opcode field, followed by the Ra field, which specifies the register containing the first operand and the Rb field, specifies the register containing the second operand. Next is a 3-bit field which is unused and reserved. A 1-bit field contains a &quot;0&quot;, which distinguished this format from the integer literal format. A 7-bit function field follows, which is used in conjunction with the opcode to specify an operation. The last field is the Rc field, which specifies the register which the result of a computation should be written to. The register fields are all 5 bits long, required to address 32 unique locations, the 32 integer registers.

The integer literal format is used by integer instructions which use a literal as one of the operands. The format is the same as the integer operate format except for the replacement of the 5-bit Rb field and the 3 bits of unused space with an 8-bit literal field which is zero-extended to a 64-bit operand.

The floating-point operate format is used by floating-point instructions. It is similar to the integer operate format, but has an 11-bit function field made possible by using the literal and unused bits which are reserved in integer operate format.

The memory format is used mostly by load and store instructions. It has a 6-bit opcode field, a 5-bit Ra field, a 5-bit Rb field and a 16-bit displacement field.

Branch instructions have a 6-bit opcode field, a 5-bit Ra field and a 21-bit displacement field. The Ra field specifies a register to be tested by a conditional branch instruction, and if the condition is met, the program counter is updated by adding the contents of the displacement field with the program counter. The displacement field contains a signed integer and if the value of the integer is positive, if the branch is taken then the program counter is incremented. If the value of the integer is negative, then program counter is decremented if the branch is taken. The range of a branch thus is ±1 Mi instructions, or ±4 MiB. The Alpha Architecture was designed with a large range as part of the architecture&#x27;s forward-looking goal.

The CALL_PAL format is used by the codice_1 instruction, which is used to call PALcode subroutines. The format retains the opcode field but replaces the others with a 26-bit function field, which contains an integer specifying a PAL subroutine.

==Instruction set==

===Control instructions===
The control instructions consist of conditional and unconditional branches, and jumps. The conditional and unconditional branch instructions use the branch instruction format, while the jump instructions use the memory instruction format.

Conditional branches test whether the least significant bit of a register is set or clear, or compare a register as a signed quadword to zero, and branch if the specified condition is true. The conditions available for comparing a register to zero are equality, inequality, less than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The new address is computed by longword aligning and sign extending the 21-bit displacement and adding it to the address of the instruction following the conditional branch.

Unconditional branches update the program counter with a new address computed in the same way as conditional branches. They also save the address of the instruction following the unconditional branch to a register. There are two such instructions, and they differ only in the hints provided for the branch prediction hardware.

There are four jump instructions. These all perform the same operation, saving the address of the instruction following the jump, and providing the program counter with a new address from a register. They differ in the hints provided to the branch prediction hardware. The unused displacement field is used for this purpose.

===Integer arithmetic===
The integer arithmetic instructions perform addition, multiplication, and subtraction on longwords and quadwords; and comparison on quadwords. There is no instruction(s) for division as the architects considered the implementation of division in hardware to be adverse to simplicity. In addition to the standard add and subtract instructions, there are &quot;scaled&quot; versions. These versions shift the second operand to the left by two or three bits before adding or subtracting. The &quot;Multiply Longword&quot; and &quot;Multiply Quadword&quot; instructions write the least significant 32 or 64 bits of a 64- or 128-bit result to the destination register, respectively. Since it is useful to obtain the most significant half, the &quot;Unsigned Multiply Quadword High&quot; (UMULH) instruction is provided. UMULH is used for implementing multi-precision arithmetic and division algorithms. The concept of a separate instruction for multiplication that returns the most significant half of a result was taken from PRISM.

The instructions that operate on longwords ignore the most significant half of the register and the 32-bit result is sign-extended before it is written to the destination register. By default, the add, multiply, and subtract instructions, with the exception of UMULH and scaled versions of add and subtract, do not trap on overflow. When such functionality is required, versions of these instructions that perform overflow detection and trap on overflow are provided.

The compare instructions compare two registers or a register and a literal and write &#x27;1&#x27; to the destination register if the specified condition is true or &#x27;0&#x27; if not. The conditions are equality, inequality, less than or equal to, and less than. With the exception of the instructions that specify the former two conditions, there are versions that perform signed and unsigned compares.

The integer arithmetic instructions use the integer operate instruction formats.

===Logical and shift===
The logical instructions consist of those for performing bitwise logical operations and conditional moves on the integer registers. The bitwise logical instructions perform AND, NAND, NOR, OR, XNOR, and XOR between two registers or a register and literal. The conditional move instructions test a register as a signed quadword to zero and move if the specified condition is true. The specified conditions are equality, inequality, less than or equal to, less than, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The shift instructions perform arithmetic right shift, and logical left and right shifts. The shift amount is given by a register or literal. Logical and shift instructions use the integer operate instruction formats.

==Extensions==

===Byte-Word Extensions (BWX)===
Later Alphas include byte-word extensions, a set of instructions to manipulate 8-bit and 16-bit data types. These instructions were first introduced in the 21164A (EV56) microprocessor and are present in all subsequent implementations. These instructions perform operations that formerly required multiple instructions to implement, which improves code density and the performance of certain applications. BWX also makes the emulation of x86 machine code and the writing of device drivers easier.

===Motion Video Instructions (MVI)===
Motion Video Instructions (MVI) was an instruction set extension to the Alpha ISA that added instructions for single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations. Alpha implementations that implement MVI, in chronological order, are the Alpha 21164PC (PCA56 and PCA57), Alpha 21264 (EV6) and Alpha 21364 (EV7). Unlike most other SIMD instruction sets of the same period, such as MIPS&#x27; MDMX or SPARC&#x27;s Visual Instruction Set, but like PA-RISC&#x27;s Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions (MAX-1, MAX-2), MVI was a simple instruction set composed of a few instructions that operate on integer data types stored in existing integer registers.

MVI&#x27;s simplicity is due to two reasons. Firstly, Digital had determined that the Alpha 21164 was already capable of performing DVD decoding through software, therefore not requiring hardware provisions for the purpose, but was inefficient in MPEG-2 encoding. The second reason is the requirement to retain the fast cycle times of implementations. Adding many instructions would have complicated and enlarged the instruction decode logic, reducing an implementation&#x27;s clock frequency.

MVI consists of 13 instructions:

===Floating-point Extensions (FIX)===
Floating-point extensions (FIX) are an extension to the Alpha Architecture. It introduces nine instructions for floating-point square-root and for transferring data to and from the integer registers and floating-point registers. The Alpha 21264 (EV6) is the first microprocessor to implement these instructions.

===Count Extensions (CIX)===
Count Extensions (CIX) is an extension to the architecture which introduces three instructions for counting bits. These instructions are categorized as integer arithmetic instructions. They were first implemented on the Alpha 21264A (EV67).

==Implementations==
At the time of its announcement, Alpha was heralded as an architecture for the next 25 years. While this was not to be, Alpha has nevertheless had a reasonably long life. The first version, the &quot;Alpha 21064&quot; (otherwise named the &quot;EV4&quot;) was introduced in November 1992 running at up to 192 MHz; a slight shrink of the die (the &quot;EV4S&quot;, shrunk from 0.75 μm to 0.675 μm) ran at 200 MHz a few months later. The 64-bit processor was a superpipelined and superscalar design, like other RISC designs, but nevertheless outperformed them all and DEC touted it as the world&#x27;s fastest processor. Careful attention to circuit design, a hallmark of the Hudson design team, like a huge centralized clock circuitry, allowed them to run the CPU at higher speeds, even though the microarchitecture was fairly similar to other RISC chips. In comparison, the less expensive Intel Pentium ran at 66 MHz when it was launched the following spring.

The &quot;Alpha 21164&quot; or &quot;EV5&quot; became available in 1995 at processor frequencies of up to 333 MHz. In July 1996 the line was speed bumped to 500 MHz, in March 1998 to 666 MHz. Also in 1998 the &quot;Alpha 21264&quot; (&quot;EV6&quot;) was released at 450 MHz, eventually reaching (in 2001 with the &quot;21264C&quot;/&quot;EV68CB&quot;) 1.25 GHz. In 2003, the &quot;Alpha 21364&quot; or &quot;EV7&quot; &quot;Marvel&quot; was launched, essentially an EV68 core with four 1.6 GB/s inter-processor communication links for improved multiprocessor system performance, running at 1 or 1.15 GHz.

In 1996, the production of Alpha chips was licensed to Samsung Electronics Company. Following the purchase of Digital by Compaq the majority of the Alpha products were placed with API NetWorks, Inc. (formerly Alpha Processor Inc.), a private company funded by Samsung and Compaq. In October 2001, Microway became the exclusive sales and service provider of API NetWorks&#x27; Alpha-based product line.

On June 25, 2001, Compaq announced that Alpha would be phased out by 2004 in favor of Intel&#x27;s Itanium, canceled the planned &quot;EV8&quot; chip, and sold all Alpha intellectual property to Intel. Hewlett-Packard merged with Compaq in 2002; HP announced that development of the Alpha series would continue for a few more years, including the release of a 1.3 GHz EV7 variant named the &quot;EV7z&quot;. This would be the final iteration of Alpha, the 0.13 μm &quot;EV79&quot; also being canceled.

Alpha is also implemented in the &quot;Piranha&quot;, a research prototype developed by Compaq&#x27;s Corporate Research and Nonstop Hardware Development groups at the Western Research Laboratory and Systems Research Center. &quot;Piranha&quot; is a multicore design for transaction processing workloads that contains eight simple cores. It was described at the 27th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture in June 2000.

Early revisions of the Sunway architecture are claimed to be based on Alpha, however since the SW26010, Sunway uses a new instruction set architecture unrelated to Alpha.

===Model history===
;ISA extensions:

* R – Hardware support for rounding to infinity and negative infinity.
* B – BWX, the &quot;Byte/Word Extension&quot;, adding instructions to allow 8- and 16-bit operations from memory and I/O
* M – MVI, &quot;multimedia&quot; instructions
* F – FIX, instructions to move data between integer and floating-point registers and for square root
* C – CIX, instructions for counting and finding bits
* T – support for prefetch with modify intent to improve the performance of the first attempt to acquire a lock

==Performance==
To illustrate the comparative performance of Alpha-based systems, some Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) performance numbers (SPECint95, SPECfp95) are listed below. Note that the SPEC results claim to report the measured performance of a whole computer system (CPU, bus, memory, compiler optimizer), not just the CPU. Also note that the benchmark and scale changed from 1992 to 1995. However, the figures give a rough impression of the performance of the Alpha architecture (64-bit), compared with the contemporary HP (64-bit) and Intel-based offerings (32-bit). Perhaps the most obvious trend is that while Intel could always get reasonably close to Alpha in integer performance, in floating-point performance the difference was considerable. On the other side, HP (PA-RISC) is also reasonably close to Alpha, but these CPUs are running at significantly lower clock rates (MHz). The tables lack two important values: the power consumption and the price of a CPU.


==Alpha-based systems==
The first generation of DEC Alpha-based systems comprise the DEC 3000 AXP series workstations and low-end servers, DEC 4000 AXP series mid-range servers, and DEC 7000 AXP and 10000 AXP series high-end servers. The DEC 3000 AXP systems use the same TURBOchannel bus as the prior MIPS-based DECstation models, whereas the 4000 is based on Futurebus+ and the 7000/10000 share an architecture with corresponding VAX models.

DEC also produced a personal computer (PC) configuration Alpha workstation with an Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus, the DECpc AXP 150 (codename &quot;Jensen&quot;, also named the DEC 2000 AXP). This is the first Alpha system to support Windows NT. DEC later produced Alpha versions of their Celebris XL and Digital Personal Workstation PC lines, with 21164 processors.

Digital also produced single-board computers based on the VMEbus for embedded and industrial use. The first generation includes the 21068-based AXPvme 64 and AXPvme 64LC, and the 21066-based AXPvme 160. These were introduced on March 1, 1994. Later models such as the AXPvme 100, AXPvme 166 and AXPvme 230 are based on the 21066A processor, while the Alpha VME 4/224 and Alpha VME 4/288 are based on the 21064A processor. The last models, the Alpha VME 5/352 and Alpha VME 5/480, are based on the 21164 processor.

The 21066 chip is used in the DEC Multia VX40/41/42 compact workstation and the ALPHAbook 1 laptop from Tadpole Technology.

In 1994, DEC launched a new range of AlphaStation and AlphaServer systems. These use 21064 or 21164 processors and introduced the PCI bus, VGA-compatible frame buffers and PS/2-style keyboards and mice. The AlphaServer 8000 series supersedes the DEC 7000/10000 AXP and also employs XMI and FutureBus+ buses.

The AlphaStation XP1000 is the first workstation based on the 21264 processor. Later AlphaServer/Station models based on the 21264 are categorised into &quot;DS&quot; (departmental server), &quot;ES&quot; (enterprise server) or &quot;GS&quot; (global server) families.

The final 21364 chip is used in the AlphaServer ES47, ES80 and GS1280 models and the AlphaStation ES47.

A number of OEM motherboards were produced by DEC, such as the 21066 and 21068-based AXPpci 33 &quot;NoName&quot;, which was part of a major push into the OEM market by the company, the 21164-based AlphaPC 164 and AlphaPC 164LX, the 21164PC-based AlphaPC 164SX and AlphaPC 164RX and the 21264-based AlphaPC 264DP. Several third parties such as Samsung and API also produced OEM motherboards such as the API UP1000 and UP2000.

To assist third parties in developing hardware and software for the platform, DEC produced Evaluation Boards, such as the EB64+ and EB164 for the Alpha 21064A and 21164 microprocessors respectively.

The 21164 and 21264 processors were used by NetApp in various network-attached storage systems, while the 21064 and 21164 processors were used by Cray in their T3D and T3E massively parallel supercomputers.

===Supercomputers===
The fastest supercomputer based on Alpha processors was the ASCI Q at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The machine was built as an HP AlphaServer SC45/GS Cluster. It had 4096 Alpha (21264 EV-68, 1.25 GHz) CPUs, and reached an Rmax of 7.727 TFLOPS.

<text>A dagger is a fighting knife with a very sharp point and usually one or two sharp edges, typically designed or capable of being used as a cutting or thrusting weapon. Daggers have been used throughout human history for close combat confrontations, and many cultures have used adorned daggers in ritual and ceremonial contexts. The distinctive shape and historic usage of the dagger have made it iconic and symbolic. A dagger in the modern sense is a weapon designed for close-proximity combat or self-defense; due to its use in historic weapon assemblages, it has associations with assassination and murders. Double-edged knives, however, play different sorts of roles in different social contexts. 

A wide variety of thrusting knives have been described as daggers, including knives that feature only a single cutting edge, such as the European rondel dagger or the Afghan pesh-kabz, or, in some instances, no cutting edge at all, such as the stiletto of the Renaissance. However, in the last hundred years or so, in most contexts, a dagger has certain definable characteristics, including a short blade with a sharply tapered point, a central spine or fuller, and usually two cutting edges sharpened the full length of the blade, or nearly so. Most daggers also feature a full crossguard to keep the hand from riding forwards onto the sharpened blade edges.

Daggers are primarily weapons, so knife legislation in many places restricts their manufacture, sale, possession, transport, or use.

==History==
===Antiquity===


The earliest daggers were made of materials such as flint, ivory or bone in Neolithic times.

Copper daggers appeared first in the early Bronze Age, in the 3rd millennium BC, and copper daggers of Early Minoan III (2400–2000 BC) were recovered at Knossos.

In ancient Egypt, daggers were usually made of copper or bronze, while royalty had gold weapons. At least since pre-dynastic Egypt, () daggers were adorned as ceremonial objects with golden hilts and later even more ornate and varied construction. One early silver dagger was recovered with midrib design. The 1924 opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun revealed two daggers, one with a gold blade, and one of smelted iron. It is held that mummies of the Eleventh Dynasty were buried with bronze sabres; and there is a bronze dagger of Thut-mes III. (Eighteenth Dynasty), , and bronze armour, swords and daggers of Mene-ptah II. of the (Nineteenth Dynasty) .

Iron production did not begin until 1200 BC, and iron ore was not found in Egypt, making the iron dagger rare, and the context suggests that the iron dagger was valued on a level equal to that of its ceremonial gold counterpart. These facts, and the composition of the dagger had long suggested a meteoritic origin, however, evidence for its meteoritic origin was not entirely conclusive until June 2016 when researchers using x-ray fluorescence spectrometry confirmed similar proportions of metals (Iron, 10% nickel, and 0.6% cobalt) in a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower.

One of the earliest objects made of smelted iron is a dagger dating to before 2000 BC, found in a context that suggests it was treated as an ornamental object of great value. Found in a Hattic royal tomb dated about 2500 BC, at Alaca Höyük in northern Anatolia, the dagger has a smelted iron blade and a gold handle.

The artisans and blacksmiths of Iberia in what is now southern Spain and southwestern France produced various iron daggers and swords of high quality from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, in ornamentation and patterns influenced by Greek, Punic (Carthaginian), and Phoenician culture. The exceptional purity of Iberian iron and the sophisticated method of forging, which included cold hammering, produced double-edged weapons of excellent quality. One can find technologically advanced designs such as folding knives rusted among the artifacts of many Second Iberian Iron Age cremation burials or in Roman Empire excavations all around Spain and the Mediterranean. Iberian infantrymen carried several types of iron daggers, most of them based on shortened versions of double-edged swords, but the true Iberian dagger had a triangular-shaped blade. Iberian daggers and swords were later adopted by Hannibal and his Carthaginian armies. The Lusitanii, a pre-Celtic people dominating the lands west of Iberia (most of modern Portugal and Extremadura) successfully held off the Roman Empire for many years with a variety of innovative tactics and light weapons, including iron-bladed short spears and daggers modeled after Iberian patterns.

During the Roman Empire, legionaries were issued a &quot;pugio&quot; (from the Latin , or &quot;fight&quot;), a double-edged iron thrusting dagger with a blade of . The design and fabrication of the &quot;pugio&quot; was taken directly from Iberian daggers and short swords; the Romans even adopted the triangular-bladed Iberian dagger, which they called the &quot;parazonium&quot;. Like the &quot;gladius&quot;, the &quot;pugio&quot; was most often used as a thrusting (stabbing weapon). As an extreme close-quarter combat weapon, the &quot;pugio&quot; was the Roman soldier&#x27;s last line of defense. When not in battle, the &quot;pugio&quot; served as a convenient utility knife.

===Middle Ages===

The term &quot;dagger&quot; appears only in the Late Middle Ages, reflecting the fact that while the dagger had been known in antiquity, it had disappeared during the Early Middle Ages, replaced by the hewing knife or seax.
The dagger reappeared in the 12th century as the &quot;knightly dagger&quot;, or more properly cross-hilt or quillon dagger, and was developed into a common arm and tool for civilian use by the late medieval period.
The earliest known depiction of a cross-hilt dagger is the so-called &quot;Guido relief&quot; inside the Grossmünster of Zürich (). A number of depictions of the fully developed cross-hilt dagger are found in the Morgan Bible (). Many of these cross-hilt daggers resemble miniature swords, with cross guards and pommels very similar in form to swords of the period. Others, however, are not an exact match to known sword designs, having for example pommel caps, large hollow star shaped pommels on so-called &quot;Burgundian Heraldic daggers&quot; or antenna style cross and pommel, reminiscent of Hallstatt era daggers. The cross-hilt type persisted well into the Renaissance

The Old French term &quot;dague&quot; appears to have referred to these weapons in the 13th century, alongside other terms such as &quot;poignal&quot; and &quot;basilard&quot;. The Middle English &quot;dagger&quot; is used from the 1380s.

During this time, the dagger was often employed in the role of a secondary defense weapon in close combat. The knightly dagger evolved into the larger baselard knife in the 14th century. During the 14th century, it became fairly common for knights to fight on foot to strengthen the infantry defensive line. This necessitated more use of daggers. At Agincourt (1415) archers used them to dispatch dismounted knights by thrusting the narrow blades through helmet vents and other apertures. The baselard was considered an intermediate between a short sword and a long dagger, and became popular also as a civilian weapon. Sloane MS. 2593 () records a song satirizing the use of oversized baselard knives as fashion accessories. Weapons of this sort called &quot;anelace&quot;, somewhere between a large dagger and a short sword, were much in use in 14th century England as civilians&#x27; accoutrements, worn &quot;suspended by a ring from the girdle&quot;.

In the Late Middle Ages, knives with blade designs that emphasized thrusting attacks, such as the stiletto, became increasingly popular, and some thrusting knives commonly referred to as &#x27;daggers&#x27; ceased to have a cutting edge. This was a response to the deployment of heavy armour, such as maille and plate armour, where cutting attacks were ineffective and focus was on thrusts with narrow blades to punch through mail or aim at armour plate intersections (or the eye slits of the helmet visor). These late medieval thrusting weapons are sometimes classed by the shape of their hilt as either roundel, bollock or ear daggers. The term &quot;dagger&quot; is coined in this time, as are the Early Modern German equivalents &quot;dolch&quot; (&quot;tolch&quot;) and &quot;degen&quot; (&quot;tegen&quot;). In the German school of fencing, Johannes Liechtenauer (Ms. 3227a) and his successors (specifically Andres Lignizer in Cod. 44 A 8) taught fighting with the dagger.

These techniques in some respects resemble modern knife fighting, but emphasized thrusting strokes almost exclusively, instead of slashes and cuts. When used offensively, a standard attack frequently employed the reverse or icepick grip, stabbing downward with the blade to increase thrust and penetrative force. This was done primarily because the blade point frequently had to penetrate or push apart an opponent&#x27;s steel chain mail or plate armour in order to inflict an injury. The disadvantage of employing the medieval dagger in this manner was that it could easily be blocked by a variety of techniques, most notably by a block with the weaponless arm while simultaneously attacking with a weapon held in the right hand. Another disadvantage was the reduction in effective blade reach to the opponent when using a reverse grip. As the wearing of armour fell out of favor, dagger fighting techniques began to evolve which emphasized the use of the dagger with a conventional or forward grip, while the reverse or icepick grip was retained when attacking an unsuspecting opponent from behind, such as in an assassination.

===Renaissance and early modern period===


The dagger was very popular as a fencing and personal defense weapon in 17th and 18th century Spain, where it was referred to as the &quot;daga&quot; or &quot;puñal&quot;. During the Renaissance Age the dagger was used as part of everyday dress, and daggers were the only weapon commoners were allowed to carry on their person. In English, the terms &quot;poniard&quot; and &quot;dirk&quot; are loaned during the late 16th to early 17th century, the latter in the spelling &quot;dork&quot;, &quot;durk&quot; (presumably via Low German, Dutch or Scandinavian &quot;dolk, dolch&quot;, ultimately from a West Slavic &quot;tulich&quot;), the modern spelling &quot;dirk&quot; dating to 18th-century Scots.

Beginning in the 17th century, another form of dagger—the plug bayonet and later the socket bayonet—was used to convert muskets and other longarms into spears by mounting them on the barrel. They were periodically used for eating; the arm was also used for a variety of other tasks such as mending boots, house repairs and farm jobs. The final function of the dagger was as an obvious and ostentatious means of enhancing a man&#x27;s personal apparel, conforming to fashion which dictated that all men carried them.

===Modern period (19th–21st century)===

WW1 trench warfare caused daggers and fighting knives to come back in play. They also replaced the sabres worn by officers, which were too long and clumsy for trench warfare. They were worn with pride as a sign of having served front line duty.

Daggers achieved public notoriety in the 20th century as ornamental uniform regalia during the Fascist dictatorships of Mussolini&#x27;s Italy and Hitler&#x27;s Germany. Dress daggers were used by several other countries as well, including Japan, but never to the same extent. As combat equipment they were carried by many infantry and commando forces during the Second World War. British Commando and other elite units were issued an especially slender dagger, the Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife, developed by William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes from real-life close-combat experiences gained while serving on the Shanghai Municipal Police Force. The F-S dagger proved very popular with the commandos, who used it primarily for sentry elimination. Some units of the U.S. Marine Corps Raiders in the Pacific were issued a similar fighting dagger, the Marine Raider stiletto, though this modified design proved less than successful when used in the type of knife combat encountered in the Pacific theater due to this version using inferior materials and manufacturing techniques.

During the Vietnam War, the Gerber Mark II, designed by US Army Captain Bud Holzman and Al Mar, was a popular fighting knife pattern that was privately purchased by many U.S. soldiers and marines who served in that war.

Aside from military forces, most daggers are no longer carried openly, but concealed in clothing. One of the more popular forms of the concealable dagger is the &quot;boot knife&quot;. The boot knife is nothing more than a shortened dagger that is compact enough to be worn on the lower leg, usually by means of a sheath clipped or strapped to a boot or other footwear.

==Cultural symbolism==
The dagger is symbolically ambiguous. For some cultures and military organizations the dagger symbolizes courage and daring in combat. 

However, daggers may be associated with deception or treachery due to the ease of concealment and surprise that the user could inflict upon an unsuspecting victim. Indeed, many assassinations have been carried out with the use of a dagger, including that of Julius Caesar. A cloak and dagger attack is one in which a deceitful, traitorous, or concealed enemy attacks a person. Some have noted a phallic association between daggers and the succession of royal dynasties in British literature.

In European artwork, daggers were sometimes associated with Hecate, the Ancient Greek goddess of witchcraft.

The social stigma of the dagger originates in its periodic use in the commission of disreputable and murderous attacks, from the 44 BC assassination of Julius Caesar to the use of the stiletto dagger by the Black Hand of early 20th century America. Consequently, it developed a public association with surprise assaults by criminals and murderers intent on stabbing unsuspecting victims. To this day, criminal codes of many nations and some US states specifically ban the carrying of the dagger as a prohibited weapon.

==Modern use==
The dagger is in military use as a close combat and ceremonial arm. 

Many nations use the dagger pattern in the form of the bayonet. Daggers are commonly used as part of the insignias of elite military units or special forces, such as the US Army Special Operations Command, the US Army Special Forces, or the Commando Dagger patch for those who have completed the British All Arms Commando Course.

==Art knives==

Daggers are a popular form of what is known as the &quot;art knife&quot;, due in part to the symmetry of the blade. One of the knives required of an American Bladesmith Society Mastersmith is the construction of an &quot;art knife&quot; or a &quot;European style&quot; dagger.&#x27;

<text>The Order of Preachers (, abbreviated OP), commonly known as the Dominican Order, is a Catholic mendicant order of pontifical right that was founded in France by a Castilian priest named Dominic de Guzmán. It was approved by Pope Honorius III via the papal bull on 22 December 1216. Members of the order, who are referred to as Dominicans, generally display the letters &quot;OP&quot; after their names, standing for , meaning &#x27;of the Order of Preachers&#x27;. Membership in the order includes friars, nuns, active sisters, and lay or secular Dominicans (formerly known as tertiaries). More recently, there have been a growing number of associates of the religious sisters who are unrelated to the tertiaries.

Founded to preach the gospel and to oppose heresy, the teaching activity of the order and its scholastic organisation placed it at the forefront of the intellectual life of the Middle Ages. The order is famed for its intellectual tradition and for having produced many leading theologians and philosophers. In 2018, there were 5,747 Dominican friars, including 4,299 priests. The order is headed by the master of the order who, , is Gerard Timoner III. Mary Magdalene and Catherine of Siena are the co-patronesses of the order.
==Foundation==
The Dominican Order came into being during the Middle Ages at a time when men of God were no longer expected to stay behind the walls of a cloister. Instead, they travelled among the people, taking as their examples the apostles of the primitive Church. Out of this ideal emerged two orders of mendicant friars – one, the Friars Minor, led by Francis of Assisi; the other, the Friars Preachers, led by Dominic de Guzmán. Like his contemporary, Francis, Dominic saw the need for a new type of organization, and the quick growth of the Dominicans and Franciscans during their first century of existence confirms that conditions were favorable for the growth of the orders of mendicant friars. The Dominicans and other mendicant orders may have been an adaptation to the rise of the profit economy in medieval Europe.

Dominic sought to establish a new kind of order, one that would bring the dedication and systematic education of the older monastic orders like the Benedictines to bear on the religious problems of the burgeoning population of cities, but with more organizational flexibility than either monastic orders or the secular clergy. The Order of Preachers was founded in response to a perceived need for informed preaching. Dominic&#x27;s new order was to be trained to preach in the vernacular languages.

Dominic inspired his followers with loyalty to learning and virtue, a deep recognition of the spiritual power of worldly deprivation and the religious state, and a highly developed governmental structure. At the same time, Dominic inspired the members of his order to develop a &quot;mixed&quot; spirituality. They were both active in preaching, and contemplative in study, prayer and meditation. The brethren of the Dominican Order were urban and learned, as well as contemplative and mystical in their spirituality. While these traits affected the women of the order, the nuns especially absorbed the latter characteristics and made those characteristics their own. In England, the Dominican nuns blended these elements with the defining characteristics of English Dominican spirituality and created a spirituality and collective personality that set them apart.

===Dominic de Guzmán===
As an adolescent, Dominic de Guzmán had a particular love of theology, and the Scriptures became the foundation of his spirituality. During his studies in Palencia, Spain, there was a dreadful famine, prompting Dominic to sell all of his beloved books and other equipment to help his neighbours. He was made a canon and ordained to the priesthood in the monastery of Santa María de La Vid. After completing his studies, Bishop Martin Bazan and Prior Diego de Acebo appointed him to the cathedral chapter of Osma.

===Preaching to the Cathars===
In 1203, Dominic de Guzmán joined Diego de Acebo, the Bishop of Osma, on a diplomatic mission to Denmark for the monarchy of Spain, to arrange the marriage between the son of King Alfonso VIII of Castile and a niece of King Valdemar II of Denmark. At that time the south of France was the stronghold of the Cathar movement. The Cathars (also known as Albigensians, due to their stronghold in Albi, France) were considered a heretical neo-gnostic sect. They believed that matter was evil and only the spirit was good; this was a fundamental challenge to the notion of the incarnation, central to Catholic theology. The Albigensian Crusade (1209–1229) was a 20-year military campaign initiated by Pope Innocent III to eliminate Catharism in Languedoc, in southern France.

Dominic saw the need for a response that would attempt to sway members of the Albigensian movement back to mainstream Catholic thought. Dominic became inspired to achieve this by preaching and teaching, starting near Toulouse, since the Albigensian Christians refused to compromise their principles despite the overwhelming force of the crusades brought against them. Diego suggested another reason that was possibly aiding the spread of the reform movement. The representatives of the Catholic Church acted and moved with an offensive amount of pomp and ceremony. In contrast, the Cathars generally led ascetic lifestyles. To try persuasion in place of persecution, Diego suggested that the regional papal legates begin to live a reformed apostolic life. The legates agreed to the proposed changes if they could find a strong leader who could meet the Albigensians on their own ground.
The prior took up the challenge, and he and Dominic dedicated themselves to the conversion of the Cathars. Despite this particular mission, Dominic met limited success converting Cathars by persuasion, &quot;for though in his ten years of preaching a large number of converts were made, it has to be said that the results were not such as had been hoped for&quot;. The differences in religious principles of the Albigensians called for far greater reforms than moderated appearances.

===Dominican convent established===
Dominic became the spiritual father to several Albigensian women he had reconciled to the faith, and in 1206 he established them in a convent in Prouille, near Toulouse. This convent would become the foundation of the Dominican nuns, thus making the Dominican nuns older than the Dominican friars. Diego sanctioned the building of a monastery for girls whose parents had sent them to the care of the Albigensians because their families were too poor to fulfill their basic needs. The monastery in Prouille would later become Dominic&#x27;s headquarters for his missionary effort. After two years on the mission field, Diego died while travelling back to Spain.

==History==
Dominic founded the Dominican Order in 1215. Dominic established a religious community in Toulouse in 1214, to be governed by the rule of Saint Augustine and statutes to govern the life of the friars, including the Primitive Constitution. The founding documents establish that the order was founded for two purposes: preaching and the salvation of souls.

Henri-Dominique Lacordaire noted that the statutes had similarities with the constitutions of the Premonstratensians, indicating that Dominic had drawn inspiration from the reform of Prémontré.

===Middle Ages===
In July 1215, with the approbation of Bishop Foulques of Toulouse, Dominic ordered his followers into an institutional life. Its purpose was revolutionary in the pastoral ministry of the Catholic Church. These priests were organized and well trained in religious studies. Dominic needed a framework—a rule—to organize these components. The Rule of Saint Augustine was an obvious choice for the Dominican Order, according to Dominic&#x27;s successor Jordan of Saxony, in the Libellus de principiis, because it lent itself to the &quot;salvation of souls through preaching&quot;. By this choice, however, the Dominican brothers designated themselves not monks, but canons regular. They could practice ministry and common life while existing in individual poverty.
The Order of Preachers was approved in December 1216 and January 1217 by Pope Honorius III in the papal bulls and . On January 21, 1217, Honorius issued the bull recognizing Dominic&#x27;s followers as an order dedicated to study and universally authorized to preach, a power formerly reserved to local episcopal authorization.

Along with charity, the other concept that most defines the work and spirituality of the order is study, the method most used by the Dominicans in working to defend the church against the perils it faced. In Dominic&#x27;s thinking, it was impossible for men to preach what they did not or could not understand. On August 15, 1217, Dominic dispatched seven of his followers to the great university center of Paris to establish a priory focused on study and preaching. The Convent of St. Jacques would eventually become the order&#x27;s first . Dominic was to establish similar foundations at other university towns of the day, Bologna in 1218, Palencia and Montpellier in 1220, and Oxford just before his death in 1221. The women of the order also established schools for the children of the local gentry.
In 1219, Pope Honorius III invited Dominic and his companions to take up residence at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina, which they did by early 1220. Before that time the friars had only a temporary residence in Rome at the convent of San Sisto Vecchio which Honorius III had given to Dominic circa 1218 intending it to become a convent for a reformation of nuns at Rome under Dominic&#x27;s guidance. In May 1220 at Bologna the order&#x27;s first General Chapter mandated that each new priory of the order maintain its own , thus laying the foundation of the Dominican tradition of sponsoring widespread institutions of learning. The official foundation of the Dominican convent at Santa Sabina with its occurred with the legal transfer of property from Honorius III to the Order of Preachers on June 5, 1222. This was transformed into the order&#x27;s first by Thomas Aquinas in 1265. Part of the curriculum of this was relocated in 1288 at the of Santa Maria sopra Minerva which in the 16th century world be transformed into the College of Saint Thomas (). In the 20th century the college would be relocated to the convent of Saints Dominic and Sixtus and would be transformed into the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;.

The Dominican friars quickly spread, including to England, where they appeared in Oxford in 1221. In the 13th century the order reached all classes of Christian society, fought heresy, schism, and paganism by word and book, and by its missions to the north of Europe, to Africa, and Asia passed beyond the frontiers of Christendom. Its schools spread throughout the entire church; its doctors wrote monumental works in all branches of knowledge, including the extremely important Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas. Its members included popes, cardinals, bishops, legates, inquisitors, confessors of princes, ambassadors, and (enforcers of the peace decreed by popes or councils).
The order&#x27;s origins in battling heterodoxy influenced its later development and reputation. Many later Dominicans battled heresy as part of their apostolate; many years after Dominic reacted to the Cathars, the first Grand Inquistor of Spain, Tomás de Torquemada, would be drawn from the Dominican Order. The order was appointed by Pope Gregory IX the duty to carry out the Inquisition. Torture was not regarded as a mode of punishment, but as a means of eliciting the truth. In his papal bull of 1252, Pope Innocent IV authorised the Dominicans&#x27; use of torture under prescribed circumstances.

The expansion of the order produced changes. A smaller emphasis on doctrinal activity favoured the development here and there of the ascetic and contemplative life and there sprang up, especially in Germany and Italy, the mystical movement with which the names of Meister Eckhart, Heinrich Suso, Johannes Tauler, and Catherine of Siena are associated. (See German mysticism, which has also been called &quot;Dominican mysticism&quot;.) This movement was the prelude to the reforms undertaken, at the end of the century, by Raymond of Capua, and continued in the following century.
At the same time, the order found itself face to face with the Renaissance. It struggled against pagan tendencies in Renaissance humanism, in Italy through Dominici and Savonarola, in Germany through the theologians of Cologne but it also furnished humanism with such advanced writers as Francesco Colonna (probably the writer of the ) and Matteo Bandello. Many Dominicans took part in the artistic activity of the age, the most prominent being Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolomeo.

====Women====
Although Dominic and the early brethren had instituted female Dominican houses at Prouille and other places by 1227, houses of women attached to the Order became so popular that some of the friars had misgivings about the increasing demands of female religious establishments on their time and resources. Nonetheless, women&#x27;s houses dotted the countryside throughout Europe. There were 74 Dominican female houses in Germany, 42 in Italy, 9 in France, 8 in Spain, 6 in Bohemia, 3 in Hungary, and 3 in Poland. Many of the German religious houses that lodged women had been home to communities of women, such as Beguines, that became Dominican once they were taught by the traveling preachers and put under the jurisdiction of the Dominican authoritative structure. A number of these houses became centers of study and mystical spirituality in the 14th century, as expressed in works such as the sister-books. There were 157 nunneries in the order by 1358. After that year, the number lessened considerably due to the Black Death.

In places besides Germany, convents were founded as retreats from the world for women of the upper classes. These were original projects funded by wealthy patrons. Among these was Countess Margaret of Flanders who established the monastery of Lille, while Val-Duchesse at Oudergem near Brussels was built with the wealth of Adelaide of Burgundy, Duchess of Brabant (1262).
Female houses differed from male Dominican houses in that they were enclosed. The sisters chanted the Divine Office and kept all the monastic observances. The nuns lived under the authority of the general and provincial chapters of the order. They shared in all the applicable privileges of the order. The friars served as their confessors, priests, teachers and spiritual mentors.

Women could be professed to the Dominican religious life at the age of 13. The formula for profession contained in the Constitutions of Montargis Priory (1250) requires that nuns pledge obedience to God, the Blessed Virgin, their prioress and her successors according to the Rule of Saint Augustine and the institute of the order, until death. The clothing of the sisters consisted of a white tunic and scapular, a leather belt, a black mantle, and a black veil. Candidates to profession were questioned to reveal whether they were actually married women who had merely separated from their husbands. Their intellectual abilities were also tested. Nuns were to be silent in places of prayer, the cloister, the dormitory, and refectory. Silence was maintained unless the prioress granted an exception for a specific cause. Speaking was allowed in the common parlor, but it was subordinate to strict rules, and the prioress, subprioress or other senior nun had to be present.

As well as sewing, embroidery and other genteel pursuits, the nuns participated in a number of intellectual activities, including reading and discussing pious literature. In the Strassburg monastery of Saint Margaret, some of the nuns could converse fluently in Latin. Learning still had an elevated place in the lives of these religious. In fact, Margarette Reglerin, a daughter of a wealthy Nuremberg family, was dismissed from a convent because she did not have the ability or will to learn.

====English Province====
The English Province and the Hungarian Province both date back to the second general chapter of the Dominican Order, held in Bologna during the spring of 1221.

Dominic dispatched 12 friars to England under the guidance of their English prior, Gilbert of Fresney, and they landed in Dover on August 5, 1221. The province officially came into being at its first provincial chapter in 1230.

The English Province was a component of the international order from which it obtained its laws, direction, and instructions. It was also, however, a group of Englishmen. Its direct supervisors were from England, and the members of the English Province dwelt and labored in English cities, towns, villages, and roadways. English and European ingredients constantly came in contact. The international side of the province&#x27;s existence influenced the national, and the national responded to, adapted, and sometimes constrained the international.

The first Dominican site in England was at Oxford, in the parishes of St. Edward and St. Adelaide. The friars built an oratory to the Blessed Virgin Mary and by 1265, the brethren, in keeping with their devotion to study, began erecting a school. The Dominican brothers likely began a school immediately after their arrival, as priories were legally schools. Information about the schools of the English Province is limited, but a few facts are known. Much of the information available is taken from visitation records. The &quot;visitation&quot; was an inspection of the province by which visitors to each priory could describe the state of its religious life and its studies at the next chapter. There were four such visits in England and Wales—Oxford, London, Cambridge and York. All Dominican students were required to learn grammar, old and new logic, natural philosophy and theology. Of all of the curricular areas, however, theology was the most important.

Dartford Priory was established long after the primary period of monastic foundation in England had ended. It emulated, then, the monasteries found in Europe—mainly France and Germany-as well as the monastic traditions of their English Dominican brothers. The first nuns to inhabit Dartford were sent from the in France. Even on the eve of the Dissolution, Prioress Jane Vane wrote to Cromwell on behalf of a postulant, saying that though she had not actually been professed, she was professed in her heart and in the eyes of God. Profession in Dartford Priory seems, then, to have been made based on personal commitment, and one&#x27;s personal association with God.

As heirs of the Dominican priory of Poissy in France, the nuns of Dartford Priory in England were also heirs to a tradition of profound learning and piety. Strict discipline and plain living were characteristic of the monastery throughout its existence.

===From the Reformation to the French Revolution===
Bartolomé de Las Casas, as a settler in the New World, was galvanized by witnessing the brutal torture and genocide of the Native Americans by the Spanish colonists. He became famous for his advocacy of the rights of Native Americans, whose cultures, especially in the Caribbean, he describes with care.

Gaspar da Cruz (), who worked all over the Portuguese colonial empire in Asia, was probably the first Christian missionary to preach (unsuccessfully) in Cambodia. After a (similarly unsuccessful) stint, in 1556, in Guangzhou, China, he eventually returned to Portugal and became the first European to publish a book devoted exclusively to China in 1569/1570.

The beginning of the 16th century confronted the order with the upheavals of Reformation. The spread of Protestantism cost it six or seven provinces and several hundreds of convents, but the discovery of the New World opened up a fresh field of activity. In the 18th century, there were numerous attempts at reform, accompanied by a reduction in the number of devotees. The French Revolution ruined the order in France, and crises that more or less rapidly followed considerably lessened or wholly destroyed numerous provinces.

=== 18th century ===
In 1731, a book entitled &quot;The second volume of the history of the Province of Spain of the Order of Preachers, chronicling the progress of their foundations and the lives of illustrious figures,&quot; was written by the chronicler of the Order of Preachers and the province of Spain, the General Preacher Fr. Manuel Joseph de Medrano, Prior of the convent of Santo Domingo in Guadalajara. Medrano, a native of Logroño, dedicated his book to, and under the protection of the Illustrious and Reverend Lord D. Fr. Francisco Lasso de la Vega y Cordova, bishop of Plasencia, with privilege, printed in Madrid at the printing press of Geronimo Roxo.

===From the 19th century to the present===
During the early 19th century, the number of Preachers seems never to have sunk below 3,500. Statistics for 1876 show 3,748, but 500 of these had been expelled from their convents and were engaged in work. Statistics for 1910 show a total of 4,472 nominally or actually engaged in proper activities of the order. , there were 6,058 Dominican friars, including 4,470 priests.
, there were 5,753 friars overall, and 4,219 priests.

France held a foremost place in the revival movement, owing to the reputation and convincing power of the orator, Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire (1802–1861). He took the habit of a Friar Preacher at Rome (1839), and the province of France was canonically erected in 1850. From this province were detached the province of Lyon, called Occitania (1862), that of Toulouse (1869), and that of Canada (1909). The French restoration likewise furnished many laborers to other provinces, to assist in their organization and progress. From it came the master general who remained longest at the head of the administration during the 19th century, Père Vincent Jandel (1850–1872). Here should be mentioned the province of Saint Joseph in the United States. Founded in 1805 by Edward Fenwick (1768–1832), afterwards first Bishop of Cincinnati, Ohio (1821–1832). In 1905, it established the Dominican House of Studies in Washington, D.C..

The province of France has produced many preachers. The conferences of Notre-Dame-de-Paris were inaugurated by Père Lacordaire. The Dominicans of the province of France furnished Lacordaire (1835–1836, 1843–1851), Jacques Monsabré, and Joseph Ollivier. The pulpit of Notre Dame has been occupied by a succession of Dominicans. Père Henri Didon (1840–1900) was a Dominican. The house of studies of the province of France publishes (founded 1859), (1907), and (1909). French Dominicans founded and administer the founded in 1890 by Marie-Joseph Lagrange (1855–1938), one of the leading international centres for biblical research. It is at the that the famed Jerusalem Bible (both editions) was prepared. Likewise Cardinal Yves Congar was a product of the French province of the Order of Preachers.

Doctrinal development has had an important place in the restoration of the Preachers. Several institutions, besides those already mentioned, played important parts. Such is the at Jerusalem, open to the religious of the order and to secular clerics, which publishes the . The , the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas () established in Rome in 1908 by Master Hyacinth Cormier, opened its doors to regulars and seculars for the study of the sacred sciences. In addition to the reviews above are the , founded by Père Thomas Coconnier ( 1908), and the (1893). Among numerous writers of the order in this period are: Cardinals Thomas Zigliara ( 1893) and Zephirin González ( 1894), two esteemed philosophers; Alberto Guillelmotti ( 1893), historian of the Pontifical Navy, and historian Heinrich Denifle ( 1905).

During the Reformation, many of the convents of Dominican nuns were forced to close. One which managed to survive, and afterwards founded many new houses, was St Ursula&#x27;s in Augsburg. In the 17th century, convents of Dominican women were often asked by their bishops to undertake apostolic work, particularly educating girls and visiting the sick. St Ursula&#x27;s returned to an enclosed life in the 18th century, but in the 19th century, after Napoleon had closed many European convents, King Louis I of Bavaria in 1828 restored the Religious Orders of women in his realm, provided that the nuns undertook some active work useful to the State (usually teaching or nursing). In 1877, Bishop Ricards in South Africa requested that Augsburg send a group of nuns to start a teaching mission in King Williamstown. From this mission were founded many Third Order Regular congregations of Dominican sisters, with their own constitutions, though still following the Rule of Saint Augustine and affiliated to the Dominican Order. These include the Dominican Sisters of Oakford, KwazuluNatal (1881), the Dominican Missionary Sisters, Zimbabwe, (1890) and the Dominican Sisters of Newcastle, KwazuluNatal (1891).

The Dominican Order has influenced the formation of other orders outside of the Catholic Church, such as the Anglican Order of Preachers within the Anglican Communion. Since not all members are obliged to take solemn or simple vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, it operates more like a third order with a third order style structure, with no contemporary or canonical ties to the historical order founded by Dominic of Guzman. The Order of Christ the Saviour is a dispersed Anglo-Catholic Dominican community founded in the 21st century within the Episcopal Church.

===Missions abroad===
The Pax Mongolica of the 13th and 14th centuries that united vast parts of the European-Asian continents enabled Western missionaries to travel east. &quot;Dominican friars were preaching the Gospel on the Volga Steppes by 1225 (the year following the establishment of the Kipchak Khanate by Batu), and in 1240 Pope Gregory IX despatched others to Persia and Armenia.&quot; The most famous Dominican was Jordanus de Severac who was sent first to Persia then in 1321, together with a companion (Nicolas of Pistoia) to India. Jordanus&#x27; work and observations are recorded in two letters he wrote to the friars of Armenia, and a book, , translated as &quot;Wonders of the East&quot;.

Another Dominican, Ricold of Monte Croce, worked in Syria and Persia. His travels took him from Acre to Tabriz, and on to Baghdad. There &quot;he was welcomed by the Dominican fathers already there, and with them entered into a disputation with the Nestorians.&quot; Although a number of Dominicans and Franciscans persevered against the growing faith of Islam throughout the region, all Christian missionaries were soon expelled with Timur&#x27;s death in 1405.

By the 1850s, the Dominicans had half a million followers in the Philippines and well-established missions in the Chinese province of Fujian and Tonkin, Vietnam, performing thousands of baptisms each year. The Dominicans presence in the Philippines has become one of the leading proponents of education with the establishment of Colegio de San Juan de Letran.

==Divisions==
The Friars, Nuns and Third Orders form the Order of Preachers. Together with the Members of Priestly Fraternities of Saint Dominic, Dominican Laity, Associates and Dominican Youths they form the Dominican family.

===Governance===
The highest authority within the Order of Preachers is the General Chapter, which is empowered to develop legislation governing all organizations within the Dominican umbrella, as well as enforce that legislation. The General Chapter is composed of two bodies, the Chapter of Provincials and the Chapter of Definitors (or &quot;Diffinitors&quot;), a unique configuration within the Catholic Church. Each body is of equal authority to propose legislation and discuss other matters of general importance within the order, and each body may be called individually or jointly. The Provincials consists of the superiors of individual Dominican provinces, while the Diffinitors consists of &quot;grass root&quot; representatives of each province, so created to avoid provincial superiors having to spend excessive time away from their day-to-day duties of governing. To maintain stability of the legislation of the order, new legislation is enacted only when approved by three successive meetings of the General Chapter.

The first General Chapters were held at Pentecost in the years 1220 and 1221. More recent General Chapters have been held as follows:
*1998 – Bologna, Italy 
*2001 – Providence, USA 
*2004 – Kraków, Poland
*2010 – 290th General Chapter, 1–21 September 2010, Rome, which elaborated the &quot;mission mandates&quot; of the order.
*2016 – Bologna
*2019 – Elective General Chapter, 9 July – 4 August 2019, at the Convent of St. Martin de Porres, Biên Hòa, Viet Nam
*2022 – 16 July – 8 August 2022, Tultenango in the State of Mexico, a Chapter of Definitors.

The General Chapter elects a Master of the Order, who has &quot;broad and direct authority over every brother, convent and province, and over every nun and monastery&quot;. The master is considered the successor of Dominic, the first Master of the Order, who envisioned the office to be one of service to the community. The master is currently elected for a 9-year term, and is aided by the General Curia of the Order. His authority is subject only to the General Chapter. He, along with the General Chapter, may assign members, and appoint or remove superiors and other officials for the good of the order.

===Nuns===
The Dominican nuns were founded by Dominic even before he had established the friars. They are contemplatives in the cloistered life. The nuns celebrated their 800th anniversary in 2006. Some monasteries raise funds for their operations by producing religious articles such as priestly vestments or baking communion wafers.

===Friars===
Friars are male members of the order, and consist of members ordained to the priesthood as well as non-ordained members, known as cooperator brothers. Both priests and cooperators participate in a variety of ministries, including preaching, parish assignments, educational ministries, social work, and related fields. Dominican life is organized into four pillars that define the order&#x27;s chrism: prayer, study, community and preaching. Dominicans are known for their intellectual rigor that informs their preaching, as well as engaging in academic debate with contemporary scholars. A significant period of academic study is required prior to taking final vows of membership.

=== Sisters===

Women have been part of the Dominican Order since the beginning, but distinct active congregations of Dominican sisters in their current form are largely a product of the nineteenth century and afterward. They draw their origins both from the Dominican nuns and the communities of women tertiaries (laywomen) who lived in their own homes and gathered regularly to pray and study: the most famous of these was the Mantellates attached to Saint Dominic&#x27;s church in Siena, to which Catherine of Siena belonged. In the seventeenth century, some European Dominican monasteries (e.g. St Ursula&#x27;s, Augsburg) temporarily became no longer enclosed, so they could engage in teaching or nursing or other work in response to pressing local need. Any daughter houses they founded, however, became independent. But in the nineteenth century, in response to increasing missionary fervor, monasteries were asked to send groups of women to found schools and medical clinics around the world. Large numbers of Catholic women traveled to Africa, the Americas, and the East to teach and support new communities of Catholics there, both settlers and converts. Owing to the large distances involved, these groups needed to be self-governing, and they frequently planted new self-governing congregations in neighboring mission areas in order to respond more effectively to the perceived pastoral needs. Following on from this period of growth in the nineteenth century, and another great period of growth in those joining these congregations in the 1950s, there are currently 24,600 Sisters belonging to 150 Dominican Religious Congregations present in 109 countries affiliated to Dominican Sisters International.

As well as the friars, Dominican sisters live their lives supported by four common values, often referred to as the Four Pillars of Dominican Life, they are community life, common prayer, study, and service. Dominic called this fourfold pattern of life &quot;holy preaching&quot;. Henri Matisse was so moved by the care that he received from the Dominican Sisters that he collaborated in the design and interior decoration of their Chapelle du Saint-Marie du Rosaire in Vence, France.

===Priestly Fraternities of St. Dominic===
The Priestly Fraternities of St. Dominic consist of diocesan priests who are formally affiliated to, and &quot;true members&quot; of, the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) through a Rule of life that they profess, and who strive for evangelical perfection under the overall direction of the Dominican friars. The origins of the Dominican fraternities can be traced from the Dominican third Order secular, which then included both priests and lay persons as members. Now existing as a separate association from that of the laity, and with its own distinct rule to follow, the Priestly Fraternities of St. Dominic continue to be guided by the Order in embracing the gift of the spirituality of Dominic in the unique context of the diocesan priesthood. Along with the special grace of the Sacrament of Holy Orders, which helps them to perform the acts of the sacred ministry worthily, they receive new spiritual help from the profession, which makes them members of the Dominican Family and sharers in the grace and mission of the Order. While the Order provides them with these spiritual aids and directs them to their own sanctification, it leaves them free for the complete service of the local Church, under the jurisdiction of their own Bishop.

===Laity===

Lay Dominicans are governed by their own rule, the Rule of the Lay Fraternities of St. Dominic, promulgated by the Master in 1987. It is the fifth Rule of the Dominican Laity; the first was issued in 1285. Lay Dominicans are also governed by the Fundamental Constitution of the Dominican Laity, and their provinces provide a General Directory and Statutes. According to their Fundamental Constitution of the Dominican Laity, sec. 4, &quot;They have a distinctive character in both their spirituality and their service to God and neighbor. As members of the Order, they share in its apostolic mission through prayer, study and preaching according to the state of the laity.&quot;

Pope Pius XII, in Chosen Laymen, an Address to the Third Order of St. Dominic (1958), said, &quot;The true condition of salvation is to meet the divine invitation by accepting the Catholic &#x27;credo&#x27; and by observing the commandments. But the Lord expects more from you [Lay Dominicans], and the Church urges you to continue seeking the intimate knowledge of God and His works, to search for a more complete and valuable expression of this knowledge, a refinement of the Christian attitudes which derive from this knowledge.&quot;

The two greatest saints among them are Catherine of Siena and Rose of Lima, who lived ascetic lives in their family homes, yet both had widespread influence in their societies.

Today, there is a growing number of Associates who share the Dominican charism. Dominican Associates are Christian women and men; married, single, divorced, and widowed; clergy members and lay persons who were first drawn to and then called to live out the charism and continue the mission of the Dominican Order – to praise, to bless, to preach. Associates do not take vows, but rather make a commitment to be partners with vowed members, and to share the mission and charism of the Dominican Family in their own lives, families, churches, neighborhoods, workplaces, and cities. They are most often associated with a particular apostolic work of a congregation of active Dominican sisters.

==Spirituality==
The Dominican emphasis on learning and charity distinguishes it from other monastic and mendicant orders. As the order first developed in Europe, learning continued to be emphasized by those friars and their sisters in Christ. These religious also struggled for a deeply personal and intimate relationship with God. When the order reached England, many of the attributes were kept, but the English gave the order additional specialized characteristics.

===Humbert of Romans===
Humbert of Romans, the master general of the order from 1254 to 1263, was a great administrator, preacher, and writer. It was under his tenure as master general that the nun of the order were given a new constitution. He also wanted his friars to reach excellence in their preaching, his most lasting contribution to the order.

Humbert is at the center of ascetic writers in the Dominican Order. He advised his readers,
&quot;[Young Dominicans] are also to be instructed not to be eager to see visions or work miracles, since these avail little to salvation, and sometimes we are fooled by them; but rather they should be eager to do good in which salvation consists. Also, they should be taught not to be sad if they do not enjoy the divine consolations they hear others have; but they should know the loving Father for some reason sometimes withholds these. Again, they should learn that if they lack the grace of compunction or devotion they should not think they are not in the state of grace as long as they have good will, which is all that God regards&quot;. The English Dominicans took this to heart and made it the focal point of their mysticism.

===Mysticism===
The Dominican Order was affected by a number of elemental influences. Its early members imbued the order with a mysticism and learning. Mysticism refers to the conviction that all believers have the capability to experience God&#x27;s love. This love may manifest itself through brief ecstatic experiences, such that one may be engulfed by God and gain an immediate knowledge of him, which is unknowable through the intellect alone. Although the ultimate attainment for mysticism is union with God, the goal is just as much to become like Christ as it is to become one with him. Those who believe in Christ should first have faith in him without becoming engaged in such overwhelming phenomena.

The Europeans of the order embraced ecstatic mysticism on a grand scale and looked to a union with the Creator. The English Dominicans looked for this complete unity as well but were not so focused on ecstatic experiences. Instead, their goal was to emulate the moral life of Christ more completely. The Dartford nuns were surrounded by all of those legacies and used them to create something unique.

====Saint Albertus Magnus====

Another member of the order who contributed significantly to its spirituality is Albert the Great, whose influence on the brotherhood permeated nearly every aspect of Dominican life.

Albertus Magnus championed the idea, drawn from Dionysius the Areopagite, that positive knowledge of God is possible but obscure. Thus, it is easier to state what God is not than to state what God is:

Albert the Great wrote that wisdom and understanding enhance one&#x27;s faith in God. According to him, these are the tools that God uses to commune with a contemplative. Love in the soul is both the cause and result of true understanding and judgement. It causes not only an intellectual knowledge of God, but a spiritual and emotional knowledge as well. Contemplation is the means whereby one can obtain this goal of understanding. Things that once seemed static and unchanging become full of possibility and perfection. The contemplative then knows that God is, but they do not know what God is. Thus, contemplation forever produces a mystified, imperfect knowledge of God. The soul is exalted beyond the rest of God&#x27;s creation but it cannot see God himself.

====Rhineland mysticism====
Mysticism in the Rhineland emerged from a series of crises—political, social (the Black Death and its consequences), and religious. The writings of Albertus Magnus made a significant contribution to German mysticism, which became vibrant in the minds of the Beguines and women such as Hildegard of Bingen and Mechthild of Magdeburg.

In Europe, it was often the female members of the order, such as Catherine of Siena, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Christine of Stommeln, Margaret Ebner, and Elsbet Stagl, who gained reputations for having mystical experiences. Notable male members of the order associated with mysticism include Henry Suso and Johannes Tauler.

One of Meister Eckhart&#x27;s themes is that one should be mindful of the great nobility which God has given the soul.

====English Dominican mysticism====

By 1300, the enthusiasm for preaching and conversion within the order had lessened. Mysticism, full of the ideas Albertus Magnus expostulated, became the devotion of the greatest minds and hands within the organization. It became a &quot;powerful instrument of personal and theological transformation both within the Order of Preachers and throughout the wider reaches of Christendom. Although Albertus Magnus did much to instill mysticism in the Order of Preachers, it is a concept that reaches back to the Hebrew Bible. In the tradition of Holy Writ, the impossibility of coming face to face with God is a recurring motif. As time passed, Jewish and early Christian writings presented the idea of &quot;unknowing&quot; in which God&#x27;s presence was enveloped in a dark cloud. All of those ideas associated with mysticism were at play in the spirituality of the Dominican community.

English Dominican mysticism in the late medieval period differed from European strands of it in that, whereas European Dominican mysticism tended to concentrate on ecstatic experiences of union with the divine, English Dominican mysticism&#x27;s ultimate focus was on a crucial dynamic in one&#x27;s personal relationship with God. That was an essential moral imitation of the Savior as an ideal for religious change and as the means for reformation of humanity&#x27;s nature as an image of divinity. This type of mysticism carried with it four elements. Firstly, spiritually it emulated the moral essence of Christ&#x27;s life. Secondly, there was a connection linking moral emulation of Christ&#x27;s life and humanity&#x27;s disposition as images of the divine. Thirdly, English Dominican mysticism focused on an embodied spirituality with a structured love of fellow men at its center. Finally, the supreme aspiration of this mysticism was either an ethical or an actual union with God.

For English Dominican mystics, the mystical experience was not expressed just in one moment of the full knowledge of God but in the journey of or process of faith. That then led to an understanding that was directed toward an experiential knowledge of divinity. However, for these mystics it was possible to pursue mystical life without the visions and voices that are usually associated with such a relationship with God.

The centre of all mystical experience is of course Christ. English Dominicans sought to gain a full knowledge of Christ through an imitation of his life. English mystics of all types tended to focus on the moral values that the events in Christ&#x27;s life exemplified. That led to a &quot;progressive understanding of the meanings of Scripture—literal, moral, allegorical, and anagogical,&quot; which was contained within the mystical journey itself. From these considerations of Scripture comes the simplest way to imitate Christ: an emulation of the moral actions and attitudes that Jesus demonstrated in his earthly ministry becomes the most significant way to feel and have knowledge of God.

The English concentrated on the spirit of the events of Christ&#x27;s life. They neither expected nor sought the appearance of the stigmata or any other physical manifestation. They wanted to create in themselves that environment that allowed Jesus to fulfill his divine mission, insofar as they were able. At the centre of that environment was love, which Christ showed for humanity in becoming human. Christ&#x27;s love reveals the mercy of God and his care for his creation. English Dominican mystics sought through that love to become images of God. English Dominican spirituality concentrated on the moral implications of image-bearing. Love led to spiritual growth that, in turn, reflected an increase in love for God and humanity.

===Devotion to Mary===
Devotion to the Virgin Mary was another very important aspect of Dominican spirituality. As an order, the Dominicans believed that they were established through the good graces of Christ&#x27;s mother, and through prayers, she sent missionaries to save the souls of nonbelievers. Dominican brothers and sisters unable to participate in the Divine Office sang the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary each day and saluted her as their advocate.

Throughout the centuries, the Holy Rosary has been an important element among the Dominicans. Pope Pius XI stated: &quot;The Rosary of Mary is the principle and foundation on which the very Order of Saint Dominic rests for making perfect the life of its members and obtaining the salvation of others.&quot; Histories of the Holy Rosary often attribute its origin to Dominic himself through the Virgin Mary. Our Lady of the Rosary is the title related to the Marian apparition to Dominic in 1208 in the church of Prouille in which the Virgin Mary gave the Rosary to him. For centuries, Dominicans have been instrumental in spreading the rosary and emphasizing the Catholic belief in the power of the rosary.

On January 1, 2008, the master of the order declared a year of dedication to the Rosary.

== Other names ==
A number of other names have been used to refer to both the order and its members.
* In England and other countries, the Dominican friars are referred to as Black Friars because of the black &quot;cappa&quot; or cloak they wear over their white habits. Dominicans were &quot;Blackfriars&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Whitefriars&quot; (i.e., Carmelites) or &quot;Greyfriars&quot; (i.e., Franciscans). They are also distinct from the &quot;Austin friars&quot; (i.e., Augustinian Friars) who wear a similar habit.
* In France, the Dominicans were known as Jacobins because their convent in Paris was attached to the Church of Saint-Jacques, now demolished, on the way to Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, which belonged to the Italian Order of Saint James of Altopascio (James the Less) &quot;Sanctus Iacobus&quot; in Latin.
* Their identification as Dominicans gave rise to the pun that they were the Domini canes, or &quot;Hounds of the Lord&quot;.

==Mottoes==
: To praise, to bless and to preach (from the Dominican Missal, &quot;Preface of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;)

<doc id="8987" wikidata="Q57339" url="?curid=8987" title="Don McLean">
<text>Donald McLean III (born October 2, 1945) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. Known as the &quot;American Troubadour&quot; or &quot;King of the Trail&quot;, he is best known for his 1971 hit &quot;American Pie&quot;, an eight-and-a-half-minute folk rock song that has been referred to as a &quot;cultural touchstone&quot;. His other hit singles include &quot;Vincent&quot;, &quot;Dreidel&quot;, &quot;Castles in the Air&quot;, and &quot;Wonderful Baby&quot;, as well as renditions of Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Crying&quot; and the Skyliners&#x27; &quot;Since I Don&#x27;t Have You&quot;.

McLean&#x27;s song &quot;And I Love You So&quot; has been recorded by Elvis Presley, Perry Como, Helen Reddy, Glen Campbell, and others. In 2000, Madonna had a hit with a rendition of &quot;American Pie&quot;. In 2004, McLean was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In January 2018, BMI certified that &quot;American Pie&quot; had reached five million airplays and &quot;Vincent&quot; three million.

==Early life==
McLean&#x27;s grandfather and father, both also named Donald McLean, were of Scottish origin. McLean&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Bucci, was of Italian origin: Her parents originated from Abruzzo in central Italy. He has other extended family in Los Angeles and Boston. McLean grew up in New Rochelle, New York, where he delivered newspapers as a boy.

===Musical roots===
Though some of his early musical influences included Frank Sinatra and Buddy Holly, as a teenager, McLean became interested in folk music, particularly the Weavers&#x27; 1955 recording &quot;The Weavers at Carnegie Hall&quot;. He often missed long periods of school because of childhood asthma, and although McLean slipped in his studies, his love of music was allowed to flourish. By age 16, he had bought his first guitar and began making contacts in the music business, becoming friends with the folk singers Erik Darling and Fred Hellerman of the Weavers. Hellerman said, &quot;He called me one day and said, &#x27;I&#x27;d like to come and visit you&#x27;, and that&#x27;s what he did! We became good friends — he has the most remarkable music memory of anyone I&#x27;ve ever known.&quot;

When McLean was 15, his father died. Fulfilling his father&#x27;s request, McLean graduated from Iona Preparatory School in 1963, and briefly attended Villanova University, dropping out after four months. After leaving Villanova, McLean became associated with the famed folk music agent Harold Leventhal for several months before teaming up with his personal manager, Herb Gart. For the next six years, he performed at venues and events including The Bitter End and the Gaslight Cafe in New York, the Newport Folk Festival, the Cellar Door in Washington, D.C., and the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Gart&#x27;s 18-year tenure as McLean&#x27;s manager ended acrimoniously in the 1980s. Following Gart&#x27;s death in September 2018, McLean wrote:

McLean attended night school at Iona College and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration in 1968. He turned down a scholarship to Columbia University Graduate School in favor of pursuing a career as a singer-songwriter, performing at such venues as Caffè Lena in Saratoga Springs, New York and The Main Point in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

Later that year, with the help of a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, McLean began reaching a wider audience, with visits to towns up and down the Hudson River. He learned the art of performing from his friend and mentor Pete Seeger. McLean accompanied Seeger on his &quot;Clearwater&quot; boat trip up the Hudson River in 1969 to raise awareness about environmental pollution in the river. During this time, McLean wrote songs that appeared on his first album &quot;Tapestry&quot;. McLean co-edited the book &quot;Songs and Sketches of the First Clearwater Crew&quot;, with sketches by Thomas B. Allen, for which Seeger wrote the foreword. Seeger and McLean sang &quot;Shenandoah&quot; on the 1974 Clearwater album. McLean thought very highly of Seeger and spoke fondly of his experiences working with him: &quot;Hardly a day goes by when I don&#x27;t think of Pete and how generous and supportive he was. If you could understand his politics and you got to know him, he really was some kind of modern day saint.&quot;

==Recording career==

===Early breakthrough===
McLean recorded &quot;Tapestry&quot; in 1969 in Berkeley, California, during the student riots. After being rejected 72 times by labels, the album was released by Mediarts, a label that had not existed when he first started to look for one. He worked on the album for a couple of years before putting it out. It attracted good reviews but little notice outside the folk community, though on the Easy Listening chart &quot;Castles in the Air&quot; was a success, and in 1973 &quot;And I Love You So&quot; became a number 1 Adult Contemporary hit for Perry Como.

McLean&#x27;s major break came when Mediarts was taken over by United Artists Records, thus securing the promotion of a major label for his second album, &quot;American Pie.&quot; The album launched two number one hits in the title song and &quot;Vincent&quot;. &quot;American Pie&quot;″s success made McLean an international star and piqued interest in his first album, which charted more than two years after its initial release.

===&quot;American Pie&quot;===

McLean&#x27;s &quot;American Pie&quot; is a song inspired partly by the deaths of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. Richardson (The Big Bopper) in a plane crash in 1959, and developments in American youth culture in the subsequent decade. The song popularized the expression &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; in reference to the crash.

The song was recorded on May 26, 1971, and a month later received its first radio airplay on New York&#x27;s WNEW-FM and WPLJ-FM to mark the closing of Fillmore East, the famous New York concert hall. &quot;American Pie&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 from January 15 to February 5, 1972, and remains McLean&#x27;s most successful single release. The single also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Easy Listening chart. With a total running time of 8:36 encompassing both sides of the single, it was also the longest song to reach number one until Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;All Too Well&quot; broke the record in 2021. Some stations played only part one of the original split-sided single release.

WCFL DJ Bob Dearborn unraveled the lyrics and first published his interpretation on January 7, 1972, four days after the song reached number 1 on rival station WLS, six days before it reached number 1 on WCFL, and eight days before it reached number 1 nationally (see &quot;Further reading&quot; under &quot;American Pie&quot;). Numerous other interpretations, which together largely converged on Dearborn&#x27;s interpretation, quickly followed. McLean declined to say anything definitive about the lyrics until 1978. Since then McLean has stated that the lyrics are also somewhat autobiographical and present an abstract story of his life from the mid-1950s until the time he wrote the song in the late 1960s.

The original United Artists Records inner sleeve featured a free verse poem written by McLean about William Boyd, also known as Hopalong Cassidy, along with a picture of Boyd in full Hopalong regalia. This sleeve was removed within a year of the album&#x27;s release. The words to this poem appear on a plaque at the hospital where Boyd died. The Boyd poem and picture tribute do appear on a special remastered 2003 CD.

In 2001, &quot;American Pie&quot; was voted number 5 in a poll of the 365 Songs of the Century compiled by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.

On April 7, 2015, McLean&#x27;s original working manuscript for &quot;American Pie&quot; sold for $1,205,000 (£809,524/€1,109,182) at Christie&#x27;s auction rooms, New York, making it the third highest auction price achieved for an American literary manuscript.

In the sale catalogue notes, McLean finally revealed the meaning in the song&#x27;s lyrics: &quot;Basically in American Pie things are heading in the wrong direction. ... It [life] is becoming less idyllic. I don&#x27;t know whether you consider that wrong or right but it is a morality song in a sense.&quot; The catalogue confirmed some of the better-known references in the song&#x27;s lyrics, including mentions of Elvis Presley (&quot;the king&quot;) and Bob Dylan (&quot;the jester&quot;), and confirmed that the song culminates with a description of the killing of Meredith Hunter at the Altamont Free Concert, ten years after the plane crash that killed Holly, Valens and Richardson, and that the song broadly depicts how the early rock innocence of the 1950s, and a bygone simpler age, had been lost; overtaken by events and changes, which themselves had been overtaken by further changes.

Mike Mills of R.E.M. reflected on the song, that &quot;&#x27;American Pie&#x27; just made perfect sense to me as a song and that&#x27;s what impressed me the most. I could say to people this is how to write songs. When you&#x27;ve written at least three songs that can be considered classic that is a very high batting average and if one of those songs happens to be something that a great many people think is one of the greatest songs ever written you&#x27;ve not only hit the top of the mountain but you&#x27;ve stayed high on the mountain for a long time.&quot;

When asked about his record broken by Taylor Swift in a &quot;Billboard&quot; interview, Don McLean said, &quot;there is something to be said for a great song that has staying power. &#x27;American Pie&#x27; remained on top for 50 years and now Taylor Swift has unseated such a historic piece of artistry. Let&#x27;s face it, nobody ever wants to lose that No. 1 spot, but if I had to lose it to somebody, I sure am glad it was another great singer/songwriter such as Taylor.&quot; When Swift broke McLean&#x27;s record, she sent him flowers and a handwritten note that read &quot;I will never forget that I&#x27;m standing on the shoulders of giants&quot;.

===&quot;Vincent&quot;===

&quot;Vincent&quot; is a tribute to the 19th-century Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. The inspiration came to McLean one morning while looking at a book about Van Gogh. As he studied a print of Van Gogh&#x27;s painting &quot;The Starry Night&quot;, he realized that a song could be written about the artist through the painting. The song argues that Van Gogh had a psychiatric illness, as opposed to being insane. It reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and it proved to be a huge hit worldwide, including reaching number 1 in the UK Singles Chart. Mike Mills of R.E.M. said &quot;You can&#x27;t change a note in that song&quot;. The song was performed by NOFX on their album &quot;45 or 46 Songs That Weren&#x27;t Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records&quot; and appears on the Fat Wreck Chords compilation &quot;Survival of the Fattest&quot;. &quot;Vincent&quot; was sung by Josh Groban on his 2001 debut album. In 2018, singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding recorded a new, stripped back, acoustic guitar-driven version of the song.

===Subsequent recordings===

Personnel from the &quot;American Pie&quot; album sessions were retained for his third album &quot;Don McLean&quot;, including the producer, Ed Freeman, Rob Rothstein on bass, and Warren Bernhardt on piano. The song &quot;The Pride Parade&quot; provides an insight into McLean&#x27;s immediate reaction to stardom. McLean told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1973 that &quot;Tapestry&quot; was an album by someone previously concerned with external situations. &quot;American Pie&quot; combines externals with internals, and the resultant success of that album makes the third one (&quot;Don McLean&quot;) entirely introspective.&quot;

Other songs written by McLean for the album include &quot;Dreidel&quot; (number 21 on the Billboard chart) and &quot;If We Try&quot; (number 58), which was recorded by Olivia Newton-John. &quot;On the Amazon&quot; from the 1920s musical &quot;Mr. Cinders&quot; was an unusual choice but became an audience favorite in concerts and featured in &quot;Till Tomorrow&quot;, a documentary film about McLean produced by Bob Elfstrom (Elfstrom held the role of Jesus Christ in Johnny and June Cash&#x27;s &quot;Gospel Road)&quot;. The film shows McLean in concert at Columbia University as he was interrupted by a bomb scare. He left the stage while the audience stood up and checked under their seats for anything that resembled a bomb. After the all-clear, McLean re-appeared and sang &quot;On the Amazon&quot; from exactly where he had left off. Don Heckman reported the bomb scare in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;Don McLean Survives Two Obstacles&quot;.

The fourth album &quot;Playin&#x27; Favorites&quot; was a top-40 hit in the UK in 1973 and included the Irish folk classic, &quot;Mountains of Mourne&quot; and Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Everyday&quot;, a live rendition of which returned McLean to the UK Singles Chart. McLean said &quot;The last album (&quot;Don McLean&quot;) was a study in depression whereas the new one (&quot;Playin&#x27; Favorites&quot;) is almost the quintessence of optimism.&quot;

The 1974 album &quot;Homeless Brother&quot;, produced by Joel Dorn, was McLean&#x27;s final studio recording for United Artists. The album featured fine New York session musicians, including Ralph McDonald on percussion, Hugh McCracken on guitar and a guest appearance by Yusef Lateef on flute. The Persuasions sang the background vocals on &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot;, and Cissy Houston provided a backing vocal on &quot;La La Love You&quot;. The album&#x27;s title song was inspired by Jack Kerouac&#x27;s book &quot;Lonesome Traveler&quot;, in which Kerouac tells the story of America&#x27;s &quot;homeless brothers&quot; or hobos. The song features background vocals by Pete Seeger.

The song &quot;The Legend of Andrew McCrew&quot; was based on an article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; concerning a black Dallas hobo named Anderson McCrew who was killed when he leapt from a moving train. No one claimed him, so a carnival took his body, mummified it, and toured all over the South with him, calling him &quot;The Famous Mummy Man&quot;. McLean&#x27;s song inspired radio station WGN in Chicago to tell the story and give the song airplay in order to raise money for a headstone for McCrew&#x27;s grave. Their campaign was successful, and McCrew&#x27;s body was exhumed and buried in the Lincoln Cemetery in Dallas.

Joel Dorn later collaborated on the McLean career retrospective &quot;Rearview Mirror&quot;, released in 2005 on Dorn&#x27;s label, Hyena Records. In 2006, Dorn reflected on working with McLean:Of the more than 200 studio albums I&#x27;ve produced in the past 40 plus years, there is a handful; maybe 15 or so that I can actually listen to from top to bottom. &quot;Homeless Brother&quot; is one of them. It accomplished everything I set out to do. And it did so because it was a true collaboration. Don brought so much to the project that all I really had to do was capture what he did, and complement it properly when necessary.

In 1977 a brief liaison with Arista Records that yielded the album &quot;Prime Time&quot;, and in October 1978, the single &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Matter Anymore&quot;. This was a track from the album &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; that should have been the second of four with Arista. McLean had started recording in Nashville, Tennessee, with Elvis Presley&#x27;s backing singers, the Jordanaires, and many of Presley&#x27;s musicians. However the Arista deal broke down following artistic disagreements between McLean and the Arista chief, Clive Davis. Consequently, McLean was left without a record contract in the United States, but through continuing deals, &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; was released by EMI in Europe and by Festival Records in Australia.

In April 1980, the Roy Orbison song &quot;Crying&quot; from the album began picking up airplay on Dutch radio stations and McLean was called to Europe to appear on several important musical variety shows to plug the song and support its release as a single by EMI. The song achieved number 1 status in the Netherlands first, followed by the UK and then Australia.

McLean&#x27;s number 1 successes in Europe and Australia led to a new deal in the United States with Millennium Records, which issued &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; two and a half years after it had been recorded in Nashville and two years after its release in Europe. It charted on February 14, 1981, and reached number 28, and &quot;Crying&quot; climbed to number 5 on the pop singles chart. Orbison himself thought that McLean&#x27;s version was the best interpretation he&#x27;d ever heard of one of his songs. Orbison thought McLean did a better job than he did and even went so far as to say that the voice of Don McLean is one of the great instruments of 20th-century America. According to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, &quot;McLean&#x27;s voice could cut through steel – he is a very pure singer and he&#x27;s up there with the best of them. He&#x27;s a very talented singer and songwriter and he deserves his success.&quot;

McLean had further chart successes in the United States in the early 1980s with &quot;Since I Don&#x27;t Have You&quot;, a new recording of &quot;Castles in the Air&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Just the Sun&quot;. In 1987, the release of the country-based album&quot; Love Tracks&quot; gave rise to the hit singles &quot;Love in My Heart&quot; (a top-10 in Australia), &quot;You Can&#x27;t Blame the Train&quot; (U.S. country number 49), and &quot;Eventually&quot;. The latter two songs were written by Terri Sharp. In 1991, EMI reissued &quot;American Pie&quot; as a single in the United Kingdom, and McLean performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. In 1992, previously unreleased songs became available on &quot;Favorites and Rarities&quot;, and &quot;Don McLean Classics&quot; featured new studio recordings of &quot;Vincent&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot;.

McLean has continued to record new material, including &quot;River of Love&quot; in 1995 on Curb Records, and more recently, the albums &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Share&quot;, &quot;Don McLean Sings Marty Robbins&quot; and &quot;The Western Album&quot; for his own Don McLean Music label. &quot;Addicted to Black&quot; was released in May 2009.

===Other songs===
McLean&#x27;s other well-known songs include the following.
*&quot;And I Love You So&quot; featured on McLean&#x27;s first album &quot;Tapestry&quot; first released in 1970. The song was later recorded by Elvis Presley, Helen Reddy, Shirley Bassey, Glen Campbell, Engelbert Humperdinck, Howard Keel, Claude François, and a 1973 hit for Perry Como. The song was performed at the Royal Wedding reception of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018.
*&quot;Castles in the Air&quot;, which McLean recorded twice. His 1981 re-recording was a top-40 hit, reaching number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in late 1981.
*&quot;Wonderful Baby&quot;, a tribute to Fred Astaire that Astaire himself recorded. Primarily rejected by pop stations, it reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Easy Listening chart.

The &quot;American Pie&quot; album features a version of Psalm 137, titled &quot;Babylon&quot;. The song is based on a canon by Philip Hayes and was arranged by McLean and Lee Hays (of The Weavers). &quot;Babylon&quot; was performed in the &quot;Mad Men&quot; episode of the same name despite the fact that the song would not be released until 10 years after the time in which the episode is set.

In 1981, McLean had an international number one hit with a version of the Roy Orbison classic &quot;Crying&quot;. It was only after the record became a success overseas that it was released in the United States. The single hit reached number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1981. Orbison himself once described McLean as &quot;the voice of the century&quot;, and in a subsequent re-recording of the song, Orbison incorporated elements of McLean&#x27;s version.

For the 1982 animated movie &quot;The Flight of Dragons&quot;, produced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr., McLean sang the opening theme. However, no soundtrack has ever been released.

Another hit song associated with McLean (though never recorded by him) is singer-songwriter Lori Lieberman&#x27;s &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot;; Lieberman was inspired by hearing McLean in concert performing his song &quot;Empty Chairs&quot;. Afterwards she shared her reaction with her manager, Norman Gimbel, who had long been searching for a way to use a phrase he had copied from a novel translated from Spanish, &quot;killing me softly with his blues&quot;. Gimbel passed the lyrics to his songwriting partner Charles Fox, who in turn composed the music to &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot;. Lieberman recorded the song (now credited to Gimbel and Fox) and released it in 1972. This initial version was heard by Roberta Flack, who recorded it with slight changes to create a number-one hit. Two decades later it was recorded by the Fugees, who had another hit.

===Later career===
&quot;The Don McLean Story: Killing Us Softly With His Songs&quot; was published in 2007. Biographer Alan Howard conducted extensive interviews for this, the only book-length biography of the often reclusive McLean to date.

McLean is credited as a co-writer on Drake&#x27;s song &quot;Doing It Wrong&quot;, featuring Stevie Wonder. The song includes lyrics from two McLean compositions – &quot;The Wrong Thing to Do&quot; and &quot;When a Good Thing Goes Bad&quot; – both of which were featured on his 1977 album &quot;Prime Time&quot;.

In a July 2022 documentary, titled &quot;The Day The Music Died&quot;, McLean discussed for the first time in 50 years the meaning of the lyrics in &quot;American Pie&quot;.

In February 2022, McLean recorded a performance of &quot;Vincent&quot; at the Immersive Van Gogh exhibit in Los Angeles in honor of Van Gogh&#x27;s birthday and the 50th anniversary of the song.

In April 2022, Tyson Fury teamed up with McLean to remake &quot;American Pie&quot;. McLean won six Telly Awards for the Fury-Whyte fight opening.

In June 2022, McLean published a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;American Pie: A Fable&quot;. The story follows the emotional journey of a newspaper delivery boy in the late 1950s who discovers the joy of friendship and music, eventually learning that when you recognize what truly makes you happy, you are never really alone.

McLean led a wave of dropouts from the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) convention after the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, saying it would be &quot;disrespectful and hurtful&quot; to perform days after 19 children and two adults were killed in a mass shooting in the state. McLean was first among performers who announced they would no longer perform at the National Rifle Association&#x27;s annual meeting in Houston.

In October 2022, McLean called rapper Kanye West an &#x27;attention-seeking fool&#x27; over his antisemitic rants. The &quot;American Pie&quot; singer who briefly lived in Israel said he stands with his Jewish friends. &quot;Lately, a flood of antisemitic invective has been triggered by the ranting of a stupid attention-seeking fool we all know,&quot; McLean wrote in the statement that did not mention Ye by name. &quot;I want to say I stand with my Jewish friends and I stand with the state of Israel. When this kind of thing happens, we should realize why the state of Israel must be respected and protected.&quot; McLean lived in Israel on-and-off from 1978 to 1982 and he &quot;grew to love the country and the people. Living there changed my life forever&quot;.

==Concerts==

McLean&#x27;s albums did not match the commercial success of &quot;American Pie&quot;, but he became a major concert attraction in the United States and overseas. His repertoire included old concert hall numbers and the catalogues of singers such as Buddy Holly and Frank Sinatra. The years spent playing gigs in small clubs and coffee houses in the 1960s transformed into well-paced performances. McLean&#x27;s first concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York and the Royal Albert Hall in London in 1972 were critically acclaimed.

In later years, McLean continued to tour the United States, Canada and Europe (2011, 2012) and Australia (2013). In June 2011, McLean appeared at the Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, UK, and in 2014 at California&#x27;s Stagecoach Country Music Festival.

During 2018, McLean embarked on a world tour with concerts in North America, UK, Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Israel, Norway and Finland. His concert at the London Palladium was reviewed positively by &quot;The Times&quot;:

&quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; noted that &quot;McLean was the consummate professional in presenting his master class of the Great American Songbook&quot; in their review of his June 2018 Tel Aviv concert.

In 2022, McLean toured through Europe, starting in Wales and ending in Sweden, to celebrate the upcoming 50th anniversary of &quot;American Pie&quot;.

In 2023, the 50th anniversary of &quot;American Pie&quot;, McLean&#x27;s Australian Tour concluded with 24 shows in Australia and New Zealand. His performances received positive critical reception.

==Legacy and influence==
The plane crash that killed musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; J. P. Richardson has become known as &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot;, the expression by which McLean, a fan of Buddy Holly, dubbed it in &quot;American Pie&quot;. Holly&#x27;s death for him symbolized the &quot;loss of innocence&quot; of the early rock-&#x27;n-roll generation.

Musician Lori Lieberman was inspired by a McLean performance in late 1971 to co-write &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot;. In November 1971, Lieberman, then 20, went out with her friend Michele Willens to see Don McLean perform at the Troubadour nightclub in Los Angeles. McLean&#x27;s hit song &quot;American Pie&quot; was rising in the charts, but Lieberman was strongly affected by McLean singing another song: &quot;Empty Chairs&quot;. This song spurred her to write poetic notes on a paper napkin while he was performing the song. McLean said in 1973 that he was surprised to find out that the song described his singing. &quot;I&#x27;m absolutely amazed. I&#x27;ve heard both Lori&#x27;s and Roberta&#x27;s version and I must say I&#x27;m very humbled about the whole thing. You can&#x27;t help but feel that way about a song written and performed as well as this one is.&quot; After decades of confirming Lieberman&#x27;s contribution, Fox and Gimbel changed their story about the song&#x27;s origins to downplay her role. Gimbel threatened McLean with a lawsuit in 2008, demanding he remove from his website an assertion that McLean was the inspiration for &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, 
but McLean responded by showing Gimbel his own words confirming the inspiration, published in 1973.

&quot;Vincent&quot; was rapper Tupac Shakur&#x27;s favorite song. Shakur&#x27;s girlfriend reportedly played the song for him when he was hospitalized and in a coma. Shakur&#x27;s mother also insisted the song be included in a documentary about the rapper&#x27;s life.

President Joe Biden capped the official state visit of South Korean President Yoon Suk-Yeol with a state dinner on April 27, 2023, at the White House to celebrate the two nations&#x27; 70-year alliance. Following a round of musical performances, Yoon took to the microphone himself with a rendition of Don McLean&#x27;s &quot;American Pie&quot;. Joe Biden then presented Yoon with a guitar autographed by McLean.

===Honors===
McLean&#x27;s alma mater, Iona College in New Rochelle, New York, conferred an honorary doctorate on him in 2001. McLean has since been vocal in his criticism of the college: &quot;Iona was, in my day, a college for the average student who wanted to go home after class. The educational experience was perfect for me. I loved the small Greek revival style campus buildings and I got to put on little shows in Doorley Hall auditorium. Since those days, the Irish Christian Brothers have been virtually destroyed by the disgusting behavior of many in their order as charges of mass child molestation have destroyed their ranks. No punishment is harsh enough when you think of trusting Catholic parents giving their children over to these cynical monsters. I am very disappointed in the Irish Christian Brothers and Iona College.&quot;

In February 2002, &quot;American Pie&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2004, McLean was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

In February 2012, McLean won the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Life Time Achievement award.

In March 2012, the PBS network broadcast a feature-length documentary about the life and music of McLean called &quot;Don McLean: American Troubadour&quot; produced by four-time Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Jim Brown.

In March 2017, McLean&#x27;s single &quot;American Pie&quot; was designated an &quot;aural treasure&quot; by the Library of Congress, &quot;worthy of preservation&quot; in the National Recording Registry &quot;as part of America&#x27;s patrimony&quot;. In 1991, a re-issue of &quot;American Pie&quot; reached the UK top 20 singles chart and in July 2017, &quot;American Pie&quot; peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rock Digital Songs Sales chart, nearly 50 years after its first release.

In May 2019, the UCLA Student Alumni Association awarded McLean its George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement. However, the award was rescinded before it was formally bestowed because of McLean&#x27;s conviction for domestic abuse. In response, McLean issued the following statement: &quot;UCLA awarded this lifetime achievement award and then took it back because you found out about my squabble with my ex-wife. This has been all over the Internet for three years. Are you people morons? This is settled law. Maybe I need to give you some bribe money to grease the college wheels? I am guilty of nothing to do with assault and you had better make that clear. We live in a dark age of accusation and not law.&quot;

On November 7, 2019, McLean returned to New Rochelle to view a new mural depicting a likeness of his younger self, with lyrics from &quot;American Pie&quot;, on the side of a building on the corner of 134 North Avenue and Bonnefoy Place, painted by artist Loic Ercolessi for a non-profit organization, Street Art for Mankind. The mural includes the likeness of singer/songwriter Alicia Keys, with lyrics to the song &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot;, which she performed with Jay-Z.

Throughout McLean&#x27;s career artists including Garth Brooks, Madonna, Drake, Josh Groban and others have recorded his songs. At a ceremony in October 2019, plaques certified by the Recording Industry Association of America for gold, platinum, and multi-platinum sales in the United States as well as presentations from Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom were bestowed on McLean. He said: &quot;As a songwriter your songs are like your children, and you are hopeful everyone loves them as much as you do, but rarely is that the case. I am so grateful that songs I have written have touched so many lives and have been recorded by so many great artists.&quot;

Television host Alex Trebek asked McLean to sing for him and his Jeopardy family at his annual Christmas party in 2019. McLean was on his &quot;bucket list&quot;. The event was held at an Italian restaurant near Trebek&#x27;s home.

In February 2021, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of &quot;American Pie&quot;, McLean recorded an A cappella rendition with the band Home Free. He stars in the music video with the singers in a virtual collaboration. The video won three Telly Awards in 2021. 

McLean received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on August 16, 2021, in the Music Category at 6314 Hollywood Boulevard, in front of The Pie Hole restaurant (corner of Hollywood and Vine). Joining in the festivities was McLean&#x27;s friend &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, a fellow Hollywood Walk of Fame recipient.

In September 2022, McLean received a 50-million record sales plaque from the TV show Good Morning America.
On November 22, 2022, McLean was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee.

In October 2023, Ritchie Valens&#x27; sister, Connie Valens, traveled to Nashville to induct McLean into the Music City Walk of Fame. &quot;I am so honored to represent the families of Buddy Holly, JP Richardson, and my brother Ritchie Valens,&quot; she said. For years, she couldn&#x27;t listen to her brother&#x27;s music because &quot;it hurt too much,&quot; but she could listen to &quot;American Pie&quot;. The previous year, she had met McLean when she was invited to take part in the documentary &quot;The Day The Music Died&quot;. They gathered at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa, where her brother (and Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper) had their last performance before the plane crash. &quot;I thanked Don and told him he had immortalized my brother Ritchie, J.P, and Buddy. He&#x27;d taken a terrible tragedy and written rock and roll history.&quot; She went on to say that because of McLean, &quot;the music didn&#x27;t die&quot;. 

==Personal life==
McLean was raised in the Catholic faith of his mother, Elizabeth McLean; his father, Donald McLean, was a Protestant. His father died when McLean was 15.
McLean has claimed that he grew up in a physically abusive household, and was abused by both his parents and his sister. Don McLean has been married twice, with both marriages ending in divorce. His first wife was Carol Sauvion, of Philadelphia, who went on to win an Emmy and Peabody Award for her PBS television series &quot;Craft in America&quot;. They were married from 1969 to 1976 and had no children.

His second marriage was to Patrisha Shnier McLean, of Montreal, Canada, from 1987 to 2016. They have two children, Jackie and Wyatt, and two grandchildren, Rosa and Mya. Their marriage ended after McLean was arrested and charged with misdemeanor domestic violence at their home in Camden, Maine, and Shnier McLean filed for divorce, citing &quot;adultery, cruel and abusive treatment, and irreconcilable differences&quot;.

In 2018, McLean confirmed his romantic relationship with model and reality star Paris Dylan, who is 48 years his junior.

McLean is an ambassador for Teen Cancer America and performed at the Teen Cancer America and UCLA Health fundraising Backyard Concert in 2018. During the show, McLean sang a duet of his song &quot;Vincent&quot; with Ed Sheeran. The Don McLean Foundation is a charity set up by McLean to be funded by all his income in perpetuity. Its headquarters is based at Lakeview, the Don McLean Maine residence, and it will serve as a center for fundraisers and conferences as well as a nature preserve. Organizations that support the needy in the State of Maine and throughout the United States will be beneficiaries.

On May 23, 2024, McLean and Paris Dylan attended a state dinner at the White House hosted by President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden in honor of Kenya&#x27;s President William Ruto and First Lady Rachel Ruto.
===Abuse allegations===

On January 18, 2016, McLean&#x27;s then-wife Patrisha Shnier McLean alleged that after four hours of &quot;terrorizing&quot; her, McLean pinned her to a bed until she broke free and ran to the bathroom, where she called the police as he tried to break down the door. McLean was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, and pled guilty to domestic violence assault, criminal restraint, criminal mischief and making domestic violence threats. McLean paid $3,660 in fines, and was not sentenced to any jail time. Under Maine&#x27;s deferred disposition law, the State agreed to dismiss the domestic violence assault charge if McLean complied with the court&#x27;s orders for one year, and the charge was expunged a year later. Shnier McLean filed for divorce, citing &quot;adultery, cruel and abusive treatment, and irreconcilable differences&quot;. McLean denied that he physically abused Shnier McLean, and his lawyer released a statement stating McLean agreed to the plea deal in the interest of privacy. In March 2017, a Maine court granted Shnier-McLean&#x27;s request for a 10-year protection order against McLean.

In a 2020 interview, Shnier McLean alleged McLean had created a cult-like household, remarking, &quot;I do feel there is an element of brainwashing there. I relate to a lot of the things they say about cults like the charismatic leader, and how their version of things becomes your version&quot;. McLean&#x27;s daughter Jackie told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2021 that her father was emotionally abusive and, like her mother, stated her father created a cultish environment. According to Jackie, McLean used paralyzing verbal attacks, forced isolation, and threats to withhold love or financial support. The article alleged that communications between Jackie and McLean suggested &quot;a pattern of asserting control and manipulation over Jackie, her actions and memories, and a seeming drive by the elder McLean to maintain a certain public image&quot;. In one email, McLean wrote to his daughter, &quot;unless you support me publicly and frequently you should not expect me to lift a finger for you nor will I give you another red cent.&quot;

When interviewed for the article, McLean admitted to some aspects of Jackie&#x27;s account, but denied that his behavior constituted abuse. He also mentioned that he had grown up in a physically abusive household, where he was &quot;hurt a lot by my sister, my mother, my father; I was hit a lot.&quot; McLean denied this in a later interview, saying; &quot;Absolutely not true. I was never abused as a child at all.&quot;

<text>DirkJan is a Dutch comic strip series, created in 1989 by Dutch author and artist Mark Retera. It is also the name of its main character. The series is a gag-a-day comic.

==Description==

DirkJan is an underachiever who stumbles through life in mostly three-panel gag-a-day comic strips. He started out in 1989 as a student at the current Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, where he lived in a typical student house with all the stereotypical sidekicks, such as the frat boy, the beer drinker, the bossy girl who checks if everybody keeps to the house rules, and the tramps who use the heated shared hallway to stay the night. Early DirkJans contained many references to the student life of Nijmegen.

==Publication==

DirkJan was first published in &quot;Critic&quot;, the magazine for the local union of psychology students. It then moved on to monthly publication in the student magazine of Nijmegen (Algemeen Nijmeegs Studentenblad, ANS). DirkJan became known nationally when the then only commercial comics magazine of the Netherlands SjoSji (now defunct) started publishing the strip.

With the last move, the nature of the strip changed. Most of the student sidekicks got cancelled and DirkJan left university, first for jail (DJ is a notorious Kabouter abuser) and then to wander the globe and indeed space.

As of May 2023, there are 28 DirkJan albums, tentatively named &#x27;DirkJan 1&#x27; through &#x27;DirkJan 22&#x27;. Several newspapers in the Netherlands publish the comic in their daily edition. There are 8 more albums outside the regular series.

The amateur comics magazine Iris (1990–1995) republished a number of DirkJan comics, some of which were refused for publication in SjoSji.

<doc id="8993" wikidata="Q764069" url="?curid=8993" title="Duck Hunt">
<text>is a 1984 light gun shooter video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The game was first released in April 1984 in Japan for the Family Computer (Famicom) console and in North America as an arcade game for the Nintendo VS. System. It became a launch game for the NES in North America in October 1985, and was re-released in Europe two years later.

Players fire the NES Zapper at a CRT television, with three attempts per round to shoot ducks and clay pigeons.

The game initially received a positive reception in the mid-1980s, but was later given mild praise in retrospective reviews. The game was inspired by Nintendo&#x27;s previous electro-mechanical arcade game which was based on the Laser Clay Shooting System released in 1976. Upon release as a video game, &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; became a major commercial success both for arcades and consoles in the 1980s, helping to popularize light gun video games with over 28 million copies sold worldwide.

In 1986, the nationwide launch of the NES included the Deluxe Set bundle with pack-in games &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; and &quot;Gyromite&quot;. The later Action Set has &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; on one cartridge. The final &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; bundle is the Power Set, with a multi-cart with &quot;World Class Track Meet&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, and &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;. The game was released on Virtual Console for the Wii U in 2014.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Duck Hunt&quot; is a first-person shooter game with moving on-screen targets, firing the NES Zapper light gun at a CRT television screen. The player selects the game mode, one or two targets appear, and the player has three attempts to hit them before they disappear. Each round totals ten targets.

The player must hit a minimum number of targets to advance to the next round or else get a game over. The difficulty progresses with faster targets of an increasing minimum number. The player receives points per target and bonus points for shooting all ten targets per round. The highest scores are tracked per session.

&quot;Duck Hunt&quot; has three optional game modes. In Game A and Game B, the targets are flying ducks, and in Game C the targets are clay pigeons that are launched into the distance. In Game A, one duck appears at a time and in Game B two ducks appear. Game A allows a second player to control the flying ducks with a NES controller. Completing Round 99 in Game A advances to Round 0, which is a kill screen where the game shows erratic behavior, such as haphazard or nonexistent targets, thus ending progress.

===&quot;Vs. Duck Hunt&quot;===
&quot;Vs. Duck Hunt&quot; was released as a Nintendo VS. System arcade game in April 1984, and was later included in the PlayChoice-10 arcade console. The console supports two light guns, for alternate players.

Gameplay consists of alternating rounds of Games B and C, with 12 targets per round instead of 10 and sometimes three targets at once instead of two. Every missed target costs one life until the game ends.

After every second round, a bonus stage has ducks flying out of the grass with the hunting dog occasionally jumping into the line of fire as a distraction. If shot, the dog scolds the player and the bonus stage ends. According to Nintendo of America employee Jerry Momoda, the dog was made impossible to shoot on console releases to make the game more family friendly.

==Development==

&quot;Duck Hunt&quot; was inspired by a 1976 electronic toy version titled &quot;Beam Gun: Duck Hunt&quot;, part of the &quot;Beam Gun&quot; series, designed by Gunpei Yokoi and Masayuki Uemura for Nintendo. Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1 developed both the NES Zapper and the NES version of &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;. The game was supervised by Takehiro Izushi, and was produced by Gunpei Yokoi. The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka, who did music for several other Nintendo games at the time. The music was represented in the classic games medley on the Video Games Live concert tour. Designer Hiroji Kiyotake created the graphics and characters.

==Release==
&quot;Duck Hunt&quot; has been released alone and in several combination ROM cartridges. The Action Set bundle of the NES in the late 1980s has one cartridge containing &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; The Power Set bundle includes the Zapper, the Power Pad, and a 3-in-1 cartridge with &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;, &quot;World Class Track Meet&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;

&quot;Duck Hunt&quot; was re-released on Virtual Console for the Wii U console in Japan on December 24, 2014, and internationally on December 25. This version was modified for the Wii Remote controller in place of the NES Zapper.

==Reception==
In North America, &quot;Vs. Duck Hunt&quot; became the third top-grossing arcade game on the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts in November 1985, below &quot;Vs. Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; at number one. The two popularized light gun video games by 1985. It was bundled with the Nintendo Entertainment System console in 1985, with copies sold worldwide.

Upon release in arcades, Eddie Adlum of &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine praised &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; and &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; as the &quot;cream on the cake&quot; among Nintendo VS. System and for successfully capturing the experience of older electro-mechanical gun games into video game format. He said that &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; and &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; &quot;sported simulated handguns on a wire cable and pop, pop, pop, you do your thing just like in the old days only at video targets&quot;.

&quot;AllGame&quot; called the game an &quot;attractive but repetitive target shooter&quot; and &quot;utterly mindless... the game is fun for a short time, but gets old after a few rounds of play&quot;. Several communities have rated the game positively. &quot;1UP.com&quot; users gave it an 8.7 out of 10, and the &quot;GameSpot&quot; community rated the multi-cartridge of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; at 9.1 out of 10. It was rated the 150th best game on a Nintendo system in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Top 200 Games list. &quot;IGN&quot; placed the game at number 77 on its &quot;Top 100 NES Games of All Time&quot; feature. The game was ranked 24th in &quot;GamesRadar&quot;″s &quot;The best NES games of all time&quot; list. Jeremy Parish of &quot;USgamer&quot; stated that &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; paired with the NES Zapper &quot;made the NES memorable&quot; and was one of the key factors behind the success of the NES. Parish related &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; to the Wii Remote in that they made their respective consoles more approachable and reach a wider demographic.

==Legacy==
&quot;Duck Hunt&quot; nameless non-playable hunting dog has been referred to in media as the &quot;&quot;Duck Hunt&quot; Dog&quot; or the &quot;Laughing Dog&quot;, notorious for smugly laughing at the player for missing ducks. The dog is on &quot;GamesRadar&quot;″s list of &quot;the 12 most annoying sidekicks ever&quot;, &quot;GameDaily&quot; list of characters &quot;we wish we could kill but can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s &quot;top 10 dogs in gaming&quot;, and MTV&#x27;s award for the greatest video game canine. The dog makes a cameo appearance in the NES Zapper game &quot;Barker Bill&#x27;s Trick Shooting&quot;, where he can be shot.

In &quot;Wii Play&quot; (2006) and its sequel &quot;Wii Play: Motion&quot; (2011), some elements from &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; and &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; are in the mini-games &quot;Shooting Range&quot; and &quot;Trigger Twist&quot;, in which some of the various targets are ducks and cans.

The dog and a duck, collectively referred to as &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;, appear as playable characters in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;. Masahiro Sakurai, the creator and director of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, said that &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;″s commercial success as &quot;the most-sold shooting game in the world&quot; was one of the primary reasons for its inclusion. In the games, the &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; team utilizes multiple attacks inspired by the light gun, including throwing clay pigeons, kicking an explosive version of the can from &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;, summoning the cast of &quot;Wild Gunman&quot; to fire at opponents with their guns, or comically dodging shots fired at opponents from the Zapper. The games feature an unlockable &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;-themed stage. Both the &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; team and stage return in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, and the team is featured in the June 2019 trailer announcing Banjo and Kazooie as downloadable content.

In the 2015 film &quot;Pixels&quot;, the dog cameos as an achievement trophy sent to the protagonists by the aliens following their victory over the enemies of &quot;Centipede&quot; in London. He is adopted by an elderly woman whose apartment was infiltrated by one of the titular enemies.

The premise for the psychological horror VR game &quot;Duck Season&quot; by Stress Level Zero is inspired by &quot;Duck Hunt&quot;.

A fan game, &quot;Duck Hunt GB&quot;, was released for the PC in 2024 that uses Game Boy-style graphics. The same developer is currently developing a new game with 3D graphics, titled &quot;Tiny Duck Hunt 3D&quot;.

<text> (, &quot;The Boat&quot;) is a 1981 West German war film written and directed by Wolfgang Petersen, produced by Günter Rohrbach, and starring Jürgen Prochnow, Herbert Grönemeyer and Klaus Wennemann. It has been exhibited both as a theatrical release (1981) and a TV miniseries (1985). Several different home video versions, as well as a director&#x27;s cut (1997) supervised by Petersen, have also been released.

An adaptation of Lothar-Günther Buchheim&#x27;s 1973 German novel based on his experiences aboard , the film is set during World War II and follows &quot;U-96&quot; and her crew, as they set out on a hazardous patrol in the Battle of the Atlantic. It depicts both the excitement of battle and the tedium of the fruitless hunt, and shows the men serving aboard U-boats as ordinary individuals with a desire to do their best for their comrades and their country.

Development began in 1979. Several American directors were considered three years earlier, before the film was shelved. During production, Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, the captain of the real &quot;U-96&quot; during Buchheim&#x27;s 1941 patrol and one of Germany&#x27;s top U-boat &quot;tonnage aces&quot; during the war, and Hans-Joachim Krug, former first officer on , served as consultants. One of Petersen&#x27;s goals was to guide the audience through &quot;a journey to the edge of the mind&quot; (the film&#x27;s German tagline ), showing &quot;what war is all about&quot;.

Produced on a DM32 million budget (about $18.5 million, equivalent to € million ), the high production cost ranks it among the most expensive films in German cinema, but it was a commercial success, grossing nearly $85 million worldwide (equivalent to $220 million in 2020). Columbia Pictures issued both German-language and English-dubbed versions in the United States theatrically through their Triumph Classics label, earning $11 million. received positive reviews, and was nominated for six Academy Awards; two of these (Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay) went to Petersen himself. He was also nominated for a BAFTA Award and DGA Award.

==Plot==
Lieutenant Werner, a war correspondent on the in October 1941, is driven by her captain and chief engineer to a French bordello, where he meets some of the crew. Thomsen, another captain, gives a drunken speech to celebrate his &quot;Ritterkreuz&quot; award and mocks Adolf Hitler.

The next morning, &quot;U-96&quot; sails out of the harbour of La Rochelle, and Werner is given a tour of the boat. He observes ideological differences between the new crew members and the hardened veterans, particularly the captain, who is cynical about the war. The new men, including Werner, are mocked by the rest, who share a tight bond. One Nazi officer, &quot;1-WO&quot; (the first [watch] officer), is disliked due to his pro-Nazi beliefs and meticulous grooming habits, which tie up the only bathroom. After days of boredom, the crew is excited by another U-boat&#x27;s spotting of an enemy convoy, but they are soon spotted by a British destroyer and attacked with depth charges. They escape with light damage.

The next three weeks are spent enduring relentless North Atlantic gales. Morale drops after various misfortunes, but the crew is cheered by a chance encounter with Thomsen&#x27;s boat. After the storm ends, the boat encounters a British convoy and launches three torpedoes, sinking two ships. They are spotted by a destroyer and have to dive below test depth, the submarine&#x27;s rated limit. During the ensuing depth-charge attack, the chief machinist, Johann, panics and has to be restrained. The boat sustains heavy damage but manages to surface when night falls. A British tanker they torpedoed is still afloat and on fire, so they torpedo it again, only to learn that sailors are still aboard. The crew watches as the sailors leap overboard and swim towards them. Neither able nor willing to accommodate prisoners, the captain orders the boat to back away.

The exhausted crew looks forward to returning home to La Rochelle for Christmas, but the boat is ordered to La Spezia, Italy, which means passing through the Strait of Gibraltar—an area defended by the Royal Navy. The U-boat makes a secret night rendezvous at the harbour of Vigo, in neutral but Axis-friendly Spain, with the SS &quot;Weser&quot;, an interned German merchant ship that clandestinely provides U-boats with fuel, torpedoes, and other supplies. The filthy submariners appear at the opulent dinner prepared for them and are warmly greeted by the &quot;Weser&#x27;s&quot; officers. The captain learns from an envoy of the German consulate that his request for Werner and the chief engineer to be sent back to Germany has been denied.

The crew finishes resupplying and depart for Italy. As they approach the Strait of Gibraltar and are about to dive, they are attacked and badly damaged by a British fighter plane, wounding the navigator, Kriechbaum. The captain orders the boat south towards the North African coast at full speed, determined to save his crew even if he loses the boat. British warships begin shelling, and they are forced to dive. When attempting to level off, the boat does not respond and continues to sink until, just prior to exceeding its crush depth, it lands on a sea shelf at a depth of 280 metres. The crew works to make repairs before running out of oxygen. After over 16 hours, they manage to surface by blowing their ballast tanks, and limp back towards La Rochelle under cover of darkness.

The crew reach La Rochelle on Christmas Eve. After Kriechbaum is taken ashore to an ambulance, Royal Air Force planes bomb and strafe the facilities. Ullmann, Johann, the second watch officer, and the are killed; Frenssen, Lamprecht, and Hinrich are wounded. After the raid, Werner leaves the U-boat bunker in which he had taken shelter, and finds the captain badly injured by shrapnel, watching his U-boat sink. After the boat disappears, the captain collapses and dies. Werner rushes to his body and surveys the scene with tears in his eyes.

==Cast==

* Jürgen Prochnow as (abbr. &quot;&quot;, ) and also called &quot;&quot; (&quot;the Old Man&quot;) by his crew: A 30-year-old battle-hardened but good-hearted and sympathetic sea veteran, he complains to Werner that most of his crew members are boys. He is openly anti-Nazi, and embittered and cynical about the war, being openly critical about how the war is being handled.
* Herbert Grönemeyer as (Ensign) Werner, war correspondent: Naive but honest, he has been sent out to sea with the crew to gather photographs of them in action and report on the voyage. Werner is mocked for his lack of experience, and soon learns the true horrors of service on a U-boat.
* Klaus Wennemann as chief engineer ( or LI, Rank: ): A quiet and well-respected man, at age 27, he is the oldest crew member besides the Captain and is tormented by the uncertain fate of his wife, especially after hearing about a British air raid on Cologne. As the second most important crewman, he oversees diving operations and makes sure the systems are running correctly.

* Hubertus Bengsch as first watch officer (I. WO, Rank: ): A young, by-the-book officer, he is an ardent Nazi and a staunch believer in the . He has a condescending attitude and is the only crewman who makes the effort to maintain his proper uniform and trim appearance, while all the others grow their beards in the traditional U-Bootwaffe fashion. He was raised in some wealth in Mexico by his stepparents, who owned a plantation. His German fiancée died in a British air raid. He spends his days writing his thoughts on military training and leadership for the High Command. When the boat is trapped underwater near Gibraltar, he becomes pessimistic and begins to let go of his adherence to Nazi ideas as he finally stops shaving every day and wearing his proper uniform all the time.
* Martin Semmelrogge as second watch officer (II. WO, Rank: ): A vulgar, comedic officer, he is short, red-haired and speaks with a mild Berlin dialect. One of his duties is to decode messages from base, using the Enigma code machine.
* Bernd Tauber as (&quot;Chief Helmsman&quot;) Kriechbaum: The navigator and 3rd Watch Officer (III. WO) always slightly skeptical of the Captain and without enthusiasm during the voyage, he shows no anger when a convoy is too far away to be attacked. Kriechbaum has four sons, with another on the way.
* Erwin Leder as (&quot;Chief Mechanic&quot;) Johann, also called &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Ghost&quot;): He is obsessed with a near-fetish love for &quot;U-96&quot;″s engines. Johann suffers a temporary mental breakdown during an attack by two destroyers. He is able to redeem himself by valiantly working to stop water leaks when the boat is trapped underwater near Gibraltar. Speaks a lower Austrian dialect.
* Martin May as (Senior Cadet) Ullmann: A young officer candidate who has a pregnant French fiancée (which is considered treason by the French partisans) and worries about her safety, he is one of the few crew members with whom Werner is able to connect. Werner offers to deliver Ullmann&#x27;s stack of love letters when Werner is ordered to leave the submarine.
* Heinz Hoenig as (Petty Officer) Hinrich: The radioman, sonar controller and ship&#x27;s combat medic gauges speed and direction of targets and enemy destroyers. Hinrich is one of the few crewmen whom the Captain is able to relate to.
* Uwe Ochsenknecht as (&quot;Boatswain&quot;) Lamprecht: The severe chief petty officer shows Werner around &quot;U-96&quot;, and supervises the firing and reloading of the torpedo tubes. He gets upset after hearing on the radio that the football team most of the crew supports (FC Schalke 04) are losing a match, and they will &quot;never make the final now&quot;.
* Claude-Oliver Rudolph as Ario: The burly mechanic who tells everyone that Dufte is marrying an ugly woman, and throws pictures around of Dufte&#x27;s fiancée in order to laugh at them both also has a disdainful relationship towards the Bibelforscher, as evidenced throughout the miniseries.
* Jan Fedder as (Petty Officer) Pilgrim: Another sailor (watch officer and diving planes operator) who gets almost swept off the submarine during a storm – a genuine accident during filming in which Fedder broke several ribs and was hospitalised for a while.
* Ralf Richter as (Petty Officer) Frenssen: Pilgrim&#x27;s best friend. Pilgrim and Frenssen love to trade dirty jokes and stories.
* Joachim Bernhard as (&quot;Bible scholar&quot;, also the contemporary German term for a member of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses): A very young religious sailor who is constantly reading the Bible, he is punched by Ario when the submarine is trapped at the bottom of the Strait of Gibraltar for praying rather than repairing the boat.
* Oliver Stritzel as Schwalle: A tall and well-built blond torpedoman.
* Jean-Claude Hoffmann as Benjamin: A red haired sailor who serves as a diving plane operator.
* Lutz Schnell as Dufte: The sailor who gets jeered at because of his upcoming marriage, and for a possible false airplane sighting.
* Konrad Becker as Böckstiegel: The Viennese sailor who is first visited by Hinrich for crab lice.
* Otto Sander as Philipp Thomsen: An alcoholic and shell-shocked U-boat commander, who is a member of &quot;The Old Guard&quot;, when introduced is extremely drunk and briefly mocks Hitler on the stage of the French bordello. (In the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; DVD audio commentary, Petersen says that Sander was really drunk while they were shooting the scene.) Sometime after &quot;U-96&quot; departs, Thomsen is deployed once again and the two submarines meet randomly in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean after being put off course by the storm. This upsets the Captain because it means that there is now a gap in the blockade chain. After failing to make contact later, it becomes apparent that Thomsen&#x27;s boat is missing. When &quot;U-96&quot; intercepts the convoy and sees they are without escorts, the Captain makes the observation that they must be away chasing down another boat; this boat is probably Thomsen&#x27;s.
* Günter Lamprecht as the Captain of the &quot;Weser&quot;: An enthusiastic officer aboard the resupply ship &quot;Weser&quot;, he mistakes the 1st Watch Officer for the Captain as they enter the ship&#x27;s elegant dining room. An ardent Nazi, he complains about the frustration of not being able to fight, but boasts about the food that has been prepared for the crew and the ship&#x27;s &quot;specialities&quot;.
* Sky du Mont as an officer aboard the &quot;Weser&quot; (uncredited).

==Production==
In late 1941, war correspondent Lothar-Günther Buchheim joined for her 7th patrol, during the Battle of the Atlantic. His orders were to photograph and describe the U-boat in action. In 1973, Buchheim published a novel based on his wartime experiences, (The Boat), a fictionalised autobiographical account narrated by a &quot;Leutnant Werner&quot;. It became the best-selling German fiction work on the war. A sequel by Buchheim was released in 1995.

Production for this film originally began in 1976. Several American directors were considered, and the () was to be played by Robert Redford. Disagreements sprang up among various parties and the project was shelved. Another Hollywood production was attempted with other American directors in mind, this time with the to be portrayed by Paul Newman. This effort primarily failed due to technical concerns, for example, how to film the close encounter of the two German submarines at sea during a storm.

Production of took two years (1979–1981) and was the most expensive German film at the time. Most of the filming was done in one year; to make the appearance of the actors as realistic as possible, scenes were filmed in sequence over the course of the year. This ensured natural growth of beards and hair, increasing skin pallor, and signs of strain on the actors, who had, just like real U-boat men, spent many months in a cramped, unhealthy atmosphere.

The production included the construction of several models of different sizes, as well as a complete, detailed reconstruction of the interior of the , a Type VIIC-class U-boat.

Hans-Joachim Krug, former first officer on &quot;U-219&quot;, served as a consultant, as did Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, the captain of the real &quot;U-96&quot;.

The film features both Standard German-speakers and dialect speakers. Petersen states in the DVD audio commentary that young men from throughout West Germany and Austria were recruited for the film, as he wanted faces and dialects that would accurately reflect the diversity of the Third Reich around 1941. All of the main actors are bilingual in German and English, and when the film was dubbed into English, each actor recorded his own part (with the exception of Martin Semmelrogge, who only dubbed his own role in the Director&#x27;s Cut). The German version is dubbed as well, as the film was shot &quot;silent&quot;, because the dialogue spoken on-set would have been drowned out by the gyroscopes in the special camera developed for filming. The film&#x27;s German version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version at the United States box office.

===Sets and models===

Several different sets were used. Two full-size mock-ups of a Type VIIC boat were built, one representing the portion above water for use in outdoor scenes, and the other a cylindrical tube on a motion mount (hydraulic gimbal) for the interior scenes. The mock-ups were built according to U-boat plans from Chicago&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry.

The outdoor mock-up was basically a shell propelled with a small engine, and stationed in La Rochelle, France, and has a history of its own. One morning the production crew walked out to where they kept it afloat and found it missing. Someone had forgotten to inform the crew that an American filmmaker had rented the mock-up for his own film shooting in the area. This filmmaker was Steven Spielberg and the film he was shooting was &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. A few weeks later, during production, the mock-up cracked in a storm and sank, was recovered and patched to stand in for the final scenes. The full-sized mock-up was used during the Gibraltar surface scenes; the attacking aircraft (played by a North American T-6 Texan / Harvard) and rockets were real while the British ships were models.
A mock-up of a conning tower was placed in a water tank at the Bavaria Studios in Munich for outdoor scenes not requiring a full view of the boat&#x27;s exterior. When filming on the outdoor mock-up or the conning tower, jets of cold water were hosed over the actors to simulate the breaking ocean waves. A half-sized full hull operating model was used for underwater shots and some surface running shots, in particular the meeting in stormy seas with another U-boat. The tank was also used for the shots of British sailors jumping from their ship; a small portion of the tanker hull was constructed for these shots.

During the filming there was a scene where actor Jan Fedder (Pilgrim) fell off the bridge while the U-boat was surfaced. During the played rescue, Bernd Tauber (Chief Helmsmann Kriechbaum) really broke two ribs. This event is often purported as Jan Fedder breaking the ribs.

The interior U-boat mock-up was mounted five metres off the floor and was shaken, rocked, and tilted up to 45 degrees by means of a hydraulic apparatus, and was vigorously shaken to simulate depth charge attacks. Petersen was admittedly obsessive about the structural detail of the U-boat set, remarking that &quot;every screw&quot; in the set was an authentic facsimile of the kind used in a World War II U-boat. In this he was considerably assisted by the numerous photographs Lothar-Günther Buchheim had taken during his own voyage on the historical &quot;U-96&quot;, some of which had been published in his 1976 book, (&quot;U-Boat War&quot;).

Throughout the filming, the actors were forbidden to go out in sunlight, to create the pallor of men who seldom saw the sun during their missions. The actors went through intensive training to learn how to move quickly through the narrow confines of the vessel.

===Special camera===
Most of the interior shots were filmed using a hand-held Arriflex of cinematographer Jost Vacano&#x27;s design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It had two gyroscopes to provide stability, a different and smaller scale solution than the Steadicam, so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mock-up.

==Release==
The film opened on 17 September 1981 and received a very wide release in West Germany, opening in 220 theatres and grossing a record $5,176,000 in the first two weeks. It became the highest-grossing German film in Germany.

The film opened in the United States on 10 February 1982.

== Different versions and home media==
Petersen has overseen the creation of several different versions. The first to be released was the 149-minute theatrical cut in 1981.

As the film received partial financing by West German television broadcasters WDR and the SDR, more footage was shot than was shown in the theatrical version. A version of six 50-minute episodes was transmitted on BBC2 in the United Kingdom in October 1984 and again during the 1999 Christmas season. In February 1985, a version of three 100-minute episodes was broadcast in West Germany.

In 1997, Petersen edited a new theatrical release, a 209-minute version, entitled &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, combining the action sequences from the feature-length release with the character development scenes from the miniseries, also improving audio quality.
In 1998, this cut was released on DVD as a single-disc edition including an audio commentary by Petersen, Prochnow and director&#x27;s cut producer Ortwin Freyermuth; a six-minute making-of featurette; and in most countries, the theatrical trailer. In 2003, it was also released as a &quot;Superbit&quot; edition with no extra features, but with a higher bit-rate and the film spread across two discs.

From 2010 onwards, the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, along with various new extras, was released internationally on Blu-ray.

In 2014, the original 308-minute miniseries, also known as &quot;The Original Uncut Version&quot;, was released on Blu-ray in Germany with optional English audio and subtitles.

In November 2018, a &quot;Complete Edition&quot; was released as a collection of five Blu-ray discs and three CDs. It contains more than 30 hours of material: the Director&#x27;s Cut (208 min.), the Original Cinema version (149 min.), the complete TV Series in six parts (&quot;The Original Uncut Version&quot;, 308 min.), Bonus Material (202 min. + various trailers), the Original Soundtrack by Klaus Doldinger (38:21 min.) and a German-language audiobook of the novel read by Dietmar Bär (910 min.).

For all versions of the film, new English language soundtracks were recorded featuring most of the original cast, who were bilingual. These soundtracks are included on various DVD and Blu-ray releases as an alternative language to the original German.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received highly positive reviews upon its release. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; scored the film at four out of four.
Prior to the 55th Academy Awards on 11 April 1983 the movie received six nominations: Cinematography for Jost Vacano; Directing for Wolfgang Petersen; Film Editing for Hannes Nikel; Sound for Milan Bor, Trevor Pyke and Mike Le-Mare; Sound Effects Editing for Mike Le-Mare; and Writing (Screenplay based on material from another medium) for Wolfgang Petersen.

Today, the film is seen as one of the greatest German films. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 98% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 9.10/10. The critical consensus states &quot;Taut, breathtakingly thrilling, and devastatingly intelligent, &quot;Das Boot&quot; is one of the greatest war films ever made.&quot; The film also has a score of 86 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics. For its unsurpassed authenticity in tension and realism, it is regarded internationally as pre-eminent among all submarine films. The film was ranked #25 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

In late 2007, there was an exhibition about the film &quot;Das Boot&quot;, as well as about the real U-boat &quot;U-96&quot;, at the Haus der Geschichte (House of German History) in Bonn. Over 100,000 people visited during the exhibition’s four-month run.

;Buchheim&#x27;s views of the film
Though impressed by the technological accuracy of the film&#x27;s set-design and port construction buildings, novelist Lothar-Günther Buchheim expressed disappointment with Petersen&#x27;s adaptation in a film review published in 1981, describing Petersen&#x27;s film as converting his clearly anti-war novel into a blend of a &quot;cheap, shallow American action flick&quot; and a &quot;contemporary German propaganda newsreel from World War II&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Das Boot&quot; kept the record for a German film with the most Academy Award nominations, until &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, which received nine nominations including Best Picture.

==Soundtrack==
The characteristic lead melody of the soundtrack, composed and produced by Klaus Doldinger, took on a life of its own after German rave group U96 created a remixed &quot;techno version&quot; in 1991. The title theme &quot;Das Boot&quot; later became an international hit.

The official soundtrack features only compositions by Doldinger, except for &quot; sung by Rina Ketty. The soundtrack (&quot;) released following the release of &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; version omits &quot;&quot;.

Songs heard in the film, but not included on the album are &quot;La Paloma&quot; sung by Rosita Serrano, the &quot;&quot; (a popular military march), &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; performed by the Red Army Chorus, &quot; and the &quot;.

==Sequel==
A sequel of the same name, in the form of a television series, was released in 2018, with different actors. It was set nine months after the end of the original film, and is split into two narratives, one based on land, the other set around another U-boat and its crew. Like the original film, the series is based on Lothar-Günther Buchheim&#x27;s 1973 book &quot;Das Boot&quot;, but with additions from Buchheim&#x27;s 1995 sequel .

<text>Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is a term which was used by some browser vendors to describe the combination of HTML, style sheets and client-side scripts (JavaScript, VBScript, or any other supported scripts) that enabled the creation of interactive and animated documents. The application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997.

DHTML (Dynamic HTML) allows scripting languages, such as JavaScript, to modify variables and elements in a web page&#x27;s structure, which in turn affect the look, behavior, and functionality of otherwise &quot;static&quot; HTML content after the page has been fully loaded and during the viewing process. Thus the dynamic characteristic of DHTML is the way it functions while a page is viewed, not in its ability to generate a unique page with each page load.

By contrast, a dynamic web page is a broader concept, covering any web page generated differently for each user, load occurrence, or specific variable values. This includes pages created by client-side scripting and ones created by server-side scripting (such as PHP, Python, JSP or ASP.NET) where the web server generates content before sending it to the client.

DHTML is the predecessor of Ajax and DHTML pages are still request/reload-based. Under the DHTML model, there may not be any interaction between the client and server after the page is loaded; all processing happens on the client side. By contrast, Ajax extends features of DHTML to allow the page to initiate network requests (or &#x27;subrequest&#x27;) to the server even after page load to perform additional actions. For example, if there are multiple tabs on a page, the pure DHTML approach would load the contents of all tabs and then dynamically display only the one that is active, while AJAX could load each tab only when it is really needed.

== Uses ==

DHTML allows authors to add effects to their pages that are otherwise difficult to achieve, by changing the Document Object Model (DOM) and page style. The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript offers ways to:

* Animate text and images in their document.
* Embed a ticker or other dynamic display that automatically refreshes its content with the latest news, stock quotes, or other data.
* Use a form to capture user input, and then process, verify and respond to that data without having to send data back to the server.
* Include rollover buttons or drop-down menus.

A less common use is to create browser-based action games. Although a number of games were created using DHTML during the late 1990s and early 2000s, differences between browsers made this difficult: many techniques had to be implemented in code to enable the games to work on multiple platforms. Browsers have since then converged toward web standards, which has made the design of DHTML games more viable. Those games can be played on all major browsers and in desktop and device applications that support embedded browser contexts.

The term &quot;DHTML&quot; has fallen out of use in recent years as it was associated with practices and conventions that tended to not work well between various web browsers.

DHTML support with extensive DOM access was introduced with Internet Explorer 4.0. Although there was a basic dynamic system with Netscape Navigator 4.0, not all HTML elements were represented in the DOM. When DHTML-style techniques became widespread, varying degrees of support among web browsers for the technologies involved made them difficult to develop and debug. Development became easier when Internet Explorer 5.0+, Mozilla Firefox 2.0+, and Opera 7.0+ adopted a shared DOM inherited from ECMAScript.

Later, JavaScript libraries such as jQuery abstracted away many of the day-to-day difficulties in cross-browser DOM manipulation, though better standards compliance among browsers has reduced the need for this.

== Structure of a web page ==
Typically a web page using DHTML is set up in the following way:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;DHTML example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;red&quot;&gt;
 &lt;script&gt;
 function init() {
 let myObj = document.getElementById(&quot;navigation&quot;);
 // ... manipulate myObj
 window.onload = init;
 &lt;/script&gt;
 Often the code is stored in an external file; this is done
 by linking the file that contains the JavaScript.
 This is helpful when several pages use the same script:
 &lt;script src=&quot;my-javascript.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
== Example: Displaying an additional block of text ==

The following code illustrates an often-used function. An additional part of a web page will only be displayed if the user requests it.

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Using a DOM function&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;style&gt;
 a { background-color: #eee; }
 a:hover { background: #ff0; }
 #toggleMe { background: #cfc; display: none; margin: 30px 0; padding: 1em; }
 &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;Using a DOM function&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;showhide&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Show paragraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p id=&quot;toggle-me&quot;&gt;This is the paragraph that is only displayed on request.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The general flow of the document continues.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;script&gt;
 function changeDisplayState(displayElement, textElement) {
 if (displayElement.style.display === &quot;none&quot; || displayElement.style.display === &quot;&quot;) {
 displayElement.style.display = &quot;block&quot;;
 textElement.innerHTML = &quot;Hide paragraph&quot;;
 } else {
 displayElement.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;
 textElement.innerHTML = &quot;Show paragraph&quot;;
 }
 let displayElement = document.getElementById(&quot;toggle-me&quot;);
 let textElement = document.getElementById(&quot;showhide&quot;);
 textElement.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function (event) {
 event.preventDefault();
 changeDisplayState(displayElement, textElement);
 &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
==Document Object Model==

DHTML is not a technology in and of itself; rather, it is the product of three related and complementary technologies: HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript. To allow scripts and components to access features of HTML and CSS, the contents of the document are represented as objects in a programming model known as the Document Object Model (DOM).

The DOM API is the foundation of DHTML, providing a structured interface that allows access and manipulation of virtually anything in the document. The HTML elements in the document are available as a hierarchical tree of individual objects, making it possible to examine and modify an element and its attributes by reading and setting properties and by calling methods. The text between elements is also available through DOM properties and methods.

The DOM also provides access to user actions such as pressing a key and clicking the mouse. It is possible to intercept and process these and other events by creating event handler functions and routines. The event handler receives control each time a given event occurs and can carry out any appropriate action, including using the DOM to change the document.

==Dynamic styles==

Dynamic styles are a key feature of DHTML. By using CSS, one can quickly change the appearance and formatting of elements in a document without adding or removing elements. This helps keep documents small and the scripts that manipulate the document fast.

The object model provides programmatic access to styles. This means you can change inline styles on individual elements and change style rules using simple JavaScript programming.

Inline styles are CSS style assignments that have been applied to an element using the style attribute. You can examine and set these styles by retrieving the style object for an individual element. For example, to highlight the text in a heading when the user moves the mouse pointer over it, you can use the style object to enlarge the font and change its color, as shown in the following simple example.
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Dynamic Styles&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;style&gt;
 ul { display: none; }
 &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h1 id=&quot;first-header&quot;&gt;Welcome to Dynamic HTML&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;clickable-link&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Dynamic styles are a key feature of DHTML.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ul id=&quot;unordered-list&quot;&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Change the color, size, and typeface of text&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Show and hide text&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;And much, much more&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We&#x27;ve only just begun!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;script&gt;
 function showMe() {
 document.getElementById(&quot;first-header&quot;).style.color = &quot;#990000&quot;;
 document.getElementById(&quot;unordered-list&quot;).style.display = &quot;block&quot;;

 document.getElementById(&quot;clickable-link&quot;).addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function (event) {
 event.preventDefault();
 showMe();
 &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<doc id="8997" wikidata="Q159595" url="?curid=8997" title="Distance education">
<text>Distance education, also known as distance learning, is the education of students who may not always be physically present at school, or where the learner and the teacher are separated in both time and distance. Traditionally, this usually involved correspondence courses wherein the student corresponded with the school via mail. Distance education is a technology-mediated modality and has evolved with the evolution of technologies such as video conferencing, TV, and the Internet. Today, it usually involves online education through an online school. A distance learning program can either be completely a remote learning, or a combination of both online learning and traditional in-person (also known as, offline) classroom instruction (called hybrid or blended). Other modalities include distance learning with complementary virtual environment or teaching in virtual environment (e-learning).

Massive open online courses (MOOCs), offering large-scale interactive participation and open access through the World Wide Web or other network technologies, are recent educational modes in distance education. A number of other terms (distributed learning, e-learning, m-learning, online learning, virtual classroom, etc.) are used roughly synonymously with distance education. E-learning has shown to be a useful educational tool. E-learning should be an interactive process with multiple learning modes for all learners at various levels of learning. The distance learning environment is an exciting place to learn new things, collaborate with others, and retain self-discipline.

== History ==
One of the earliest attempts at distance education was advertised in 1728. This was in the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot; for &quot;Caleb Philipps, Teacher of the new method of Short Hand&quot;, who sought students who wanted to learn the skills through weekly mailed lessons.

The first distance education course in the modern sense was provided by Sir Isaac Pitman in the 1840s who taught a system of shorthand by mailing texts transcribed into shorthand on postcards and receiving transcriptions from his students in return for correction. The element of student feedback was a crucial innovation in Pitman&#x27;s system. The postage stamp made this scheme for remote education possible, and these efforts were scalable because of the introduction of uniform postage rates across England in 1840.

This early beginning proved extremely successful and the Phonographic Correspondence Society was founded three years later to establish these courses on a more formal basis. The society paved the way for the later formation of Sir Isaac Pitman Colleges across the country.

The first correspondence school in the United States was the Society to Encourage Studies at Home which was founded in 1873.

Founded in 1894, Wolsey Hall, Oxford was the first distance-learning college in the UK.

=== University correspondence courses ===
====United Kingdom====

The University of London was the first university to offer degrees to anyone who could pass their examinations, establishing its External Programme in 1858. It had been established in 1836 as an examining and degree-awarding body for affiliated colleges, originally University College London and King&#x27;s College London but with many others added over the next two decades. The affiliated colleges provided certificates that the student had attended a course. A new charter in 1858 removed this requirement, allowing men (and women from 1878) taking instruction at any institution or pursuing a course of self-directed study to sit the examinations and receive degrees. The External Programme was referred to as the &quot;People&#x27;s University&quot; by Charles Dickens as it provided access to higher education to students from less affluent backgrounds. Enrollment increased steadily during the late 19th century, and its example was widely copied elsewhere. However, the university only provided examinations, not instructional material, leading academics to state that &quot;the original degree by external study of the UOL was not a form of distance education&quot;.

The External Programme is now known as the University of London Worldwide, and includes postgraduate and undergraduate degrees created by member institutions of the University of London.

====Australia and South Africa====
The vast distances made Australia especially active; the University of Queensland established its Department of Correspondence Studies in 1911.

In South Africa, the University of South Africa, formerly an examining and certification body, started to present distance education tuition in 1946.

====United States====
In the United States, only a third of the population lived in cities of 100,000 or more population in 1920; in order to reach the rest, correspondence techniques were adopted.

William Rainey Harper, founder and first president of the University of Chicago, celebrated the concept of extended education, where a research university had satellite colleges elsewhere in the region.

In 1892, Harper encouraged correspondence courses to further promote education, an idea that was put into practice by the University of Chicago, U. Wisconsin, Columbia U., and several dozen other universities by the 1920s. Enrollment in the largest private for-profit school based in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the International Correspondence Schools grew explosively in the 1890s. Founded in 1888 to provide training for immigrant coal miners aiming to become state mine inspectors or foremen, it enrolled 2500 new students in 1894 and matriculated 72,000 new students in 1895. By 1906 total enrollments reached 900,000. The growth was due to sending out complete textbooks instead of single lessons, and the use of 1200 aggressive in-person salesmen. There was a stark contrast in pedagogy:

Education was a high priority in the Progressive Era, as American high schools and colleges expanded greatly. For men who were older or were too busy with family responsibilities, night schools were opened, such as the YMCA school in Boston that became Northeastern University. Private correspondence schools outside of the major cities provided a flexible, focused solution. Large corporations systematized their training programs for new employees. The National Association of Corporation Schools grew from 37 in 1913 to 146 in 1920. Private schools that provided specialized technical training to everyone who enrolled, not just employees of one company, began to open across the nation in the 1880s. Starting in Milwaukee in 1907, public schools began opening free vocational program.

====International Conference====
The International Conference for Correspondence Education held its first meeting in 1938. The goal was to provide individualized education for students, at low cost, by using a pedagogy of testing, recording, classification, and differentiation. Since then, the group has changed its name to the International Council for Open and Distance Education (ICDE), with its main office in Oslo, Norway.

=== Open universities ===

The Open University (OU) in the United Kingdom was founded by the then Labour government led by Harold Wilson. Based on the vision of Michael Young, planning commenced in 1965 under the Minister of State for Education, Jennie Lee, who established a model for the Open University as one of widening access to the highest standards of scholarship in higher education and setting up a planning committee consisting of university vice-chancellors, educationalists, and television broadcasters, chaired by Sir Peter Venables. The British Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (BBC) Assistant Director of Engineering at the time, James Redmond, had obtained most of his qualifications at , and his natural enthusiasm for the project did much to overcome the technical difficulties of using television to broadcast teaching programs.
The Open University revolutionized the scope of the correspondence program and helped to create a respectable learning alternative to the traditional form of education. It has been at the forefront of developing new technologies to improve distance learning service as well as undertaking research in other disciplines. Walter Perry was appointed the OU&#x27;s first vice-chancellor in January 1969, and its foundation secretary was Anastasios Christodoulou. The election of the new Conservative government under the leadership of Edward Heath, in 1970; led to budget cuts under Chancellor of the Exchequer Iain Macleod (who had earlier called the idea of an Open University &quot;blithering nonsense&quot;). However, the OU accepted its first 25,000 students in 1971, adopting a radical open admissions policy. At the time, the total student population of conventional universities in the United Kingdom was around 130,000.

Athabasca University, Canada&#x27;s open university, was created in 1970 and followed a similar, though independently developed, pattern. The Open University inspired the creation of Spain&#x27;s National University of Distance Education (1972) and Germany&#x27;s FernUniversität in Hagen (1974). There are now many similar institutions around the world, often with the name &quot;Open University&quot; (in English or in the local language).

The University of the Philippines Open University was established in 1995 as the fifth constituent University of the Philippines System and was the first distance education and online university in the Philippines. Its mandate is to provide educational opportunities to individuals aspiring for higher education and improved qualifications but were unable to take advantage of traditional modes of education because of personal and professional obligations.

Most open universities use distance education technologies as delivery methods, though some require attendance at local study centers or at regional &quot;summer schools&quot;. Some open universities have grown to become &quot;mega-universities&quot;.

===COVID-19 pandemic===


The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the closure of the vast majority of schools worldwide for in-person learning. COVID-19 increased the value of distance education although its policies were implemented and formulated among several universities much earlier. Many schools moved to online remote learning through platforms including—but not limited to—Zoom, Blackboard, Cisco Webex, Google Classroom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, D2L, and Edgenuity. A recent study showed that Google Classroom was the most used platform by students followed by Microsoft Teams and Zoom, respectively. The less-used platforms included Blackboard Learn, Webex by Cisco, DingTalk, Tencent, and WhatsApp. However, the most preferred platforms by students were Microsoft Teams followed by Google Classroom and Zoom. Although Google Classroom was the most used by students as decided by their lectures, Microsoft Teams was the most preferred by those students

Concerns arose over the impact of this transition on students without access to an internet-enabled device or a stable internet connection. Distanced education during the COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted synchronous learning for many students and teachers; where educators were no longer able to teach in real-time and could only switch to asynchronous instruction, this significantly and negatively affected their coping with the transition, and posed various legal issues, especially in terms of copyright. The physical surroundings during the COVID-19 pandemic are seen by university instructors as having a detrimental effect on the quality of distance education. However, where the lecture is delivered and the type of faculty do not show any significant statistical variances in the quality of distance education. The shift away from real-time instruction to asynchronous learning modes has posed significant challenges, impacting both the teaching and learning experience. Educators, grappling with this abrupt transition, have faced hurdles in effectively engaging students and delivering course content, leading to heightened stress and burnout among faculty members. Additionally, this shift has raised legal concerns, particularly regarding copyright issues related to the dissemination of educational materials in digital formats. Post-COVID-19  pandemic, while some educational institutions went back to physical classes, others switched to blended learning or kept up their online distance learning.

A recent study about the benefits and drawbacks of online learning found that students have had a harder time producing their own work. The study suggests teachers should cut back on the amount of information taught and incorporate more activities during the lesson, in order for students to create their own work. Though schools are slow to adapt to new technologies, COVID-19 required schools to adapt and learn how to use new digital and online learning tools. Web conferencing has become more popular since 2007. Researchers have found that people in online classes perform just as effectively as participants in conventional learning classes. The use of online learning is becoming a pathway for learners with sparse access to physical courses so they can complete their degrees. Furthermore, digital classroom technologies allow those living remotely to access learning, and it enables the student to fit learning into their schedule more easily.

== Technologies ==
Internet technology has enabled many forms of distance learning through open educational resources and facilities such as e-learning and MOOCs. Although the expansion of the Internet blurs the boundaries, distance education technologies are divided into two modes of delivery: synchronous learning and asynchronous learning.

In synchronous learning, all participants are &quot;present&quot; at the same time in a virtual classroom, as in traditional classroom teaching. It requires a timetable. Web conferencing, videoconferencing, educational television, and instructional television are examples of synchronous technology, as are direct-broadcast satellite (DBS), internet radio, live streaming, telephone, and web-based VoIP.

Web conferencing software helps to facilitate class meetings, and usually contains additional interaction tools such as text chat, polls, hand raising, emoticons etc. These tools also support asynchronous participation by students who can listen to recordings of synchronous sessions. Immersive environments (notably SecondLife) have also been used to enhance participant presence in distance education courses. Another form of synchronous learning using the classroom is the use of robot proxies including those that allow sick students to attend classes.

Some universities have been starting to use robot proxies to enable more engaging synchronous hybrid classes where both remote and in-person students can be present and interact using telerobotics devices such as the Kubi Telepresence robot stand that looks around and the Double Robot that roams around. With these telepresence robots, the remote students have a seat at the table or desk instead of being on a screen on the wall.

In asynchronous learning, participants access course materials flexibly on their schedules. Students are not required to be together at the same time. Mail correspondence, which is the oldest form of distance education, is an asynchronous delivery technology, as are message board forums, e-mail, video and audio recordings, print materials, voicemail, and fax.

The five characteristics of technological innovations (compatibility, observability, relative advantage, complexity, and trialability) have a significant positive relationship with the digital literacy of users. Besides, observability, trialability, and digital skill were found to have a positive significant influence on digital literacy.    

The two methods can be combined. Many courses offered by both open universities and an increasing number of campus-based institutions use periodic sessions of residential or day teaching to supplement the sessions delivered at a distance. This type of mixed distance and campus-based education has recently come to be called &quot;blended learning&quot; or less often &quot;hybrid learning&quot;. Many open universities use a blend of technologies and a blend of learning modalities (face-to-face, distance, and hybrid) all under the rubric of &quot;distance learning&quot;.

Distance learning can also use interactive radio instruction (IRI), interactive audio instruction (IAI), online virtual worlds, digital games, webinars, and webcasts, all of which are referred to as e-Learning.

=== Radio and television ===

The rapid spread of film in the 1920s and radio in the 1930s led to proposals to use it for distance education. By 1938, at least 200 city school systems, 25 state boards of education, and many colleges and universities broadcast educational programs for public schools. One line of thought was to use radio as a master teacher.
The first large-scale implementation of radio for distance education took place in 1937 in Chicago. During a three-week school closure implemented in response to a polio outbreak that the city was experiencing, superintendent of Chicago Public Schools William Johnson and assistant superintendent Minnie Fallon implemented a programs of distance learning that provided the city&#x27;s elementary school students with instruction through radio broadcasts.

A typical setup came in Kentucky in 1948 when John Wilkinson Taylor, president of the University of Louisville, teamed up with NBC to use radio as a medium for distance education. The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission endorsed the project and predicted that the &quot;college-by-radio&quot; would put &quot;American education 25 years ahead&quot;. The university was owned by the city, and local residents would pay the low tuition rates, receive their study materials in the mail, and listen by radio to live classroom discussions that were held on campus. Physicist Daniel Q. Posin also was a pioneer in the field of distance education when he hosted a televised course through DePaul University.

Charles Wedemeyer of the University of Wisconsin–Madison also promoted new methods. From 1964 to 1968, the Carnegie Foundation funded Wedemeyer&#x27;s &quot;Articulated Instructional Media Project&quot; (AIM) which brought in a variety of communications technologies aimed at providing learning to an off-campus population. The radio courses faded away in the 1950s. Many efforts to use television along the same lines proved unsuccessful, despite heavy funding by the Ford Foundation.

From 1970 to 1972 the Coordinating Commission for Higher Education in California funded Project Outreach to study the potential of tele-courses. The study included the University of California, California State University, and community colleges. This study led to coordinated instructional systems legislation allowing the use of public funds for non-classroom instruction and paved the way for the emergence of tele-courses as the precursor to the online courses and programs of today. The Coastline Community Colleges, The Dallas County Community College District, and Miami Dade Community College led the way. The &quot;Adult Learning Service&quot; of the US Public Broadcasting Service came into being and the &quot;wrapped&quot; series, and individually produced tele-course for credit became a significant part of the history of distance education and online learning.

=== Internet ===
The widespread use of computers and the Internet has made distance learning easier and faster, and today virtual schools and virtual universities deliver full curricula online. The capacity of the Internet to support voice, video, text, and immersion teaching methods made earlier distinct forms of telephone, videoconferencing, radio, television, and text-based education somewhat redundant. However, many of the techniques developed and lessons learned with earlier media are used in Internet delivery.

The first online courses for graduate and undergraduate credit were offered in 1985 by Connected Education through The New School in New York City, with students earning the MA in Media Studies completely online via computer conferencing, with no in-person requirements. This was followed in 1986 by the University of Toronto through the Graduate School of Education (then called OISE: the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education), offering a course in &quot;Women and Computers in Education&quot;, dealing with gender issues and educational computing. The first new and fully online university was founded in 1994 as the Open University of Catalonia, headquartered in Barcelona, Spain. In 1999 Jones International University was launched as the first fully online university accredited by a regional accrediting association in the US.

Between 2000 and 2008, enrollment in distance education courses increased rapidly almost every country in both developed and developing countries. Many private, public, non-profit, and for-profit institutions worldwide now offer distance education courses from the most basic instruction through to the highest levels of degree and doctoral programs. New York University and International University Canada, for example, offer online degrees in engineering and management-related fields through NYU Tandon Online. Levels of accreditation vary: widely respected universities such as Stanford University and Harvard now deliver online courses—but other online schools receive little outside oversight, and some are fraudulent, i.e., diploma mills. In the US, the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC) specializes in the accreditation of distance education institutions.

In the United States in 2011, it was found that a third of all the students enrolled in postsecondary education had taken an accredited online course in a postsecondary institution. Growth continued. In 2013 the majority of public and private colleges offered full academic programs online. Programs included training in the mental health, occupational therapy, family therapy, art therapy, physical therapy, and rehabilitation counseling fields.

By 2008, online learning programs were available in the United States in 44 states at the K-12 level.

Internet forums, online discussion groups, and online learning community can contribute to a distance education experience. Research shows that socialization plays an important role in some forms of distance education.

E-Courses are available from educational platforms such as Khan Academy and MasterClass on many topics and for students of all levels.

== Paced and self-paced models ==
Most distance education uses a paced format similar to traditional campus-based models in which learners commence and complete a course at the same time. Some institutions offer self-paced programs that allow for continuous enrollment, and the length of time to complete the course is set by the learner&#x27;s time, skill, and commitment levels. Self-paced courses are almost always offered asynchronously. Each delivery method offers advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers, and institutions.

Kaplan and Haenlein classify distance education into four groups according to &quot;Time dependency&quot; and &quot;Number of participants&quot;: 
# MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses): Open-access online course (i.e., without specific participation restrictions) that allows for unlimited (massive) participation; 
# SPOCs (Small Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and therefore requires some form of formal enrollment;
# SMOCs (Synchronous Massive Online Courses): Open-access online course that allows for unlimited participation but requires students to be &quot;present&quot; at the same time (synchronously);
# SSOCs (Synchronous Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and requires students to be &quot;present&quot; at the same time (synchronously).

Paced models are a familiar mode since they are used almost exclusively in campus-based schools. Institutes that offer both distance and campus programs usually use paced models so that teacher workload, student semester planning, tuition deadlines, exam schedules, and other administrative details can be synchronized with campus delivery. Student familiarity and the pressure of deadlines encourage students to readily adapt to and usually succeed in paced models. However, student freedom is sacrificed as a common pace is often too fast for some students and too slow for others. In additional life events, professional or family responsibilities can interfere with a student&#x27;s capability to complete tasks to an external schedule. Finally, paced models allow students to readily form communities of inquiry and to engage in collaborative work.

Self-paced courses maximize student freedom, as not only can students commence studies on any date, but they can complete a course in as little time as a few weeks or up to a year or longer. Students often enroll in self-paced study when they are under pressure to complete programs, have not been able to complete a scheduled course, need additional courses, or have pressure which precludes regular study for any length of time. The self-paced nature of the programming, though, is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination, resulting in course incompletion. Assessment of learning can also be challenging as exams can be written on any day, making it possible for students to share examination questions with resulting loss of academic integrity. Finally, it is extremely challenging to organize collaborative work activities, though some schools are developing cooperative models based upon networked and connectivist pedagogies for use in self-paced programs.

== Benefits ==
Distance learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments. Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure. As a result, more classes can be offered and enable students to enroll in more of their required classes on time and prevent delayed graduation. Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.
As the population at large becomes more involved in lifelong learning beyond the normal schooling age, institutions can benefit financially, and adult learning business courses may be particularly lucrative. Distance education programs can act as a catalyst for institutional innovation and are at least as effective as face-to-face learning programs, especially if the instructor is knowledgeable and skilled.

Distance education can also provide a broader method of communication within the realm of education. With the many tools and programs that technological advancements have to offer, communication appears to increase in distance education amongst students and their professors, as well as students and their classmates. The distance educational increase in communication, particularly communication amongst students and their classmates, is an improvement that has been made to provide distance education students with as many of the opportunities as possible as they would receive in in-person education. The improvement being made in distance education is growing in tandem with the constant technological advancements. Present-day online communication allows students to associate with accredited schools and programs throughout the world that are out of reach for in-person learning. By having the opportunity to be involved in global institutions via distance education, a diverse array of thought is presented to students through communication with their classmates. This is beneficial because students have the opportunity to &quot;combine new opinions with their own, and develop a solid foundation for learning&quot;. It has been shown through research that &quot;as learners become aware of the variations in interpretation and construction of meaning among a range of people [they] construct an individual meaning&quot;, which can help students become knowledgeable of a wide array of viewpoints in education. To increase the likelihood that students will build effective ties with one another during the course, instructors should use similar assignments for students across different locations to overcome the influence of co-location on relationship building.

The high cost of education affects students in higher education, and distance education may be an alternative in order to provide some relief. Distance education has been a more cost-effective form of learning, and can sometimes save students a significant amount of money as opposed to traditional education. Distance education may be able to help to save students a considerable amount financially by removing the cost of transportation. In addition, distance education may be able to save students from the economic burden of high-priced course textbooks. Many textbooks are now available as electronic textbooks, known as e-textbooks, which can offer digital textbooks for a reduced price in comparison to traditional textbooks. Also, the increasing improvements in technology have resulted in many school libraries having a partnership with digital publishers that offer course materials for free, which can help students significantly with educational costs.

Within the class, students are able to learn in ways that traditional classrooms would not be able to provide. It is able to promote good learning experiences and therefore, allow students to obtain higher satisfaction with their online learning. For example, students can review their lessons more than once according to their needs. Students can then manipulate the coursework to fit their learning by focusing more on their weaker topics while breezing through concepts that they already have or can easily grasp. When course design and the learning environment are at their optimal conditions, distance education can lead students to higher satisfaction with their learning experiences. Studies have shown that high satisfaction correlates to increased learning. For those in a healthcare or mental health distance learning program, online-based interactions have the potential to foster deeper reflections and discussions of client issues as well as a quicker response to client issues, since supervision happens on a regular basis and is not limited to a weekly supervision meeting. This also may contribute to the students feeling a greater sense of support, since they have ongoing and regular access to their instructors and other students.

Distance learning may enable students who are unable to attend a traditional school setting, due to disability or illness such as decreased mobility and immune system suppression, to get a good education. Children who are sick or are unable to attend classes are able to attend them in &quot;person&quot; through the use of robot proxies. This helps the students have experiences in the classroom and social interaction that they are unable to receive at home or the hospital, while still keeping them in a safe learning environment. Over the last few years more students are entering safely back into the classroom thanks to the help of robots. An article from the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;A Swiveling Proxy Will Even Wear a Tutu&quot;, explains the positive impact of virtual learning in the classroom, and another explains how even a simple, stationary telepresence robot can help.
Distance education may provide equal access regardless of socioeconomic status or income, area of residence, gender, race, age, or cost per student. Applying universal design strategies to distance learning courses as they are being developed (rather than instituting accommodations for specific students on an as-needed basis) can increase the accessibility of such courses to students with a range of abilities, disabilities, learning styles, and native languages.
Distance education graduates, who would never have been associated with the school under a traditional system, may donate money to the school.

Distance learning may also offer a final opportunity for adolescents that are no longer permitted in the general education population due to behavior disorders. Instead of these students having no other academic opportunities, they may continue their education from their homes and earn their diplomas, offering them another chance to be an integral part of society.

Distance learning offers individuals a unique opportunity to benefit from the expertise and resources of the best universities currently available. Moreover, the online environment facilitates pedagogical innovation such as new program structures and formats. Students have the ability to collaborate, share, question, infer, and suggest new methods and techniques for continuous improvement of the content. The ability to complete a course at a pace that is appropriate for each individual is the most effective manner to learn given the personal demands on time and schedule. Self-paced distance learning on a mobile device, such as a smartphone, provides maximum flexibility and capability.

Distance learning can also reduce the phenomenon of rural exodus by enabling students from remote regions to remain in their hometowns while pursuing higher education. Eliminating the distance barrier to higher education can also increase the number of alternatives open to students, and foster greater competition between institutions of higher learning regardless of geography.

== Criticism ==
Barriers to effective distance education include obstacles such as domestic distractions and unreliable technology, as well as students&#x27; program costs, adequate contact with teachers and support services, and a need for more experience.

Some students attempt to participate in distance education without proper training with the tools needed to be successful in the program. Students must be provided with training opportunities (if needed) on each tool that is used throughout the program. The lack of advanced technology skills can lead to an unsuccessful experience. Schools have a responsibility to adopt a proactive policy for managing technology barriers. Time management skills and self-discipline in distance education is just as important as complete knowledge of the software and tools being used for learning.

The results of a study of Washington state community college students showed that distance- learning students tended to drop out more often than their traditional counterparts due to difficulties in language, time management, and study skills.

According to Pankaj Singhm, director of Nims University, &quot;distance learning benefits may outweigh the disadvantages for students in such a technology-driven society, however before indulging into the use of educational technology a few more disadvantages should be considered.&quot; He describes that over multiple years, &quot;all of the obstacles have been overcome and the world environment for distance education continues to improve.&quot; Pankaj Singhm also claims there is a debate to distance education stating, &quot;due to a lack of direct face-to-face social interaction. However, as more people become used to personal and social interaction online (for example dating, chat rooms, shopping, or blogging), it is becoming easier for learners to both project themselves and socializes with others. This is an obstacle that has dissipated.&quot;

Not all courses required to complete a degree may be offered online. Health care profession programs in particular require some sort of patient interaction through field work before a student may graduate. Studies have also shown that students pursuing a medical professional graduate degree who are participating in distance education courses, favor a face to face communication over professor-mediated chat rooms and/or independent studies. However, this is little correlation between student performance when comparing the previous different distance learning strategies.

There is a theoretical problem with the application of traditional teaching methods to online courses because online courses may have no upper size limit. Daniel Barwick noted that there is no evidence that large class size is always worse or that small class size is always better, although a negative link has been established between certain types of instruction in large classes and learning outcomes; he argued that higher education has not made a sufficient effort to experiment with a variety of instructional methods to determine whether the large class size is always negatively correlated with a reduction in learning outcomes. Early proponents of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) saw them as just the type of experiment that Barwick had pointed out was lacking in higher education, although Barwick himself has never advocated for MOOCs.

There may also be institutional challenges. Distance learning is new enough that it may be a challenge to gain support for these programs in a traditional brick-and-mortar academic learning environment. Furthermore, it may be more difficult for the instructor to organize and plan a distance learning program, especially since many are new programs and their organizational needs are different from a traditional learning program.

Additionally, though distance education offers industrial countries the opportunity to become globally informed, there are still negative sides to it. Hellman states that &quot;These include its cost and capital intensiveness, time constraints and other pressures on instructors, the isolation of students from instructors and their peers, instructors&#x27; enormous difficulty in adequately evaluating students they never meet face-to-face, and drop-out rates far higher than in classroom-based courses.&quot;

A more complex challenge of distance education relates to cultural differences between students and teachers and among students. Distance programs tend to be more diverse as they could go beyond the geographical borders of regions, countries, and continents, and cross the cultural borders that may exist concerning race, gender, and religion. That requires a proper understanding and awareness of the norms, differences, preconceptions, and potential conflicting issues.

== Assessments ==
Tools have been developed to assess the quality of distance education. Walker developed a survey instrument known as the Distance Education Learning Environment Survey (DELES), which examines instructor support, student interaction, and collaboration, personal relevance, authentic learning, active learning, and student autonomy. Harnish and Reeves provide a systematic approach based on training, implementation, system usage, communication, and support.

== Educational technology ==
The modern use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning) facilitates distance learning and independent learning through the extensive use of information and communications technology (ICT), replacing traditional content delivery with postal correspondence. Instruction can be synchronous and asynchronous online communication in an interactive learning environment or virtual communities, in lieu of a physical classroom. &quot;The focus is shifted to the education transaction in the form of a virtual community of learners sustainable across time.&quot;

One of the most significant issues encountered in the mainstream correspondence model of distance education is transactional distance, which results from the lack of appropriate communication between learner and teacher. This gap has been observed to become wider if there is no communication between the learner and teacher and has direct implications for the learning process and future endeavors in distance education. Distance education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures to increase the amount of interaction between learners and teachers. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, and increased use of information and communication technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.

== Credentials ==
Online credentials for learning are digital credentials that are offered in place of traditional paper credentials for a skill or educational achievement. Directly linked to the accelerated development of internet communication technologies, the development of digital badges, electronic passports and massive open online courses (MOOCs) have a very direct bearing on our understanding of learning, recognition and levels as they pose a direct challenge to the status quo. It is useful to distinguish between three forms of online credentials: Test-based credentials, online badges, and online certificates.

<text>Death of a Hero is a World War I novel by Richard Aldington. It was his first novel, published by Chatto &amp; Windus in 1929, and thought to be partly autobiographical.

==Plot summary==

&quot;Death of a Hero&quot; is the story of a young English artist named George Winterbourne who enlists in the army at the beginning of World War I. The book is narrated by an unnamed first-person narrator who claims to have known and served with the main character. It is divided into three parts.

===Book I===

The first part details George&#x27;s family history. His father, a middle-class man from England&#x27;s countryside, marries a poor woman who falsely believes she is marrying into a monied family. After George&#x27;s birth, his mother has a series of lovers. The portrait of George&#x27;s parents is believed to be based on his own parents, whom he disliked. One critic called the characters &quot;parodic monsters&quot;.

George is brought up to be a proper and patriotic member of English society. He is encouraged to learn his father&#x27;s insurance business, but fails to do so. After a disagreement with his parents, he relocates to London to become an artist and live a socialite lifestyle.

===Book II===

The second section of the book deals with George&#x27;s London life. He ingrains himself in socialite society and engages a number of trendy philosophies.

After he and his lover, Elizabeth, have a pregnancy scare, they decide to marry. Although they do not have a child, the marriage endures. They decide to leave their marriage open. George takes Elizabeth&#x27;s close friend as a lover, however, and their marriage begins to fall apart. Just as the situation is becoming particularly heated, England declares war on Germany. George decides to enlist.

Aldington&#x27;s portrayal of society contains &quot;clumsily satirical portraits&quot; of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, both of whom were close personal acquaintances.

===Book III===

George trains for the army and is sent to France. (No particular location in France is mentioned. The town behind the front where George spends much of his time is referred to as M—.) He fights on the front for some time. When he returns home, he finds that he has been so affected by the war that he cannot relate to his friends, including his wife and lover.

The casualty rate among officers is particularly high at the front. When a number of officers in George&#x27;s unit are killed, he is promoted. Upon spending time with the other officers, he finds them to be cynical and utilitarian. He loses faith in the war quickly.

The story ends with George standing up during a machine-gun barrage. He is killed.

At the end of the book there is a poem written from the point of view of a veteran comparing World War I to the Trojan War.

==Censorship==
Aldington, a veteran of World War I, claimed that his novel was accurate in terms of speech and style. It contained extensive colloquial speech, including profanity, discussion of sexuality and graphic descriptions of the war and of trench life. There was extensive censorship in England and many war novels had been banned or burned as a result. When Aldington first published his novel, he redacted a number of passages to ensure the publication of his book would not be challenged. He insisted that his publishers include a disclaimer in the original printing of the book with the following text:
To my astonishment, my publisher informed me that certain words, phrases, sentences, and even passages, are at present taboo in England. I have recorded nothing which I have not observed in human life, said nothing I do not believe to be true... At my request the publishers are removing what they believe would be considered objectionable, and are placing asterisks to show where omissions have been made... In my opinion it is better for the book to appear mutilated than for me to say what I don&#x27;t believe.

<doc id="9001" wikidata="Q978963" url="?curid=9001" title="Degree Confluence Project">
<text>The Degree Confluence Project is a World Wide Web-based all-volunteer project that aims to have people visit each of the integer degree intersections of latitude and longitude on Earth, posting photographs and a narrative of each visit online. The project describes itself as &quot;an organized sampling of the world&quot;.

==Requirements==
The precise location of each degree confluence uses the WGS 84 horizontal datum, and visitors to degree confluences almost always make use of GNSS receivers. For a &quot;successful visit&quot;, the visitor must get within 100 metres of the confluence point, and post a narrative and several photographs to the project website. A visit, or attempted visit, which does not conform to these rules may still be recorded on the website as an &quot;incomplete visit&quot;. The project encourages visits to degree confluences which have been visited previously, and many confluence points — especially in non-remote regions of developed nations – have been visited several times.

The total number of degree confluences is 64,442, of which 21,543 are on land, 38,409 on water, and 4,490 on the Antarctic and Arctic ice caps. The project categorizes degree confluences as either &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;secondary&quot;. A confluence is primary only if it is on land or within sight of land. In addition, at latitudes greater than 48°, only some points are designated primary because confluences crowd together near the poles. Both primary and secondary confluences may be visited and recorded.

In addition, visits to certain special geographical locations can also be reported (special visits). For example:
* Middle of the World monument (0°, 78°27&#x27;08&quot;W)
* Centers of continents
* Royal Greenwich Observatory

== History ==
The project was started by Alex Jarrett in February 1996 because he &quot;liked the idea of visiting a location represented by a round number such as 43°00&#x27;00&quot;N 72°00&#x27;00&quot;W. What would be there? Would other people have recognized this as a unique spot?&quot;

As of October 2024, 6,668 (40.7%) of 16,349 primary confluences have been visited, covering 195 countries and territories.

== Milestones ==
* First degree confluence visit posted to the website: in New Hampshire, USA by Alex Jarrett (project founder) and Peter Cline on February 20, 1996. (Note that some degree confluence visits that pre-date this visit have since been posted on the project&#x27;s website.)
* Highest confluence: in Kuba, Tibet, China at 19,143 feet (5,835 m), first visited by Greg Michaels and Robert Whitfield on May 29, 2005.
* Lowest confluence: in Matrūh, Egypt at −255 feet (−78 m), first visited by Dave Morrison, Steve Price and Tony Carlisle on December 4, 2004.

His films were popular, especially for his performances of patter songs and favorites such as &quot;Inchworm&quot; and &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;.

He was the first ambassador-at-large of UNICEF in 1954 and received the French Legion of Honour in 1986 for his years of work with the organization.

==Early life and education==
David Daniel Kaminsky was born in Brooklyn, New York, on January 18, 1911 (though he would later say 1913), to Ukrainian Jewish immigrants Jacob and Clara (&quot;née&quot; Nemerovsky) Kaminsky. He was the youngest of three sons. His parents and older brothers Larry and Mac left Yekaterinoslav (then part of Novorossia in the Russian Empire) two years before Danny&#x27;s birth; he was their only son born in the United States.

He attended Public School 149 in East New York, Brooklyn (eventually renamed to honor him)—where he began entertaining his classmates with songs and jokes. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, but he did not graduate.

His mother died when he was in his early teens. Not long after, Kaye and his friend Louis ran away to Florida. Kaye sang while Louis played the guitar, and the pair eked out a living for a while. When Kaye returned to New York, his father did not pressure him to return to school or work, giving his son the chance to mature and discover his abilities. Kaye said that as a young boy, he had wanted to be a surgeon, but the family could not afford medical education.

After leaving school, he held a succession of jobs as a soda jerk, auto insurance investigator, and office clerk. Most ended with him being fired. He lost the insurance job when he made an error that cost the insurance company $40,000 ($600,000 in 2019 adjusted for inflation). A dentist who hired him to look after his office over lunch and run errands fired him when he found Kaye using his dental drill on the office woodwork. In 1939, Kaye met the same dentist&#x27;s daughter, Sylvia Fine, at an audition, and in 1940, they eloped. He learned his trade in his teenaged years in the Catskills as a tummler (M.C.) in the Borscht Belt.

Kaye&#x27;s first break came in 1933 when he joined the Three , a vaudeville dance act. They opened in Utica, New York, where he used the stage name Danny Kaye for the first time. The act toured the United States and in Asia with the show &quot;La Vie Paree&quot;. The troupe left for a six-month tour of Asia on February 8, 1934. During its stay in Osaka, Japan, a typhoon hit the city. The troupe&#x27;s hotel suffered heavy damage. The strong wind hurled a piece of the hotel&#x27;s cornice into Kaye&#x27;s room. By evening&#x27;s performance time, the city was in the grip of the storm. With no power, the audience became restless and nervous. To calm them, Kaye went on stage holding a flashlight to illuminate his face and sang every song he could recall as loudly as he was able.

The experience of trying to entertain audiences who did not speak English inspired him to do the pantomime gestures, songs, and facial expressions that eventually made his reputation. Sometimes, he found them necessary when ordering a meal. Kaye&#x27;s daughter Dena relates a story her father told about being in a restaurant in China and trying to order chicken. Kaye flapped his arms and clucked, giving the waiter an imitation of a chicken. The waiter nodded in understanding, bringing Kaye two eggs. His interest in cooking began on the tour.

Jobs were in short supply when Kaye returned to the United States, and he struggled for bookings. One job was working in a burlesque revue with fan dancer Sally Rand. After the dancer dropped a fan while trying to chase away a fly, Kaye was hired to watch the fans, so they were always held in front of her.

==Career==
In 1937, Kaye&#x27;s film debut came from a contract with New York-based Educational Pictures for a series of two-reel comedies. He usually played a manic, dark-haired, fast-talking Russian in these low-budget shorts, opposite young hopefuls June Allyson and Imogene Coca. The Kaye series ended abruptly when the studio shut down in 1938. He was working in the Catskills in 1937 under the name Danny Kolbin.

His next venture was a short-lived Broadway show with Sylvia Fine as the pianist, lyricist, and composer. &quot;The Straw Hat Revue&quot; opened on September 29, 1939, and closed after 10 weeks, but critics noticed Kaye&#x27;s work. The reviews brought an offer for both Kaye and his bride Sylvia to work at La Martinique, a New York City nightclub. Kaye performed with Sylvia as his accompanist. At La Martinique, playwright Moss Hart saw Danny perform, and that led to Hart&#x27;s casting him in his hit Broadway comedy &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;.

In 1941, aged 30, Kaye scored a triumph playing Russell Paxton in &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;, starring Gertrude Lawrence. His show-stopping number was &quot;Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)&quot; by Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin in which he sang the names of a string of Russian composers at breakneck speed, seemingly without taking a breath. In the next Broadway season, he was the star of a show about a young man who is drafted called &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It!&quot;.

His feature-film debut was in producer Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s Technicolor 1944 comedy &quot;Up in Arms&quot;, a remake of Goldwyn&#x27;s Eddie Cantor comedy &quot;Whoopee!&quot; (1930). Rival producer Robert M. Savini cashed in by compiling three of Kaye&#x27;s Educational Pictures shorts into a patchwork feature entitled &quot;The Birth of a Star&quot; (1945). Studio mogul Goldwyn wanted Kaye&#x27;s prominent nose fixed to look less Jewish; Kaye refused, but he did allow his red hair to be bleached blond, apparently because it looked better in Technicolor.
Kaye starred in a radio program, &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;, on CBS from 1945 to 1946. The program&#x27;s popularity rose quickly. Within a year, he tied with Jimmy Durante for fifth place in the &quot;Radio Daily&quot; popularity poll. Kaye was asked to participate in a USO tour following the end of World War II. It meant that he would be absent from his radio show for nearly two months at the beginning of the season. Kaye&#x27;s friends filled in with a different guest host each week. Kaye was the first American actor to visit postwar Tokyo. He had toured there some ten years before with the vaudeville troupe. When Kaye asked to be released from his radio contract in mid-1946, he agreed not to accept a regular radio show for one year and only limited guest appearances on other radio programs. Many of the show&#x27;s episodes survive today, notable for Kaye&#x27;s opening signature patter (&quot;Git gat gittle, giddle-di-ap, giddle-de-tommy, riddle de biddle de roop, da-reep, fa-san, skeedle de woo-da, fiddle de wada, reep!&quot;).

Kaye starred in several movies with actress Virginia Mayo in the 1940s, and is known for films such as &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (1947), &quot;The Inspector General&quot; (1949), &quot;On the Riviera&quot; (1951) co-starring Gene Tierney, &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; (1954), &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954), &quot;The Court Jester&quot; (1956), &quot;Me and the Colonel&quot; (1958), and &quot;Merry Andrew&quot; (1958). Kaye starred in two pictures based on biographies, &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot; (1952) the Danish storyteller and &quot;The Five Pennies&quot; (1959) about jazz pioneer Red Nichols. His wife, writer/lyricist Sylvia Fine, wrote many tongue-twisting songs for which Kaye became famous. She was also an associate film producer. Some of Kaye&#x27;s films included the theme of doubles, two people who look identical (both Danny Kaye) being mistaken for each other to comic effect. While his wife wrote most of Kaye&#x27;s material, he created much of it himself, often while performing. Kaye had one character he never shared with the public; Kaplan, the owner of a rubber company, came to life only for family and friends. His wife, Sylvia, described the Kaplan character:

When he appeared at the London Palladium in 1948, he &quot;roused the Royal family to laughter and was the first of many performers who have turned British variety into an American preserve.&quot; &quot;Life&quot; described his reception as &quot;worshipful hysteria&quot; and noted that the royal family, for the first time, left the royal box to watch from the front row of the orchestra. He related that he had no idea of the familial connections when the Marquess of Milford Haven introduced himself after a show and said he would like his cousins to see Kaye perform. Kaye stated he never returned to the venue because no way existed to recreate the magic of that time. Kaye had an invitation to return to London for a &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; in November of the same year. When the invitation arrived, Kaye was busy with &quot;The Inspector General&quot; (which had a working title of &quot;Happy Times&quot;). Warner Bros. stopped the film to allow their star to attend. When his Decca labelmates The Andrews Sisters began their engagement at the London Palladium on the heels of Kaye&#x27;s successful 1948 appearance there, the trio was well received and David Lewin of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; declared: &quot;The audience gave the Andrews Sisters the Danny Kaye roar!&quot;

He hosted the 24th Academy Awards in 1952. The program was broadcast on radio; telecasts of the Oscar ceremony came later. During the 1950s, Kaye visited Australia, where he played Buttons in a production of &quot;Cinderella&quot; in Sydney. In 1953, Kaye started a production company, Dena Pictures, named for his daughter. &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; was the first film produced by his firm. The firm expanded into television in 1960 under the name Belmont Television.

Kaye entered television in 1956, on the CBS show &quot;See It Now&quot; with Edward R. Murrow. &quot;The Secret Life of Danny Kaye&quot; combined his 50,000-mile, ten-country tour as UNICEF ambassador with music and humor. His first solo effort was in 1960 with a one-hour special produced by Sylvia and sponsored by General Motors, with similar specials in 1961 and 1962.
He hosted &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot; from 1963 to 1967; it won four Emmy awards and a Peabody award. His last cinematic starring role came in 1963&#x27;s &quot;The Man from the Diners&#x27; Club&quot;.

Beginning in 1964, he acted as television host to the CBS telecasts of MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Kaye did a stint as a &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; mystery guest on the Sunday-night CBS-TV quiz program. Kaye was later a guest panelist on that show. He also appeared on the interview program &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;. In the 1970s, Kaye tore a ligament in his leg during the run of the Richard Rodgers musical &quot;Two by Two&quot;, but went on with the show, appearing with his leg in a cast and cavorting on stage in a wheelchair. He had done much the same on his television show in 1964, when his right leg and foot were burned from a cooking accident. Camera shots were planned so television viewers did not see Kaye in his wheelchair.

In 1976, he played Geppetto in a television musical adaptation of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; with Sandy Duncan in the title role. Kaye portrayed Captain Hook opposite Mia Farrow in a musical version of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; featuring songs by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. He later guest-starred in episodes of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, and in the 1980s revival &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

In many films, as well as on stage, Kaye proved to be an able actor, singer, dancer, and comedian. He showed his serious side as ambassador for UNICEF and in his dramatic role in the memorable TV film &quot;Skokie&quot;, when he played a Holocaust survivor. Before his death in 1987, Kaye conducted an orchestra during a comical series of concerts organized for UNICEF fundraising. Kaye received two Academy Awards - an Academy Honorary Award in 1955 and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1982. That year, he received the Screen Actors Guild annual award.

In 1980, Kaye hosted and sang in the 25th anniversary of Disneyland celebration and hosted the opening celebration for Epcot in 1982 (EPCOT Center at the time). Both were aired on primetime television in the U.S.

===Career in music===

While Kaye claimed he could not read music, he was said to have perfect pitch. A flamboyant performer with his own distinctive style, &quot;easily adapting from outrageous novelty songs to tender ballads&quot; (according to critic Jason Ankeny), in 1945, Kaye began hosting his own CBS radio program, in which he performed a number of hit songs, including &quot;Dinah&quot; and &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;.

In 1947, Kaye teamed up with The Andrews Sisters (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) on Decca Records, producing the number-three &quot;Billboard&quot; hit &quot;Civilization (Bongo, Bongo, Bongo)&quot;. The success of the pairing prompted both acts to record through 1950, producing such rhythmically comical fare as &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Song&quot; (based on the bird from the Walter Lantz cartoons and a &quot;Billboard&quot; hit for the quartet), &quot;Put &#x27;em in a Box, Tie &#x27;em with a Ribbon (And Throw &#x27;em in the Deep Blue Sea)&quot;, &quot;The Big Brass Band from Brazil&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Quiet Town (In Crossbone County)&quot;, &quot;Amelia Cordelia McHugh (Mc Who?)&quot;, &quot;Ching-a-ra-sa-sa&quot;, and a duet by Danny and Patty Andrews of &quot;Orange Colored Sky&quot;. The acts teamed for two yuletide favorites - a frantic, harmonic rendition of &quot;A Merry Christmas at Grandmother&#x27;s House (Over the River and Through the Woods)&quot; and a duet by Danny and Patty, &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth&quot;.

Kaye&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Columbia Presents Danny Kaye&quot;, had been released in 1942 by Columbia Records with songs performed to the accompaniment of Maurice Abravanel and Johnny Green. The album was reissued as a Columbia LP in 1949 and is described by the critic Bruce Eder as &quot;a bit tamer than some of the stuff that Kaye hit with later in the &#x27;40s and in the &#x27;50s, and for reasons best understood by the public, doesn&#x27;t attract nearly the interest of his kids&#x27; records and overt comedy routines&quot;.

In 1950, a Decca single, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts&quot;, was released, and became another chart hit for him. His second Columbia LP album &quot;Danny Kaye Entertains&quot; (1953, Columbia) included five songs recorded in 1941 from his Broadway musical &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;, most notably &quot;Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)&quot;.

Following the success of the film &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot; (1952), two of its songs written by Frank Loesser and sung by Kaye, &quot;Thumbelina&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Copenhagen&quot;, reached the charts; the former title became a minor US hit, and the latter reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. In 1953, Decca released &quot;Danny at the Palace&quot;, a live recording made at the New York Palace Theater, followed by &quot;Knock On Wood&quot; (Decca, 1954) a set of songs from the movie of the same name sung by Kaye, accompanied by Victor Young and His Singing Strings.

In 1956, Kaye signed a three-year recording contract with Capitol Records, which released his single &quot;Love Me Do&quot; in December of that year. The B-side, &quot;Ciu Ciu Bella&quot;, with lyrics written by Sylvia Fine, was inspired by an episode in Rome when Kaye, on a mission for UNICEF, befriended a 7-year-old child with polio in a children&#x27;s hospital, who sang this song for him in Italian.

In 1958, Saul Chaplin and Johnny Mercer wrote songs for &quot;Merry Andrew&quot;, a film starring Kaye as a British teacher attracted to the circus. The score added up to six numbers, all sung by Kaye; conductor Billy May&#x27;s 1950 composition &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus Band&quot; (renamed &quot;Music of the Big Top Circus Band&quot;) was deposited on the second side of the &quot;Merry Andrew&quot; soundtrack, released in 1958. A year later, another soundtrack came out, for &quot;The Five Pennies&quot; (in which Kaye starred as 1920s cornet player Red Nichols), featuring Louis Armstrong.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Kaye regularly conducted world-famous orchestras, although he had to learn the scores by ear. Kaye&#x27;s style, even if accompanied by unpredictable antics (he once traded the baton for a flyswatter to conduct &quot;The Flight of the Bumblebee&quot;) was praised by the likes of Zubin Mehta, who once stated that Kaye &quot;has a very efficient conducting style&quot;. His ability with an orchestra was mentioned by Dimitri Mitropoulos, then conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. After Kaye&#x27;s appearance, Mitropoulos remarked, &quot;Here is a man who is not musically trained, who cannot even read music and he gets more out of my orchestra than I have.&quot; Kaye was invited to conduct symphonies as charity fundraisers and was the conductor of the all-city marching band at the season opener of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1984. Over his career, he raised over US$5 million in support of musician pension funds.

===Imitations===
Kaye was sufficiently popular to inspire imitations:
* The 1946 Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Book Revue&quot; had a sequence with Daffy Duck wearing a blond wig and impersonating Kaye.
* Satirical songwriter Tom Lehrer&#x27;s 1953 song &quot;Lobachevsky&quot; was based on a number that Kaye had done, about the Russian director Constantin Stanislavski, with the affected Russian accent. Lehrer mentioned Kaye in an opening monologue, citing him as an &quot;idol since childbirth&quot;.
* Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster fashioned a short-lived superhero title, &quot;Funnyman&quot;, taking inspiration from Kaye&#x27;s persona.

==Other endeavors==

===Cooking===
In his later years, Kaye entertained at home as chef. He specialized in Chinese and Italian cooking. He had a custom-made Chinese restaurant installed at the rear of his house by its alley, then had a kitchen and dining area built around it. The stove that Kaye used for his Chinese dishes was fitted with metal rings for the burners to allow the heat to be highly concentrated, and a trough with circulating ice water cooled the area to keep the intense heat tolerable for those who were cooking. He learned &quot;at Johnny Kan&#x27;s restaurant in San Francisco and with Cecilia Chang at her Mandarin restaurants in San Francisco and Los Angeles&quot;. He taught Chinese cooking classes at a San Francisco Chinese restaurant in the 1970s. The theatre and demonstration kitchen under the library at the Hyde Park, New York, campus of the Culinary Institute of America is named for him.

Kaye referred to his kitchen as &quot;Ying&#x27;s Thing&quot;. While filming &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; in France, he phoned home to ask his family if they would like to eat at Ying&#x27;s Thing that evening; Kaye flew home for dinner. Not all of his efforts in the kitchen went well. After flying to San Francisco for a recipe for sourdough bread, he came home and spent hours preparing loaves. When his daughter asked about the bread, Kaye hit the bread on the kitchen table; his bread was hard enough to chip it. Kaye approached kitchen work with enthusiasm, making sausages and other foods needed for his cuisine. Though it is often claimed that he was a Meilleur Ouvrier de France (MOF), this is not true, as the MOF is restricted to French professionals. Rather, he had cooked for several famous French chefs at his house (all of them MOFs), and they signed an &quot;honorary&quot; Meilleur Ouvrier de France diploma for him.

===Flying===
Kaye became an aviation enthusiast and pilot. His interest was sparked by his longtime friend, choreographer Michael Kidd, who at the time had recently earned his private pilot&#x27;s license. Kaye was an enthusiastic and accomplished golfer, but reduced golf activities in favor of flying and started training for his license in 1959.
 The first plane Kaye owned was a Piper Aztec. After this, he became qualified for many types of aircraft, from single-engined light aircraft to multiengine jets.

Kaye received a type rating in a Learjet, and he was named vice president of the Learjet Company by Bill Lear as an honorary title (he had no line responsibility at the company). He supported many flying projects. In 1968, he was honorary chairman of the Las Vegas International Exposition of Flight, a show that used many facets of the city&#x27;s entertainment industry while presenting an air show. The operational show chairman was well-known aviation figure Lynn Garrison. Kaye flew a Learjet to 65 cities in five days on a mission to help UNICEF.

===Business ventures===
In 1958, Kaye and partner Lester Smith formed Kaye–Smith Enterprises. The company owned a chain of radio stations, mostly in the Pacific Northwest. Other Kaye–Smith divisions included a concert-promotion company, a video-production company, and a recording studio. 

===Baseball===
A lifelong Dodgers fan, Kaye recorded a song called &quot;D-O-D-G-E-R-S (Oh, Really? No, O&#x27;Malley!)&quot;, describing a fictitious encounter with the San Francisco Giants, a hit during the real-life pennant chase of 1962. That song is included on &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; compact discs. A good friend of Leo Durocher&#x27;s, he often traveled with the team. He also possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of the game and was an accomplished second baseman.

Kaye and his business partner Lester Smith also led an investment group, which was awarded the American League&#x27;s 13th franchise, which became the Seattle Mariners for US$6.2 million on February 7, 1976. The ownership percentages of Kaye, Smith, and two other remaining original investors were reduced to 5% each when George Argyros purchased 80% of the Mariners for $10.4 million on January 30, 1981. Kaye sold all of his business interests to Smith&#x27;s family in 1985.

===Medicine===
Kaye was an honorary member of the American College of Surgeons and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

===Charity===

Working alongside UNICEF&#x27;s Halloween fundraiser founder, Ward Simon Kimball Jr., the actor educated the public on impoverished children in deplorable living conditions overseas, and assisted in the distribution of donated goods and funds. His involvement with UNICEF came about in an unusual way. Kaye was flying home from London in 1949 when one of the plane&#x27;s four engines lost its propeller and caught fire. The problem was initially thought serious enough that it might make an ocean landing; life jackets and life rafts were made ready. The plane was able to head back over 500 miles (804.67 km) to land at Shannon Airport, Ireland. On the way back to Shannon, the head of the Children&#x27;s Fund, Maurice Pate, had the seat next to Danny Kaye and spoke at length about the need for recognition for the fund. Their discussion continued on the flight from Shannon to New York; it was the beginning of the actor&#x27;s long association with UNICEF.

&quot;For all of his success as a performer (...) his greatest legacy remains his tireless humanitarian work—so close were his ties to the United Nations International Children&#x27;s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) that when the organization received the Nobel Peace Prize, Kaye was tapped to accept it&quot;, according to music critic Jason Ankeny.

==Personal life==
Kaye and Sylvia Fine grew up in Brooklyn, living a few blocks apart, but they did not meet until they were working on an off-Broadway show in 1939. Sylvia was an audition pianist.

Sylvia discovered that Danny had worked for her father Samuel Fine, a dentist. Kaye, working in Florida, proposed on the telephone; they were married in Fort Lauderdale on January 3, 1940. They were married for life, except for a separation in 1947 and 1948, when Kaye was involved with Eve Arden.

The couple&#x27;s only child, daughter Dena, was born on December 17, 1946. When she was very young, Dena did not like seeing her father perform because she did not understand that people were supposed to laugh at what he did. Kaye said in a 1954 interview, &quot;Whatever she wants to be she will be without interference from her mother nor from me.&quot; Dena grew up to become a journalist.

Donald Spoto, the author of &quot;Laurence Olivier&quot; (HarperCollins), made an unsubstantiated claim that Kaye had a 10-year secret affair with Laurence Olivier. Despite media rumor since that book&#x27;s publication, no evidence has been published. English journalist Terry Coleman, who spent four years studying Olivier&#x27;s archive of letters and memorabilia, could not find evidence of such an affair between Kaye and Olivier. Coleman observed, &quot;I did check it and talked to a number of people. In this mountain of material in the archives, I could not find a hint of an affair with Danny Kaye.&quot;

On January 18, 2013, during a 24-hour salute to Kaye on Turner Classic Movies in celebration of what TCM thought was his 100th birthday, Kaye&#x27;s daughter Dena revealed to TCM host Ben Mankiewicz that Kaye&#x27;s stated birth year of 1913 was incorrect, and that he was actually born in 1911.

A lifelong Democrat, he supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election. Kaye was the godfather of actress Mary Louise Weller.

===Health and death===
In 1983, Kaye had quadruple bypass heart surgery and contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion. He died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the early morning hours of March 3, 1987, aged 76, from complications of heart failure, internal bleeding, and hepatitis C.

==Legacy==
Kaye&#x27;s body was cremated and his ashes were interred in the foundation of a bench in Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. His grave is adorned with a bench that contains friezes of a baseball and bat, an aircraft, a piano, a flowerpot, musical notes, and a chef&#x27;s toque. His name and birth and death dates are inscribed on the toque. The United Nations held a memorial tribute to him at its New York headquarters on the evening of October 21, 1987.

The Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College in New York was opened in 1988, with a $1 million gift from Sylvia Kaye.

David Koenig reflects, &quot;His legacy has dimmed with the passage of time. His greatest works (...) endure today only as memories in the minds of aging members of his audiences (...) much of his TV work has not aged particularly well. Whimsy was of another time.&quot; However, Koenig sees Kaye&#x27;s film work in a different light, &quot;History has smiled on individual pictures — in particular the holiday staple of &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Court Jester&quot;... the medieval romp has steadily gained a reputation as one of the greatest comedies of all time.&quot;

<text>Daniel S. DeCarlo (December 12, 1919 – December 18, 2001) was an American cartoonist best known for having developed the look of Archie Comics in the late 1950s and early 1960s, modernizing the characters to their contemporary appearance and establishing the publisher&#x27;s house style up until his death. As well, he is the generally recognized co-creator of the characters Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Josie and the Pussycats (the title character of which was named for his wife), and Cheryl Blossom.

==Early life and career==
Dan DeCarlo was born in New Rochelle, New York, the son of a gardener. He attended New Rochelle High School, followed by Manhattan&#x27;s Art Students League from 1938 to 1941, when he was drafted into the U.S. Army. Stationed in Great Britain, he worked in the motor pool and as a draftsman, and painted company mascots on the noses of airplanes. He also drew a weekly military comic strip, &quot;418th Scandal Sheet&quot;. He met his wife, French citizen Josie Dumont, on a blind date in Belgium not long after the Battle of the Bulge.

==Atlas and Archie==

DeCarlo was married, with a pregnant wife, and working as a laborer for his father when he began to pursue a professional art career. Circa 1947, answering an ad, he broke into the comic book industry at Timely Comics, the 1940s iteration of Marvel Comics. Under editor-in-chief Stan Lee, his first assignment was the teen-humor series &quot;Jeanie&quot;. DeCarlo went uncredited, as was typical for most comic-book writers and artists of the era, and he recalled in 2001, &quot;I went on with her maybe ten books. They used to call me &#x27;The Jeanie Machine&#x27; because that was all Stan used to give me, was &quot;Jeanie&quot;... Then he took me off &quot;Jeanie&quot; and he gave me &quot;Millie the Model&quot;. That was a big break for me. It wasn&#x27;t doing too well and somehow when I got on it became quite successful.&quot;

He went on to an atypically long, 10-year run on that humor series, from issues #18–93 (June 1949 – Nov. 1959), most of them published by Marvel&#x27;s 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics. DeCarlo and Lee also took over the &quot;My Friend Irma&quot; comic strip, spun off from the hit Marie Wilson radio comedy. For a decade, DeCarlo wrote and drew the slapsticky adventures of Millie Collins, her redheaded friendly nemesis Chili Storm and the rest of the cast. He also contributed the short-lived &quot;Sherry the Showgirl&quot; and &quot;Showgirls&quot; for Atlas. In 1960, he and Atlas editor-in-chief Stan Lee co-created the short-lived syndicated comic strip &quot;Willie Lumpkin&quot;, about a suburban mail carrier, for the Chicago-based Publishers Syndicate. A version of the character later appeared as a long-running minor supporting character in Lee&#x27;s later co-creation, the Marvel Comics series &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;.

As well during this period, DeCarlo created and drew Standard Comics&#x27; futuristic teen-humor comic book &quot;Jetta of the 21st Century&quot;. Running three issues, #5–7 (Dec. 1952 - April 1953), it featured red-haired Jetta Raye and her friends at Neutron High School.

In addition to his comic-book work, DeCarlo drew freelance pieces for the magazines &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Argosy&quot;, as well as Timely/Atlas publisher Martin Goodman&#x27;s Humorama line of pin-up girl cartoon digests.

DeCarlo first freelanced for Archie Comics, the company with which he became most closely associated, in the late 1950s while still freelancing for Atlas. He said in 2001,
DeCarlo is tentatively identified with Archie as early as the Jughead story &quot;The Big Shot&quot; in &quot;Archie Comics&quot; #48 (Feb. 1951), with his earliest confirmed credit the 3 3/4-page story &quot;No Picnic&quot; in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Girls Betty and Veronica&quot; #4 (published in September 1951). His art soon established the publisher&#x27;s house style. As well, he is the generally recognized creator of the teen-humor characters Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Josie and the Pussycats, and Cheryl Blossom.

===Josie===
DeCarlo created Josie on his own in the late 1950s; his wife, named Josie, said in an interview quoted in a DeCarlo obituary, &quot;We went on a Caribbean cruise, and I had a [cat] costume for the cruise, and that&#x27;s the way it started.&quot; DeCarlo first tried to sell the character as a syndicated comic strip called &quot;Here&#x27;s Josie&quot;, recalling in 2001:
Josie was introduced in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Pals &#x27;n&#x27; Gals&quot; #23. The first issue of &quot;She&#x27;s Josie&quot; followed, cover-dated February 1963. The series featured levelheaded, sweet-natured Josie, her blonde bombshell friend Melody, and bookwormish brunette Pepper. These early years also featured the characters of Josie and Pepper&#x27;s boyfriends Albert and Sock (real name Socrates); Albert&#x27;s rival Alexander Cabot III; and Alex&#x27;s twin sister Alexandra. Occasionally Josie and her friends appeared in &quot;crossover&quot; issues with the main Archie characters. &quot;She&#x27;s Josie&quot; was renamed &quot;Josie&quot; with issue #17 (Dec. 1965), and again renamed, to &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, with issue #45 (Dec. 1969), whereby Pepper was replaced by Valerie and Albert was replaced by Alan M. Under this title, the series finished its run with issue #106 (Oct. 1982). Josie and her gang also made irregular appearances in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; and &quot;Laugh Comics&quot; during the 1960s.

When Universal Pictures was preparing the live-action movie adaptation &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; in 2001, DeCarlo and Archie Comics became involved in a lawsuit over the character&#x27;s creation, leading the publisher to terminate its 43-year relationship with him. A federal district court ruled in 2001 that Archie Comics owned the copyright to the Josie characters; this decision was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On December 11, 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal filed by DeCarlo&#x27;s attorney, Whitney Seymour Jr., who had argued that the issue was a matter of state property law and not federal copyright law.

DeCarlo was listed as a creator in the end credits of the film &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;. He received credit as co-creator of the live-action television show &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;.

Among DeCarlo&#x27;s final works were a story for Paul Dini&#x27;s independent comics series &quot;Jingle Belle&quot;, and stories for Bongo Comics&#x27; &quot;The Simpsons&quot; TV tie-in comic, &quot;Bart Simpson&quot;.

===Death===
DeCarlo died in New Rochelle, New York, of pneumonia. Comics creator Paul Dini said upon DeCarlo&#x27;s death, &quot;It was tragic that when he was at an age when many cartoonists are revered as treasures by more beneficent publishers, Dan felt spurned and slighted by the owners of properties that prospered greatly from his contributions.&quot;

==Personal life==
His twin sons, Dan Jr. and James &quot;Jim&quot; DeCarlo (born January 27, 1948) were also prolific Archie artists, penciling and inking respectively. The two predeceased their father. Dan Jr. died in October 1990 of stomach cancer, and James died in August 1991 from complications from a stroke. Josie DeCarlo, the inspiration for the Archie character Josie, died in her sleep on March 14, 2012.

==Josie DeCarlo==
Josette Marie &quot;Josie&quot; DeCarlo (née Dumont; September 8, 1923 – March 14, 2012) was a French-born model who became the inspiration and namesake for Josie McCoy of &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; comics and the 1970 Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon series.

She met future husband Dan DeCarlo on a blind date in Belgium in 1945, Shortly after the Battle of the Bulge. At the time, Dumont did not speak English, while DeCarlo, a member of the U.S. Army during World War II, spoke very little French.

Unable to have a conversation due to their language barrier, the two communicated through his cartoons. She later explained, &quot;We communicated with drawing... He would draw things for me to make me understand what he had in mind. He was really so amusing. Instead of just using words, he would use cartoons to express himself. Right away, we knew that we were meant for each other.&quot; The couple married in 1946.

She became the inspiration for &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; while the couple were on a cruise. Josie DeCarlo wore a catsuit costume during the cruise, which became the basis for the fictional &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; trademark outfits.

Later, when she got a new hairdo, Dan DeCarlo incorporated it into the Josie character as well, &quot;The hairdo came after... One day, I came in with a new hairdo with a little bow in my hair, and he said, &#x27;That&#x27;s it!&#x27;&quot; Dan DeCarlo drew his wife with the cat costume as Josie McCoy and naming the starring character Josie. Josie first appeared in Archie Comics in 1962. The character was voiced by actress Janet Waldo in the television series.

After her husband&#x27;s death in 2001, Josie DeCarlo remained active in the comics and animation industries, promoting his work.

Josie DeCarlo died in her sleep on March 14, 2012, aged 88. Her funeral was held in Scarsdale, New York.

==Awards==
DeCarlo won the National Cartoonists Society Award for Best Comic Book in 2000 for &quot;Betty &amp; Veronica&quot;. He was nominated for the Academy of Comic Book Arts&#x27; Shazam Award for Best Penciller (Humor Division) in 1974.

==Legacy==
&quot;Love and Rockets&quot; co-creators Jaime Hernandez and Gilbert Hernandez cite DeCarlo as an artistic influence.

Artist/animator Bruce Timm, best known for his contributions to the DC Animated Universe, has cited Dan DeCarlo as one of his influences.
