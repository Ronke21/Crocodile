<text>Charles John Huffam Dickens (; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English novelist, journalist, short story writer and social critic. He created some of literature&#x27;s best-known fictional characters, and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and, by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are widely read today.

Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school at age 12 to work in a boot-blacking factory when his father John was incarcerated in a debtors&#x27; prison. After three years, he returned to school before beginning his literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years; wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and nonfiction articles; lectured and performed readings extensively; was a tireless letter writer; and campaigned vigorously for children&#x27;s rights, education and other social reforms.

Dickens&#x27;s literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, a publishing phenomenon—thanks largely to the introduction of the character Sam Weller in the fourth episode—that sparked &quot;Pickwick&quot; merchandise and spin-offs. Within a few years, Dickens had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most of them published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense. The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience&#x27;s reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. For example, when his wife&#x27;s chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; seemed to reflect her own disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features. His plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives. Masses of the illiterate poor would individually pay a halfpenny to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.

His 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every creative medium. &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1853 novel &quot;Bleak House&quot;, a satire on the judicial system, helped support a reformist movement that culminated in the 1870s legal reform in England. &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (set in London and Paris) is regarded as his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career. The term &quot;Dickensian&quot; is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.

==Early life==

Charles Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), Landport in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), Hampshire, the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (née Barrow; 1789–1863) and John Dickens (1785–1851). His father was a clerk in the Royal Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam, rigger in the Royal Navy and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848).

In January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, Fitzrovia. When Charles was four, they relocated to Sheerness and thence to Chatham, Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a &quot;very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy&quot;.

Charles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding, as well as &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and &quot;Gil Blas&quot;. He read and re-read &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot; and the Collected Farces of Elizabeth Inchbald. Aged seven, he first saw Joseph Grimaldi—the father of modern clowning—perform at the Star Theatre in Rochester, Kent. He later imitated Grimaldi&#x27;s clowning on several occasions, and would also edit the &quot;Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi&quot;. He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing. His father&#x27;s brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a dame school and then at a school run by William Giles, a dissenter, in Chatham.
This period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at Somerset House and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term at school) moved to Camden Town in London. The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts and, living beyond his means, John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the Marshalsea debtors&#x27; prison in Southwark, London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town. Mrs Roylance was &quot;a reduced impoverished old lady, long known to our family&quot;, whom Dickens later immortalised, &quot;with a few alterations and embellishments&quot;, as &quot;Mrs Pipchin&quot; in &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;. Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the Insolvent Court, Archibald Russell, &quot;a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman ... with a quiet old wife&quot; and lame son, in Lant Street in Southwark. They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;.

On Sundays—with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the Royal Academy of Music—he spent the day at the Marshalsea. Dickens later used the prison as a setting in &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren&#x27;s Blacking Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present Charing Cross railway station, where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered &quot;how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age&quot;. As he recalled to John Forster (from &quot;Life of Charles Dickens&quot;):

When the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of Covent Garden, the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street. Small audiences gathered and watched them at work—in Dickens&#x27;s biographer Simon Callow&#x27;s estimation, the public display was &quot;a new refinement added to his misery&quot;.
A few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him £450. On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was released from prison. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act, Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left the Marshalsea, for the home of Mrs Roylance.

Charles&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens&#x27;s view that a father should rule the family and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: &quot;I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back.&quot; His mother&#x27;s failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.

Righteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which working-class people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most autobiographical, novel, &quot;David Copperfield&quot;: &quot;I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!&quot;

Dickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in Camden Town, where he remained until March 1827, having spent about two years there. He did not consider it to be a good school: &quot;Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster&#x27;s sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr Creakle&#x27;s Establishment in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;.&quot;

Dickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, Gray&#x27;s Inn, as a junior clerk from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers and clerks. Captivated with London&#x27;s theatre scene, he went to theatres obsessively: he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every day. His favourite actor was Charles Mathews and Dickens learnt his &quot;monopolylogues&quot; (farces in which Mathews played every character) by heart. Then, having learned Gurney&#x27;s system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at Doctors&#x27; Commons and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years.

In 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the model for the character Dora in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. Maria&#x27;s parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.

== Career ==

===Journalism and writing===

In 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident. He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre—he became an early member of the Garrick Club—he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.

In 1833, Dickens submitted his first story, &quot;A Dinner at Poplar Walk&quot;, to the London periodical &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot;. His uncle William Barrow offered him a job on &quot;The Mirror of Parliament&quot; and he worked in the House of Commons for the first time early in 1832. He rented rooms at Furnival&#x27;s Inn and worked as a political journalist, reporting on Parliamentary debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;.
His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces, published in 1836: &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot;—Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years. Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname &#x27;Moses&#x27;, which he had given to his youngest brother Augustus Dickens, after a character in Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;. When pronounced by anyone with a head cold, &quot;Moses&quot; became &quot;Boses&quot;—later shortened to &quot;Boz&quot;. Dickens&#x27;s own name was considered &quot;queer&quot; by a contemporary critic, who wrote in 1849: &quot;Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer name, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations.&quot; Dickens contributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career. In January 1835, the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; launched an evening edition, under the editorship of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s music critic, George Hogarth. Hogarth invited him to contribute &quot;Street Sketches&quot; and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house—excited by Hogarth&#x27;s friendship with Walter Scott (whom Dickens greatly admired) and enjoying the company of Hogarth&#x27;s three daughters: Georgina, Mary and 19-year-old Catherine.

Dickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially. He began a friendship with William Harrison Ainsworth, the author of the highwayman novel &quot;Rookwood&quot; (1834), whose bachelor salon in Harrow Road had become the meeting place for a set that included Daniel Maclise, Benjamin Disraeli, Edward Bulwer-Lytton and George Cruikshank. All these became his friends and collaborators, with the exception of Disraeli, and he met his first publisher, John Macrone, at the house. The success of &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; led to a proposal from publishers Chapman and Hall for Dickens to supply text to match Robert Seymour&#x27;s engraved illustrations in a monthly letterpress. Seymour committed suicide after the second instalment and Dickens, who wanted to write a connected series of sketches, hired &quot;Phiz&quot; to provide the engravings (which were reduced from four to two per instalment) for the story. The resulting story became &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; and, although the first few episodes were not successful, the introduction of the Cockney character Sam Weller in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by Phiz) marked a sharp climb in its popularity. The final instalment sold 40,000 copies. On the impact of the character, &quot;The Paris Review&quot; stated, &quot;arguably the most historic bump in English publishing is the Sam Weller Bump.&quot; A publishing phenomenon, John Sutherland, Professor of Modern English Literature at University College London, called &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; &quot;[t]he most important single novel of the Victorian era&quot;. The unprecedented success led to numerous spin-offs and merchandise including &quot;Pickwick&quot; cigars, playing cards, china figurines, Sam Weller puzzles, Weller boot polish and joke books.


On its impact on mass culture, Nicholas Dames in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; writes, Literature&#x27; is not a big enough category for &quot;Pickwick&quot;. It defined its own, a new one that we have learned to call &#x27;entertainment&#x27;.&quot; In November 1836, Dickens accepted the position of editor of &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, a position he held for three years, until he fell out with the owner. In 1836, as he finished the last instalments of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, he began writing the beginning instalments of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;—writing as many as 90 pages a month—while continuing work on &quot;Bentley&#x27;s&quot; and also writing four plays, the production of which he oversaw. &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, published in 1838, became one of Dickens&#x27;s better known stories and was the first Victorian novel with a child protagonist.

On 2 April 1836, after a one-year engagement, and between episodes two and three of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, Dickens married Catherine Thomson Hogarth (1815–1879), the daughter of George Hogarth, editor of the &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot;. They were married in St Luke&#x27;s Church, Chelsea, London. After a brief honeymoon in Chalk in Kent, the couple returned to lodgings at Furnival&#x27;s Inn. The first of their ten children, Charles, was born in January 1837 and a few months later the family set up home in Bloomsbury at 48 Doughty Street, London (on which Charles had a three-year lease at £80 a year) from 25 March 1837 until December 1839. Dickens&#x27;s younger brother Frederick and Catherine&#x27;s 17-year-old sister Mary Hogarth moved in with them. Dickens became very attached to Mary, and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837. Unusually for Dickens, as a consequence of his shock, he stopped working, and he and Catherine stayed at a little farm on Hampstead Heath for a fortnight. Dickens idealised Mary; the character he fashioned after her, Rose Maylie, he found he could not now kill, as he had planned, in his fiction, and, according to Ackroyd, he drew on memories of her for his later descriptions of Little Nell and Florence Dombey. His grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for the June instalment of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; and had to cancel the &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; instalment that month as well. The time in Hampstead was the occasion for a growing bond between Dickens and John Forster to develop; Forster soon became his unofficial business manager and the first to read his work.

His success as a novelist continued. The young Queen Victoria read both &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, staying up until midnight to discuss them. &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1838–39), &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; (1840–41) and, finally, his first historical novel, &quot;Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of &#x27;Eighty&quot;, as part of the &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot; series (1840–41), were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books. Dickens biographer Peter Ackroyd has called &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; &quot;one of Dickens&#x27;s most neglected, but most rewarding, novels&quot;. The poet Edgar Allan Poe read &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;, and the talking raven that featured in the novel inspired in part Poe&#x27;s 1845 poem &quot;The Raven&quot;.

In the midst of all his activity during this period, there was discontent with his publishers and John Macrone was bought off, while Richard Bentley signed over all his rights in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Other signs of a certain restlessness and discontent emerged; in Broadstairs he flirted with Eleanor Picken, the young fiancée of his solicitor&#x27;s best friend and one night grabbed her and ran with her down to the sea. He declared they were both to drown there in the &quot;sad sea waves&quot;. She finally got free, and afterwards kept her distance. In June 1841, he precipitously set out on a two-month tour of Scotland and then, in September 1841, telegraphed Forster that he had decided to go to America. His weekly periodical &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot; ended, though Dickens was still keen on the idea of the weekly magazine, an appreciation that had begun with his childhood reading of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Idler&quot; and the 18th-century magazines &quot;Tatler&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

Dickens was perturbed by the return to power of the Tories, whom he described as &quot;people whom, politically, I despise and abhor.&quot; He had been tempted to stand for the Liberals in Reading, but decided against it due to financial straits. He wrote three anti-Tory verse satires (&quot;The Fine Old English Gentleman&quot;, &quot;The Quack Doctor&#x27;s Proclamation&quot;, and &quot;Subjects for Painters&quot;) which were published in &quot;The Examiner&quot;.
===First visit to the United States===
On 22 January 1842, Dickens and his wife arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, aboard the RMS &quot;Britannia&quot; during their first trip to the United States and Canada. At this time Georgina Hogarth, another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now living at Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone to care for the young family they had left behind. She remained with them as housekeeper, organiser, adviser and friend until Dickens&#x27;s death in 1870. Dickens modelled the character of Agnes Wickfield after Georgina and Mary.
He described his impressions in a travelogue, &quot;American Notes for General Circulation&quot;. In &quot;Notes&quot;, Dickens includes a powerful condemnation of slavery which he had attacked as early as &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, correlating the emancipation of the poor in England with the abolition of slavery abroad citing newspaper accounts of runaway slaves disfigured by their masters. In spite of the abolitionist sentiments gleaned from his trip to America, some modern commentators have pointed out inconsistencies in Dickens&#x27;s views on racial inequality. For instance, he has been criticised for his subsequent acquiescence in Governor Eyre&#x27;s harsh crackdown during the 1860s Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica and his failure to join other British progressives in condemning it. From Richmond, Virginia, Dickens returned to Washington, D.C., and started a trek westward, with brief pauses in Cincinnati and Louisville, to St. Louis, Missouri. While there, he expressed a desire to see an American prairie before returning east. A group of 13 men then set out with Dickens to visit Looking Glass Prairie, a trip 30 miles into Illinois.

During his American visit, Dickens spent a month in New York City, giving lectures, raising the question of international copyright laws and the pirating of his work in America. He persuaded a group of 25 writers, headed by Washington Irving, to sign a petition for him to take to Congress, but the press were generally hostile to this, saying that he should be grateful for his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated.

The popularity he gained caused a shift in his self-perception according to critic Kate Flint, who writes that he &quot;found himself a cultural commodity, and its circulation had passed out his control&quot;, causing him to become interested in and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next novels. She writes that he assumed a role of &quot;influential commentator&quot;, publicly and in his fiction, evident in his next few books. His trip to the US ended with a trip to Canada—Niagara Falls, Toronto, Kingston and Montreal—where he appeared on stage in light comedies.

=== Return to England ===
Soon after his return to England, Dickens began work on the first of his Christmas stories, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, written in 1843, which was followed by &quot;The Chimes&quot; in 1844 and &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; in 1845. Of these, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America. The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens&#x27;s mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School, caused Dickens to resolve to &quot;strike a sledge hammer blow&quot; for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he &quot;wept and laughed, and wept again&quot; as he &quot;walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed&quot;.

Between 1843 and 1844, &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, the last of his picaresque novels, was serialised. It includes the character of Sarah Gamp, a nurse who is dissolute, sloppy and generally drunk, and also features one of the first literary private detective characters, Mr Nadgett. After living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846), where he began work on &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1846–48).

At about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, Augustus, worked (John Chapman &amp; Co). It had been carried out by Thomas Powell, a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called &quot;The Living Authors of England&quot; with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (&quot;Dombey and Son&quot;) on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman &amp; Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to Lewis Gaylord Clark, editor of the New York literary magazine &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot;, saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman &amp; Co to seek written confirmation of Powell&#x27;s guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell&#x27;s embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.

====Philanthropy====
Angela Burdett Coutts, heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women of the working class. Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores. After initially resisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named Urania Cottage, in the Lime Grove area of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, which he managed for ten years, setting the house rules, reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents. Emigration and marriage were central to Dickens&#x27;s agenda for the women on leaving Urania Cottage, from which it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859.

====Religious views====

As a young man, Dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organised religion. In 1836, in a pamphlet titled &quot;Sunday Under Three Heads&quot;, he defended the people&#x27;s right to pleasure, opposing a plan to prohibit games on Sundays. &quot;Look into your churches—diminished congregations and scanty attendance. People have grown sullen and obstinate, and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this, once in every seven. They display their feeling by staying away [from church]. Turn into the streets [on a Sunday] and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around.&quot;
Dickens honoured the figure of Jesus Christ. He is regarded as a professing Christian. His son, Henry Fielding Dickens, described him as someone who &quot;possessed deep religious convictions&quot;. In the early 1840s, he had shown an interest in Unitarian Christianity and Robert Browning remarked that &quot;Mr Dickens is an enlightened Unitarian.&quot; Professor Gary Colledge has written that he &quot;never strayed from his attachment to popular lay Anglicanism&quot;. Dickens authored a work called &quot;The Life of Our Lord&quot; (1846), a book about the life of Christ, written with the purpose of sharing his faith with his children and family. In a scene from &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, Dickens echoed Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s use of Luke 23:34 from &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; (Dickens held a copy in his library), with G. K. Chesterton writing, &quot;among the great canonical English authors, Chaucer and Dickens have the most in common.&quot;

Dickens disapproved of Roman Catholicism and 19th-century evangelicalism, seeing both as extremes of Christianity and likely to limit personal expression, and was critical of what he saw as the hypocrisy of religious institutions and philosophies like spiritualism, all of which he considered deviations from the true spirit of Christianity, as shown in the book he wrote for his family in 1846. While Dickens advocated equal rights for Catholics in England, he strongly disliked how individual civil liberties were often threatened in countries where Catholicism predominated and referred to the Catholic Church as &quot;that curse upon the world.&quot; Dickens also rejected the Evangelical conviction that the Bible was the infallible word of God. His ideas on Biblical interpretation were similar to the Liberal Anglican Arthur Penrhyn Stanley&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;progressive revelation&quot;. Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky referred to Dickens as &quot;that great Christian writer&quot;.

==Middle years==

In December 1845, Dickens took up the editorship of the London-based &quot;Daily News&quot;, a liberal paper through which Dickens hoped to advocate, in his own words, &quot;the Principles of Progress and Improvement, of Education and Civil and Religious Liberty and Equal Legislation.&quot; Among the other contributors Dickens chose to write for the paper were the radical economist Thomas Hodgskin and the social reformer Douglas William Jerrold, who frequently attacked the Corn Laws. Dickens lasted only ten weeks on the job before resigning due to a combination of exhaustion and frustration with one of the paper&#x27;s co-owners.

A Francophile, Dickens often holidayed in France and, in a speech delivered in Paris in 1846 in French, called the French &quot;the first people in the universe&quot;. During his visit to Paris, Dickens met the French literati Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Eugène Scribe, Théophile Gautier, François-René de Chateaubriand and Eugène Sue. In early 1849, Dickens started to write &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. It was published between 1849 and 1850. In Dickens&#x27;s biography, &quot;Life of Charles Dickens&quot; (1872), John Forster wrote of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, &quot;underneath the fiction lay something of the author&#x27;s life&quot;. It was Dickens&#x27;s personal favourite among his novels, as he wrote in the preface to the 1867 edition. His collection of letters, of which more than 14,000 are known, covered a wide range of subject-matter. Letters during this period included a correspondence with Mary Tyler, dated 6 November 1849, on the comedic merits of Punch and Judy, a puppet show dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch, and his review of the Great Exhibition, the first in a series of world&#x27;s fairs, which he attended at Hyde Park, London in 1851.
In November 1851, Dickens moved into Tavistock House where he wrote &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1852–53), &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854) and &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1855–57). A work of Gothic fiction depicting London as a murky city swathed in fog, &quot;Bleak House&quot; is credited with introducing urban fog to the novel, which would become a frequent characteristic of urban Gothic literature and film. Reflecting the public enthusiasm for dinosaurs that first developed in Victorian England, the opening of &quot;Bleak House&quot; contains an early mention of dinosaurs in literature: &quot;it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill&quot;.

While at Tavistock Dickens indulged in amateur theatricals, and he worked closely with the novelist and playwright Wilkie Collins. In 1856, his income from writing allowed him to buy Gads Hill Place in Higham, Kent. As a child, Dickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it. The area was also the scene of some of the events of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and this literary connection pleased him.

During this time Dickens was also the publisher, editor and a major contributor to the journals &quot;Household Words&quot; (1850–1859) and &quot;All the Year Round&quot; (1858–1870), with both titles deriving from a Shakespearean quotation. The journals contained a mix of fiction and non-fiction, and dealt with aspects in the culture. For example, the latter included Dickens&#x27; assessment of Madame Tussauds, a wax museum established in Baker Street in 1835, which he called &quot;something more than an exhibition, it is an institution.&quot; In 1854, at the behest of Sir John Franklin&#x27;s widow Lady Jane, Dickens viciously attacked Arctic explorer John Rae in &quot;Household Words&quot; for his report to the Admiralty, based on interviews with local Inuit, that the members of Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition had resorted to cannibalism. These attacks would later be expanded on his 1856 play &quot;The Frozen Deep&quot;, which satirises Rae and the Inuit. Twentieth-century archaeology work in King William Island later confirmed that the members of the Franklin expedition resorted to cannibalism.
In 1855, when Dickens&#x27;s good friend and Liberal MP Austen Henry Layard formed an Administrative Reform Association to demand significant reforms of Parliament, Dickens joined and volunteered his resources in support of Layard&#x27;s cause. With the exception of Lord John Russell, who was the only leading politician in whom Dickens had any faith and to whom he later dedicated &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, Dickens believed that the political aristocracy and their incompetence were the death of England. When he and Layard were accused of fomenting class conflict, Dickens replied that the classes were already in opposition and the fault was with the aristocratic class. Dickens used his pulpit in &quot;Household Words&quot; to champion the Reform Association. He also commented on foreign affairs, declaring his support for Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini, helping raise funds for their campaigns and stating that &quot;a united Italy would be of vast importance to the peace of the world, and would be a rock in Louis Napoleon&#x27;s way,&quot; and that &quot;I feel for Italy almost as if I were an Italian born.&quot; Dickens also published dozens of writings in &quot;Household Words&quot; supporting vaccination, including multiple laudations for vaccine pioneer Edward Jenner.

Following the Indian Mutiny of 1857, Dickens joined in the widespread criticism of the East India Company for its role in the event, but reserved his fury for Indians, wishing that he was the commander-in-chief in India so that he would be able to &quot;do my utmost to exterminate the Race upon whom the stain of the late cruelties rested.&quot;

In 1857, Dickens hired professional actresses for &quot;The Frozen Deep&quot;, which he and his protégé Wilkie Collins had written. Dickens fell in love with one of the actresses, Ellen Ternan, and this passion was to last the rest of his life. In 1858, when Dickens was 45 and Ternan 18, divorce would have been scandalous for someone of his fame. After publicly accusing Catherine of not loving their children and suffering from &quot;a mental disorder&quot;—statements that disgusted his contemporaries, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning—Dickens attempted to have Catherine institutionalised. When his scheme failed, they separated. Catherine left, never to see her husband again, taking with her one child. Her sister Georgina, who stayed at Gads Hill, raised the other children.

During this period, whilst pondering a project to give public readings for his own profit, Dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by Great Ormond Street Hospital to help it survive its first major financial crisis. His &quot;Drooping Buds&quot; essay in &quot;Household Words&quot; earlier on 3 April 1852 was considered by the hospital&#x27;s founders to have been the catalyst for the hospital&#x27;s success. Dickens, whose philanthropy was well-known, was asked by his friend, the hospital&#x27;s founder Charles West, to preside over the appeal, and he threw himself into the task, heart and soul. Dickens&#x27;s public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment to put the hospital on a sound financial footing; one reading on 9 February 1858 alone raised £3,000.
After separating from Catherine, Dickens undertook a series of popular and remunerative reading tours which, together with his journalism, were to absorb most of his creative energies for the next decade, in which he was to write only two novels. His first reading tour, lasting from April 1858 to February 1859, consisted of 129 appearances in 49 towns throughout England, Scotland and Ireland. Dickens&#x27;s continued fascination with the theatrical world was written into the theatre scenes in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, and he found an outlet in public readings. In 1866, he undertook a series of public readings in England and Scotland, with more the following year in England and Ireland.
Other works soon followed, including &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1859) and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1861), which were resounding successes. Set in London and Paris, &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; is his best-known work of historical fiction and includes the famous opening sentence &quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot; It is regularly touted as one of the best-selling novels of all time. Themes in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; include wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil.

In early September 1860, in a field behind Gads Hill, Dickens made a bonfire of most of his correspondence; he spared only letters on business matters. Since Ellen Ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her, the extent of the affair between the two remains speculative. In the 1930s, Thomas Wright recounted that Ternan had unburdened herself to a Canon Benham and gave currency to rumours they had been lovers. Dickens&#x27;s daughter, Kate Perugini, stated that the two had a son who died in infancy to biographer Gladys Storey in an interview before the former&#x27;s death in 1929. Storey published her account in &quot;Dickens and Daughter&quot;, though no contemporary evidence was given. On his death, Dickens settled an annuity on Ternan which made her financially independent. Claire Tomalin&#x27;s book &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; argues that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life. The book was turned into a play, &quot;Little Nell&quot;, by Simon Gray, and a 2013 film. During the same period, Dickens furthered his interest in the paranormal, becoming one of the early members of The Ghost Club in London. In Christmas Eve of 1862, a theatrical production of his novella, &quot;The Haunted Man and the Ghost&#x27;s Bargain&quot;, saw the first public demonstration of &quot;Pepper&#x27;s ghost&quot;—a method of projecting the illusion of a ghost into a theatre (named after its developer John Henry Pepper)—which caused a sensation among those in attendance at the Regent Street theatre.

In June 1862, he was offered £10,000 for a reading tour of Australia. He was enthusiastic, and even planned a travel book, &quot;The Uncommercial Traveller Upside Down&quot;, but ultimately decided against the tour. Two of his sons, Alfred D&#x27;Orsay Tennyson Dickens and Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens, migrated to Australia, Edward becoming a member of the Parliament of New South Wales as Member for Wilcannia between 1889 and 1894.

==Later life==

On 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash in Kent. The train&#x27;s first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair and ten passengers were killed. The only first-class carriage to remain on the track—which was left hanging precariously off the bridge—was the one in which Dickens was travelling. For three hours before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it.

Dickens later used the experience of the crash as material for his short ghost story, &quot;The Signal-Man&quot;, in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash. He also based the story on several previous rail accidents, such as the Clayton Tunnel rail crash in Sussex of 1861. Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the inquest to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother, which would have caused a scandal. After the crash, Dickens was nervous when travelling by train and would use alternative means when available. In 1868 he wrote, &quot;I have sudden vague rushes of terror, even when riding in a hansom cab, which are perfectly unreasonable but quite insurmountable.&quot; Dickens&#x27;s son, Henry, recalled, &quot;I have seen him sometimes in a railway carriage when there was a slight jolt. When this happened he was almost in a state of panic and gripped the seat with both hands.&quot;

===Second visit to the United States===

While he contemplated a second visit to the United States, the outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans. On 9 November 1867, over two years after the war, Dickens set sail from Liverpool for his second American reading tour. Landing in Boston, he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his American publisher, James T. Fields. In early December, the readings began. He performed 76 readings, netting £19,000, from December 1867 to April 1868. Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at Steinway Hall. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the &quot;true American catarrh&quot;, he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in Central Park.

During his travels, he saw a change in the people and the circumstances of America. His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his honour at Delmonico&#x27;s on 18 April, when he promised never to denounce America again. By the end of the tour Dickens could hardly manage solid food, subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry. On 23 April he boarded the Cunard liner to return to Britain, barely escaping a federal tax lien against the proceeds of his lecture tour.

===Farewell readings===
In 1868–69, Dickens gave a series of &quot;farewell readings&quot; in England, Scotland and Ireland, beginning on 6 October. He managed, of a contracted 100 readings, to give 75 in the provinces, with a further 12 in London. As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis. He had a stroke on 18 April 1869 in Chester. He collapsed on 22 April 1869, at Preston, Lancashire; on doctor&#x27;s advice, the tour was cancelled. After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began work on his final novel, &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;. Described as a &quot;dark and gothic&quot; tale, his unfinished novel focuses on Drood&#x27;s uncle, John Jasper, a drug-addicted choirmaster. It was fashionable in the 1860s to &#x27;do the slums&#x27; and, in company, Dickens visited opium dens in Shadwell in the East End of London, where he witnessed an elderly addict called &quot;Laskar Sal&quot;, who formed the model for &quot;Opium Sal&quot; in &quot;Edwin Drood&quot;.

After Dickens regained enough strength, he arranged, with medical approval, for a final series of readings to partly make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness. There were 12 performances, on 11 January to 15 March 1870; the last at 8:00pm at St. James&#x27;s Hall, London. Though in grave health by then, he read &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;The Trial from Pickwick&quot;. On 2 May, he made his last public appearance at a Royal Academy banquet in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, paying a special tribute on the death of his friend, illustrator Daniel Maclise.

===Death===
On 8 June 1870, Dickens had another stroke at his home after a full day&#x27;s work on &quot;Edwin Drood&quot;. He never regained consciousness. The next day, he died at Gads Hill Place. Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he had had the stroke and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gads Hill so that the public would not know the truth about their relationship. Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral &quot;in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner&quot;, he was laid to rest in the Poets&#x27; Corner of Westminster Abbey. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads:

A letter from Dickens to the Clerk of the Privy Council in March indicates he had been offered and accepted a baronetcy, which was not gazetted before his death. His last words were &quot;On the ground&quot; in response to his sister-in-law Georgina&#x27;s request that he lie down. On Sunday, 19 June 1870, five days after Dickens was buried in the Abbey, Dean Arthur Penrhyn Stanley delivered a memorial elegy, lauding &quot;the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn&quot;, for showing by his own example &quot;that even in dealing with the darkest scenes and the most degraded characters, genius could still be clean, and mirth could be innocent&quot;. Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist&#x27;s grave, Stanley assured those present that &quot;the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue.&quot;

In his will, drafted more than a year before his death, Dickens left the care of his £80,000 estate (£ in ) to his long-time colleague John Forster and his &quot;best and truest friend&quot; Georgina Hogarth who, along with Dickens&#x27;s two sons, also received a tax-free sum of £8,000 (equivalent to £ in ). He confirmed his wife Catherine&#x27;s annual allowance 
of £600 (£ in ). He bequeathed £19 19s (£ in ) to each servant in his employment at the time of his death.

==Literary style==

Dickens&#x27;s approach to the novel is influenced by various things, including the picaresque novel tradition, melodrama and the novel of sensibility. According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;. Satire and irony are central to the picaresque novel. Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett. Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot; was a major influence on the 19th-century novelist including Dickens, who read it in his youth and named a son Henry Fielding Dickens after him. Influenced by Gothic fiction—a literary genre that began with &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; (1764) by Horace Walpole—Dickens incorporated Gothic imagery, settings and plot devices in his works. Victorian gothic moved from castles and abbeys into contemporary urban environments: in particular London, such as Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and &quot;Bleak House&quot;. The jilted bride Miss Havisham from &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is one of Dickens&#x27;s best-known gothic creations; living in a ruined mansion, her bridal gown effectively doubles as her funeral shroud.

No other writer had such a profound influence on Dickens as William Shakespeare. On Dickens&#x27;s veneration of Shakespeare, Alfred Harbage wrote in &quot;A Kind of Power: The Shakespeare-Dickens Analogy&quot; (1975) that &quot;No one is better qualified to recognise literary genius than a literary genius&quot;. Regarding Shakespeare as &quot;the great master&quot; whose plays &quot;were an unspeakable source of delight&quot;, Dickens&#x27;s lifelong affinity with the playwright included seeing theatrical productions of his plays in London and putting on amateur dramatics with friends in his early years. In 1838, Dickens travelled to Stratford-upon-Avon and visited the house in which Shakespeare was born, leaving his autograph in the visitors&#x27; book. Dickens would draw on this experience in his next work, &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1838–39), expressing the strength of feeling experienced by visitors to Shakespeare&#x27;s birthplace: the character Mrs Wititterly states, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how it is, but after you&#x27;ve seen the place and written your name in the little book, somehow or other you seem to be inspired; it kindles up quite a fire within one.&quot;

Dickens&#x27;s writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity. Satire, flourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to the artist and social critic Hogarth for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre. Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an &quot;allegorical impetus&quot; to the novels&#x27; meanings. To cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr Murdstone in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; conjures up twin allusions to murder and stony coldness. His literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery—he calls one character the &quot;Noble Refrigerator&quot;—are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens&#x27;s acclaimed flights of fancy. On his ability to elicit a response from his works, English screenwriter Sarah Phelps writes, &quot;He knew how to work an audience and how to get them laughing their heads off one minute or on the edge of their seats and holding their breath the next. The other thing about Dickens is that he loved telling stories and he loved his characters, even those horrible, mean-spirited ones.&quot;

The author worked closely with his illustrators, supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them. He briefed the illustrator on plans for each month&#x27;s instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. Marcus Stone, illustrator of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, recalled that the author was always &quot;ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics, and ... life-history of the creations of his fancy&quot;. Dickens employs Cockney English in many of his works, denoting working-class Londoners. Cockney grammar appears in terms such as ain&#x27;t, and consonants in words are frequently omitted, as in &#x27;ere (here) and wot (what). An example of this usage is in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. The Artful Dodger uses cockney slang which is juxtaposed with Oliver&#x27;s &#x27;proper&#x27; English, when the Dodger repeats Oliver saying &quot;seven&quot; with &quot;sivin&quot;.

===Characters===

Dickens&#x27;s biographer Claire Tomalin regards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after Shakespeare.
Dickensian characters are amongst the most memorable in English literature, especially so because of their typically whimsical names. The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim, Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit (&quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;); Oliver Twist, The Artful Dodger, Fagin and Bill Sikes (&quot;Oliver Twist&quot;); Pip, Miss Havisham, Estella and Abel Magwitch (&quot;Great Expectations&quot;); Sydney Carton, Charles Darnay and Madame Defarge (&quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;); David Copperfield, Uriah Heep and Mr Micawber (&quot;David Copperfield&quot;); Daniel Quilp and Nell Trent (&quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;), Samuel Pickwick and Sam Weller (&quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;); and Wackford Squeers (&quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;) are so well known as to be part and parcel of popular culture, and in some cases have passed into ordinary language: a &quot;scrooge&quot;, for example, is a miser or someone who dislikes Christmas festivity.
His characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books. &quot;Gamp&quot; became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character Mrs Gamp, and &quot;Pickwickian&quot;, &quot;Pecksniffian&quot; and &quot;Gradgrind&quot; all entered dictionaries due to Dickens&#x27;s original portraits of such characters who were, respectively, quixotic, hypocritical and vapidly factual. The character that made Dickens famous, Sam Weller became known for his Wellerisms—one-liners that turn proverbs on their heads. Many were drawn from real life: Mrs Nickleby is based on his mother, although she did not recognise herself in the portrait, just as Mr Micawber is constructed from aspects of his father&#x27;s &#x27;rhetorical exuberance&#x27;; Harold Skimpole in &quot;Bleak House&quot; is based on James Henry Leigh Hunt; his wife&#x27;s dwarfish chiropodist recognised herself in Miss Mowcher in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. Perhaps Dickens&#x27;s impressions on his meeting with Hans Christian Andersen informed the delineation of Uriah Heep (a term synonymous with sycophant).

Virginia Woolf maintained that &quot;we remodel our psychological geography when we read Dickens&quot; as he produces &quot;characters who exist not in detail, not accurately or exactly, but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks&quot;. T. S. Eliot wrote that Dickens &quot;excelled in character; in the creation of characters of greater intensity than human beings&quot;. One &quot;character&quot; vividly drawn throughout his novels is London itself. Dickens described London as a magic lantern, inspiring the places and people in many of his novels. From the coaching inns on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the Thames, all aspects of the capital—Dickens&#x27;s London—are described over the course of his body of work. Walking the streets (particularly around London) formed an integral part of his writing life, stoking his creativity. Dickens was known to regularly walk at least a dozen miles (19 km) per day, and once wrote, &quot;If I couldn&#x27;t walk fast and far, I should just explode and perish.&quot;

===Autobiographical elements===

Authors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in &quot;Bleak House&quot; reflect Dickens&#x27;s experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law&#x27;s procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright. Dickens&#x27;s father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; resulting from Dickens&#x27;s own experiences of the institution. Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens&#x27;s portraits of girls such as Little Em&#x27;ly in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and Lucie Manette in &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;.

Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens&#x27;s own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.

===Episodic writing===

A pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction, Dickens wrote most of his major novels in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot; and &quot;Household Words&quot;, later reprinted in book form. These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than before. His instalment format inspired a narrative that he would explore and develop throughout his career, and the regular cliffhangers made each new episode widely anticipated. When &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in New York harbour, shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, &quot;Is little Nell dead?&quot; Dickens was able to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end. He wrote, &quot;The thing has to be planned for presentation in these fragments, and yet for afterwards fusing together as an uninterrupted whole.&quot;

Another important impact of Dickens&#x27;s episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation; he toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp&#x27;s drowning in &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine. When in 1863 Jewish English reader Eliza Davis wrote to rebuke him for having &quot;encouraged a vile prejudice against the despised Hebrew&quot; with the character of Fagin in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Dickens halted the second printing of the novel and made some changes to the original 1837 text. He also created a group of sympathetic Jewish characters in his next novel, &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, published 1864–1865.

At the helm in popularising cliffhangers and serial publications in Victorian literature, Dickens&#x27;s influence can also be seen in television soap operas and film series, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; stating that &quot;the DNA of Dickens&#x27;s busy, episodic storytelling, delivered in instalments and rife with cliffhangers and diversions, is traceable in everything.&quot; His serialisation of his novels also drew comments from other writers. In Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wrecker&quot;, Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship, remarked: &quot;See! They were writing up the log,&quot; said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. &quot;Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels.&quot;

===Social commentary===

Dickens&#x27;s novels were, among other things, works of social commentary. Simon Callow states, &quot;From the moment he started to write, he spoke for the people, and the people loved him for it.&quot; He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that &quot;Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen&quot;. Dickens&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.

At a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues—such as sanitation and the workhouse—but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), Dickens&#x27;s only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed &quot;Hands&quot; by the factory owners; that is, not really &quot;people&quot; but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; are claimed to have been influential in having the Fleet Prison shut down. Karl Marx asserted that Dickens &quot;issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together&quot;. George Bernard Shaw even remarked that &quot;Great Expectations&quot; was more seditious than Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. The exceptional popularity of Dickens&#x27;s novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (&quot;Bleak House&quot;, 1853; &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;, 1857; &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, 1865), not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. &quot;Bleak House&quot;, a satire of protracted legal cases with &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot;—a fictional long-running Chancery case which has been cited by courts as a symbol of a legal case that interminably drags on—the central plot of the novel, helped support a judicial reform movement that culminated in the enactment of legal reform in England in the 1870s.

It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an &#x27;unruly superfluity of material&#x27; that, in the gradual dénouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.

===Literary techniques===

Dickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; (1841) was received as extremely moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde. &quot;One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell&quot;, he said in a famous remark, &quot;without dissolving into tears ... of laughter.&quot; G. K. Chesterton stated, &quot;It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to&quot;, arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens&#x27;s grief, his &quot;despotic&quot; use of people&#x27;s feelings to move them to tears in works like this.
The question as to whether Dickens belongs to the tradition of the sentimental novel is debatable. Valerie Purton, in her book &quot;Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition&quot;, sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his &quot;sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes&quot;, and that &quot;&quot;Dombey and Son&quot; is [ ... ] Dickens&#x27;s greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; online comments that, despite &quot;patches of emotional excess&quot;, such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843), &quot;Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist&quot;.

In &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in &quot;Bleak House&quot; and Amy Dorrit in &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens&#x27;s goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens&#x27;s fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence. For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones,&quot; which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.

==Reputation==

Dickens was the most popular novelist of his time, and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors. His works have never gone out of print, and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema, with at least 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens&#x27;s works documented. Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime—early productions included &quot;The Haunted Man&quot; which was performed in the West End&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre in 1848—and, as early as 1901, the British silent film &quot;Scrooge, or, Marley&#x27;s Ghost&quot; was made by Walter R. Booth. Contemporaries such as publisher Edward Lloyd cashed in on Dickens&#x27;s popularity with cheap imitations of his novels, resulting in his own popular &#x27;penny dreadfuls&#x27;.

Dickens created some of the world&#x27;s best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest British novelist of the Victorian era. From the beginning of his career in the 1830s, his achievements in English literature were compared to those of Shakespeare. Dickens&#x27;s literary reputation, however, began to decline with the publication of &quot;Bleak House&quot; in 1852–53. Philip Collins calls &quot;Bleak House&quot; &quot;a crucial item in the history of Dickens&#x27;s reputation. Reviewers and literary figures during the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, saw a &#x27;drear decline&#x27; in Dickens, from a writer of &#x27;bright sunny comedy ... to dark and serious social&#x27; commentary&quot;. &quot;The Spectator&quot; called &quot;Bleak House&quot; &quot;a heavy book to read through at once ... dull and wearisome as a serial&quot;; Richard Simpson, in &quot;The Rambler&quot;, characterised &quot;Hard Times&quot; as &quot;this dreary framework&quot;; &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; thought &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; &quot;decidedly the worst of his novels&quot;. All the same, despite these &quot;increasing reservations amongst reviewers and the chattering classes, &#x27;the public never deserted its favourite. Dickens&#x27;s popular reputation remained unchanged, sales continued to rise, and &quot;Household Words&quot; and later &quot;All the Year Round&quot; were highly successful.
As his career progressed, Dickens&#x27;s fame and the demand for his public readings were unparalleled. In 1868, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Amid all the variety of &#x27;readings&#x27;, those of Mr Charles Dickens stand alone.&quot; A Dickens biographer, Edgar Johnson, wrote: &quot;It was [always] more than a reading; it was an extraordinary exhibition of acting that seized upon its auditors with a mesmeric possession.&quot; Author David Lodge called him the &quot;first writer to be an object of unrelenting public interest and adulation&quot;. Juliet John backed the claim for Dickens &quot;to be called the first self-made global media star of the age of mass culture&quot;. The word &quot;celebrity&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 1851, and the BBC states &quot;Charles Dickens was one of the first figures to be called one&quot;. Comparing his reception at public readings to those of a contemporary pop star—the BBC compared his reception in the US to The Beatles—&quot;The Guardian&quot; states, &quot;People sometimes fainted at his shows. His performances even saw the rise of that modern phenomenon, the &#x27;speculator&#x27; or ticket tout (scalpers)—the ones in New York City escaped detection by borrowing respectable-looking hats from the waiters in nearby restaurants.&quot;
Among fellow writers, there was a range of opinions on Dickens. Poet laureate, William Wordsworth (1770–1850), thought him a &quot;very talkative, vulgar young person&quot;, adding he had not read a line of his work, while novelist George Meredith (1828–1909), found Dickens &quot;intellectually lacking&quot;. In 1888, Leslie Stephen commented in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; that &quot;if literary fame could be safely measured by popularity with the half-educated, Dickens must claim the highest position among English novelists&quot;. Anthony Trollope&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot; famously declared Thackeray, not Dickens, to be the greatest novelist of the age. However, both Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were admirers. Dostoyevsky commented: &quot;We understand Dickens in Russia, I am convinced, almost as well as the English, perhaps even with all the nuances. It may well be that we love him no less than his compatriots do. And yet how original is Dickens, and how very English!&quot; Tolstoy referred to &quot;David Copperfield&quot; as his favourite book, and he later adopted the novel as &quot;a model for his own autobiographical reflections&quot;. French writer Jules Verne called Dickens his favourite writer, writing his novels &quot;stand alone, dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression&quot;. Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was inspired by Dickens&#x27;s novels in several of his paintings, such as &quot;Vincent&#x27;s Chair&quot;, and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading Dickens, especially &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, was one of the things that was keeping him from committing suicide. Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character, while admiring his gift for caricature. Henry James denied him a premier position, calling him &quot;the greatest of superficial novelists&quot;: Dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth, and the novels, &quot;loose baggy monsters&quot;, betrayed a &quot;cavalier organisation&quot;. Joseph Conrad described his own childhood in bleak Dickensian terms, noting he had &quot;an intense and unreasoning affection&quot; for &quot;Bleak House&quot; dating back to his boyhood. The novel influenced his own gloomy portrait of London in &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; (1907). Virginia Woolf had a love-hate relationship with Dickens, finding his novels &quot;mesmerizing&quot; while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a commonplace style.
Around 1940–41, the attitude of the literary critics began to warm towards Dickens—led by George Orwell in &quot;Inside the Whale and Other Essays&quot; (March 1940), Edmund Wilson in &quot;The Wound and the Bow&quot; (1941) and Humphry House in &quot;Dickens and His World&quot;. However, even in 1948, F. R. Leavis, in &quot;The Great Tradition&quot;, asserted that &quot;the adult mind doesn&#x27;t as a rule find in Dickens a challenge to an unusual and sustained seriousness&quot;; Dickens was indeed a great genius, &quot;but the genius was that of a great entertainer&quot;, though he later changed his opinion with &quot;Dickens the Novelist&quot; (1970, with Q. D. (Queenie) Leavis): &quot;Our purpose&quot;, they wrote, &quot;is to enforce as unanswerably as possible the conviction that Dickens was one of the greatest of creative writers&quot;. In 1944, Soviet film director and film theorist Sergei Eisenstein wrote an essay on Dickens&#x27;s influence on cinema, such as cross-cutting—where two stories run alongside each other, as seen in novels such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.

In the 1950s, &quot;a substantial reassessment and re-editing of the works began, and critics found his finest artistry and greatest depth to be in the later novels: &quot;Bleak House&quot;, &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot;—and (less unanimously) in &quot;Hard Times&quot; and &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;&quot;. Dickens was among the favourite authors of Roald Dahl; the best-selling children&#x27;s author would include three of Dickens&#x27;s novels among those read by the title character in his 1988 novel &quot;Matilda&quot;. In 2005, Paul McCartney, an avid reader of Dickens, named &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; his favourite novel. On Dickens he states, &quot;I like the world that he takes me to. I like his words; I like the language&quot;, adding, &quot;A lot of my stuff—it&#x27;s kind of Dickensian.&quot; Screenwriter Jonathan Nolan&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012) was inspired by &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, with Nolan calling the depiction of Paris in the novel &quot;one of the most harrowing portraits of a relatable, recognisable civilisation that completely folded to pieces&quot;. On 7 February 2012, the 200th anniversary of Dickens&#x27;s birth, Philip Womack wrote in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;: &quot;Today there is no escaping Charles Dickens. Not that there has ever been much chance of that before. He has a deep, peculiar hold upon us&quot;.

==Legacy==

Museums and festivals celebrating Dickens&#x27;s life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated. These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; and &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;; and the Charles Dickens&#x27; Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house in which he was born. The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers&#x27; proofs, first editions and illustrations from the collection of Dickens&#x27;s friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Dickens&#x27;s will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled &quot;Dickens and Little Nell&quot;, cast in 1890 by Francis Edwin Elwell, stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Another life-size statue of Dickens is located at Centennial Park in Sydney, Australia. In 1960 a bas-relief sculpture of Dickens, notably featuring characters from his books, was commissioned from sculptor Estcourt J Clack to adorn the office building built on the site of his former home at 1 Devonshire Terrace, London. In 2014, a life-size statue was unveiled near his birthplace in Portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth; this was supported by his great-great-grandsons, Ian and Gerald Dickens.
&quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is most probably his best-known story, with frequent new adaptations. It is also the most-filmed of Dickens&#x27;s stories, with many versions dating from the early years of cinema. According to the historian Ronald Hutton, the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, in contrast to the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations, as new middle-class expectations arose. Its archetypal figures (Scrooge, Tiny Tim, the Christmas ghosts) entered into Western cultural consciousness. &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, a prominent phrase from the tale, was popularised following the appearance of the story. The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, and his exclamation &quot;Bah! Humbug!&#x27;&quot;, a dismissal of the festive spirit, likewise gained currency as an idiom. The Victorian era novelist William Makepeace Thackeray called the book &quot;a national benefit, and to every man and woman who reads it a personal kindness&quot;.
Dickens was commemorated on the £10 note issued by the Bank of England that circulated between 1992 and 2003. His portrait appeared on the reverse of the note accompanied by a scene from &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. The Charles Dickens School is a high school in Broadstairs, Kent. A theme park, Dickens World, was open in Chatham from 2007 to 2016. To celebrate the 200th anniversary of his birth in 2012, the Museum of London held the UK&#x27;s first major exhibition on the author in 40 years. In 2002, Dickens was number 41 in the BBC&#x27;s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. American literary critic Harold Bloom placed Dickens among the greatest Western writers of all time. In the 2003 UK survey The Big Read carried out by the BBC, five of Dickens&#x27;s books were named in the Top 100.

Actors who have portrayed Dickens on screen include Anthony Hopkins, Derek Jacobi, Simon Callow, Dan Stevens and Ralph Fiennes, the latter playing the author in &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; (2013) which depicts Dickens&#x27;s alleged secret love affair with Ellen Ternan which lasted for thirteen years until his death in 1870.
Dickens and his publications have appeared on a number of postage stamps in countries including: the United Kingdom (1970, 1993, 2011 and 2012 issued by the Royal Mail—their 2012 collection marked the bicentenary of Dickens&#x27;s birth), the Soviet Union (1962), Antigua, Barbuda, Botswana, Cameroon, Dubai, Fujairah, St Lucia and Turks and Caicos Islands (1970), St Vincent (1987), Nevis (2007), Alderney, Gibraltar, Jersey and Pitcairn Islands (2012), Austria (2013) and Mozambique (2014). In 1976, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in his honour.

In November 2018 it was reported that a previously lost portrait of a 31-year-old Dickens, by Margaret Gillies, had been found in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Gillies was an early supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage and had painted the portrait in late 1843 when Dickens, aged 31, wrote &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. It was exhibited, to acclaim, at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1844. The Charles Dickens Museum is reported to have paid £180,000 for the portrait.

<text>A carabiner or karabiner (), often shortened to biner or to crab, colloquially known as a (climbing) clip, is a specialized type of shackle, a metal loop with a spring-loaded gate used to quickly and reversibly connect components, most notably in safety-critical systems. The word comes from the German , short for , meaning &quot;carbine hook,&quot; as the device was used by carabiniers to attach their carbines to their belts.

==Use==
Carabiners are widely used in rope-intensive activities such as climbing, fall arrest systems, arboriculture, caving, sailing, hot-air ballooning, rope rescue, construction, industrial rope work, window cleaning, whitewater rescue, and acrobatics. They are predominantly made from both steel and aluminium. Those used in sports tend to be of a lighter weight than those used in commercial applications and rope rescue.

Often referred to as carabiner-style or as mini-carabiners, carabiner keyrings and other light-use clips of similar style and design have also become popular. Most are stamped with a &quot;not for climbing&quot; or similar warning due to a common lack of load-testing and safety standards in manufacturing.

While any metal link with a spring-loaded gate is technically a carabiner, the strict usage among the climbing community specifically refers only to devices manufactured and tested for load-bearing in safety-critical systems like rock and mountain climbing, typically rated to 20 kN or more.

Carabiners on hot-air balloons are used to connect the envelope to the basket and are rated at 2.5, 3, or 4 tonnes.

Load-bearing screw-gate carabiners are used to connect the diver&#x27;s umbilical to the surface supplied diver&#x27;s harness. They are usually rated for a safe working load of 5 kN or more (equivalent to a weight in excess of approximately 500 kg).

==Types==
===Shape===
Carabiners come in four characteristic shapes:
#Oval: Symmetric. Most basic and utilitarian. Smooth regular curves are gentle on equipment and allow easy repositioning of loads. Their greatest disadvantage is that a load is shared equally on both the strong solid spine and the weaker gated axis. Often preferred type for racking biners due to their symmetric shape.
#D: Asymmetric shape transfers the majority of the load on to the spine, the carabiner&#x27;s strongest axis.
#Offset-D: Variant of a D with a greater asymmetry, allowing for a wider gate opening.
#Pear/HMS: Wider and rounder shape at the top than offset-D&#x27;s, and typically larger. Used for belaying with a munter hitch, and with some types of belay device. The largest HMS carabiners can also be used for rappelling with a munter hitch (the size is needed to accommodate the hitch with two strands of rope). These are usually the heaviest carabiners.

===Locking mechanisms===
Carabiners fall into three broad locking categories: non-locking, manual locking, and auto locking.

====Non-locking====
Non-locking carabiners (or &quot;snap-links&quot;) have a sprung swinging gate that accepts a rope, webbing sling, or other hardware. Rock climbers frequently connect two non-locking carabiners with a short length of webbing to create a quickdraw (an extender).

Two gate types are common:

# Solid gate: The more traditional carabiner design, incorporating a solid metal gate with separate pin and spring mechanisms. Most modern carabiners feature a &#x27;key-lock nose shape and gate opening, which is less prone to snagging than traditional notch and pin design. Most locking carabiners are based on the solid gate design.
# Wire gate: A single piece of bent spring-steel wire forms the gate. Wire gate carabiners are significantly lighter than solid gates, with roughly the same strength. Wire gates are less prone to icing up than solid gates, an advantage in Alpine mountaineering and ice climbing. The reduced gate mass makes their wire bales less prone to &quot;gate flutter&quot;, a dangerous condition created when the carabiner suddenly impacts rock or other hard surfaces during a fall, and the gate opens momentarily due to momentum (and both lowers the breaking strength of the carabiner when open, and potentially allows the rope to escape). Simple wiregate designs feature a notch that can snag objects (similar to original solid gate designs), but newer designs feature a shroud or guide wires around the &quot;hooked&quot; part of the carabiner nose to prevent snagging.

Both solid and wire gate carabiners can be either &quot;straight gate&quot; or &quot;bent gate&quot;. Bent-gate carabiners are easier to clip a rope into using only one hand, and so are often used for the rope-end carabiner of quickdraws and alpine draws used for lead climbing.

====Locking====

Locking carabiners have the same general shape as non-locking carabiners, but have an additional mechanism securing the gate to prevent unintentional opening during use. These mechanisms may be either threaded sleeves (&quot;screw-lock&quot;), spring-loaded sleeves (&quot;twist-lock&quot;), magnetic levers (&quot;Magnetron&quot;), other spring loaded unlocking levers or opposing double spring loaded gates (&quot;twin-gate&quot;).

=====Manual=====

* Screw-lock (or screw gate): Have a threaded sleeve over the gate which must be engaged and disengaged manually. They have fewer moving parts than spring-loaded mechanisms, are less prone to malfunctioning due to contamination or component fatigue, and are easier to employ one-handed. They, however, require more total effort and are more time-consuming than pull-lock, twist-lock or lever-lock.

=====Auto-locking=====
* Twist-lock, push-lock, twist-and-push-lock: Have a security sleeve over the gate which must be manually rotated and/or pulled to disengage, but which springs automatically to locked position upon release. They offer the advantage of re-engaging without additional user input, but being spring-loaded are prone to both spring fatigue and their more complex mechanisms becoming balky from dirt, ice, or other contamination. They are also difficult to open one-handed and with gloves on, and sometimes jam, getting stuck after being tightened under load, and being very hard to undo once the load is removed.
* Multiple-levers: Having at least two spring loaded levers that are each operated with one hand.
* Magnetic: Have two small levers with embedded magnets on either side of the locking gate which must be pushed towards each other or pinched simultaneously to unlock. Upon release the levers pull shut and into the locked position against a small steel insert in the carabiner nose. With the gate open the magnets in the two levers repel each other so they do not lock or stick together, which might prevent the gate from closing properly. Advantages are very easy one-handed operation, re-engaging without additional user input and few mechanical parts that can fail.
*Double-Gate: Have two opposed overlapping gates at the opening which prevent a rope or anchor from inadvertently passing through the gate in either direction. Gates may only be opened by pushing outwards from in between towards either direction. The carabiner can therefore be opened by splitting the gates with a fingertip, allowing easy one hand operation. The likelihood of a rope under tension to split the gates is therefore practically none. The lack of a rotating lock prevents a rolling knot, such as the Munter hitch, from unlocking the gate and passing through, giving a measure of inherent safety in use and reducing mechanical complexity.

==Certification==

===Europe===
*Recreation: Carabiners sold for use in climbing in Europe must conform to standard EN 12275:1998 &quot;Mountaineering equipment – Connectors – Safety requirements and test methods&quot;, which governs testing protocols, rated strengths, and markings. A breaking strength of at least 20 kN (20,000 newtons = approximately 2040 kilograms of force which is significantly more than the weight of a small car) with the gate closed and 7 kN with the gate open is the standard for most climbing applications, although requirements vary depending on the activity. Carabiners are marked on the side with single letters showing their intended area of use, for example, K (via ferrata), B (base), and H (for belaying with an Italian or Munter hitch).
*Industry: Carabiners used for access in commercial and industrial environments within Europe must comply with EN 362:2004 &quot;Personal protective equipment against falls from a height. Connectors.&quot; The minimum gate closed breaking strength of a carabiner conforming with EN 362:2004 is nominally the same as that of EN 12275:1998 at around 20 kN. Carabiners complying with both EN 12275:1998 and EN 362:2004 are available.

===United States===
*Climbing and mountaineering: Minimum breaking strength (MBS) requirements and calculations for climbing and mountaineering carabiners in the USA are set out in ASTM Standard F1774. This standard calls for a MBS of 20 kN on the long axis, and 7 kN on the short axis (cross load). 
*Rescue: Carabiners used for rescue are addressed in ASTM F1956. This document addresses two classifications of carabiners, light use and heavy-duty. Light use carabiners are the most widely used, and are commonly found in applications including technical rope rescue, mountain rescue, cave rescue, cliff rescue, military, SWAT, and even by some non-NFPA fire departments. ASTM requirements for light use carabiners are 27 kN MBS on the long axis, 7 kN on the short axis. Requirements for the lesser-used heavy duty rescue carabiners are 40 kN MBS long axis, 10.68 kN short axis.
*Fire rescue: Minimum breaking strength requirements and calculations for rescue carabiners used by NFPA compliant agencies are set out in National Fire Protection Association standard 1983-2012 edition &quot;Fire Service Life Safety Rope and Equipment&quot;. The standard defines two classes of rescue carabiners. Technical use rescue carabiners are required to have minimum breaking strengths of 27 kN gate closed, 7 kN gate open and 7 kN minor axis. General use rescue carabiners are required to have minimum breaking strengths of 40 kN gate closed, 11 kN gate open and 11 kN minor axis. Testing procedures for rescue carabiners are set out in ASTM International standard F 1956 &quot;Standard Specification of Rescue Carabiners&quot;.
*Fall protection: Carabiners used for fall protection in US industry are classified as &quot;connectors&quot; and are required to meet Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard 1910.66 App C &quot;Personal Fall Arrest System&quot; which specifies &quot;drop forged, pressed or formed steel, or made of equivalent materials&quot; and a minimum breaking strength of .

American National Standards Institute/American Society of Safety Engineers standard ANSI Z359.1-2007 &quot;Safety Requirement for Personal Fall Arrest Systems, Subsystems and Components&quot;, section 3.2.1.4 (for snap hooks and carabiners) is a voluntary consensus standard. This standard requires that all connectors/ carabiners support a minimum breaking strength (MBS) of and feature an auto-locking gate mechanism which supports a minimum breaking strength (MBS) of .

==History==

The first known hooks that had a sprung, hinged gate where the spring kept it closed (characteristics expected of a carabiner) were depicted by Nuremberg patrician Martin Löffelholz von Kolberg in about 1505 in the Codex Löffelholz, in the Holy Roman Empire. These then became the clip used to hold a cavalry carbine or arquebus, with the earliest known mention of them being in 1616 by Johann Jacob von Wallhausen, in the Holy Roman Empire. They were widely used in many European countries during the 17th century, and typically had a belt attachment and swivel joint, much like a modern luggage strap or handbag strap. The load bearing latch was added in the 1790s, for the British cavalry design. They were used for many other purposes during the 19th century, such as for luggage straps, mining and connecting ropes. Some common designs first appeared during that time, including S-carabiners. Oval links, which had also appeared in 1485, also reappeared as carabiners. Screw gates and internal springs were developed. Prussian fire brigades began to use carabiners for connecting themselves to ladders in 1847, and this became the modern gourd-shaped design by 1868. German and Austrian mountaineers started using them during the late 19th century, with a mention of their use from 1879, and their continued use for climbing by climbers in Saxon Switzerland. The majority used gourd shaped carabiners which were created for mining or other utility purposes.

The common myth suggesting that mountaineering carabiners were invented or made by German climber Otto &quot;Rambo&quot; Herzog in the 1910s has no basis in fact. He used them for some challenging climbs and some new techniques at a time when such &quot;artificial aids&quot; were still controversial in mountain climbing, but he did not invent them or develop any designs, and he was born long after other climbers were already using carabiners. 

During the 1920s many designs were used by mountain climbers, such as gourd-shaped, oval or elliptical, mostly sold for general hardware. By the early 1930s, a form of carabiner were being sold for climbing, oval designs being the most popular. During this decade, hardened steel carabiners appeared and the first aluminium carabiner prototypes were made by Pierre Allain, although they were never sold. 

The modern carabiner that endures today was first designed and widely distributed during WWII for the US Army. Raffi Bedayn, an engineer from the San Francisco Bay Area was assigned the project to meet a need for swift, strong and secure rope attachments for use by the infantry. Bedayn was one of the early &quot;golden age&quot; Yosemite mountain climbers with years of involvement with the American Alpine Club and drew on his experience to inform his design. Bedayn crafted a smooth steel oval with a spring-operated lever opening (or &quot;gate&quot;) and a rod-and-hook gate closure that imbeds in the carabiner body to prevent twisting, a design still in use today. Bedayn innovated the use of lighter aluminum when steel became scarce during the war. Early carabiners from Bedayn&#x27;s commercial production efforts during the late 1940&#x27;s - 1960&#x27;s have &quot;Bedayn California&quot; or &quot;Bedayn Calif.&quot; engraved on the gate or on one end of the oval. These were the first commercially produced carabiners designed specifically for climbing.

Later innovations included offset D-shaped carabiners and locking mechanisms. Rock climbers such as Yvon Choinard were credited for ongoing evolutionary adaptions of the basic design - such as the &quot;D shape&quot; carabiner and locking features, which facilitated better safety and stability during climbs. Aluminium carabiners were first sold to the military in 1941, which were the first commercial carabiners designed specifically for climbing. Slightly offset D-shaped carabiners were sold in the late 1940s, which became the standard offset D-shape (which is now the most common) in the 1950s.

Chouinard Equipment introduced the 22 kN aluminium carabiner in 1968, though this strength had already been far surpassed by steel carabiners. Wiregate carabiners were first patented in 1969, and were sold for maritime use. They were first sold for climbing in 1996. The popular keylock, which avoids snagging, was developed around 1984–1987.

<doc id="5899" wikidata="Q2141130" url="?curid=5899" title="Continuity (fiction)">
<text>In fiction, continuity is the consistency of the characteristics of people, plot, objects, and places seen by the audience over some period of time. It is relevant to many genres and forms of storytelling, especially if it is long-running.

Continuity is particularly a concern in the process of film and television production due to the difficulty in rectifying errors after filming ends. Continuity can also apply to other art forms, such as novels, comics, and video games, though usually on a smaller scale; it also applies to fiction used by persons, corporations, and governments in the public eye.

Most film and TV productions have a script supervisor on hand whose job is to pay attention to and attempt to maintain continuity across the chaotic and typically non-linear production schedule. It is an inconspicuous job because if done well, none may ever notice. The script supervisor gathers numerous paperwork, photographs, and other documentation which note a large quantity of detail for maintaining the continuity of the production; some of the gathered documents can be sometimes assembled into the story bible. The gathered information and photographs usually regard factors both within the scene and the technical details of the production, including meticulous records of camera positioning and equipment settings. Film-based Polaroid cameras were once standard but have since been replaced by digital cameras; all of this is, ideally, all related shots can match, due to filming being split up over months in different sets and locations. 
In comic books, continuity has also come to mean a set of contiguous events, sometimes said to be &quot;set in the same universe.&quot;

==Continuity errors==
Many continuity errors are subtle, such as minor changes between shots (like the level of drink in a glass or the length of a cigarette); these minor errors often remain due to relative indifference to the final cut. While minor errors are often unnoticed by the average viewer, other errors may be more noticeable, such as sudden drastic changes in the appearance of a character. Productions will aim to prevent such errors in continuity because they can affect the audience&#x27;s suspension of disbelief.

In cinema, special attention must be paid to continuity because scenes are rarely shot in the order in which they appear in the final film. The shooting schedule is often dictated by location permit issues and other logistics. For example, a character may return to Times Square in New York City several times throughout a movie, but as it is extraordinarily expensive to close off Times Square, those scenes will likely be filmed all at once to reduce permit costs. Weather, the ambiance of natural light, cast and crew availability, or any number of other circumstances can also influence a shooting schedule.

=== Measures against continuity errors in the film ===

Film production companies use various techniques to prevent continuity errors. The first would be to film all the shots for a particular scene together and all shots of consecutive scenes together (if the scenes take place together, with no break between them in the film&#x27;s timeline). This allows actors to remain in costume, in character, and in the same location (and with the same weather, if shooting on location).

The second major technique is for costume designers, production designers, prop masters, and make-up artists to take instant photographs of actors and sets at the beginning and end of each day&#x27;s shooting (once made possible by Polaroid cameras, now done with digital cameras and cell phones as well). This allows the various workers to check each day&#x27;s clothing, set, props, and make-up against a previous day&#x27;s.

The third is to avoid shooting on location entirely but instead film everything on a studio set. This allows weather and lighting to be controlled (as the shooting is indoors), and for all clothing and sets to be stored in one place to be hauled out the next day from a secure location.

The advent of advanced CGI has helped alleviate the challenge of preventing continuity errors from reaching the final cut, as it is easier to &quot;airbrush&quot; the errant drink glass or cigarette than it once was, albeit still not necessarily trivial.

===Editing errors===
Editing errors can occur when a character in a scene references a scene or incident that has not occurred yet, or of which they should not yet be aware.

An example of an editing error can be seen in the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), where a scene of people climbing a slope at the start is seen from below and then replayed from above.

===Visual errors===
Visual errors are instant &quot;discontinuities&quot; occurring in visual media such as film and television. Items of clothing change colors, shadows get longer or shorter, items within a scene change place or disappear, etc.

One of the earliest examples of a &quot;visual error&quot; appears in Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s 1914 movie &quot;The Property Man&quot;. Here, in a supposedly smooth step from one room to another, the Tramp loses his hat in one room, but it is instantly back on his head as he enters the next room. Rather &quot;loose&quot; plots and a lack of continuity editing made most early films rife with such errors.

===Plot errors===
A plot error, or a plot hole as it is commonly known, reflects a failure in the consistency of the created fictional world. A character might state he was an only child, yet later mention a sibling. In the TV show &quot;Cheers&quot;, Frasier Crane&#x27;s wife Lilith mentions Frasier&#x27;s parents are both dead, and, in another episode, Frasier himself claims his father to have been a scientist. When the character was spun off into &quot;Frasier&quot;, his father, a retired policeman named Martin, became a central character. Eventually, in an episode featuring &quot;Cheers&quot; star Ted Danson, the inconsistency was given the retroactive explanation that Frasier was embarrassed about his father&#x27;s lowbrow attitudes and thus claimed his death. This is a frequent occurrence in sitcoms, where networks may agree to continue a show, but only if a certain character is emphasized, leading other minor characters to be written out of the show with no further mention of the character&#x27;s existence, while the emphasized character (usually a breakout character, as in the case of Frasier Crane) develops a more complete back story that ignores previous, more simplified backstories.

===Homeric nod===

A Homeric nod (sometimes heard as &#x27;Even Homer nods&#x27;) is a term for a continuity error that has its origins in Homeric epic. The proverbial phrase for it was coined by the Roman poet Horace in his &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;: &quot;et idem indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus&quot; (&quot;and yet I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer nods off&quot;).

There are numerous continuity errors in Homer that can be described as &quot;nods&quot;, as for example:

*In &quot;Iliad&quot;, Menelaos kills a minor character, Pylaimenes, in combat. Pylaimenes is later still alive to witness the death of his son.
*In &quot;Iliad&quot; 9.165-93 three characters, Phoinix, Odysseus, and Aias set out on an embassy to Achilleus; however, at line 182 the poet uses a verb in the dual form to indicate that there are only two people going; at lines 185ff. verbs in the plural form are used, indicating more than two; but another dual verb appears at line 192 (&quot;the two of them came forward&quot;).

In modern Homeric scholarship, many of Homer&#x27;s &quot;nods&quot; are explicable as the consequences of the poem being retold and improvised by generations of oral poets. In the second case cited above, it is likely that two different versions are being conflated: one version with an embassy of three people, another with just two people. 
Alexander Pope was inclined to give Homeric nods the benefit of the doubt, saying in his &quot;Essay on Criticism&quot; that &quot;Those oft are Stratagems which Errors seem, Nor is it Homer Nods, but We that Dream.&quot;

===Aging discrepancies===
The practice of accelerating the age of a television character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series and/or the real-world progression of time is popularly known as Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome, or SORAS. Children unseen on screen for a time might reappear portrayed by an actor several years older than the original. Usually coinciding with a recast, this rapid aging is typically done to open up the character to a wider range of storylines, and to attract younger viewers. A recent example of this occurring is in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot; series, in which Mordred is initially played by a young child in Season 4, yet suddenly grows up into his late teens in time for the start of Season 5, with the rest of the characters aging by only three years.

The reverse can also happen. On the television program &quot;Lost&quot;, the character of 10-year-old Walt Lloyd was played by 12-year-old actor Malcolm David Kelley. The first few seasons took place over the course of just a few months, but by that point, Lloyd looked much older than 10. In his remaining few appearances, special effects were used to make him look younger, or the scene took place years later.

===Deliberate continuity errors===
Sometimes a work of fiction may deliberately employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, in the Marx Brothers&#x27; classic film &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, at the climax of the film, the camera shows a shot of Groucho Marx speaking a line, followed by a cutaway shot of something else happening, followed by another shot of Groucho. Each time, Groucho&#x27;s hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a Napoleonic hat, a Prussian hat, etc.). The fictional Broadway play &quot;&quot; that first appeared in the miniseries &quot;Hawkeye&quot; (2021) depicts events that happened in the film &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012), and contains intentional plot inaccuracies such as the inclusion of Scott Lang / Ant-Man who did not appear in the film.

==Dealing with errors==
When continuity mistakes have been made, explanations are often proposed by either writers or fans to smooth over discrepancies. Fans sometimes make up explanations for such errors that may or may not be integrated into canon; this has come to be colloquially known as &quot;fanwanking&quot; (a term originally coined by the author Craig Hinton to describe excessive use of continuity). Often when fans do not agree with one of the events in a story (such as the death of a favorite character), they will choose to ignore the event in question so that their enjoyment of the franchise is not diminished. When the holder of the intellectual property discards all existing continuity and starts from scratch, it is known as rebooting. Fans call a less extreme literary technique that erases one episode the reset button. See also fanon.

A conflict with previously established facts is sometimes deliberate; this is a &quot;retcon&quot;, as it is a &quot;retro&quot;active change in &quot;con&quot;tinuity. Retcons sometimes clarify ambiguities or correct perceived errors. This is not to be confused with the continuance of a reality (continuality).

== Ageless characters ==
Some fiction ignores continuity to allow characters to slow or stop the aging process, despite real-world markers like major social or technological changes. In comics this is sometimes referred to as a &quot;floating timeline&quot;, where the fiction takes place in a &quot;continuous present&quot;. Roz Kaveney suggests that comic books use this technique to satisfy &quot;the commercial need to keep certain characters going forever&quot;. This is also due to the fact that the authors have no need to accommodate the aging of their characters, which is also typical of most animated television shows. Kevin Wanner compares the use of a sliding timescale in comics to the way ageless figures in myths are depicted interacting with the contemporary world of the storyteller. When certain stories in comics, especially origin stories, are rewritten, they often retain key events but are updated to a contemporary time, such as with the comic book character Tony Stark, who invents his Iron Man armor in a different war depending on when the story is told.

<doc id="5902" wikidata="Q8454" url="?curid=5902" title="Capital punishment">
<text>Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty and formerly called judicial homicide, is the state-sanctioned killing of a person as punishment for actual or supposed misconduct. The sentence ordering that an offender be punished in such a manner is known as a death sentence, and the act of carrying out the sentence is known as an execution. A prisoner who has been sentenced to death and awaits execution is &quot;condemned&quot; and is commonly referred to as being &quot;on death row&quot;. Etymologically, the term &quot;capital&quot; (, derived via the Latin &#x27; from&#x27;, &quot;head&quot;) refers to execution by beheading, but executions are carried out by many methods, including hanging, shooting, lethal injection, stoning, electrocution, and gassing.

Crimes that are punishable by death are known as &quot;capital crimes&quot;, &quot;capital offences&quot;, or &quot;capital felonies&quot;, and vary depending on the jurisdiction, but commonly include serious crimes against a person, such as murder, assassination, mass murder, child murder, aggravated rape, terrorism, aircraft hijacking, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, along with crimes against the state such as attempting to overthrow government, treason, espionage, sedition, and piracy. Also, in some cases, acts of recidivism, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping, in addition to drug trafficking, drug dealing, and drug possession, are capital crimes or enhancements. However, states have also imposed punitive executions, for an expansive range of conduct, for political or religious beliefs and practices, for a status beyond one&#x27;s control, or without employing any significant due process procedures. Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of an innocent person by means of capital punishment. For example, the executions following the show trials in the Soviet Union during the Great Purge of 1936–1938 were an instrument of political repression.

The top three countries by the number of executions are China, Iran and Saudi Arabia. As of 2021, 56 countries retain capital punishment, 111 countries have completely abolished it &quot;de jure&quot; for all crimes, 7 have abolished it for ordinary crimes (while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes), and 24 are abolitionist in practice. Although the majority of countries have abolished capital punishment, over half of the world&#x27;s population live in countries where the death penalty is retained, including India, China, the U.S., Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Japan, Vietnam, Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia and DR Congo. As of 2023, only 2 out of 38 OECD member countries (the United States and Japan) allow capital punishment.

Capital punishment is controversial, with many people, organisations, and religious groups holding differing views on whether it is ethically permissible. Amnesty International declares that the death penalty breaches human rights, specifically &quot;the right to life and the right to live free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&quot; These rights are protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948. In the European Union (EU), Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits the use of capital punishment. The Council of Europe, which has 46 member states, has worked to end the death penalty and no execution has taken place in its current member states since 1997. The United Nations General Assembly has adopted, throughout the years from 2007 to 2020, eight non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with support for eventual abolition.

==History==

Execution of criminals and dissidents has been used by nearly all societies since the beginning of civilisations on Earth. Until the nineteenth century, without developed prison systems, there was frequently no workable alternative to ensure deterrence and incapacitation of criminals. In pre-modern times the executions themselves often involved torture with painful methods, such as the breaking wheel, keelhauling, sawing, hanging, drawing and quartering, burning at the stake, crucifixion, flaying, slow slicing, boiling alive, impalement, mazzatello, blowing from a gun, schwedentrunk, and scaphism. Other methods which appear only in legend include the blood eagle and brazen bull.

The use of formal execution extends to the beginning of recorded history. Most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system. Communal punishments for wrongdoing generally included blood money compensation by the wrongdoer, corporal punishment, shunning, banishment and execution. In tribal societies, compensation and shunning were often considered enough as a form of justice. The response to crimes committed by neighbouring tribes, clans or communities included a formal apology, compensation, blood feuds, and tribal warfare.

A blood feud or vendetta occurs when arbitration between families or tribes fails, or an arbitration system is non-existent. This form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organized religion. It may result from crime, land disputes or a code of honour. &quot;Acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies (as well as potential allies) that injury to property, rights, or the person will not go unpunished.&quot;

In most countries that practice capital punishment, it is now reserved for murder, terrorism, war crimes, espionage, treason, or as part of military justice. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as rape, fornication, adultery, incest, sodomy, and bestiality carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as Hudud, Zina, and Qisas crimes, such as apostasy (formal renunciation of the state religion), blasphemy, moharebeh, hirabah, Fasad, Mofsed-e-filarz and witchcraft. In many countries that use the death penalty, drug trafficking and often drug possession is also a capital offence. In China, human trafficking and serious cases of corruption and financial crimes are punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world, courts-martial have imposed death sentences for offences such as cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and mutiny.

===Ancient history===

Elaborations of tribal arbitration of feuds included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system. Compensation was based on the principle of &quot;substitution&quot; which might include material (for example, cattle, slaves, land) compensation, exchange of brides or grooms, or payment of the blood debt. Settlement rules could allow for animal blood to replace human blood, or transfers of property or blood money or in some case an offer of a person for execution. The person offered for execution did not have to be an original perpetrator of the crime because the social system was based on tribes and clans, not individuals. Blood feuds could be regulated at meetings, such as the Norsemen &quot;things&quot;. Systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts (for example, trial by combat or blood money). One of the more modern refinements of the blood feud is the duel.
In certain parts of the world, nations in the form of ancient republics, monarchies or tribal oligarchies emerged. These nations were often united by common linguistic, religious or family ties. Moreover, expansion of these nations often occurred by conquest of neighbouring tribes or nations. Consequently, various classes of royalty, nobility, various commoners and slaves emerged. Accordingly, the systems of tribal arbitration were submerged into a more unified system of justice which formalized the relation between the different &quot;social classes&quot; rather than &quot;tribes&quot;. The earliest and most famous example is Code of Hammurabi which set the different punishment and compensation, according to the different class or group of victims and perpetrators. The Torah/Old Testament lays down the death penalty for murder, kidnapping, practicing magic, violation of the Sabbath, blasphemy, and a wide range of sexual crimes, although evidence suggests that actual executions were exceedingly rare, if they occurred at all.

A Peshotanu was a condemned person Ancient Persia. 

A further example comes from Ancient Greece, where the Athenian legal system replacing customary oral law was first written down by Draco in about 621 BC: the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though Solon later repealed Draco&#x27;s code and published new laws, retaining capital punishment only for intentional homicide, and only with victim&#x27;s family permission. The word derives from Draco&#x27;s laws. The Romans also used the death penalty for a wide range of offences.

===Ancient Greece===

Protagoras (whose thought is reported by Plato) criticised the principle of revenge, because once the damage is done it cannot be cancelled by any action. So, if the death penalty is to be imposed by society, it is only to protect the latter against the criminal or for a dissuasive purpose. &quot;The only right that Protagoras knows is therefore human right, which, established and sanctioned by a sovereign collectivity, identifies itself with positive or the law in force of the city. In fact, it finds its guarantee in the death penalty which threatens all those who do not respect it.&quot;

Plato saw the death penalty as a means of purification, because crimes are a &quot;defilement&quot;. Thus, in the Laws, he considered necessary the execution of the animal or the destruction of the object which caused the death of a man by accident. For the murderers, he considered that the act of homicide is not natural and is not fully consented by the criminal. Homicide is thus a disease of the soul, which must be reeducated as much as possible, and, as a last resort, sentence to death if no rehabilitation is possible.

According to Aristotle, for whom free will is proper to man, a person is responsible for their actions. If there was a crime, a judge must define the penalty allowing the crime to be annulled by compensating it. This is how pecuniary compensation appeared for criminals the least recalcitrant and whose rehabilitation is deemed possible. However, for others, he argued, the death penalty is necessary.

This philosophy aims on the one hand to protect society and on the other hand to compensate to cancel the consequences of the crime committed. It inspired Western criminal law until the 17th century, a time when the first reflections on the abolition of the death penalty appeared.

===Ancient Rome===
The Twelve Tables, the body of laws handed down from archaic Rome, prescribe the death penalty for a variety of crimes including libel, arson and theft. During the Late Republic, there was consensus among the public and legislators to reduce the incidence of capital punishment. This opinion led to voluntary exile being prescribed in place of the death penalty, whereby a convict could either choose to leave in exile or face execution.

A historic debate, followed by a vote, took place in the Roman Senate to decide the fate of Catiline&#x27;s allies when he attempted to seize power in December, 63 BC. Cicero, then Roman consul, argued in support of the killing of conspirators without judgment by decision of the Senate (Senatus consultum ultimum) and was supported by the majority of senators; among the minority voices opposed to the execution, the most notable was Julius Caesar. The custom was different for foreigners who did not hold rights as Roman citizens, and especially for slaves, who were transferrable property.

Crucifixion was a form of punishment first employed by the Romans against slaves who rebelled, and throughout the Republican era was reserved for slaves, bandits, and traitors. Intended to be a punishment, a humiliation, and a deterrent, the condemned could take up to a few days to die. Corpses of the crucified were typically left on the crosses to decompose and to be eaten by animals.

===China===
There was a time in the Tang dynasty (618–907) when the death penalty was abolished. This was in the year 747, enacted by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712–756). When abolishing the death penalty, Xuanzong ordered his officials to refer to the nearest regulation by analogy when sentencing those found guilty of crimes for which the prescribed punishment was execution. Thus, depending on the severity of the crime a punishment of severe scourging with the thick rod or of exile to the remote Lingnan region might take the place of capital punishment. However, the death penalty was restored only 12 years later in 759 in response to the An Lushan Rebellion. At this time in the Tang dynasty only the emperor had the authority to sentence criminals to execution. Under Xuanzong capital punishment was relatively infrequent, with only 24 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.

The two most common forms of execution in the Tang dynasty were strangulation and decapitation, which were the prescribed methods of execution for 144 and 89 offences respectively. Strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against one&#x27;s parents or grandparents with a magistrate, scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb. Decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition. Despite the great discomfort involved, most of the Tang Chinese preferred strangulation to decapitation, as a result of the traditional Tang Chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is, therefore, disrespectful to one&#x27;s ancestors to die without returning one&#x27;s body to the grave intact.

Some further forms of capital punishment were practiced in the Tang dynasty, of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal. The first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod which was common throughout the Tang dynasty especially in cases of gross corruption. The second was truncation, in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death. A further form of execution called Ling Chi (slow slicing), or death by/of a thousand cuts, was used from the close of the Tang dynasty (around 900) to its abolition in 907.

When a minister of the fifth grade or above received a death sentence the emperor might grant him a special dispensation allowing him to commit suicide in lieu of execution. Even when this privilege was not granted, the law required that the condemned minister be provided with food and ale by his keepers and transported to the execution ground in a cart rather than having to walk there.

Nearly all executions under the Tang dynasty took place in public as a warning to the population. The heads of the executed were displayed on poles or spears. When local authorities decapitated a convicted criminal, the head was boxed and sent to the capital as proof of identity and that the execution had taken place.

===Middle Ages===

In medieval and early modern Europe, before the development of modern prison systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalised form of punishment for even minor offences.

In early modern Europe, a mass panic regarding witchcraft swept across Europe and later the European colonies in North America. During this period, there were widespread claims that malevolent Satanic witches were operating as an organised threat to Christendom. As a result, tens of thousands of women were prosecuted for witchcraft and executed through the witch trials of the early modern period (between the 15th and 18th centuries).
The death penalty also targeted sexual offences such as sodomy. In the early history of Islam (7th–11th centuries), there is a number of &quot;purported (but mutually inconsistent) reports&quot; (&quot;athar&quot;) regarding the punishments of sodomy ordered by some of the early caliphs. Abu Bakr, the first caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, apparently recommended toppling a wall on the culprit, or else burning him alive, while Ali ibn Abi Talib is said to have ordered death by stoning for one sodomite and had another thrown head-first from the top of the highest building in the town; according to Ibn Abbas, the latter punishment must be followed by stoning. Other medieval Muslim leaders, such as the Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad (most notably al-Mu&#x27;tadid), were often cruel in their punishments. In early modern England, the Buggery Act 1533 stipulated hanging as punishment for &quot;buggery&quot;. James Pratt and John Smith were the last two Englishmen to be executed for sodomy in 1835. In 1636 the laws of Puritan governed Plymouth Colony included a sentence of death for sodomy and buggery. The Massachusetts Bay Colony followed in 1641. Throughout the 19th century, U.S. states repealed death sentences from their sodomy laws, with South Carolina being the last to do so in 1873.

Historians recognise that during the Early Middle Ages, the Christian populations living in the lands invaded by the Arab Muslim armies between the 7th and 10th centuries suffered religious discrimination, religious persecution, religious violence, and martyrdom multiple times at the hands of Arab Muslim officials and rulers. As People of the Book, Christians under Muslim rule were subjected to &quot;dhimmi&quot; status (along with Jews, Samaritans, Gnostics, Mandeans, and Zoroastrians), which was inferior to the status of Muslims. Christians and other religious minorities thus faced religious discrimination and religious persecution in that they were banned from proselytising (for Christians, it was forbidden to evangelise or spread Christianity) in the lands invaded by the Arab Muslims on pain of death, they were banned from bearing arms, undertaking certain professions, and were obligated to dress differently in order to distinguish themselves from Arabs. Under &quot;sharia&quot;, Non-Muslims were obligated to pay &quot;jizya&quot; and &quot;kharaj&quot; taxes, together with periodic heavy ransom levied upon Christian communities by Muslim rulers in order to fund military campaigns, all of which contributed a significant proportion of income to the Islamic states while conversely reducing many Christians to poverty, and these financial and social hardships forced many Christians to convert to Islam. Christians unable to pay these taxes were forced to surrender their children to the Muslim rulers as payment who would sell them as slaves to Muslim households where they were forced to convert to Islam. Many Christian martyrs were executed under the Islamic death penalty for defending their Christian faith through dramatic acts of resistance such as refusing to convert to Islam, repudiation of the Islamic religion and subsequent reconversion to Christianity, and blasphemy towards Muslim beliefs.

Despite the wide use of the death penalty, calls for reform were not unknown. The 12th-century Jewish legal scholar Moses Maimonides wrote: &quot;It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death.&quot; He argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely &quot;according to the judge&#x27;s caprice&quot;. Maimonides&#x27;s concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.

===Enlightenment philosophy===
While during the Middle Ages the expiatory aspect of the death penalty was taken into account, this is no longer the case under the Lumières. These define the place of man within society no longer according to a divine rule, but as a contract established at birth between the citizen and the society, it is the social contract. From that moment on, capital punishment should be seen as useful to society through its dissuasive effect, but also as a means of protection of the latter vis-à-vis criminals.

===Modern era===

In the last several centuries, with the emergence of modern nation states, justice came to be increasingly associated with the concept of natural and legal rights. The period saw an increase in standing police forces and permanent penitential institutions. Rational choice theory, a utilitarian approach to criminology which justifies punishment as a form of deterrence as opposed to retribution, can be traced back to Cesare Beccaria, whose influential treatise &quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot; (1764) was the first detailed analysis of capital punishment to demand the abolition of the death penalty. In England, Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), the founder of modern utilitarianism, called for the abolition of the death penalty. Beccaria, and later Charles Dickens and Karl Marx noted the incidence of increased violent criminality at the times and places of executions. Official recognition of this phenomenon led to executions being carried out inside prisons, away from public view.

In England in the 18th century, when there was no police force, Parliament drastically increased the number of capital offences to more than 200. These were mainly property offences, for example cutting down a cherry tree in an orchard. In 1820, there were 160, including crimes such as shoplifting, petty theft or stealing cattle. The severity of the so-called Bloody Code was often tempered by juries who refused to convict, or judges, in the case of petty theft, who arbitrarily set the value stolen at below the statutory level for a capital crime.

===20th century===

In Nazi Germany, there were three types of capital punishment; hanging, decapitation, and death by shooting. Also, modern military organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military discipline. In the past, cowardice, absence without leave, desertion, insubordination, shirking under enemy fire and disobeying orders were often crimes punishable by death (see decimation and running the gauntlet). One method of execution, since firearms came into common use, has also been firing squad, although some countries use execution with a single shot to the head or neck.
Various authoritarian states employed the death penalty as a potent means of political oppression. Anti-Soviet author Robert Conquest claimed that more than one million Soviet citizens were executed during the Great Purge of 1936 to 1938, almost all by a bullet to the back of the head. Mao Zedong publicly stated that &quot;800,000&quot; people had been executed in China during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). Partly as a response to such excesses, civil rights organisations started to place increasing emphasis on the concept of human rights and an abolition of the death penalty.

===Contemporary era===
By continent, all European countries but one have abolished capital punishment; many Oceanian countries have abolished it; most countries in the Americas have abolished its use, while a few actively retain it; less than half of countries in Africa retain it; and the majority of countries in Asia retain it, for example, China, Japan and India.

Abolition was often adopted due to political change, as when countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy, or when it became an entry condition for the EU. The United States is a notable exception: some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades, the earliest being Michigan, where it was abolished in 1846, while other states still actively use it today. The death penalty in the United States remains a contentious issue which is hotly debated.

In retentionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived when a miscarriage of justice has occurred though this tends to cause legislative efforts to improve the judicial process rather than to abolish the death penalty. In abolitionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived by particularly brutal murders, though few countries have brought it back after abolishing it. However, a spike in serious, violent crimes, such as murders or terrorist attacks, has prompted some countries to effectively end the moratorium on the death penalty. One notable example is Pakistan which in December 2014 lifted a six-year moratorium on executions after the Peshawar school massacre during which 132 students and 9 members of staff of the Army Public School and Degree College Peshawar were killed by Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan terrorists, a group distinct from the Afghan Taliban, who condemned the attack.
Since then, Pakistan has executed over 400 convicts.

In 2017, two major countries, Turkey and the Philippines, saw their executives making moves to reinstate the death penalty. In the same year, passage of the law in the Philippines failed to obtain the Senate&#x27;s approval.

On 29 December 2021, after a 20-year moratorium, the Kazakhstan government enacted the &#x27;On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the Abolition of the Death Penalty&#x27; signed by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as part of series of Omnibus reformations of the Kazak legal system &#x27;Listening State&#x27; initiative.

==History of abolition==
In 724 AD in Japan, the death penalty was banned during the reign of Emperor Shōmu but the abolition only lasted a few years. In 818, Emperor Saga abolished the death penalty under the influence of Shinto and it lasted until 1156. In China, the death penalty was banned by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang in 747, replacing it with exile or scourging. However, the ban only lasted 12 years. Following his conversion to Christianity in 988, Vladimir the Great abolished the death penalty in Kievan Rus&#x27;, along with torture and mutilation; corporal punishment was also seldom used.

In England, a public statement of opposition was included in The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards, written in 1395.
In the post-classical Republic of Poljica, life was ensured as a basic right in its Poljica Statute of 1440.
Sir Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;, published in 1516, debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion. More was himself executed for treason in 1535.
More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian Cesare Beccaria &quot;Dei Delitti e Delle Pene&quot; (&quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot;), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility from the point of view of social welfare, of torture and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, Grand Duke Leopold II of Habsburg, the future emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the first abolition in modern times. On 30 November 1786, after having &quot;de facto&quot; blocked executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the penal code that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000, Tuscany&#x27;s regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating Cities for Life Day. Leopolds brother Joseph, the then emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, abolished in his immediate lands in 1787 capital punishment, which though only lasted until 1795, after both had died and Leopolds son Francis abolished it in his immediate lands. In Tuscany it was reintroduced in 1790 after Leopolds departure becoming emperor. Only after 1831 capital punishment was again at times stopped, though it took until 2007 to abolish capital punishment in Italy completely.

The Kingdom of Tahiti (when the island was independent) was the first legislative assembly in the world to abolish the death penalty in 1824. Tahiti commuted the death penalty to banishment.

In the United States, Michigan was the first state to ban the death penalty, on 18 May 1846.

The short-lived revolutionary Roman Republic banned capital punishment in 1849. Venezuela followed suit and abolished the death penalty in 1863 and San Marino did so in 1865. The last execution in San Marino had taken place in 1468. In Portugal, after legislative proposals in 1852 and 1863, the death penalty was abolished in 1867. The last execution in Brazil was 1876; from then on all the condemnations were commuted by the Emperor Pedro II until its abolition for civil offences and military offences in peacetime in 1891. The penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated and abolished again twice (1938–1953 and 1969–1978), but on those occasions it was restricted to acts of terrorism or subversion considered &quot;internal warfare&quot; and all sentences were commuted and not carried out.

Many countries have abolished capital punishment either in law or in practice. Since World War II, there has been a trend toward abolishing capital punishment. Capital punishment has been completely abolished by 108 countries, a further seven have done so for all offences except under special circumstances and 26 more have abolished it in practice because they have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice against carrying out executions.

In the United States between 1972 and 1976 the death penalty was declared unconstitutional based on the &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; case, but the 1976 &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; case once again permitted the death penalty under certain circumstances. Further limitations were placed on the death penalty in &quot;Atkins v. Virginia&quot; (2002; death penalty unconstitutional for people with an intellectual disability) and &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; (2005; death penalty unconstitutional if defendant was under age 18 at the time the crime was committed). In the United States, 23 of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. ban capital punishment.

In the United Kingdom, it was abolished for murder (leaving only treason, piracy with violence, arson in royal dockyards and a number of wartime military offences as capital crimes) for a five-year experiment in 1965 and permanently in 1969, the last execution having taken place in 1964. It was abolished for all offences in 1998. Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights, first entering into force in 2003, prohibits the death penalty in all circumstances for those states that are party to it, including the United Kingdom from 2004.

Abolition occurred in Canada in 1976 (except for some military offences, with complete abolition in 1998); in France in 1981; and in Australia in 1973 (although the state of Western Australia retained the penalty until 1984). In South Australia, under the premiership of then-Premier Dunstan, the &quot;Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935&quot; (SA) was modified so that the death sentence was changed to life imprisonment in 1976.

In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly affirmed in a formal resolution that throughout the world, it is desirable to &quot;progressively restrict the number of offences for which the death penalty might be imposed, with a view to the desirability of abolishing this punishment&quot;.

==Contemporary use==
===By country===

Most nations, including almost all developed countries, have abolished capital punishment either in law or in practice; notable exceptions are the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore. Additionally, capital punishment is also carried out in China, India, and most Islamic states.

Since World War II, there has been a trend toward abolishing the death penalty. 54 countries retain the death penalty in active use, 112 countries have abolished capital punishment altogether, 7 have done so for all offences except under special circumstances, and 22 more have abolished it in practice because they have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice against carrying out executions.

According to Amnesty International, 20 countries are known to have performed executions in 2022. There are countries which do not publish information on the use of capital punishment, most significantly China and North Korea. According to Amnesty International, around 1,000 prisoners were executed in 2017. Amnesty reported in 2004 and 2009 that Singapore and Iraq respectively had the world&#x27;s highest per capita execution rate. According to Al Jazeera and UN Special Rapporteur Ahmed Shaheed, Iran has had the world&#x27;s highest per capita execution rate. A 2012 EU report from the Directorate-General for External Relations&#x27; policy department pointed to Gaza as having the highest per capita execution rate in the MENA region.

The use of the death penalty is becoming increasingly restrained in some retentionist countries including Taiwan and Singapore. Indonesia carried out no executions between November 2008 and March 2013. Singapore, Japan and the United States are the only developed countries that are classified by Amnesty International as &#x27;retentionist&#x27; (South Korea is classified as &#x27;abolitionist in practice&#x27;). Nearly all retentionist countries are situated in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. The only retentionist country in Europe is Belarus and in March 2023 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko signed a law which allows to use capital punishment against officials and soldiers convicted of high treason. During the 1980s, the democratisation of Latin America swelled the ranks of abolitionist countries.

This was soon followed by the overthrow of the socialist states in Europe. Many of these countries aspired to enter the EU, which strictly requires member states not to practice the death penalty, as does the Council of Europe (see Capital punishment in Europe). Public support for the death penalty in the EU varies. The last execution in a member state of the present-day Council of Europe took place in 1997 in Ukraine. In contrast, the rapid industrialisation in Asia has seen an increase in the number of developed countries which are also retentionist. In these countries, the death penalty retains strong public support, and the matter receives little attention from the government or the media; in China there is a small but significant and growing movement to abolish the death penalty altogether. This trend has been followed by some African and Middle Eastern countries where support for the death penalty remains high.

Some countries have resumed practising the death penalty after having previously suspended the practice for long periods. The United States suspended executions in 1972 but resumed them in 1976; there was no execution in India between 1995 and 2004; and Sri Lanka declared an end to its moratorium on the death penalty on 20 November 2004, although it has not yet performed any further executions. The Philippines re-introduced the death penalty in 1993 after abolishing it in 1987, but again abolished it in 2006.

The United States and Japan are the only developed countries to have recently carried out executions. The U.S. federal government, the U.S. military, and 27 states have a valid death penalty statute, and over 1,400 executions have been carried in the United States since it reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Japan has 106 inmates with finalized death sentences , after Chisako Kakehi, who was the 78-year-old death row inmate convicted of murdering her husband and common-law spouses to inherit their assets, has died while in custody.

The most recent country to abolish the death penalty was Kazakhstan on 2 January 2021 after a moratorium dating back 2 decades.

According to an Amnesty International report released in April 2020, Egypt ranked regionally third and globally fifth among the countries that carried out most executions in 2019. The country increasingly ignored international human rights concerns and criticism. In March 2021, Egypt executed 11 prisoners in a jail, who were convicted in cases of &quot;murder, theft, and shooting&quot;.

According to Amnesty International&#x27;s 2021 report, at least 483 people were executed in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The figure excluded the countries that classify death penalty data as state secret. The top five executioners for 2020 were China, Iran, Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.

===Modern-day public opinion===
The public opinion on the death penalty varies considerably by country and by the crime in question. Countries where a majority of people are against execution include Norway, where only 25% support it. Most French, Finns, and Italians also oppose the death penalty. In 2020, 55% of Americans supported the death penalty for an individual convicted of murder, down from 60% in 2016, 64% in 2010, 65% in 2006, and 68% in 2001. In 2020, 43% of Italians expressed support for the death penalty.

In Taiwan, polls and research have consistently shown strong support for the death penalty at 80%. This includes a survey conducted by the National Development Council of Taiwan in 2016, showing that 88% of Taiwanese people disagree with abolishing the death penalty. Its continuation of the practice drew criticism from local rights groups.

The support and sentencing of capital punishment has been growing in India in the 2010s due to anger over several recent brutal cases of rape, even though actual executions are comparatively rare. While support for the death penalty for murder is still high in China, executions have dropped precipitously, with 3,000 executed in 2012 versus 12,000 in 2002. A poll in South Africa, where capital punishment is abolished, found that 76% of millennial South Africans support re-introduction of the death penalty due to increasing incidents of rape and murder.
A 2017 poll found younger Mexicans are more likely to support capital punishment than older ones. 57% of Brazilians support the death penalty. The age group that shows the greatest support for execution of those condemned is the 25 to 34-year-old category, in which 61% say they support it.

A 2023 poll by Research Co. found that 54% of Canadians support reinstating the death penalty for murder in their country. In April 2021 a poll found that 54% of Britons said they would support reinstating the death penalty for those convicted of terrorism in the UK, while 23% of respondents said they would be opposed. In 2020, an Ipsos/Sopra Steria survey showed that 55% of the French people support re-introduction of the death penalty; this was an increase from 44% in 2019.

The death penalty for juvenile offenders (criminals aged under 18 years at the time of their crime although the legal or accepted definition of &quot;juvenile offender&quot; may vary from one jurisdiction to another) has become increasingly rare. Considering the age of majority is not 18 in some countries or has not been clearly defined in law, since 1990 ten countries have executed offenders who were considered juveniles at the time of their crimes: China, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United States, and Yemen. China, Pakistan, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen have since raised the minimum age to 18. Amnesty International has recorded 61 verified executions since then, in several countries, of both juveniles and adults who had been convicted of committing their offences as juveniles. China does not allow for the execution of those under 18, but child executions have reportedly taken place.
One of the youngest children ever to be executed was the infant son of Perotine Massey on or around 18 July 1556. His mother was one of the Guernsey Martyrs who was executed for heresy, and his father had previously fled the island. At less than one day old, he was ordered to be burned by Bailiff Hellier Gosselin, with the advice of priests nearby who said the boy should burn due to having inherited moral stain from his mother, who had given birth during her execution.

Since 1642 in Colonial America and in the United States, an estimated 365 juvenile offenders were executed by various colonial authorities and (after the American Revolution) the federal government. The U.S. Supreme Court abolished capital punishment for offenders under the age of 16 in &quot;Thompson v. Oklahoma&quot; (1988), and for all juveniles in &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; (2005).

In Prussia, children under the age of 14 were exempted from the death penalty in 1794. Capital punishment was cancelled by the Electorate of Bavaria in 1751 for children under the age of 11 and by the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1813 for children and youth under 16 years. In Prussia, the exemption was extended to youth under the age of 16 in 1851. For the first time, all juveniles were excluded for the death penalty by the North German Confederation in 1871, which was continued by the German Empire in 1872. In Nazi Germany, capital punishment was reinstated for juveniles between 16 and 17 years in 1939. This was broadened to children and youth from age 12 to 17 in 1943. The death penalty for juveniles was abolished by West Germany, also generally, in 1949 and by East Germany in 1952.

In the Hereditary Lands, Austrian Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia within the Habsburg monarchy, capital punishment for children under the age of 11 was no longer foreseen by 1770. The death penalty was, also for juveniles, nearly abolished in 1787 except for emergency or military law, which is unclear in regard of those. It was reintroduced for juveniles above 14 years by 1803, and was raised by general criminal law to 20 years in 1852 and this exemption and the alike one of military law in 1855, which may have been up to 14 years in wartime, were also introduced into all of the Austrian Empire.

In the Helvetic Republic, the death penalty for children and youth under the age of 16 was abolished in 1799 yet the country was already dissolved in 1803 whereas the law could remain in force if it was not replaced on cantonal level. In the canton of Bern, all juveniles were exempted from the death penalty at least in 1866. In Fribourg, capital punishment was generally, including for juveniles, abolished by 1849. In Ticino, it was abolished for youth and young adults under the age of 20 in 1816. In Zurich, the exclusion from the death penalty was extended for juveniles and young adults up to 19 years of age by 1835. In 1942, the death penalty was almost deleted in criminal law, as well for juveniles, but since 1928 persisted in military law during wartime for youth above 14 years. If no earlier change was made in the given subject, by 1979 juveniles could no longer be subject to the death penalty in military law during wartime.

Between 2005 and May 2008, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen were reported to have executed child offenders, the largest number occurring in Iran.

During Hassan Rouhani&#x27;s tenure as president of Iran from 2013 until 2021, at least 3,602 death sentences have been carried out. This includes the executions of 34 juvenile offenders.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which forbids capital punishment for juveniles under article 37(a), has been signed by all countries and subsequently ratified by all signatories with the exception of the United States (despite the US Supreme Court decisions abolishing the practice). The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. A majority of countries are also party to the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (whose Article 6.5 also states that &quot;Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age...&quot;).

Iran, despite its ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, was the world&#x27;s largest executioner of juvenile offenders, for which it has been the subject of broad international condemnation; the country&#x27;s record is the focus of the Stop Child Executions Campaign. But on 10 February 2012, Iran&#x27;s parliament changed controversial laws relating to the execution of juveniles. In the new legislation the age of 18 (solar year) would be applied to accused of both genders and juvenile offenders must be sentenced pursuant to a separate law specifically dealing with juveniles. Based on the Islamic law which now seems to have been revised, girls at the age of 9 and boys at 15 of lunar year (11 days shorter than a solar year) are deemed fully responsible for their crimes. Iran accounted for two-thirds of the global total of such executions, and currently has approximately 140 people considered as juveniles awaiting execution for crimes committed (up from 71 in 2007). The past executions of Mahmoud Asgari, Ayaz Marhoni and Makwan Moloudzadeh became the focus of Iran&#x27;s child capital punishment policy and the judicial system that hands down such sentences. In 2023 Iran executed a minor who had knifed a man that fought him for following a girl in the street.

Saudi Arabia also executes criminals who were minors at the time of the offence. In 2013, Saudi Arabia was the center of an international controversy after it executed Rizana Nafeek, a Sri Lankan domestic worker, who was believed to have been 17 years old at the time of the crime. Saudi Arabia banned execution for minors, except for terrorism cases, in April 2020.

Japan has not executed juvenile criminals after August 1997, when they executed Norio Nagayama, a spree killer who had been convicted of shooting four people dead in the late 1960s. Nagayama&#x27;s case created the eponymously named &quot;Nagayama standards&quot;, which take into account factors such as the number of victims, brutality and social impact of the crimes. The standards have been used in determining whether to apply the death sentence in murder cases. Teruhiko Seki, convicted of murdering four family members including a 4-year-old daughter and raping a 15-year-old daughter of a family in 1992, became the second inmate to be hanged for a crime committed as a minor in the first such execution in 20 years after Nagayama on 19 December 2017. Takayuki Otsuki, who was convicted of raping and strangling a 23-year-old woman and subsequently strangling her 11-month-old daughter to death on 14 April 1999, when he was 18, is another inmate sentenced to death, and his request for retrial has been rejected by the Supreme Court of Japan.

There is evidence that child executions are taking place in the parts of Somalia controlled by the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). In October 2008, a girl, Aisha Ibrahim Dhuhulow was buried up to her neck at a football stadium, then stoned to death in front of more than 1,000 people. Somalia&#x27;s established Transitional Federal Government announced in November 2009 (reiterated in 2013) that it plans to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This move was lauded by UNICEF as a welcome attempt to secure children&#x27;s rights in the country.

===Methods===
The following methods of execution have been used by various countries:
* Hanging (Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Nigeria, Sudan, Pakistan, Palestinian National Authority, Israel, Yemen, Egypt, India, Oman, Myanmar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Syria, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Liberia)
* Shooting (the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Republic of China, Vietnam (until 2011), Belarus, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia, Somaliland, North Korea, Indonesia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Yemen, and in the US states of Oklahoma and Utah).
* Lethal injection (United States, Guatemala, Thailand, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Vietnam (after 2011))
* Beheading (Saudi Arabia)
* Stoning (Nigeria, Sudan)
* Electrocution and gas inhalation (some U.S. states, but only if the prisoner requests it or if lethal injection is unavailable)
*Inert gas asphyxiation (Some U.S. states: Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama)

===Public execution===

A public execution is a form of capital punishment which &quot;members of the general public may voluntarily attend&quot;. This definition excludes the presence of a small number of witnesses randomly selected to assure executive accountability. While today the great majority of the world considers public executions to be distasteful and most countries have outlawed the practice, throughout much of history executions were performed publicly as a means for the state to demonstrate &quot;its power before those who fell under its jurisdiction be they criminals, enemies, or political opponents&quot;. Additionally, it afforded the public a chance to witness &quot;what was considered a great spectacle&quot;.

Social historians note that beginning in the 20th century in the U.S. and western Europe, death in general became increasingly shielded from public view, occurring more and more behind the closed doors of the hospital. Executions were likewise moved behind the walls of the penitentiary. The last formal public executions occurred in 1868 in Britain, in 1936 in the U.S. and in 1939 in France.

According to Amnesty International, in 2012, &quot;public executions were known to have been carried out in Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Somalia&quot;. There have been reports of public executions carried out by state and non-state actors in Hamas-controlled Gaza, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. Executions which can be classified as public were also carried out in the U.S. states of Florida and Utah .

==Capital crime==
===Atrocity crimes===
Atrocity crimes such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide are usually punishable by death in countries retaining capital punishment. Death sentences for such crimes were handed down and carried out during the Nuremberg Trials in 1946 and the Tokyo Trials in 1948, but starting in the 1990s, ad hoc tribunals such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) forbade the death penalty and can only impose life imprisonment as a maximum penalty. This tradition is carried on by the current International Criminal Court.

===Murder===
Intentional homicide is punishable by death in most countries retaining capital punishment, but generally provided it involves an aggravating factor required by statute or judicial precedents.

Some countries, including Singapore and Malaysia, made the death penalty mandatory for murder, though Singapore later changed its laws since 2013 to reserve the mandatory death sentence for intentional murder while providing an alternative sentence of life imprisonment with/without caning for murder with no intention to cause death, which allowed some convicted murderers on death row in Singapore (including Kho Jabing) to apply for the reduction of their death sentences after the courts in Singapore confirmed that they committed murder without the intention to kill, and are thus eligible for re-sentencing under the new death penalty laws in Singapore. In October 2018 the Malaysian Government imposed a moratorium on all executions until the passage of a new law that would abolish the death penalty. In April 2023, legislation abolishing the mandatory death penalty was passed in Malaysia. The death penalty would be retained, but courts have the discretion to replace it with other punishments, including whipping and imprisonment of 30–40 years.

===Drug trafficking===
In 2018, at least 35 countries retained the death penalty for drug trafficking, drug dealing, drug possession and related offences. People had been regularly sentenced to death and executed for drug-related offences in China, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Vietnam. Other countries may retain the death penalty for symbolic purposes.

The death penalty was mandated for drug trafficking in Singapore and Malaysia. Since 2013, Singapore ruled that those who were certified to have diminished responsibility (e.g. major depressive disorder) or acting as drug couriers and had assisted the authorities in tackling drug-related activities, would be sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death, with the offender liable to at least 15 strokes of the cane if he was not sentenced to death and was simultaneously sentenced to caning as well. Notably, drug couriers like Yong Vui Kong and Cheong Chun Yin successfully applied to have their death sentences replaced with life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane in 2013 and 2015 respectively.

In April 2023, legislation abolishing the mandatory death penalty was passed in Malaysia.

===Other offences===

Other crimes that are punishable by death in some countries include:
*Firearm offences (e.g. Arms Offences Act of Singapore)
*Terrorism
*Treason (a capital crime in most countries that retain capital punishment)
*Espionage 
*Crimes against the state, such as attempting to overthrow government (most countries with the death penalty)
*Political protests (Saudi Arabia) 
*Rape (China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Brunei, etc.)
*Economic crimes (China, Iran) 
*Human trafficking (China)
*Corruption (China, Iran)
*Kidnapping (China, Singapore, Bangladesh, the US states of Georgia and Idaho, etc.) 
*Separatism (China)
*Unlawful sexual behaviour (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, Brunei, Nigeria, etc.)
*Religious Hudud offences such as apostasy (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan etc.) 
*Blasphemy (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, certain states in Nigeria)
*Moharebeh (Iran)
*Drinking alcohol (Iran) 
*Witchcraft and sorcery (Saudi Arabia)
*Arson (Algeria, Tunisia, Mali, Mauritania, etc.)
*Hirabah; brigandage; armed or aggravated robbery (Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kenya, Zambia, Ethiopia, the US state of Georgia etc.)
*Homosexuality (Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Brunei, Uganda, Nigeria (Northern states), Mauritania, etc.) (Unclear for United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Iran, Libya, Somalia, etc.)

==Controversy and debate==

Death penalty opponents regard the death penalty as inhumane and criticize it for its irreversibility. They argue also that capital punishment lacks deterrent effect, or has a brutalization effect, discriminates against minorities and the poor, and that it encourages a &quot;culture of violence&quot;. There are many organizations worldwide, such as Amnesty International, and country-specific, such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), whose main purpose includes abolition of the death penalty.

Advocates of the death penalty argue that it deters crime, is a good tool for police and prosecutors in plea bargaining, makes sure that convicted criminals do not offend again, and that it ensures justice for crimes such as homicide, where other penalties will not inflict the desired retribution demanded by the crime itself. Capital punishment for non-lethal crimes is usually considerably more controversial, and abolished in many of the countries that retain it.

===Retribution===
Supporters of the death penalty argued that death penalty is morally justified when applied in murder especially with aggravating elements such as for murder of police officers, child murder, torture murder, multiple homicide and mass killing such as terrorism, massacre and genocide. This argument is strongly defended by New York Law School&#x27;s Professor Robert Blecker, who says that the punishment must be painful in proportion to the crime. Eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant defended a more extreme position, according to which every murderer deserves to die on the grounds that loss of life is incomparable to any penalty that allows them to remain alive, including life imprisonment.

Some abolitionists argue that retribution is simply revenge and cannot be condoned. Others while accepting retribution as an element of criminal justice nonetheless argue that life without parole is a sufficient substitute. It is also argued that the punishing of a killing with another death is a relatively unusual punishment for a violent act, because in general violent crimes are not punished by subjecting the perpetrator to a similar act (e.g. rapists are, typically, not punished by corporal punishment, although it may be inflicted in Singapore, for example).

===Human rights===
Abolitionists believe capital punishment is the worst violation of human rights, because the right to life is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a psychological torture. Human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it &quot;cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment&quot;. Amnesty International considers it to be &quot;the ultimate irreversible denial of Human Rights&quot;. Albert Camus wrote in a 1956 book called &quot;Reflections on the Guillotine, Resistance, Rebellion &amp; Death&quot;:

In the classic doctrine of natural rights as expounded by for instance Locke and Blackstone, on the other hand, it is an important idea that the right to life can be forfeited, as most other rights can be given due process is observed, such as the right to property and the right to freedom, including provisionally, in anticipation of an actual verdict. As John Stuart Mill explained in a speech given in Parliament against an amendment to abolish capital punishment for murder in 1868:

In one of the most recent cases relating to the death penalty in Singapore, activists like Jolovan Wham, Kirsten Han and Kokila Annamalai and even the international groups like the United Nations and European Union argued for Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, who has been on death row at Singapore&#x27;s Changi Prison since 2010, should not be executed due to an alleged intellectual disability, as they argued that Nagaenthran has low IQ of 69 and a psychiatrist has assessed him to be mentally impaired to an extent that he should not be held liable to his crime and execution. They also cited international law where a country should be prohibiting the execution of mentally and intellectually impaired people in order to push for Singapore to commute Nagaenthran&#x27;s death penalty to life imprisonment based on protection of human rights. However, the Singapore government and both Singapore&#x27;s High Court and Court of Appeal maintained their firm stance that despite his certified low IQ, it is confirmed that Nagaenthran is not mentally or intellectually disabled based on the joint opinion of three government psychiatrists as he is able to fully understand the magnitude of his actions and has no problem in his daily functioning of life. Despite the international outcry, Nagaenthran was executed on 27 April 2022.

===Non-painful execution===
Trends in most of the world have long been to move to private and less painful executions. France adopted the guillotine for this reason in the final years of the 18th century, while Britain banned hanging, drawing, and quartering in the early 19th century. Hanging by turning the victim off a ladder or by kicking a stool or a bucket, which causes death by strangulation, was replaced by long drop &quot;hanging&quot; where the subject is dropped a longer distance to dislocate the neck and sever the spinal cord. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar, Shah of Persia (1896–1907) introduced throat-cutting and blowing from a gun (close-range cannon fire) as quick and relatively painless alternatives to more torturous methods of executions used at that time. In the United States, electrocution and gas inhalation were introduced as more humane alternatives to hanging, but have been almost entirely superseded by lethal injection. A small number of countries, for example Iran and Saudi Arabia, still employ slow hanging methods, decapitation, and stoning.

A study of executions carried out in the United States between 1977 and 2001 indicated that at least 34 of the 749 executions, or 4.5%, involved &quot;unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner&quot;. The rate of these &quot;botched executions&quot; remained steady over the period of the study. A separate study published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2008 (&quot;Baze v. Rees&quot;) and again in 2015 (&quot;Glossip v. Gross&quot;) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In &quot;Bucklew v. Precythe&quot;, the majority verdict – written by Judge Neil Gorsuch – further affirmed this principle, stating that while the ban on cruel and unusual punishment affirmatively bans penalties that &quot;deliberately inflict&quot; pain and degradation, it does in no sense limit the possible infliction of pain in the execution of a capital verdict.

===Wrongful execution===

It is frequently argued that capital punishment leads to miscarriage of justice through the wrongful execution of innocent persons. Many people have been proclaimed innocent victims of the death penalty.

Some have claimed that as many as 39 executions have been carried out in the face of compelling evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt in the US from 1992 through 2004. Newly available DNA evidence prevented the pending execution of more than 15 death row inmates during the same period in the US, but DNA evidence is only available in a fraction of capital cases. , 159 prisoners on death row have been exonerated by DNA or other evidence, which is seen as an indication that innocent prisoners have almost certainly been executed. The National Coalition to
Abolish the Death Penalty claims that between 1976 and 2015, 1,414 prisoners in the United States have been executed while 156 sentenced to death have had their death sentences vacated. It is impossible to assess how many have been wrongly executed, since courts do not generally investigate the innocence of a dead defendant, and defense attorneys tend to concentrate their efforts on clients whose lives can still be saved; however, there is strong evidence of innocence in many cases.

Improper procedure may also result in unfair executions. For example, Amnesty International argues that in Singapore &quot;the Misuse of Drugs Act contains a series of presumptions which shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused. This conflicts with the universally guaranteed right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty&quot;. Singapore&#x27;s Misuse of Drugs Act presumes one is guilty of possession of drugs if, as examples, one is found to be present or escaping from a location &quot;proved or presumed to be used for the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug&quot;, if one is in possession of a key to a premises where drugs are present, if one is in the company of another person found to be in possession of illegal drugs, or if one tests positive after being given a mandatory urine drug screening. Urine drug screenings can be given at the discretion of police, without requiring a search warrant. The onus is on the accused in all of the above situations to prove that they were not in possession of or consumed illegal drugs.

===Volunteers===

Some prisoners have volunteered or attempted to expedite capital punishment, often by waiving all appeals. Prisoners have made requests or committed further crimes in prison as well. In the United States, execution volunteers constitute approximately 11% of prisoners on death row. Volunteers often bypass legal procedures which are designed to designate the death penalty for the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; offenders. Opponents of execution volunteering cited the prevalence of mental illness among volunteers comparing it to suicide. Execution volunteers have received considerably less attention and effort at legal reform than those who were exonerated after execution.

===Racial, ethnic, and social class bias===
Opponents of the death penalty argue that this punishment is being used more often against perpetrators from racial and ethnic minorities and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, than against those criminals who come from a privileged background; and that the background of the victim also influences the outcome. Researchers have shown that white Americans are more likely to support the death penalty when told that it is mostly applied to black Americans, and that more stereotypically black-looking or dark-skinned defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death if the case involves a white victim. However, a study published in 2018 failed to replicate the findings of earlier studies that had concluded that white Americans are more likely to support the death penalty if informed that it is largely applied to black Americans; according to the authors, their findings &quot;may result from changes since 2001 in the effects of racial stimuli on white attitudes about the death penalty or their willingness to express those attitudes in a survey context.&quot;

In Alabama in 2019, a death row inmate named Domineque Ray was denied his imam in the room during his execution, instead only offered a Christian chaplain. After filing a complaint, a federal court of appeals ruled 5–4 against Ray&#x27;s request. The majority cited the &quot;last-minute&quot; nature of the request, and the dissent stated that the treatment went against the core principle of denominational neutrality.

In July 2019, two Shiite men, Ali Hakim al-Arab, 25, and Ahmad al-Malali, 24, were executed in Bahrain, despite the protests from the United Nations and rights group. Amnesty International stated that the executions were being carried out on confessions of &quot;terrorism crimes&quot; that were obtained through torture.

On 30 March 2022, despite the appeals by the United Nations and rights activists, 68-year-old Malay Singaporean Abdul Kahar Othman was hanged at Singapore&#x27;s Changi Prison for illegally trafficking diamorphine, which marked the first execution in Singapore since 2019 as a result of an informal moratorium caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier, there were appeals made to advocate for Abdul Kahar&#x27;s death penalty be commuted to life imprisonment on humanitarian grounds, as Abdul Kahar came from a poor family and has struggled with drug addiction. He was also revealed to have been spending most of his life going in and out of prison, including a ten-year sentence of preventive detention from 1995 to 2005, and has not been given much time for rehabilitation, which made the activists and groups arguing that Abdul Kahar should be given a chance for rehabilitation instead of subjecting him to execution. Both the European Union (EU) and Amnesty International criticised Singapore for finalizing and carrying out Abdul Kahar&#x27;s execution, and about 400 Singaporeans protested against the government&#x27;s use of the death penalty merely days after Abdul Kahar&#x27;s death sentence was authorised. Still, over 80% of the public supported the use of the death penalty in Singapore.

===International views===
The United Nations introduced a resolution during the General Assembly&#x27;s 62nd sessions in 2007 calling for a universal ban. The approval of a draft resolution by the Assembly&#x27;s third committee, which deals with human rights issues, voted 99 to 52, with 33 abstentions, in support of the resolution on 15 November 2007 and was put to a vote in the Assembly on 18 December.

Again in 2008, a large majority of states from all regions adopted, on 20 November in the UN General Assembly (Third Committee), a second resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty; 105 countries voted in support of the draft resolution, 48 voted against and 31 abstained.

The moratorium resolution has been presented for a vote each year since 2007. On 15 December 2022, 125 countries voted in support of the moratorium, with 37 countries opposing, and 22 abstentions. The countries voting against the moratorium included the United States, People&#x27;s Republic of China, North Korea, and Iran.

A range of amendments proposed by a small minority of pro-death penalty countries were overwhelmingly defeated. It had in 2007 passed a non-binding resolution (by 104 to 54, with 29 abstentions) by asking its member states for &quot;a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty&quot;.
A number of regional conventions prohibit the death penalty, most notably, the Protocol 6 (abolition in time of peace) and Protocol 13 (abolition in all circumstances) to the European Convention on Human Rights. The same is also stated under Protocol 2 in the American Convention on Human Rights, which, however, has not been ratified by all countries in the Americas, most notably Canada and the United States. Most relevant operative international treaties do not require its prohibition for cases of serious crime, most notably, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This instead has, in common with several other treaties, an optional protocol prohibiting capital punishment and promoting its wider abolition.

Several international organizations have made abolition of the death penalty (during time of peace, or in all circumstances) a requirement of membership, most notably the EU and the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe are willing to accept a moratorium as an interim measure. Thus, while Russia was a member of the Council of Europe, and the death penalty remains codified in its law, it has not made use of it since becoming a member of the council – Russia has not executed anyone since 1996. With the exception of Russia (abolitionist in practice) and Belarus (retentionist), all European countries are classified as abolitionist.

Latvia abolished the death penalty for war crimes in 2012, becoming the last EU member to do so.

Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights calls for the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances (including for war crimes). The majority of European countries have signed and ratified it. Some European countries have not done this, but all of them except Belarus have now abolished the death penalty in all circumstances (, and Russia ). Armenia is the most recent country to ratify the protocol, on 19 October 2023.

Protocol 6, which prohibits the death penalty during peacetime, has been ratified by all members of the Council of Europe. It had been signed but not ratified by Russia at the time of its expulsion in 2022.
There are also other international abolitionist instruments, such as the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which has 90 parties; and the Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty (for the Americas; ratified by 13 states).

In Turkey, over 500 people were sentenced to death after the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état. About 50 of them were executed, the last one 25 October 1984. Then there was a &quot;de facto&quot; moratorium on the death penalty in Turkey. As a move towards EU membership, Turkey made some legal changes. The death penalty was removed from peacetime law by the National Assembly in August 2002, and in May 2004 Turkey amended its constitution to remove capital punishment in all circumstances. It ratified Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights in February 2006. As a result, Europe is a continent free of the death penalty in practice, all states, having ratified Protocol 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights, with the exceptions of Russia (which has entered a moratorium) and Belarus, which are not members of the Council of Europe. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has been lobbying for Council of Europe observer states who practice the death penalty, the U.S. and Japan, to abolish it or lose their observer status. In addition to banning capital punishment for EU member states, the EU has also banned detainee transfers in cases where the receiving party may seek the death penalty.

Sub-Saharan African countries that have recently abolished the death penalty include Burundi, which abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 2009, and Gabon which did the same in 2010. On 5 July 2012, Benin became part of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which prohibits the use of the death penalty.

The newly created South Sudan is among the 111 UN member states that supported the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly that called for the removal of the death penalty, therefore affirming its opposition to the practice. South Sudan, however, has not yet abolished the death penalty and stated that it must first amend its Constitution, and until that happens it will continue to use the death penalty.

Among non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are noted for their opposition to capital punishment. A number of such NGOs, as well as trade unions, local councils, and bar associations, formed a World Coalition Against the Death Penalty in 2002.

An open letter led by Danish Member of the European Parliament, Karen Melchior was sent to the European Commission ahead of the 26 January 2021 meeting of the Bahraini Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani with the members of the European Union for the signing of a Cooperation Agreement. A total of 16 MEPs undersigned the letter expressing their grave concern towards the extended abuse of human rights in Bahrain following the arbitrary arrest and detention of activists and critics of the government. The attendees of the meeting were requested to demand from their Bahraini counterparts to take into consideration the concerns raised by the MEPs, particularly for the release of Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja and Sheikh Mohammed Habib Al-Muqdad, the two European-Bahraini dual citizens on death row.

===Religious views===

The world&#x27;s major faiths have differing views depending on the religion, denomination, sect and the individual adherent. The Catholic Church considers the death penalty as &quot;inadmissible&quot; in any circumstance and denounces it as an &quot;attack&quot; on the &quot;inviolability and dignity of the person.&quot; Both the Baháʼí and Islamic faiths support capital punishment.

<doc id="5903" wikidata="Q2198855" url="?curid=5903" title="Cultural movement">
<text>A cultural movement is a shared effort by loosely affiliated individuals to change the way others in society think by disseminating ideas through various art forms and making intentional choices in daily life. By definition, cultural movements are intertwined with other phenomena such as social movements and political movements, and can be difficult to distinguish from broader cultural change or transformation.

Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in culture; but as world communications have accelerated, this geographical distinction has become less distinct. 

When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade.: These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. An obsession emerges among the mainstream with the new movement, and the old one falls into neglect – sometimes it dies out entirely, but often it chugs along favored in a few disciplines and occasionally making reappearances (sometimes prefixed with &quot;neo-&quot;).

There is continual argument over the precise definition of each of these periods as one historian might group them differently, or choose different names or descriptions. Even though in many cases the popular change from one to the next can be swift and sudden, the beginning and end of movements are somewhat subjective. This is because the movements did not spring out of the blue and into existence then come to an abrupt end and lose total support, as would be suggested by a date range. Thus use of the term &quot;period&quot; is somewhat deceptive. &quot;Period&quot; also suggests a linearity of development, whereas it has not been uncommon for two or more distinctive cultural approaches to be active at the same time. Historians will be able to find distinctive traces of a cultural movement before its accepted beginning, and there will always be new creations in old forms. So it can be more useful to think in terms of broad &quot;movements&quot; that have rough beginnings and endings. Yet for historical perspective, some rough date ranges will be provided for each to indicate the &quot;height&quot; or accepted time span of the movement.

This list covers Western, notably European and American cultural movements. They have, however, been paralleled by cultural movements in East Asia and elsewhere. In the late 20th and early 21st century in Thailand, for example, there has been a cultural shift away from Western social and political values and more toward Japanese and Chinese. As well, Thai culture has reinvigorated monarchical concepts to accommodate state shifts away from Western ideology regarding democracy and monarchies. 
==Cultural movements==
* Graeco-Roman
** The Greek culture marked a departure from the other Mediterranean cultures that preceded and surrounded it. The Romans adopted Greek and other styles, and spread the result throughout Western Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Together, Greek and Roman thought in philosophy, religion, science, history, and all forms of thought can be viewed as a central underpinning of Western culture, and is therefore termed the Classical Age by some. Others might divide it into the Hellenistic period and the Roman period, or might choose other finer divisions.
:: See: Classical architecture — Classical sculpture — Greek architecture — Hellenistic architecture — Ionic — Doric — Corinthian — Stoicism — Cynicism — Epicurean — Roman architecture — Early Christian — Neoplatonism
* Romanesque (11th century &amp; 12th centuries)
** A style (esp. architectural) similar in form and materials to Roman styles. Romanesque seems to be the first pan-European style since Roman Imperial Architecture and examples are found in every part of the continent.
:: See: Romanesque architecture — Ottonian Art
* Gothic (mid 12th century until mid 15th century)
:: See: Gothic architecture — Gregorian chant — Neoplatonism
* Nominalism

** Rejects Platonic realism as a requirement for thinking and speaking in general terms.
* Humanism (16th century)

* Renaissance
** The use of light, shadow, and perspective to more accurately represent life. Because of how fundamentally these ideas were felt to alter so much of life, some have referred to it as the &quot;Golden Age&quot;. In reality it was less an &quot;Age&quot; and more of a movement in popular philosophy, science, and thought that spread over Europe (and probably other parts of the world), over time, and affected different aspects of culture at different points in time. Very roughly, the following periods can be taken as indicative of place/time foci of the Renaissance: Italian Renaissance 1450–1550. Spanish Renaissance 1550–1587. English Renaissance 1588–1629.
* Protestant Reformation
** The Protestant Reformation, often referred to simply as the Reformation, was a schism from the Roman Catholic Church initiated by Martin Luther, John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli and other early Protestant Reformers in the 16th century Europe.
* Mannerism
** Anti-classicist movement that sought to emphasize the feeling of the artist himself.
** See: Mannerism/Art
* Baroque
** Emphasizes power and authority, characterized by intricate detail and without the &quot;disturbing angst&quot; of Mannerism. Essentially is exaggerated Classicism to promote and glorify the Church and State. Occupied with notions of infinity.
** See: Baroque art — Baroque music
* Rococo
* Neoclassical (17th–19th centuries)
** Severe, unemotional movement recalling Roman and Greek (&quot;classical&quot;) style, reacting against the overbred Rococo style and the emotional Baroque style. It stimulated revival of classical thinking, and had especially profound effects on science and politics. It also had a direct influence on Academic Art in the 19th century. Beginning in the early 17th century with Cartesian thought (see René Descartes), this movement provided philosophical frameworks for the natural sciences, sought to determine the principles of knowledge by rejecting all things previously believed to be known about the world. In Renaissance Classicism attempts are made to recreate the classic art forms — tragedy, comedy, and farce.
** See also: Weimar Classicism
*Age of Enlightenment (1688–1789): Reason (rationalism) seen as the ideal.
* Romanticism (1770–1830)
** Began in Germany and spread to England and France as a reaction against Neoclassicism and against the Age of Enlightenment.. The notion of &quot;folk genius&quot;, or an inborn and intuitive ability to do magnificent things, is a core principle of the Romantic movement. Nostalgia for the primitive past in preference to the scientifically minded present. Romantic heroes, exemplified by Napoleon, are popular. Fascination with the past leads to a resurrection of interest in the Gothic period. It did not really replace the Neoclassical movement so much as provide a counterbalance; many artists sought to join both styles in their works.
** See: Symbolism
* Realism (1830–1905)
** Ushered in by the Industrial Revolution and growing Nationalism in the world. Began in France. Attempts to portray the speech and mannerisms of everyday people in everyday life. Tends to focus on middle class social and domestic problems. Plays by Ibsen are an example. Naturalism evolved from Realism, following it briefly in art and more enduringly in theatre, film, and literature. Impressionism, based on &#x27;scientific&#x27; knowledge and discoveries concerns observing nature and reality objectively.
** See: Post-Impressionism — Neo-impressionism — Pointillism — Pre-Raphaelite
* Art Nouveau (1880–1905)
** Decorative, symbolic art
** See: Transcendentalism
* Modernism (1880–1965)
** Also known as the Avant-garde movement. Originating in the 19th century with Symbolism, the Modernist movement composed itself of a wide range of &#x27;isms&#x27; that ran in contrast to Realism and that sought out the underlying fundamentals of art and philosophy. The Jazz age and Hollywood emerge and have their hey-days.

* Postmodernism (since c.1965)
** A reaction to Modernism, in a way, Postmodernism largely discards the notion that artists should seek pure fundamentals, often questioning whether such fundamentals even exist – or suggestion that if they do exist, they may be irrelevant. It is exemplified by movements such as deconstructivism, conceptual art, &quot;etc.&quot;
** See: Postmodern philosophy — Postmodern music — Postmodern art
* Post-postmodernism (since c.1990)

<text>The chalcogens (ore forming) ( ) are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the oxygen family. Group 16 consists of the elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and the radioactive elements polonium (Po) and livermorium (Lv). Often, oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens, sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term &quot;chalcogen&quot; altogether, due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. The word &quot;chalcogen&quot; is derived from a combination of the Greek word () principally meaning copper (the term was also used for bronze, brass, any metal in the poetic sense, ore and coin), and the Latinized Greek word , meaning &quot;born&quot; or &quot;produced&quot;.

Sulfur has been known since antiquity, and oxygen was recognized as an element in the 18th century. Selenium, tellurium and polonium were discovered in the 19th century, and livermorium in 2000. All of the chalcogens have six valence electrons, leaving them two electrons short of a full outer shell. Their most common oxidation states are −2, +2, +4, and +6. They have relatively low atomic radii, especially the lighter ones.

All of the naturally occurring chalcogens have some role in biological functions, either as a nutrient or a toxin. Selenium is an important nutrient (among others as a building block of selenocysteine) but is also commonly toxic. Tellurium often has unpleasant effects (although some organisms can use it), and polonium (especially the isotope polonium-210) is always harmful as a result of its radioactivity.

Sulfur has more than 20 allotropes, oxygen has nine, selenium has at least eight, polonium has two, and only one crystal structure of tellurium has so far been discovered. There are numerous organic chalcogen compounds. Not counting oxygen, organic sulfur compounds are generally the most common, followed by organic selenium compounds and organic tellurium compounds. This trend also occurs with chalcogen pnictides and compounds containing chalcogens and carbon group elements.

Oxygen is generally obtained by separation of air into nitrogen and oxygen. Sulfur is extracted from oil and natural gas. Selenium and tellurium are produced as byproducts of copper refining. Polonium is most available in naturally occurring actinide-containing materials. Livermorium has been synthesized in particle accelerators. The primary use of elemental oxygen is in steelmaking. Sulfur is mostly converted into sulfuric acid, which is heavily used in the chemical industry. Selenium&#x27;s most common application is glassmaking. Tellurium compounds are mostly used in optical disks, electronic devices, and solar cells. Some of polonium&#x27;s applications are due to its radioactivity.

==Properties==

===Atomic and physical===
Chalcogens show similar patterns in electron configuration, especially in the outermost shells, where they all have the same number of valence electrons, resulting in similar trends in chemical behavior:

All chalcogens have six valence electrons. All of the solid, stable chalcogens are soft and do not conduct heat well. Electronegativity decreases towards the chalcogens with higher atomic numbers. Density, melting and boiling points, and atomic and ionic radii tend to increase towards the chalcogens with higher atomic numbers.

===Isotopes===
Out of the six known chalcogens, one (oxygen) has an atomic number equal to a nuclear magic number, which means that their atomic nuclei tend to have increased stability towards radioactive decay. Oxygen has three stable isotopes, and 14 unstable ones. Sulfur has four stable isotopes, 20 radioactive ones, and one isomer. Selenium has six observationally stable or nearly stable isotopes, 26 radioactive isotopes, and 9 isomers. Tellurium has eight stable or nearly stable isotopes, 31 unstable ones, and 17 isomers. Polonium has 42 isotopes, none of which are stable. It has an additional 28 isomers. In addition to the stable isotopes, some radioactive chalcogen isotopes occur in nature, either because they are decay products, such as 210Po, because they are primordial, such as 82Se, because of cosmic ray spallation, or via nuclear fission of uranium. Livermorium isotopes 288Lv through 293Lv have been discovered; the most stable livermorium isotope is 293Lv, which has a half-life of 0.061 seconds.

With the exception of livermorium, all chalcogens have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope: oxygen has trace 15O, sulfur has trace 35S, selenium has 82Se, tellurium has 128Te and 130Te, and polonium has 210Po.

Among the lighter chalcogens (oxygen and sulfur), the most neutron-poor isotopes undergo proton emission, the moderately neutron-poor isotopes undergo electron capture or β+ decay, the moderately neutron-rich isotopes undergo β− decay, and the most neutron rich isotopes undergo neutron emission. The middle chalcogens (selenium and tellurium) have similar decay tendencies as the lighter chalcogens, but no proton-emitting isotopes have been observed, and some of the most neutron-deficient isotopes of tellurium undergo alpha decay. Polonium isotopes tend to decay via alpha or beta decay. Isotopes with nonzero nuclear spins are more abundant in nature among the chalcogens selenium and tellurium than they are with sulfur.

===Allotropes===

Oxygen&#x27;s most common allotrope is diatomic oxygen, or O2, a reactive paramagnetic molecule that is ubiquitous to aerobic organisms and has a blue color in its liquid state. Another allotrope is O3, or ozone, which is three oxygen atoms bonded together in a bent formation. There is also an allotrope called tetraoxygen, or O4, and six allotropes of solid oxygen including &quot;red oxygen&quot;, which has the formula O8.

Sulfur has over 20 known allotropes, which is more than any other element except carbon. The most common allotropes are in the form of eight-atom rings, but other molecular allotropes that contain as few as two atoms or as many as 20 are known. Other notable sulfur allotropes include rhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur. Rhombic sulfur is the more stable of the two allotropes. Monoclinic sulfur takes the form of long needles and is formed when liquid sulfur is cooled to slightly below its melting point. The atoms in liquid sulfur are generally in the form of long chains, but above 190 °C, the chains begin to break down. If liquid sulfur above 190 °C is frozen very rapidly, the resulting sulfur is amorphous or &quot;plastic&quot; sulfur. Gaseous sulfur is a mixture of diatomic sulfur (S2) and 8-atom rings.

Selenium has at least eight distinct allotropes. The gray allotrope, commonly referred to as the &quot;metallic&quot; allotrope, despite not being a metal, is stable and has a hexagonal crystal structure. The gray allotrope of selenium is soft, with a Mohs hardness of 2, and brittle. Four other allotropes of selenium are metastable. These include two monoclinic red allotropes and two amorphous allotropes, one of which is red and one of which is black. The red allotrope converts to the black allotrope in the presence of heat. The gray allotrope of selenium is made from spirals on selenium atoms, while one of the red allotropes is made of stacks of selenium rings (Se8).

Tellurium is not known to have any allotropes, although its typical form is hexagonal. Polonium has two allotropes, which are known as α-polonium and β-polonium. α-polonium has a cubic crystal structure and converts to the rhombohedral β-polonium at 36 °C.

The chalcogens have varying crystal structures. Oxygen&#x27;s crystal structure is monoclinic, sulfur&#x27;s is orthorhombic, selenium and tellurium have the hexagonal crystal structure, while polonium has a cubic crystal structure.
===Chemical===

Oxygen, sulfur, and selenium are nonmetals, and tellurium is a metalloid, meaning that its chemical properties are between those of a metal and those of a nonmetal. It is not certain whether polonium is a metal or a metalloid. Some sources refer to polonium as a metalloid, although it has some metallic properties. Also, some allotropes of selenium display characteristics of a metalloid, even though selenium is usually considered a nonmetal. Even though oxygen is a chalcogen, its chemical properties are different from those of other chalcogens. One reason for this is that the heavier chalcogens have vacant d-orbitals. Oxygen&#x27;s electronegativity is also much higher than those of the other chalcogens. This makes oxygen&#x27;s electric polarizability several times lower than those of the other chalcogens.

For covalent bonding a chalcogen may accept two electrons according to the octet rule, leaving two lone pairs. When an atom forms two single bonds, they form an angle between 90° and 120°. In 1+ cations, such as , a chalcogen forms three molecular orbitals arranged in a trigonal pyramidal fashion and one lone pair. Double bonds are also common in chalcogen compounds, for example in chalcogenates (see below).

The oxidation number of the most common chalcogen compounds with positive metals is −2. However the tendency for chalcogens to form compounds in the −2 state decreases towards the heavier chalcogens. Other oxidation numbers, such as −1 in pyrite and peroxide, do occur. The highest formal oxidation number is +6. This oxidation number is found in sulfates, selenates, tellurates, polonates, and their corresponding acids, such as sulfuric acid.

Oxygen is the most electronegative element except for fluorine, and forms compounds with almost all of the chemical elements, including some of the noble gases. It commonly bonds with many metals and metalloids to form oxides, including iron oxide, titanium oxide, and silicon oxide. Oxygen&#x27;s most common oxidation state is −2, and the oxidation state −1 is also relatively common. With hydrogen it forms water and hydrogen peroxide. Organic oxygen compounds are ubiquitous in organic chemistry. 

Sulfur&#x27;s oxidation states are −2, +2, +4, and +6. Sulfur-containing analogs of oxygen compounds often have the prefix &quot;thio-&quot;. Sulfur&#x27;s chemistry is similar to oxygen&#x27;s, in many ways. One difference is that sulfur-sulfur double bonds are far weaker than oxygen-oxygen double bonds, but sulfur-sulfur single bonds are stronger than oxygen-oxygen single bonds. Organic sulfur compounds such as thiols have a strong specific smell, and a few are utilized by some organisms.

Selenium&#x27;s oxidation states are −2, +4, and +6. Selenium, like most chalcogens, bonds with oxygen. There are some organic selenium compounds, such as selenoproteins. Tellurium&#x27;s oxidation states are −2, +2, +4, and +6. Tellurium forms the oxides tellurium monoxide, tellurium dioxide, and tellurium trioxide. Polonium&#x27;s oxidation states are +2 and +4.
There are many acids containing chalcogens, including sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, selenic acid, and telluric acid. All hydrogen chalcogenides are toxic except for water. Oxygen ions often come in the forms of oxide ions (), peroxide ions (), and hydroxide ions (). Sulfur ions generally come in the form of sulfides (), bisulfides (), sulfites (), sulfates (), and thiosulfates (). Selenium ions usually come in the form of selenides (), selenites () and selenates (). Tellurium ions often come in the form of tellurates (). Molecules containing metal bonded to chalcogens are common as minerals. For example, pyrite (FeS2) is an iron ore, and the rare mineral calaverite is the ditelluride .

Although all group 16 elements of the periodic table, including oxygen, can be defined as chalcogens, oxygen and oxides are usually distinguished from chalcogens and chalcogenides. The term &quot;chalcogenide&quot; is more commonly reserved for sulfides, selenides, and tellurides, rather than for oxides.

Except for polonium, the chalcogens are all fairly similar to each other chemically. They all form X2− ions when reacting with electropositive metals.

Sulfide minerals and analogous compounds produce gases upon reaction with oxygen.
==Compounds==

===With halogens=== 
Chalcogens also form compounds with halogens known as chalcohalides, or chalcogen halides. The majority of simple chalcogen halides are well-known and widely used as chemical reagents. However, more complicated chalcogen halides, such as sulfenyl, sulfonyl, and sulfuryl halides, are less well known to science. Out of the compounds consisting purely of chalcogens and halogens, there are a total of 13 chalcogen fluorides, nine chalcogen chlorides, eight chalcogen bromides, and six chalcogen iodides that are known. The heavier chalcogen halides often have significant molecular interactions. Sulfur fluorides with low valences are fairly unstable and little is known about their properties. However, sulfur fluorides with high valences, such as sulfur hexafluoride, are stable and well-known. Sulfur tetrafluoride is also a well-known sulfur fluoride. Certain selenium fluorides, such as selenium difluoride, have been produced in small amounts. The crystal structures of both selenium tetrafluoride and tellurium tetrafluoride are known. Chalcogen chlorides and bromides have also been explored. In particular, selenium dichloride and sulfur dichloride can react to form organic selenium compounds. Dichalcogen dihalides, such as Se2Cl2 also are known to exist. There are also mixed chalcogen-halogen compounds. These include SeSX, with X being chlorine or bromine. Such compounds can form in mixtures of sulfur dichloride and selenium halides. These compounds have been fairly recently structurally characterized, as of 2008. In general, diselenium and disulfur chlorides and bromides are useful chemical reagents. Chalcogen halides with attached metal atoms are soluble in organic solutions. One example of such a compound is . Unlike selenium chlorides and bromides, selenium iodides have not been isolated, as of 2008, although it is likely that they occur in solution. Diselenium diiodide, however, does occur in equilibrium with selenium atoms and iodine molecules. Some tellurium halides with low valences, such as and , form polymers when in the solid state. These tellurium halides can be synthesized by the reduction of pure tellurium with superhydride and reacting the resulting product with tellurium tetrahalides. Ditellurium dihalides tend to get less stable as the halides become lower in atomic number and atomic mass. Tellurium also forms iodides with even fewer iodine atoms than diiodides. These include TeI and Te2I. These compounds have extended structures in the solid state. Halogens and chalcogens can also form halochalcogenate anions.

===Organic===
Alcohols, phenols and other similar compounds contain oxygen. However, in thiols, selenols and tellurols; sulfur, selenium, and tellurium replace oxygen. Thiols are better known than selenols or tellurols. Aside from alcohols, thiols are the most stable chalcogenols and tellurols are the least stable, being unstable in heat or light. Other organic chalcogen compounds include thioethers, selenoethers and telluroethers. Some of these, such as dimethyl sulfide, diethyl sulfide, and dipropyl sulfide are commercially available. Selenoethers are in the form of R2Se or RSeR. Telluroethers such as dimethyl telluride are typically prepared in the same way as thioethers and selenoethers. Organic chalcogen compounds, especially organic sulfur compounds, have the tendency to smell unpleasant. Dimethyl telluride also smells unpleasant, and selenophenol is renowned for its &quot;metaphysical stench&quot;. There are also thioketones, selenoketones, and telluroketones. Out of these, thioketones are the most well-studied with 80% of chalcogenoketones papers being about them. Selenoketones make up 16% of such papers and telluroketones make up 4% of them. Thioketones have well-studied non-linear electric and photophysical properties. Selenoketones are less stable than thioketones and telluroketones are less stable than selenoketones. Telluroketones have the highest level of polarity of chalcogenoketones.

===With metals===

There is a very large number of metal chalcogenides. There are also ternary compounds containing alkali metals and transition metals. Highly metal-rich metal chalcogenides, such as Lu7Te and Lu8Te have domains of the metal&#x27;s crystal lattice containing chalcogen atoms. While these compounds do exist, analogous chemicals that contain lanthanum, praseodymium, gadolinium, holmium, terbium, or ytterbium have not been discovered, as of 2008. The boron group metals aluminum, gallium, and indium also form bonds to chalcogens. The Ti3+ ion forms chalcogenide dimers such as TiTl5Se8. Metal chalcogenide dimers also occur as lower tellurides, such as Zr5Te6.

Elemental chalcogens react with certain lanthanide compounds to form lanthanide clusters rich in chalcogens. Uranium(IV) chalcogenol compounds also exist. There are also transition metal chalcogenols which have potential to serve as catalysts and stabilize nanoparticles.

===With pnictogens===
Compounds with chalcogen-phosphorus bonds have been explored for more than 200 years. These compounds include unsophisticated phosphorus chalcogenides as well as large molecules with biological roles and phosphorus-chalcogen compounds with metal clusters. These compounds have numerous applications, including organo-phosphate insecticides, strike-anywhere matches and quantum dots. A total of 130,000 compounds with at least one phosphorus-sulfur bond, 6000 compounds with at least one phosphorus-selenium bond, and 350 compounds with at least one phosphorus-tellurium bond have been discovered. The decrease in the number of chalcogen-phosphorus compounds further down the periodic table is due to diminishing bond strength. Such compounds tend to have at least one phosphorus atom in the center, surrounded by four chalcogens and side chains. However, some phosphorus-chalcogen compounds also contain hydrogen (such as secondary phosphine chalcogenides) or nitrogen (such as dichalcogenoimidodiphosphates). Phosphorus selenides are typically harder to handle that phosphorus sulfides, and compounds in the form PxTey have not been discovered. Chalcogens also bond with other pnictogens, such as arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Heavier chalcogen pnictides tend to form ribbon-like polymers instead of individual molecules. Chemical formulas of these compounds include Bi2S3 and Sb2Se3. Ternary chalcogen pnictides are also known. Examples of these include P4O6Se and P3SbS3. salts containing chalcogens and pnictogens also exist. Almost all chalcogen pnictide salts are typically in the form of [PnxE4x]3−, where Pn is a pnictogen and E is a chalcogen. Tertiary phosphines can react with chalcogens to form compounds in the form of R3PE, where E is a chalcogen. When E is sulfur, these compounds are relatively stable, but they are less so when E is selenium or tellurium. Similarly, secondary phosphines can react with chalcogens to form secondary phosphine chalcogenides. However, these compounds are in a state of equilibrium with chalcogenophosphinous acid. Secondary phosphine chalcogenides are weak acids. Binary compounds consisting of antimony or arsenic and a chalcogen. These compounds tend to be colorful and can be created by a reaction of the constituent elements at temperatures of .

===Other===
Chalcogens form single bonds and double bonds with other carbon group elements than carbon, such as silicon, germanium, and tin. Such compounds typically form from a reaction of carbon group halides and chalcogenol salts or chalcogenol bases. Cyclic compounds with chalcogens, carbon group elements, and boron atoms exist, and occur from the reaction of boron dichalcogenates and carbon group metal halides. Compounds in the form of M-E, where M is silicon, germanium, or tin, and E is sulfur, selenium or tellurium have been discovered. These form when carbon group hydrides react or when heavier versions of carbenes react. Sulfur and tellurium can bond with organic compounds containing both silicon and phosphorus.

All of the chalcogens form hydrides. In some cases this occurs with chalcogens bonding with two hydrogen atoms. However tellurium hydride and polonium hydride are both volatile and highly labile. Also, oxygen can bond to hydrogen in a 1:1 ratio as in hydrogen peroxide, but this compound is unstable.

Chalcogen compounds form a number of interchalcogens. For instance, sulfur forms the toxic sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide. Tellurium also forms oxides. There are some chalcogen sulfides as well. These include selenium sulfide, an ingredient in some shampoos.

Since 1990, a number of borides with chalcogens bonded to them have been detected. The chalcogens in these compounds are mostly sulfur, although some do contain selenium instead. One such chalcogen boride consists of two molecules of dimethyl sulfide attached to a boron-hydrogen molecule. Other important boron-chalcogen compounds include macropolyhedral systems. Such compounds tend to feature sulfur as the chalcogen. There are also chalcogen borides with two, three, or four chalcogens. Many of these contain sulfur but some, such as Na2B2Se7 contain selenium instead.

==History==

===Early discoveries===

Sulfur has been known since ancient times and is mentioned in the Bible fifteen times. It was known to the ancient Greeks and commonly mined by the ancient Romans. In the Middle Ages, it was a key part of alchemical experiments. In the 1700s and 1800s, scientists Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Thénard proved sulfur to be a chemical element.

Early attempts to separate oxygen from air were hampered by the fact that air was thought of as a single element up to the 17th and 18th centuries. Robert Hooke, Mikhail Lomonosov, Ole Borch, and Pierre Bayden all successfully created oxygen, but did not realize it at the time. Oxygen was discovered by Joseph Priestley in 1774 when he focused sunlight on a sample of mercuric oxide and collected the resulting gas. Carl Wilhelm Scheele had also created oxygen in 1771 by the same method, but Scheele did not publish his results until 1777.

Tellurium was first discovered in 1783 by Franz Joseph Müller von Reichenstein. He discovered tellurium in a sample of what is now known as calaverite. Müller assumed at first that the sample was pure antimony, but tests he ran on the sample did not agree with this. Muller then guessed that the sample was bismuth sulfide, but tests confirmed that the sample was not that. For some years, Muller pondered the problem. Eventually he realized that the sample was gold bonded with an unknown element. In 1796, Müller sent part of the sample to the German chemist Martin Klaproth, who purified the undiscovered element. Klaproth decided to call the element tellurium after the Latin word for earth.

Selenium was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius. Berzelius noticed a reddish-brown sediment at a sulfuric acid manufacturing plant. The sample was thought to contain arsenic. Berzelius initially thought that the sediment contained tellurium, but came to realize that it also contained a new element, which he named selenium after the Greek moon goddess Selene.

===Periodic table placing===
Three of the chalcogens (sulfur, selenium, and tellurium) were part of the discovery of periodicity, as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same group that were noted by Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner as having similar properties. Around 1865 John Newlands produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music. His version included a &quot;group b&quot; consisting of oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and osmium.

After 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing oxygen at the top of &quot;group VI&quot; above sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. Chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, and uranium were sometimes included in this group, but they would be later rearranged as part of group VIB; uranium would later be moved to the actinide series. Oxygen, along with sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and later polonium would be grouped in &quot;group VIA&quot;, until the group&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;group 16&quot; in 1988.

===Modern discoveries===
In the late 19th century, Marie Curie and Pierre Curie discovered that a sample of pitchblende was emitting four times as much radioactivity as could be explained by the presence of uranium alone. The Curies gathered several tons of pitchblende and refined it for several months until they had a pure sample of polonium. The discovery officially took place in 1898. Prior to the invention of particle accelerators, the only way to produce polonium was to extract it over several months from uranium ore.

The first attempt at creating livermorium was from 1976 to 1977 at the LBNL, who bombarded curium-248 with calcium-48, but were not successful. After several failed attempts in 1977, 1998, and 1999 by research groups in Russia, Germany, and the US, livermorium was created successfully in 2000 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research by bombarding curium-248 atoms with calcium-48 atoms. The element was known as ununhexium until it was officially named livermorium in 2012.

===Names and etymology===
In the 19th century, Jons Jacob Berzelius suggested calling the elements in group 16 &quot;amphigens&quot;, as the elements in the group formed amphid salts (salts of oxyacids, formerly regarded as composed of two oxides, an acid and a basic oxide). The term received some use in the early 1800s but is now obsolete. The name &quot;chalcogen&quot; comes from the Greek words &#x27; (, literally &quot;copper&quot;), and &#x27; (, born, gender, kindle). It was first used in 1932 by Wilhelm Biltz&#x27;s group at Leibniz University Hannover, where it was proposed by Werner Fischer. The word &quot;chalcogen&quot; gained popularity in Germany during the 1930s because the term was analogous to &quot;halogen&quot;. Although the literal meanings of the modern Greek words imply that &quot;chalcogen&quot; means &quot;copper-former&quot;, this is misleading because the chalcogens have nothing to do with copper in particular. &quot;Ore-former&quot; has been suggested as a better translation, as the vast majority of metal ores are chalcogenides and the word &quot;&quot; in ancient Greek was associated with metals and metal-bearing rock in general; copper, and its alloy bronze, was one of the first metals to be used by humans.

Oxygen&#x27;s name comes from the Greek words &quot;oxy genes&quot;, meaning &quot;acid-forming&quot;. Sulfur&#x27;s name comes from either the Latin word &#x27; or the Sanskrit word &#x27;; both of those terms are ancient words for sulfur. Selenium is named after the Greek goddess of the moon, Selene, to match the previously discovered element tellurium, whose name comes from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning earth. Polonium is named after Marie Curie&#x27;s country of birth, Poland. Livermorium is named for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

==Occurrence==
The four lightest chalcogens (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, and tellurium) are all primordial elements on Earth. Sulfur and oxygen occur as constituent copper ores and selenium and tellurium occur in small traces in such ores. Polonium forms naturally from the decay of other elements, even though it is not primordial. Livermorium does not occur naturally at all.

Oxygen makes up 21% of the atmosphere by weight, 89% of water by weight, 46% of the Earth&#x27;s crust by weight, and 65% of the human body. Oxygen also occurs in many minerals, being found in all oxide minerals and hydroxide minerals, and in numerous other mineral groups. Stars of at least eight times the mass of the Sun also produce oxygen in their cores via nuclear fusion. Oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, making up 1% of the universe by weight.

Sulfur makes up 0.035% of the Earth&#x27;s crust by weight, making it the 17th most abundant element there and makes up 0.25% of the human body. It is a major component of soil. Sulfur makes up 870 parts per million of seawater and about 1 part per billion of the atmosphere. Sulfur can be found in elemental form or in the form of sulfide minerals, sulfate minerals, or sulfosalt minerals. Stars of at least 12 times the mass of the Sun produce sulfur in their cores via nuclear fusion. Sulfur is the tenth most abundant element in the universe, making up 500 parts per million of the universe by weight.

Selenium makes up 0.05 parts per million of the Earth&#x27;s crust by weight. This makes it the 67th most abundant element in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Selenium makes up on average 5 parts per million of the soils. Seawater contains around 200 parts per trillion of selenium. The atmosphere contains 1 nanogram of selenium per cubic meter. There are mineral groups known as selenates and selenites, but there are not many minerals in these groups. Selenium is not produced directly by nuclear fusion. Selenium makes up 30 parts per billion of the universe by weight.

There are only 5 parts per billion of tellurium in the Earth&#x27;s crust and 15 parts per billion of tellurium in seawater. Tellurium is one of the eight or nine least abundant elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust. There are a few dozen tellurate minerals and telluride minerals, and tellurium occurs in some minerals with gold, such as sylvanite and calaverite. Tellurium makes up 9 parts per billion of the universe by weight.

Polonium only occurs in trace amounts on Earth, via radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. It is present in uranium ores in concentrations of 100 micrograms per metric ton. Very minute amounts of polonium exist in the soil and thus in most food, and thus in the human body. The Earth&#x27;s crust contains less than 1 part per billion of polonium, making it one of the ten rarest metals on Earth.

Livermorium is always produced artificially in particle accelerators. Even when it is produced, only a small number of atoms are synthesized at a time.

===Chalcophile elements===

Chalcophile elements are those that remain on or close to the surface because they combine readily with chalcogens other than oxygen, forming compounds which do not sink into the core. Chalcophile (&quot;chalcogen-loving&quot;) elements in this context are those metals and heavier nonmetals that have a low affinity for oxygen and prefer to bond with the heavier chalcogen sulfur as sulfides. Because sulfide minerals are much denser than the silicate minerals formed by lithophile elements, chalcophile elements separated below the lithophiles at the time of the first crystallisation of the Earth&#x27;s crust. This has led to their depletion in the Earth&#x27;s crust relative to their solar abundances, though this depletion has not reached the levels found with siderophile elements.
==Production==

Approximately 100 million metric tons of oxygen are produced yearly. Oxygen is most commonly produced by fractional distillation, in which air is cooled to a liquid, then warmed, allowing all the components of air except for oxygen to turn to gases and escape. Fractionally distilling air several times can produce 99.5% pure oxygen. Another method with which oxygen is produced is to send a stream of dry, clean air through a bed of molecular sieves made of zeolite, which absorbs the nitrogen in the air, leaving 90 to 93% pure oxygen.
Sulfur can be mined in its elemental form, although this method is no longer as popular as it used to be. In 1865 a large deposit of elemental sulfur was discovered in the U.S. states of Louisiana and Texas, but it was difficult to extract at the time. In the 1890s, Herman Frasch came up with the solution of liquefying the sulfur with superheated steam and pumping the sulfur up to the surface. These days sulfur is instead more often extracted from oil, natural gas, and tar.

The world production of selenium is around 1500 metric tons per year, out of which roughly 10% is recycled. Japan is the largest producer, producing 800 metric tons of selenium per year. Other large producers include Belgium (300 metric tons per year), the United States (over 200 metric tons per year), Sweden (130 metric tons per year), and Russia (100 metric tons per year). Selenium can be extracted from the waste from the process of electrolytically refining copper. Another method of producing selenium is to farm selenium-gathering plants such as milk vetch. This method could produce three kilograms of selenium per acre, but is not commonly practiced.

Tellurium is mostly produced as a by-product of the processing of copper. Tellurium can also be refined by electrolytic reduction of sodium telluride. The world production of tellurium is between 150 and 200 metric tons per year. The United States is one of the largest producers of tellurium, producing around 50 metric tons per year. Peru, Japan, and Canada are also large producers of tellurium.

Until the creation of nuclear reactors, all polonium had to be extracted from uranium ore. In modern times, most isotopes of polonium are produced by bombarding bismuth with neutrons. Polonium can also be produced by high neutron fluxes in nuclear reactors. Approximately 100 grams of polonium are produced yearly. All the polonium produced for commercial purposes is made in the Ozersk nuclear reactor in Russia. From there, it is taken to Samara, Russia for purification, and from there to St. Petersburg for distribution. The United States is the largest consumer of polonium.

All livermorium is produced artificially in particle accelerators. The first successful production of livermorium was achieved by bombarding curium-248 atoms with calcium-48 atoms. As of 2011, roughly 25 atoms of livermorium had been synthesized.

==Applications==

Metabolism is the most important source and use of oxygen. Minor industrial uses include Steelmaking (55% of all purified oxygen produced), the chemical industry (25% of all purified oxygen), medical use, water treatment (as oxygen kills some types of bacteria), rocket fuel (in liquid form), and metal cutting.

Most sulfur produced is transformed into sulfur dioxide, which is further transformed into sulfuric acid, a very common industrial chemical. Other common uses include being a key ingredient of gunpowder and Greek fire, and being used to change soil pH. Sulfur is also mixed into rubber to vulcanize it. Sulfur is used in some types of concrete and fireworks. 60% of all sulfuric acid produced is used to generate phosphoric acid. Sulfur is used as a pesticide (specifically as an acaricide and fungicide) on &quot;orchard, ornamental, vegetable, grain, and other crops.&quot;
Around 40% of all selenium produced goes to glassmaking. 30% of all selenium produced goes to metallurgy, including manganese production. 15% of all selenium produced goes to agriculture. Electronics such as photovoltaic materials claim 10% of all selenium produced. Pigments account for 5% of all selenium produced. Historically, machines such as photocopiers and light meters used one-third of all selenium produced, but this application is in steady decline.

Tellurium suboxide, a mixture of tellurium and tellurium dioxide, is used in the rewritable data layer of some CD-RW disks and DVD-RW disks. Bismuth telluride is also used in many microelectronic devices, such as photoreceptors. Tellurium is sometimes used as an alternative to sulfur in vulcanized rubber. Cadmium telluride is used as a high-efficiency material in solar panels.

Some of polonium&#x27;s applications relate to the element&#x27;s radioactivity. For instance, polonium is used as an alpha-particle generator for research. Polonium alloyed with beryllium provides an efficient neutron source. Polonium is also used in nuclear batteries. Most polonium is used in antistatic devices. Livermorium does not have any uses whatsoever due to its extreme rarity and short half-life.

Organochalcogen compounds are involved in the semiconductor process. These compounds also feature into ligand chemistry and biochemistry. One application of chalcogens themselves is to manipulate redox couples in supramolecular chemistry (chemistry involving non-covalent bond interactions). This application leads on to such applications as crystal packing, assembly of large molecules, and biological recognition of patterns. The secondary bonding interactions of the larger chalcogens, selenium and tellurium, can create organic solvent-holding acetylene nanotubes. Chalcogen interactions are useful for conformational analysis and stereoelectronic effects, among other things. Chalcogenides with through bonds also have applications. For instance, divalent sulfur can stabilize carbanions, cationic centers, and radical. Chalcogens can confer upon ligands (such as DCTO) properties such as being able to transform Cu(II) to Cu(I). Studying chalcogen interactions gives access to radical cations, which are used in mainstream synthetic chemistry. Metallic redox centers of biological importance are tunable by interactions of ligands containing chalcogens, such as methionine and selenocysteine. Also, chalcogen through-bonds can provide insight about the process of electron transfer.

==Biological role==
Oxygen is needed by almost all organisms for the purpose of generating ATP. It is also a key component of most other biological compounds, such as water, amino acids and DNA. Human blood contains a large amount of oxygen. Human bones contain 28% oxygen. Human tissue contains 16% oxygen. A typical 70-kilogram human contains 43 kilograms of oxygen, mostly in the form of water.

All animals need significant amounts of sulfur. Some amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine contain sulfur. Plant roots take up sulfate ions from the soil and reduce it to sulfide ions. Metalloproteins also use sulfur to attach to useful metal atoms in the body and sulfur similarly attaches itself to poisonous metal atoms like cadmium to haul them to the safety of the liver. On average, humans consume 900 milligrams of sulfur each day. Sulfur compounds, such as those found in skunk spray often have strong odors.

All animals and some plants need trace amounts of selenium, but only for some specialized enzymes. Humans consume on average between 6 and 200 micrograms of selenium per day. Mushrooms and brazil nuts are especially noted for their high selenium content. Selenium in foods is most commonly found in the form of amino acids such as selenocysteine and selenomethionine. Selenium can protect against heavy metal poisoning.

Tellurium is not known to be needed for animal life, although a few fungi can incorporate it in compounds in place of selenium. Microorganisms also absorb tellurium and emit dimethyl telluride. Most tellurium in the blood stream is excreted slowly in urine, but some is converted to dimethyl telluride and released through the lungs. On average, humans ingest about 600 micrograms of tellurium daily. Plants can take up some tellurium from the soil. Onions and garlic have been found to contain as much as 300 parts per million of tellurium in dry weight.

Polonium has no biological role, and is highly toxic on account of being radioactive.

==Toxicity==

Oxygen is generally nontoxic, but oxygen toxicity has been reported when it is used in high concentrations. In both elemental gaseous form and as a component of water, it is vital to almost all life on Earth. Despite this, liquid oxygen is highly dangerous. Even gaseous oxygen is dangerous in excess. For instance, sports divers have occasionally drowned from convulsions caused by breathing pure oxygen at a depth of more than underwater. Oxygen is also toxic to some bacteria. Ozone, an allotrope of oxygen, is toxic to most life. It can cause lesions in the respiratory tract.

Sulfur is generally nontoxic and is even a vital nutrient for humans. However, in its elemental form it can cause redness in the eyes and skin, a burning sensation and a cough if inhaled, a burning sensation and diarrhoea and/or catharsis if ingested, and can irritate the mucous membranes. An excess of sulfur can be toxic for cows because microbes in the rumens of cows produce toxic hydrogen sulfide upon reaction with sulfur. Many sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are highly toxic.

Selenium is a trace nutrient required by humans on the order of tens or hundreds of micrograms per day. A dose of over 450 micrograms can be toxic, resulting in bad breath and body odor. Extended, low-level exposure, which can occur at some industries, results in weight loss, anemia, and dermatitis. In many cases of selenium poisoning, selenous acid is formed in the body. Hydrogen selenide (H2Se) is highly toxic.

Exposure to tellurium can produce unpleasant side effects. As little as 10 micrograms of tellurium per cubic meter of air can cause notoriously unpleasant breath, described as smelling like rotten garlic. Acute tellurium poisoning can cause vomiting, gut inflammation, internal bleeding, and respiratory failure. Extended, low-level exposure to tellurium causes tiredness and indigestion. Sodium tellurite (Na2TeO3) is lethal in amounts of around 2 grams.

Polonium is dangerous as an alpha particle emitter. If ingested, polonium-210 is a million times as toxic as hydrogen cyanide by weight; it has been used as a murder weapon in the past, most famously to kill Alexander Litvinenko. Polonium poisoning can cause nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and lymphopenia. It can also damage hair follicles and white blood cells. Polonium-210 is only dangerous if ingested or inhaled because its alpha particle emissions cannot penetrate human skin. Polonium-209 is also toxic, and can cause leukemia.

==Amphid salts==
&quot;Amphid salts&quot; was a name given by Jons Jacob Berzelius in the 19th century for chemical salts derived from the 16th group of the periodic table which included oxygen, sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. The term received some use in the early 1800s but is now obsolete. The current term in use for the 16th group is chalcogens.

<doc id="5906" wikidata="Q1997" url="?curid=5906" title="Carbon dioxide">
<text>Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula . It is made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It is found in the gas state at room temperature and at normally-encountered concentrations it is odorless. As the source of carbon in the carbon cycle, atmospheric is the primary carbon source for life on Earth. In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, and seawater.

It is a trace gas in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at 421 parts per million (ppm), or about 0.042% (as of May 2022) having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm or about 0.028%. Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of these increased concentrations, which are the primary cause of climate change.

Its concentration in Earth&#x27;s pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by organisms and geological features. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria use energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in a process called photosynthesis, which produces oxygen as a waste product. In turn, oxygen is consumed and is released as waste by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize organic compounds to produce energy by respiration. is released from organic materials when they decay or combust, such as in forest fires. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonate and mainly bicarbonate (), which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric levels increase.

Carbon dioxide is 53% more dense than dry air, but is long lived and thoroughly mixes in the atmosphere. About half of excess emissions to the atmosphere are absorbed by land and ocean carbon sinks. These sinks can become saturated and are volatile, as decay and wildfires result in the being released back into the atmosphere. , or the carbon it holds, is eventually sequestered (stored for the long term) in rocks and organic deposits like coal, petroleum and natural gas.

Nearly all produced by humans goes into the atmosphere. Less than 1% of produced annually is put to commercial use, mostly in the fertilizer industry and in the oil and gas industry for enhanced oil recovery. Other commercial applications include food and beverage production, metal fabrication, cooling, fire suppression and stimulating plant growth in greenhouses.

== Chemical and physical properties ==
=== Structure, bonding and molecular vibrations ===

The symmetry of a carbon dioxide molecule is linear and centrosymmetric at its equilibrium geometry. The length of the carbon–oxygen bond in carbon dioxide is 116.3 pm, noticeably shorter than the roughly 140 pm length of a typical single C–O bond, and shorter than most other C–O multiply bonded functional groups such as carbonyls. Since it is centrosymmetric, the molecule has no electric dipole moment.

As a linear triatomic molecule, has four vibrational modes as shown in the diagram. In the symmetric and the antisymmetric stretching modes, the atoms move along the axis of the molecule. There are two bending modes, which are degenerate, meaning that they have the same frequency and same energy, because of the symmetry of the molecule. When a molecule touches a surface or touches another molecule, the two bending modes can differ in frequency because the interaction is different for the two modes. Some of the vibrational modes are observed in the infrared (IR) spectrum: the antisymmetric stretching mode at wavenumber 2349 cm−1 (wavelength 4.25 μm) and the degenerate pair of bending modes at 667 cm−1 (wavelength 15.0 μm). The symmetric stretching mode does not create an electric dipole so is not observed in IR spectroscopy, but it is detected in Raman spectroscopy at 1388 cm−1 (wavelength 7.20 μm), with a Fermi resonance doublet at 1285 cm−1.

In the gas phase, carbon dioxide molecules undergo significant vibrational motions and do not keep a fixed structure. However, in a Coulomb explosion imaging experiment, an instantaneous image of the molecular structure can be deduced. Such an experiment has been performed for carbon dioxide. The result of this experiment, and the conclusion of theoretical calculations based on an ab initio potential energy surface of the molecule, is that none of the molecules in the gas phase are ever exactly linear. This counter-intuitive result is trivially due to the fact that the nuclear motion volume element vanishes for linear geometries. This is so for all molecules except diatomic molecules.

=== In aqueous solution ===

Carbon dioxide is soluble in water, in which it reversibly forms (carbonic acid), which is a weak acid, because its ionization in water is incomplete.

The hydration equilibrium constant of carbonic acid is, at 25 °C:
:formula_1
Hence, the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid, but remains as molecules, not affecting the pH.

The relative concentrations of , , and the deprotonated forms (bicarbonate) and (carbonate) depend on the pH. As shown in a Bjerrum plot, in neutral or slightly alkaline water (pH &gt; 6.5), the bicarbonate form predominates (&gt;50%) becoming the most prevalent (&gt;95%) at the pH of seawater. In very alkaline water (pH &gt; 10.4), the predominant (&gt;50%) form is carbonate. The oceans, being mildly alkaline with typical pH = 8.2–8.5, contain about 120 mg of bicarbonate per liter.

Being diprotic, carbonic acid has two acid dissociation constants, the first one for the dissociation into the bicarbonate (also called hydrogen carbonate) ion ():
:&quot;K&quot;a1 = 2.5 × 10−4 mol/L; p&quot;K&quot;a1 = 3.6 at 25 °C.
This is the &quot;true&quot; first acid dissociation constant, defined as
:formula_2
where the denominator includes only covalently bound and does not include hydrated (aq). The much smaller and often-quoted value near 4.16 × 10−7 (or pKa1 = 6.38) is an &quot;apparent&quot; value calculated on the (incorrect) assumption that all dissolved is present as carbonic acid, so that 
:formula_3
Since most of the dissolved remains as molecules, &quot;K&quot;a1(apparent) has a much larger denominator and a much smaller value than the true &quot;K&quot;a1.

The bicarbonate ion is an amphoteric species that can act as an acid or as a base, depending on pH of the solution. At high pH, it dissociates significantly into the carbonate ion ():
:&quot;K&quot;a2 = 4.69 × 10−11 mol/L; p&quot;K&quot;a2 = 10.329

In organisms, carbonic acid production is catalysed by the enzyme known as carbonic anhydrase.

In addition to altering its acidity, the presence of carbon dioxide in water also affects its electrical properties. When carbon dioxide dissolves in desalinated water, the electrical conductivity increases significantly from below 1 μS/cm to nearly 30 μS/cm. When heated, the water begins to gradually lose the conductivity induced by the presence of formula_4 , especially noticeable as temperatures exceed 30 °C.

The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of fully deionized water without saturation is comparably low in relation to these data.

=== Chemical reactions ===
 is a potent electrophile having an electrophilic reactivity that is comparable to benzaldehyde or strongly electrophilic α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. However, unlike electrophiles of similar reactivity, the reactions of nucleophiles with are thermodynamically less favored and are often found to be highly reversible. The reversible reaction of carbon dioxide with amines to make carbamates is used in scrubbers and has been suggested as a possible starting point for carbon capture and storage by amine gas treating.
Only very strong nucleophiles, like the carbanions provided by Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds react with to give carboxylates:
:where M = Li or MgBr and R = alkyl or aryl.

In metal carbon dioxide complexes, serves as a ligand, which can facilitate the conversion of to other chemicals.

The reduction of to CO is ordinarily a difficult and slow reaction:
The redox potential for this reaction near pH 7 is about −0.53 V &quot;versus&quot; the standard hydrogen electrode. The nickel-containing enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase catalyses this process.

Photoautotrophs (i.e. plants and cyanobacteria) use the energy contained in sunlight to photosynthesize simple sugars from absorbed from the air and water:

=== Physical properties ===
Carbon dioxide is colorless. At low concentrations, the gas is odorless; however, at sufficiently high concentrations, it has a sharp, acidic odor. At standard temperature and pressure, the density of carbon dioxide is around 1.98 kg/m3, about 1.53 times that of air.

Carbon dioxide has no liquid state at pressures below 0.51795(10) MPa (5.11177(99) atm). At a pressure of 1 atm (0.101325 MPa), the gas deposits directly to a solid at temperatures below 194.6855(30) K (−78.4645(30) °C) and the solid sublimes directly to a gas above this temperature. In its solid state, carbon dioxide is commonly called dry ice.

Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at pressures above 0.51795(10) MPa (5.11177(99) atm); the triple point of carbon dioxide is 216.592(3) K (−56.558(3) °C) at 0.51795(10) MPa (5.11177(99) atm) (see phase diagram). The critical point is 304.128(15) K (30.978(15) °C) at 7.3773(30) MPa (72.808(30) atm). Another form of solid carbon dioxide observed at high pressure is an amorphous glass-like solid. This form of glass, called &quot;carbonia&quot;, is produced by supercooling heated at extreme pressures (40–48 GPa, or about 400,000 atmospheres) in a diamond anvil. This discovery confirmed the theory that carbon dioxide could exist in a glass state similar to other members of its elemental family, like silicon dioxide (silica glass) and germanium dioxide. Unlike silica and germania glasses, however, carbonia glass is not stable at normal pressures and reverts to gas when pressure is released.

At temperatures and pressures above the critical point, carbon dioxide behaves as a supercritical fluid known as supercritical carbon dioxide.

Table of thermal and physical properties of carbon dioxide () at atmospheric pressure:
== Biological role ==
Carbon dioxide is an end product of cellular respiration in organisms that obtain energy by breaking down sugars, fats and amino acids with oxygen as part of their metabolism. This includes all plants, algae and animals and aerobic fungi and bacteria. In vertebrates, the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body&#x27;s tissues to the skin (e.g., amphibians) or the gills (e.g., fish), from where it dissolves in the water, or to the lungs from where it is exhaled. During active photosynthesis, plants can absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they release in respiration.

=== Photosynthesis and carbon fixation ===

Carbon fixation is a biochemical process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated by plants, algae and cyanobacteria into energy-rich organic molecules such as glucose, thus creating their own food by photosynthesis. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to produce sugars from which other organic compounds can be constructed, and oxygen is produced as a by-product.

Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase, commonly abbreviated to RuBisCO, is the enzyme involved in the first major step of carbon fixation, the production of two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate from and ribulose bisphosphate, as shown in the diagram at left.

RuBisCO is thought to be the single most abundant protein on Earth.

Phototrophs use the products of their photosynthesis as internal food sources and as raw material for the biosynthesis of more complex organic molecules, such as polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. These are used for their own growth, and also as the basis of the food chains and webs that feed other organisms, including animals such as ourselves. Some important phototrophs, the coccolithophores synthesise hard calcium carbonate scales. A globally significant species of coccolithophore is &quot;Emiliania huxleyi&quot; whose calcite scales have formed the basis of many sedimentary rocks such as limestone, where what was previously atmospheric carbon can remain fixed for geological timescales.

Plants can grow as much as 50% faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. Elevated levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated in FACE experiments.

Increased atmospheric concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein.

The concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids can also be altered in plants exposed to high concentrations of .

Plants also emit during respiration, and so the majority of plants and algae, which use C3 photosynthesis, are only net absorbers during the day. Though a growing forest will absorb many tons of each year, a mature forest will produce as much from respiration and decomposition of dead specimens (e.g., fallen branches) as is used in photosynthesis in growing plants. Contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral, mature forests can continue to accumulate carbon and remain valuable carbon sinks, helping to maintain the carbon balance of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Additionally, and crucially to life on earth, photosynthesis by phytoplankton consumes dissolved in the upper ocean and thereby promotes the absorption of from the atmosphere.

=== Toxicity ===

Carbon dioxide content in fresh air (averaged between sea-level and 10 kPa level, i.e., about altitude) varies between 0.036% (360 ppm) and 0.041% (412 ppm), depending on the location.

In humans, exposure to at concentrations greater than 5% causes the development of hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. Concentrations of 7% to 10% (70,000 to 100,000 ppm) may cause suffocation, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, manifesting as dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour. Concentrations of more than 10% may cause convulsions, coma, and death. levels of more than 30% act rapidly leading to loss of consciousness in seconds.

Because it is heavier than air, in locations where the gas seeps from the ground (due to sub-surface volcanic or geothermal activity) in relatively high concentrations, without the dispersing effects of wind, it can collect in sheltered/pocketed locations below average ground level, causing animals located therein to be suffocated. Carrion feeders attracted to the carcasses are then also killed. Children have been killed in the same way near the city of Goma by emissions from the nearby volcano Mount Nyiragongo. The Swahili term for this phenomenon is .
Adaptation to increased concentrations of occurs in humans, including modified breathing and kidney bicarbonate production, in order to balance the effects of blood acidification (acidosis). Several studies suggested that 2.0 percent inspired concentrations could be used for closed air spaces (e.g. a submarine) since the adaptation is physiological and reversible, as deterioration in performance or in normal physical activity does not happen at this level of exposure for five days. Yet, other studies show a decrease in cognitive function even at much lower levels. Also, with ongoing respiratory acidosis, adaptation or compensatory mechanisms will be unable to reverse the condition.

==== Below 1% ====
There are few studies of the health effects of long-term continuous exposure on humans and animals at levels below 1%. Occupational exposure limits have been set in the United States at 0.5% (5000 ppm) for an eight-hour period. At this concentration, International Space Station crew experienced headaches, lethargy, mental slowness, emotional irritation, and sleep disruption. Studies in animals at 0.5% have demonstrated kidney calcification and bone loss after eight weeks of exposure. A study of humans exposed in 2.5 hour sessions demonstrated significant negative effects on cognitive abilities at concentrations as low as 0.1% (1000ppm) likely due to induced increases in cerebral blood flow. Another study observed a decline in basic activity level and information usage at 1000 ppm, when compared to 500 ppm.

However a review of the literature found that a reliable subset of studies on the phenomenon of carbon dioxide induced cognitive impairment to only show a small effect on high-level decision making (for concentrations below 5000 ppm). Most of the studies were confounded by inadequate study designs, environmental comfort, uncertainties in exposure doses and differing cognitive assessments used. Similarly a study on the effects of the concentration of in motorcycle helmets has been criticized for having dubious methodology in not noting the self-reports of motorcycle riders and taking measurements using mannequins. Further when normal motorcycle conditions were achieved (such as highway or city speeds) or the visor was raised the concentration of declined to safe levels (0.2%).

==== Ventilation ====

Poor ventilation is one of the main causes of excessive concentrations in closed spaces, leading to poor indoor air quality. Carbon dioxide differential above outdoor concentrations at steady state conditions (when the occupancy and ventilation system operation are sufficiently long that concentration has stabilized) are sometimes used to estimate ventilation rates per person. Higher concentrations are associated with occupant health, comfort and performance degradation. ASHRAE Standard 62.1–2007 ventilation rates may result in indoor concentrations up to 2,100 ppm above ambient outdoor conditions. Thus if the outdoor concentration is 400 ppm, indoor concentrations may reach 2,500 ppm with ventilation rates that meet this industry consensus standard. Concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this (range of 3,000 or 4,000 ppm).

Miners, who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to insufficient ventilation, referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as &quot;blackdamp&quot;, &quot;choke damp&quot; or &quot;stythe&quot;. Before more effective technologies were developed, miners would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged canary with them as they worked. The canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans, and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch. The Davy lamp could also detect high levels of blackdamp (which sinks, and collects near the floor) by burning less brightly, while methane, another suffocating gas and explosion risk, would make the lamp burn more brightly.

In February 2020, three people died from suffocation at a party in Moscow when dry ice (frozen ) was added to a swimming pool to cool it down. A similar accident occurred in 2018 when a woman died from fumes emanating from the large amount of dry ice she was transporting in her car.
==== Indoor air ====
Humans spend more and more time in a confined atmosphere (around 80-90% of the time in a building or vehicle). According to the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &amp; Safety (ANSES) and various actors in France, the rate in the indoor air of buildings (linked to human or animal occupancy and the presence of combustion installations), weighted by air renewal, is &quot;usually between about 350 and 2,500 ppm&quot;.

In homes, schools, nurseries and offices, there are no systematic relationships between the levels of and other pollutants, and indoor is statistically not a good predictor of pollutants linked to outdoor road (or air, etc.) traffic. is the parameter that changes the fastest (with hygrometry and oxygen levels when humans or animals are gathered in a closed or poorly ventilated room). In poor countries, many open hearths are sources of and CO emitted directly into the living environment.

==== Outdoor areas with elevated concentrations ====
Local concentrations of carbon dioxide can reach high values near strong sources, especially those that are isolated by surrounding terrain. At the Bossoleto hot spring near Rapolano Terme in Tuscany, Italy, situated in a bowl-shaped depression about in diameter, concentrations of rise to above 75% overnight, sufficient to kill insects and small animals. After sunrise the gas is dispersed by convection. High concentrations of produced by disturbance of deep lake water saturated with are thought to have caused 37 fatalities at Lake Monoun, Cameroon in 1984 and 1700 casualties at Lake Nyos, Cameroon in 1986.

== Human physiology ==

=== Content ===
The body produces approximately of carbon dioxide per day per person, containing of carbon. In humans, this carbon dioxide is carried through the venous system and is breathed out through the lungs, resulting in lower concentrations in the arteries. The carbon dioxide content of the blood is often given as the partial pressure, which is the pressure which carbon dioxide would have had if it alone occupied the volume. In humans, the blood carbon dioxide contents are shown in the adjacent table.

=== Transport in the blood ===
 is carried in blood in three different ways. Exact percentages vary between arterial and venous blood.
* Majority (about 70% to 80%) is converted to bicarbonate ions by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells, by the reaction:
* 5–10% is dissolved in blood plasma
* 5–10% is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds

Hemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of allosteric effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. This is known as the Haldane Effect, and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the Bohr effect.

=== Regulation of respiration ===
Carbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local autoregulation of blood supply. If its concentration is high, the capillaries expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.

Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person&#x27;s breathing rate influences the level of in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes respiratory acidosis, while breathing that is too rapid leads to hyperventilation, which can cause respiratory alkalosis.

Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing air hunger. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the oxygen mask to themselves first before helping others; otherwise, one risks losing consciousness.

The respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial pressure of 40 mmHg. With intentional hyperventilation, the content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20 mmHg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one&#x27;s breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.

== Concentrations and role in the environment ==

=== Atmosphere ===


=== Oceans ===
==== Ocean acidification ====

Carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean to form carbonic acid (), bicarbonate (), and carbonate (). There is about fifty times as much carbon dioxide dissolved in the oceans as exists in the atmosphere. The oceans act as an enormous carbon sink, and have taken up about a third of emitted by human activity.

==== Hydrothermal vents ====
Carbon dioxide is also introduced into the oceans through hydrothermal vents. The &quot;Champagne&quot; hydrothermal vent, found at the Northwest Eifuku volcano in the Mariana Trench, produces almost pure liquid carbon dioxide, one of only two known sites in the world as of 2004, the other being in the Okinawa Trough. The finding of a submarine lake of liquid carbon dioxide in the Okinawa Trough was reported in 2006.

== Sources ==
The burning of fossil fuels for energy produces 36.8 billion tonnes of per year as of 2023. Nearly all of this goes into the atmosphere, where approximately half is subsequently absorbed into natural carbon sinks. Less than 1% of produced annually is put to commercial use.

=== Biological processes ===
Carbon dioxide is a by-product of the fermentation of sugar in the brewing of beer, whisky and other alcoholic beverages and in the production of bioethanol. Yeast metabolizes sugar to produce and ethanol, also known as alcohol, as follows:

All aerobic organisms produce when they oxidize carbohydrates, fatty acids, and proteins. The large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily. Refer to cellular respiration, anaerobic respiration and photosynthesis. The equation for the respiration of glucose and other monosaccharides is:

Anaerobic organisms decompose organic material producing methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds. Regardless of the type of organic material, the production of gases follows well defined kinetic pattern. Carbon dioxide comprises about 40–45% of the gas that emanates from decomposition in landfills (termed &quot;landfill gas&quot;). Most of the remaining 50–55% is methane.

==== Combustion ====
The combustion of all carbon-based fuels, such as methane (natural gas), petroleum distillates (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, propane), coal, wood and generic organic matter produces carbon dioxide and, except in the case of pure carbon, water. As an example, the chemical reaction between methane and oxygen:

Iron is reduced from its oxides with coke in a blast furnace, producing pig iron and carbon dioxide:

==== By-product from hydrogen production ====
Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of the industrial production of hydrogen by steam reforming and the water gas shift reaction in ammonia production. These processes begin with the reaction of water and natural gas (mainly methane).

==== Thermal decomposition of limestone ====
It is produced by thermal decomposition of limestone, by heating (calcining) at about , in the manufacture of quicklime (calcium oxide, CaO), a compound that has many industrial uses:

Acids liberate from most metal carbonates. Consequently, it may be obtained directly from natural carbon dioxide springs, where it is produced by the action of acidified water on limestone or dolomite. The reaction between hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate (limestone or chalk) is shown below:

The carbonic acid () then decomposes to water and :

Such reactions are accompanied by foaming or bubbling, or both, as the gas is released. They have widespread uses in industry because they can be used to neutralize waste acid streams.

== Commercial uses ==

Around 230 Mt of are used each year, mostly in the fertiliser industry for urea production (130 million tonnes) and in the oil and gas industry for enhanced oil recovery (70 to 80 million tonnes). Other commercial applications include food and beverage production, metal fabrication, cooling, fire suppression and stimulating plant growth in greenhouses.

Technology exists to capture from industrial flue gas or from the air. Research is ongoing on ways to use captured in products and some of these processes have been deployed commercially. However, the potential to use products is very small compared to the total volume of that could foreseeably be captured. The vast majority of captured is considered a waste product and sequestered in underground geologic formations.

=== Precursor to chemicals ===
In the chemical industry, carbon dioxide is mainly consumed as an ingredient in the production of urea, with a smaller fraction being used to produce methanol and a range of other products. Some carboxylic acid derivatives such as sodium salicylate are prepared using by the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction.

Captured could be to produce methanol or electrofuels. To be carbon-neutral, the would need to come from bioenergy production or direct air capture.

=== Fossil fuel recovery ===
Carbon dioxide is used in enhanced oil recovery where it is injected into or adjacent to producing oil wells, usually under supercritical conditions, when it becomes miscible with the oil. This approach can increase original oil recovery by reducing residual oil saturation by 7–23% additional to primary extraction. It acts as both a pressurizing agent and, when dissolved into the underground crude oil, significantly reduces its viscosity, and changing surface chemistry enabling the oil to flow more rapidly through the reservoir to the removal well.

Most injected in -EOR projects comes from naturally occurring underground deposits. Some used in EOR is captured from industrial facilities such as natural gas processing plants, using carbon capture technology and transported to the oilfield in pipelines.

=== Agriculture ===
Plants require carbon dioxide to conduct photosynthesis. The atmospheres of greenhouses may (if of large size, must) be enriched with additional to sustain and increase the rate of plant growth. At very high concentrations (100 times atmospheric concentration, or greater), carbon dioxide can be toxic to animal life, so raising the concentration to 10,000 ppm (1%) or higher for several hours will eliminate pests such as whiteflies and spider mites in a greenhouse. Some plants respond more favorably to rising carbon dioxide concentrations than others, which can lead to vegetation regime shifts like woody plant encroachment.

=== Foods ===
Carbon dioxide is a food additive used as a propellant and acidity regulator in the food industry. It is approved for usage in the EU (listed as E number E290), US, Australia and New Zealand (listed by its INS number 290).

A candy called Pop Rocks is pressurized with carbon dioxide gas at about . When placed in the mouth, it dissolves (just like other hard candy) and releases the gas bubbles with an audible pop.

Leavening agents cause dough to rise by producing carbon dioxide. Baker&#x27;s yeast produces carbon dioxide by fermentation of sugars within the dough, while chemical leaveners such as baking powder and baking soda release carbon dioxide when heated or if exposed to acids.

==== Beverages ====
Carbon dioxide is used to produce carbonated soft drinks and soda water. Traditionally, the carbonation of beer and sparkling wine came about through natural fermentation, but many manufacturers carbonate these drinks with carbon dioxide recovered from the fermentation process. In the case of bottled and kegged beer, the most common method used is carbonation with recycled carbon dioxide. With the exception of British real ale, draught beer is usually transferred from kegs in a cold room or cellar to dispensing taps on the bar using pressurized carbon dioxide, sometimes mixed with nitrogen.

The taste of soda water (and related taste sensations in other carbonated beverages) is an effect of the dissolved carbon dioxide rather than the bursting bubbles of the gas. Carbonic anhydrase 4 converts carbon dioxide to carbonic acid leading to a sour taste, and also the dissolved carbon dioxide induces a somatosensory response.

==== Winemaking ====

Carbon dioxide in the form of dry ice is often used during the cold soak phase in winemaking to cool clusters of grapes quickly after picking to help prevent spontaneous fermentation by wild yeast. The main advantage of using dry ice over water ice is that it cools the grapes without adding any additional water that might decrease the sugar concentration in the grape must, and thus the alcohol concentration in the finished wine. Carbon dioxide is also used to create a hypoxic environment for carbonic maceration, the process used to produce Beaujolais wine.

Carbon dioxide is sometimes used to top up wine bottles or other storage vessels such as barrels to prevent oxidation, though it has the problem that it can dissolve into the wine, making a previously still wine slightly fizzy. For this reason, other gases such as nitrogen or argon are preferred for this process by professional wine makers.

====Stunning animals====
Carbon dioxide is often used to &quot;stun&quot; animals before slaughter. &quot;Stunning&quot; may be a misnomer, as the animals are not knocked out immediately and may suffer distress.

=== Inert gas ===
Carbon dioxide is one of the most commonly used compressed gases for pneumatic (pressurized gas) systems in portable pressure tools. Carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for welding, although in the welding arc, it reacts to oxidize most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more brittle than those made in more inert atmospheres. When used for MIG welding, use is sometimes referred to as MAG welding, for Metal Active Gas, as can react at these high temperatures. It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres, improving the flow characteristics. Although, this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site. This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.

Carbon dioxide is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately , allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. Aluminium capsules of are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for air guns, paintball markers/guns, inflating bicycle tires, and for making carbonated water. High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests. Liquid carbon dioxide is used in supercritical drying of some food products and technological materials, in the preparation of specimens for scanning electron microscopy and in the decaffeination of coffee beans.

=== Fire extinguisher ===

Carbon dioxide can be used to extinguish flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas. It does not itself react to extinguish the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some fire extinguishers, especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because they do not cool the burning substances significantly, and when the carbon dioxide disperses, they can catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. They are mainly used in server rooms.

Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire-protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space. International Maritime Organization standards recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide-based fire-protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report (2000), causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.

=== Supercritical as solvent ===
Liquid carbon dioxide is a good solvent for many lipophilic organic compounds and is used to decaffeinate coffee. Carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the pharmaceutical and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as organochlorides. It is also used by some dry cleaners for this reason. It is used in the preparation of some aerogels because of the properties of supercritical carbon dioxide.

=== Refrigerant ===

Liquid and solid carbon dioxide are important refrigerants, especially in the food industry, where they are employed during the transportation and storage of ice cream and other frozen foods. Solid carbon dioxide is called &quot;dry ice&quot; and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical. Solid carbon dioxide is always below at regular atmospheric pressure, regardless of the air temperature.

 Liquid carbon dioxide (industry nomenclature R744 or R-744) was used as a refrigerant prior to the use of dichlorodifluoromethane (R12, a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) compound). might enjoy a renaissance because one of the main substitutes to CFCs, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R134a, a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) compound) contributes to climate change more than does. physical properties are highly favorable for cooling, refrigeration, and heating purposes, having a high volumetric cooling capacity. Due to the need to operate at pressures of up to , systems require highly mechanically resistant reservoirs and components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors. In automobile air conditioning, in more than 90% of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50°, (R744) operates more efficiently than systems using HFCs (e.g., R134a). Its environmental advantages (GWP of 1, non-ozone depleting, non-toxic, non-flammable) could make it the future working fluid to replace current HFCs in cars, supermarkets, and heat pump water heaters, among others. Coca-Cola has fielded -based beverage coolers and the U.S. Army is interested in refrigeration and heating technology.

=== Minor uses ===

Carbon dioxide is the lasing medium in a carbon-dioxide laser, which is one of the earliest type of lasers.

Carbon dioxide can be used as a means of controlling the pH of swimming pools, by continuously adding gas to the water, thus keeping the pH from rising. Among the advantages of this is the avoidance of handling (more hazardous) acids. Similarly, it is also used in the maintaining reef aquaria, where it is commonly used in calcium reactors to temporarily lower the pH of water being passed over calcium carbonate in order to allow the calcium carbonate to dissolve into the water more freely, where it is used by some corals to build their skeleton.

Used as the primary coolant in the British advanced gas-cooled reactor for nuclear power generation.

Carbon dioxide induction is commonly used for the euthanasia of laboratory research animals. Methods to administer include placing animals directly into a closed, prefilled chamber containing , or exposure to a gradually increasing concentration of . The American Veterinary Medical Association&#x27;s 2020 guidelines for carbon dioxide induction state that a displacement rate of 30–70% of the chamber or cage volume per minute is optimal for the humane euthanasia of small rodents. Percentages of vary for different species, based on identified optimal percentages to minimize distress.

Carbon dioxide is also used in several related cleaning and surface-preparation techniques.

== History of discovery ==

Carbon dioxide was the first gas to be described as a discrete substance. In about 1640, the Flemish chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont observed that when he burned charcoal in a closed vessel, the mass of the resulting ash was much less than that of the original charcoal. His interpretation was that the rest of the charcoal had been transmuted into an invisible substance he termed a &quot;gas&quot; (from Greek &quot;chaos&quot;) or &quot;wild spirit&quot; (&quot;spiritus sylvestris&quot;).

The properties of carbon dioxide were further studied in the 1750s by the Scottish physician Joseph Black. He found that limestone (calcium carbonate) could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called &quot;fixed air&quot;. He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and supported neither flame nor animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through limewater (a saturated aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide), it would precipitate calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation. In 1772, English chemist Joseph Priestley published a paper entitled &quot;Impregnating Water with Fixed Air&quot; in which he described a process of dripping sulfuric acid (or &quot;oil of vitriol&quot; as Priestley knew it) on chalk in order to produce carbon dioxide, and forcing the gas to dissolve by agitating a bowl of water in contact with the gas.

Carbon dioxide was first liquefied (at elevated pressures) in 1823 by Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday. The earliest description of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) was given by the French inventor Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier, who in 1835 opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide, only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a &quot;snow&quot; of solid .

Carbon dioxide in combination with nitrogen was known from earlier times as Blackdamp, stythe or choke damp. Along with the other types of damp it was encountered in mining operations and well sinking. Slow oxidation of coal and biological processes replaced the oxygen to create a suffocating mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.

<doc id="5907" wikidata="Q732063" url="?curid=5907" title="Cheers">
<text>Cheers is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC from September 30, 1982, to May 20, 1993, for 11 seasons and 275 episodes. The show was produced by Charles/Burrows/Charles Productions in association with Paramount Television and was created by the team of James Burrows and Glen and Les Charles. The show is set in the titular bar in Boston, where a group of locals meet to drink, relax, socialize, and escape from their day to day issues.

At the center of the show is the bar&#x27;s owner and head bartender, Sam Malone, who is a womanizing former relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. The show&#x27;s ensemble cast introduced in the pilot episode are waitresses Diane Chambers and Carla Tortelli, second bartender Coach Ernie Pantusso, and regular customers Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin. Later main characters of the show also include Frasier Crane, Woody Boyd, Lilith Sternin, and Rebecca Howe.

After premiering in 1982, it was nearly canceled during its first season when it ranked almost last in ratings for its premiere (74th out of 77 shows). However, &quot;Cheers&quot; eventually became a Nielsen ratings juggernaut in the United States, earning a top-10 rating during eight of its 11 seasons, including one season at number one (season 9). The show spent most of its run on NBC&#x27;s Thursday night &quot;Must See TV&quot; lineup. Widely watched, its series finale in 1993 became the most-watched single TV episode of the 1990s, and the show&#x27;s 275 episodes have been successfully syndicated worldwide. Nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series for all 11 of its seasons on the air, it earned 28 Primetime Emmy Awards from a record of 117 nominations.

During its run, &quot;Cheers&quot; became one of the most popular series in history and received critical acclaim from its start to its end and is frequently cited as one of the greatest television shows of all time. In 1997, the episodes &quot;Thanksgiving Orphans&quot; and &quot;Home Is the Sailor,&quot; aired originally in 1987, were respectively ranked No. 7 and No. 45 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. Its series finale was watched by an estimated 93 million viewers, almost 40% of the US population at the time. The series also produced three spin-offs: &quot;The Tortellis&quot;, &quot;Wings&quot;, and &quot;Frasier&quot;; and a Spanish remake.

==Characters==

Before the &quot;Cheers&quot; pilot &quot;Give Me a Ring Sometime&quot; was completed and aired in 1982, the series consisted of four employees in the first script. Later revisions added Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin (regular customers of Cheers) as among the regular characters of the series, even though neither were featured.

In later years, Woody Boyd replaced Coach, after the character died off-screen in season three (1984–85), following actor Nicholas Colasanto&#x27;s death. Frasier Crane started as a recurring character and became a permanent one. In season six (1987–88), new character Rebecca Howe was added, having been written into the show after the finale of the previous season (1986–87). Lilith Sternin started as a one-time character in an episode of season four, &quot;Second Time Around&quot; (1985). After her second season five appearance, she became a recurring character and was later featured as a permanent one during season 10 (1991–92).

===Original main characters===
* Ted Danson as Sam Malone: A bartender and proprietor of Cheers, Sam is also a lothario. Before the series began, he was a baseball relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox nicknamed &quot;Mayday Malone&quot; until he became an alcoholic, harming his career. He has an on-again, off-again relationship with Diane Chambers, his class opposite, in the first five seasons (1982–1987). During their off-times, Sam has flings with many not-so-bright &quot;sexy women&quot; yet fails to pursue a meaningful relationship. After Diane is written out of the series, he tries to pursue Rebecca Howe, with varying results. At the end of the series, he is still unmarried and faces his sexual addiction with the help of Dr. Robert Sutton&#x27;s (Gilbert Lewis) group meetings, advised by Frasier.
* Shelley Long as Diane Chambers: An academic, sophisticated graduate student attending Boston University. In the pilot, Diane is abandoned by her fiancé, leaving her without a job, a man or money. Realizing that one of her few practical skills is memorization, which comes in handy when dealing with drink orders, she reluctantly becomes a barmaid. Later, she becomes a close friend of Coach and has an on-and-off relationship with bartender Sam Malone, her class opposite. During their off-relationship times, Diane dates men who fit her upper-class ideals, such as Frasier Crane. Diane returns to Cheers while dating Frasier to help cure Sam of his drinking addiction with help from Dr. Crane. Diane&#x27;s biggest enemy is Carla, who frequently insults her, but Diane&#x27;s lack of retaliation serves to annoy Carla even more. In 1987, Diane leaves Boston and Sam to pursue a screenwriting career in California. She promises Sam she will return to Boston to marry him but does not do so.
* Nicholas Colasanto as &quot;Coach&quot; Ernie Pantusso: A &quot;borderline senile&quot; co-bartender, widower and retired baseball coach. Coach is also a friend of Sam and a close friend of Diane. He has a daughter, Lisa (Allyce Beasley). Coach listens to people&#x27;s problems and solves them. However, other people also help resolve his own problems. In 1985, Coach died without explicit explanation, as Colasanto died of a heart attack.
* Rhea Perlman as Carla Tortelli: A &quot;wisecracking, cynical&quot; cocktail waitress, who treats customers badly. When the series premieres, she is the mother of five children by her ex-husband Nick Tortelli (Dan Hedaya). Over the course of the series, she bears three more, the depiction of which incorporated Perlman&#x27;s real-life pregnancies. All of her children are ill behaved, except Ludlow, whose father is a prominent academic. She flirts with men, including ones who are not flattered by her ways, and believes in superstitions. Later, she marries Eddie LeBec, an ice hockey player, who later becomes a penguin mascot for ice shows. After he dies in an ice show accident by an ice resurfacer, Carla later discovers that Eddie had committed bigamy with another woman, whom he had gotten pregnant. Carla sleeps with Sam&#x27;s enemy, John Allen Hill, to Sam&#x27;s annoyance and anger.
* George Wendt as Norm Peterson: A bar regular and occasionally employed accountant. A recurrent joke on the show, especially in the earlier seasons, is that the character was such a popular and constant fixture at the bar that anytime he entered through the front door, everyone present would yell out his name (&quot;NORM!&quot;) in greeting (when present in the scene Diane would be heard saying &quot;Norman!&quot; moments later) ; usually, this cry would be followed by one of the present bartenders asking Norm how he was, usually receiving a sardonic response and a request for a beer. (&quot;It&#x27;s a dog-eat-dog world, and I&#x27;m wearing Milkbone underwear.&quot;) He has infrequent accounting jobs and a troubled marriage with (but is still in love with and married to) Vera, an unseen character, though she is occasionally heard. Later in the series, he becomes a house painter and an interior decorator. Even later in the series, Norm secures his dream job, tasting beer at a brewery. The character was not originally intended to be a main cast role; Wendt auditioned for a minor role of George for the pilot episode. The role was only to be Diane Chambers&#x27; first customer and had only one word: &quot;Beer!&quot; After he was cast in a more permanent role, the character was renamed Norm.

===Subsequent main characters===

* John Ratzenberger as Cliff Clavin: A know-it-all bar regular and mail carrier. He lives with his mother Esther Clavin (Frances Sternhagen) in first the family house and later his own apartment. In the bar, Cliff continuously spouts nonsensical and annoying trivia, making him an object of derision for the bar patrons (especially Carla). Ratzenberger auditioned for the role of a minor character George, but it went to Wendt, evolving the role into Norm Peterson. The producers decided they wanted a resident bar know-it-all, so the US Postal Worker Cliff Clavin was added for the pilot, as a recurring character for the first season before becoming a main character starting with the second. Originally written as a security guard, the producers changed his occupation into a mail carrier as they thought such a man would have a wider array of knowledge.
* Kelsey Grammer as Frasier Crane: A psychiatrist and bar regular, a recurring character for seasons 3 and 4 who joins the main cast by season 5. Frasier started out as Diane Chambers&#x27; love interest in the third season (1984–85). In the fourth season (1985–86), after Diane jilts him at the altar in Europe, Frasier starts to frequent Cheers and becomes a regular. He later marries Lilith Sternin and has a son, Frederick. After the series ends, the character becomes the focus of the spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;, in which he is divorced from Lilith and living in Seattle.
* Woody Harrelson as Woody Boyd: A not-so-bright bartender, first appearing in season 4. He arrives from his Midwest hometown of Hanover, Indiana to Boston, to see Coach, his &quot;pen pal&quot; (as referring to exchanging &quot;pens&quot;, not letters). When Sam tells Woody that Coach died, Sam hires Woody in Coach&#x27;s place. Later, he marries his girlfriend Kelly Gaines (Jackie Swanson), also not-so-bright but raised in a rich family. In the final season, he runs for city council and, surprisingly, wins.
* Bebe Neuwirth as Lilith Sternin: A psychiatrist and bar regular, a recurring character until joining the main cast in season 10. She is often teased by bar patrons about her uptight personality and appearance. In &quot;Second Time Around&quot; (1986), her first and only episode of the fourth season, her date with Frasier does not go well because they constantly argue. In the fifth season, with help from Diane, Lilith and Frasier begin a relationship. Eventually, they marry and have a son, Frederick. In the eleventh and final season, she commits adultery and leaves Frasier to live with another man in an experimental underground environment called the &quot;Eco-pod&quot;. She breaks it off, returns later in the season and reconciles with Frasier. However, in the spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;, the couple has divorced, with Lilith maintaining custody of Frederick. In season 11 of &quot;Cheers&quot;, Bebe Neuwirth is given &quot;starring&quot; credit only when she appears.
* Kirstie Alley as Rebecca Howe: First appearing in season 6, she starts out as a strong independent woman, manager of the bar for the corporation that buys Cheers from Sam after his on-off relationship with Diane ends. When Sam regains ownership, she begs him to let her remain, first as a cocktail waitress and later as a manager. She has repeated romantic failures with mainly rich men and becomes more and more &quot;neurotic, insecure, and sexually frustrated&quot;. At the start, Sam frequently attempts to seduce Rebecca without success. As her personality changes, he loses interest in her. In the series finale, after failed relationships with rich men, Rebecca marries a plumber and quits working for the bar. In the &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up&quot;, she is revealed to be divorced and back at the bar. When Frasier asks whether this means that she is working there again, Sam says, &quot;No, she&#x27;s just back at the bar.&quot;

===Character table===
===Recurring characters===

Although &quot;Cheers&quot; operated largely around that main ensemble cast and their interactions with various one-off characters, guest stars and recurring characters did occasionally supplement them. Notable repeat guests included Dan Hedaya as Nick Tortelli and Jean Kasem as Loretta Tortelli (who were the main characters in the first spin-off, &quot;The Tortellis&quot;), Fred Dryer as Dave Richards, Annie Golden as Margaret O&#x27;Keefe, Derek McGrath as Andy Schroeder (also referred to as &quot;Andy Andy&quot;), interchangeably Joel Polis and Robert Desiderio as rival bar owner Gary, Jay Thomas as Eddie LeBec, Roger Rees as Robin Colcord, Tom Skerritt as Evan Drake, Frances Sternhagen as Esther Clavin, Richard Doyle as Walter Gaines, Keene Curtis as John Allen Hill, Anthony Cistaro as Henri, Michael McGuire as Professor Sumner Sloan, and Harry Anderson as Harry &quot;The Hat&quot; Gittes. Jackie Swanson, who played the recurring role of Woody&#x27;s girlfriend and eventual wife &quot;Kelly Gaines-Boyd&quot;, appeared in 24 episodes from 1989 to 1993. The character is as equally dim and naive—but ultimately as sweet-natured—as Woody.

Paul Willson played the recurring barfly character Paul Krapence. (In one early appearance in the first season he was called &quot;Glen&quot;, and was later credited on-screen as &quot;Gregg&quot; and &quot;Tom&quot;, but he was playing the same character throughout.) Thomas Babson played &quot;Tom&quot;, a law student often mocked by Cliff Clavin, for continually failing to pass the Massachusetts bar exam. &quot;Al&quot;, played by Al Rosen, appeared in 38 episodes, and was known for his surly quips. Rhea Perlman&#x27;s father Philip Perlman played the role of &quot;Phil&quot;.

===Celebrity appearances===
Other celebrities guest-starred in single episodes as themselves throughout the series. Sports figures appeared on the show as themselves, with a connection to Boston or Sam&#x27;s former team, the Red Sox, such as Luis Tiant, Wade Boggs, and Kevin McHale and Larry Bird (of the Boston Celtics). Some television stars also made guest appearances as themselves such as Alex Trebek, Arsenio Hall, Dick Cavett, Robert Urich, George McFarland and Johnny Carson. Various political figures even made appearances on &quot;Cheers&quot; such as then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral William J. Crowe, former Colorado Senator Gary Hart, then-Speaker of the House Tip O&#x27;Neill, then-Senator John Kerry, then-Governor Michael Dukakis, Ethel Kennedy (widow of Robert F. Kennedy), and then-Mayor of Boston Raymond Flynn, the last five of whom all represented Cheers&#x27; home state and city.

In maternal roles, Glynis Johns, in a guest appearance in 1983, played Diane&#x27;s mother, Helen Chambers. Nancy Marchand played Frasier&#x27;s mother, Hester Crane, in an episode that aired in 1985. In an episode that aired in 1992, Celeste Holm – who had previously played Ted Danson&#x27;s mother in &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; – appeared as Kelly&#x27;s jokester of a paternal grandmother. Melendy Britt appeared in the episode &quot;Woody or Won&#x27;t He&quot; (1990) as Kelly&#x27;s mother, Roxanne Gaines, a very attractive high-society lady and a sexy, flirtatious upper-class cougar who tries to seduce Woody.

The musician Harry Connick Jr. appeared in an episode as Woody&#x27;s cousin and plays a song from his Grammy-winning album &quot;We Are in Love&quot; (). John Cleese won a Primetime Emmy Award for his guest appearance as &quot;Dr. Simon Finch-Royce&quot; in the fifth-season episode &quot;Simon Says&quot;. Emma Thompson guest-starred as Nanny G/Nannette Guzman, a famous singing nanny and Frasier&#x27;s ex-wife. Christopher Lloyd guest-starred as a tortured artist who wanted to paint Diane. Marcia Cross portrayed Rebecca&#x27;s sister Susan in the season 7 episode &quot;Sisterly Love&quot;. John Mahoney once appeared as an inept jingle writer, which included a brief conversation with Frasier Crane, whose father he later portrayed on the spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;. Peri Gilpin, who later played Roz Doyle on &quot;Frasier,&quot; also appeared in one episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;, in its 11th season, as Holly Matheson, a reporter who interviews Woody. The Righteous Brothers, Bobby Hatfield and Bill Medley, also guest-starred in different episodes. In &quot;The Guy Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, Rebecca meets a plumber, played by Tom Berenger, who came to fix one of the beer keg taps. They marry in the series finale, triggering her resignation from Cheers. Judith Barsi appears in the episode &quot;Relief Bartender&quot;.

Notable guest appearances of actresses portraying Sam&#x27;s sexual conquests or potential sexual conquests include Kate Mulgrew in the three-episode finale of season four, portraying Boston councilwoman Janet Eldridge; Donna McKechnie as Debra, Sam&#x27;s ex-wife (with whom he is on good terms), who pretends to be an intellectual in front of Diane; Barbara Babcock as Lana Marshall, a talent agent who specializes in representing male athletes, whom she routinely sleeps with on-demand; Julia Duffy as Rebecca Prout, a depressed intellectual friend of Diane&#x27;s; Alison La Placa as magazine reporter Paula Nelson; Carol Kane as Amanda, who Sam eventually learns was a fellow patient at the sanitarium with Diane; Barbara Feldon as Lauren Hudson, Sam&#x27;s annual Valentine&#x27;s Day fling (in an homage to &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot;); Sandahl Bergman as Judy Marlowe, a longtime casual sex partner; Laurie Marlowe (Chelsea Noble), Judy&#x27;s now-grown-up daughter, who always considered Sam a pseudo-father figure, &amp; whom Sam falls for; Madolyn Smith-Osborne as Dr. Sheila Rydell, a colleague of Frasier and Lilith; Valerie Mahaffey as Valerie Hill, John Allen Hill&#x27;s daughter whom Sam pursues if only to gain an upper hand in his business relationship with Hill; and Alexis Smith as Alice Anne Volkman, Rebecca&#x27;s much older ex-professor. In season 9, episode 17, &quot;I&#x27;m Getting My Act Together and Sticking It in Your Face&quot;, Sam, believing Rebecca wants a more serious relationship, pretends to be gay, his lover being a casual friend named Leon (Jeff McCarthy)—the plan ultimately leads to a kiss between Sam and Leon.

===Death of Nicholas Colasanto===
Near the end of production of the third season, the writers of &quot;Cheers&quot; had to deal with the death of one of the main actors. Nicholas Colasanto&#x27;s heart condition had been diagnosed in the mid-1970s, but it had worsened. He had lost weight and was having trouble breathing during filming, and he was hospitalized shortly before filming finished for season three due to fluid in his lungs. He recovered but was not cleared to return to work. He was visiting the set in January 1985 to watch the filming of several episodes, and co-star Shelley Long commented, &quot;I think we were all in denial. We were all glad he was there, but he lost a lot of weight.&quot; Co-star Rhea Perlman added that he &quot;wanted to be there so badly. He didn&#x27;t want to be sick. He couldn&#x27;t breathe well. It was hard. He was laboring all the time.&quot; Colasanto ultimately died of a heart attack at his home on February 12, 1985.

The third-season episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot; were filmed out of order, partly to accommodate Shelley Long&#x27;s pregnancy. As a result, they had already completed filming the season finale at the time of his death, which had scenes with Colasanto in it. As the remaining episodes were filmed, Coach&#x27;s absence was explained by having one of the characters mention that Coach was out of town for various reasons.

The &quot;Cheers&quot; writing staff assembled in June 1985 to discuss how to deal with the absence of Coach. They quickly discarded the idea that he had moved away, as they felt that he would never abandon his friends. In addition, most viewers were aware of Colasanto&#x27;s death, so the writing staff decided to handle the situation more openly. The season four opener, &quot;Birth, Death, Love and Rice&quot;, dealt with Coach&#x27;s death and introduced Woody Harrelson, Colasanto&#x27;s replacement.

==Episodes==

==Themes==
Nearly all of &quot;Cheers&quot; takes place in the front room of the bar, but the characters often go into the rear pool room or the bar&#x27;s office. &quot;Cheers&quot; does not show any action outside the bar until the first episode of the second season, which takes place in Diane&#x27;s apartment.

The show&#x27;s main theme in its early seasons is the romance between intellectual waitress Diane Chambers and the bar&#x27;s owner, Sam Malone, a former Major League Baseball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox and recovering alcoholic. After Shelley Long (Diane) left the show, the focus shifted to Sam&#x27;s new relationship with Rebecca Howe, a neurotic corporate ladder climber.

Many &quot;Cheers&quot; scripts centered or touched upon a variety of social issues, albeit humorously. As &quot;Toasting Cheers&quot; puts it, &quot;The script was further strengthened by the writers&#x27; boldness in successfully tackling controversial issues such as alcoholism, homosexuality, and adultery.&quot;

Social class was a subtext of the show. The &quot;upper class&quot;—represented by characters like Diane Chambers, Frasier Crane, and Lilith Sternin—rub shoulders with middle- and working-class characters Sam Malone, Carla Tortelli, Norm Peterson, and Cliff Clavin. An extreme example of this was the relationship between Woody Boyd and a millionaire&#x27;s daughter, Kelly Gaines. Many viewers enjoyed &quot;Cheers&quot; in part because of this focus on character development in addition to plot development.

Feminism and the role of women were also recurring themes throughout the show, with some critics seeing each of the major female characters portraying an aspect as a flawed feminist in her own way. Diane is a vocal feminist, and Sam is the epitome of everything she hates: promiscuity and chauvinism (see &quot;Sam and Diane&quot;).

Homosexuality was dealt with from the first season, which was rare in the early 1980s on American television. In the first-season episode &quot;The Boys in the Bar&quot; (the title being a reference to the play and subsequent movie &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;), a friend and former teammate of Sam&#x27;s comes out in his autobiography. Some of the male regulars pressure Sam to take action to ensure that Cheers does not become a gay bar. The episode won a GLAAD Media Award, and the script&#x27;s writers, Ken Levine and David Isaacs, were nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award.

Addiction also plays a role on &quot;Cheers&quot;, almost exclusively through Sam. He is a recovering alcoholic who had bought a bar during his drinking days. Frasier has a notable bout of drinking in the fourth-season episode &quot;The Triangle&quot;, while Woody develops a gambling problem in the seventh season episode &quot;Call Me Irresponsible&quot;. Carla and other characters drink beer while pregnant, but nobody seems to mind.

==Cheers owners==

Cheers had several owners before Sam, as the bar was opened in 1889. The &quot;Est. 1895&quot; on the bar&#x27;s sign is a made-up date chosen by Carla for numerology purposes, revealed in season 8, episode 6, &quot;The Stork Brings a Crane&quot;, which also revealed the bar&#x27;s address as 112 Beacon Street and that it originated under the name Mom&#x27;s. In the series&#x27; second episode, &quot;Sam&#x27;s Women&quot;, Coach tells a customer looking for Gus, the owner of Cheers, that Gus is dead. In a later episode, Gus O&#x27;Mally comes back from Arizona for one night and helps run the bar.

The biggest storyline surrounding the ownership of Cheers begins in the fifth-season finale, &quot;I Do, Adieu&quot;, when Sam and Diane part ways, due to Shelley Long&#x27;s departure from the series. In addition, Sam leaves on a trip to circumnavigate the globe. Before he leaves, he sells Cheers to the Lillian Corporation. He returns in the sixth-season premiere, &quot;Home is the Sailor&quot;, having sunk his boat, to find the bar under the new management of Rebecca Howe. He begs for his job back and is hired by Rebecca as a bartender. In the seventh-season premiere, &quot;How to Recede in Business&quot;, Rebecca is fired and Sam is promoted to manager. Rebecca is allowed to keep a job at Lillian vaguely similar to what she had before, but only after Sam has Rebecca () &quot;agree&quot; to a long list of demands that the corporation had for her.

From there, Sam occasionally attempts to buy the bar back with schemes that usually involve the wealthy executive Robin Colcord. Sam acquires Cheers again in the eighth-season finale, when it is sold back to him for 85¢ by the Lillian Corporation after he alerts the company to Colcord&#x27;s insider trading. Fired by the corporation because of her silence on the issue, Rebecca is hired by Sam as a hostess/office manager. For the rest of the episode, to celebrate Sam&#x27;s reclaiming the bar, a huge banner reading &quot;Under OLD Management!&quot; hangs from the staircase. When it is learned that the Pool Room and bathrooms are actually owned by Melville&#x27;s (which spawns a war of wits between Sam and Melville&#x27;s owner John Allen Hill), Rebecca later purchases them from Hill, making Sam and Rebecca partners in the ownership of Cheers (and more or less co-runners of the establishment).

Sam has two main battles. One is with Gary&#x27;s Olde Towne Tavern, trying to beat them at some activity or another but always failing, except for one episode when Diane helps Cheers win the bowling trophy, and extending to the practical jokes they play on each other. The second is with Melville&#x27;s owner John Allen Hill, who keeps annoying Sam with his pettiness and ego. Hill had an ongoing relationship with Carla.

==Production==
===Creation and concept===
Some believe that the show is a rehashing of Boston&#x27;s ABC affiliate WCVB&#x27;s locally produced 1979 sitcom &quot;Park Street Under&quot; featuring Steve Sweeney and American Repertory Theater founder Karen MacDonald. Three men developed and created the &quot;Cheers&quot; television series: Glen and Les Charles (&quot;Glen and Les&quot;) and James Burrows, who identified themselves as &quot;two Mormons and a Jew.&quot; They aimed at &quot;creating a show around a Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn-type relationship&quot; between their two main characters, Sam and Diane. Malone represents the average man, while Chambers represents class and sophistication. The show revolves around characters in a bar under &quot;humorous adult themes&quot; and &quot;situations&quot;.

The original idea was a group of workers who interacted like a family, the goal being a concept similar to &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. The creators considered making an American version of the British &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, set in a hotel or an inn. When the creators settled on a bar as their setting, the show began to resemble the radio program &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, originally written and cocreated by James Burrows&#x27; father Abe Burrows. They liked the idea of a tavern, as it provided a continuous stream of new people, for a variety of characters. An early concept revolved around a woman becoming the new owner of the bar and the animosity created between her and the regulars, an idea that was used later in Season 6 when the character of Rebecca Howe is introduced.

Early discussions about the location of the show centered on Barstow, California, then Kansas City, Missouri. They eventually turned to the East Coast and finally Boston. The Bull &amp; Finch Pub in Boston, which was the model for Cheers, was chosen from a phone book. When Glen Charles asked the bar&#x27;s owner, Tom Kershaw, to shoot exterior and interior photos, he agreed, charging $1. Kershaw has since gone on to make millions of dollars, licensing the pub&#x27;s image and selling a variety of &quot;Cheers&quot; memorabilia. The Bull &amp; Finch became the 42nd-busiest outlet in the American food and beverage industry in 1997. During initial casting, Shelley Long, who was in Boston at the time filming &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot;, remarked that the bar in the script resembled a bar she had come upon in the city, which turned out to be the Bull &amp; Finch.

===Production team===
The crew of &quot;Cheers&quot; numbered in the hundreds. The three creators—James Burrows and Glen and Les Charles—kept offices on Paramount&#x27;s lot for the duration of the &quot;Cheers&quot; run. The Charles Brothers remained in overall charge throughout the show&#x27;s run, frequently writing major episodes, though starting with the third season they began delegating the day-to-day running of the writing staff to various showrunners. Ken Estin and Sam Simon were appointed as showrunners for the third season, and succeeded by David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee the following year. Angell, Casey and Lee would remain as showrunners until the end of the seventh season when they left to develop their own sitcom, &quot;Wings&quot;, and were replaced by Bill and Cheri Steinkellner and Phoef Sutton for the eighth through tenth seasons. For the final season, Tom Anderson and Dan O&#x27;Shannon acted as the showrunners.

James Burrows is regarded as being a factor in the show&#x27;s longevity, directing 243 of the 270 episodes and supervising the show&#x27;s production. Among the show&#x27;s other directors were Andy Ackerman, Thomas Lofaro, Tim Berry, Tom Moore, Rick Beren, as well as cast members John Ratzenberger and George Wendt.

Craig Safan provided the series&#x27; original music for its entire run except the theme song. His extensive compositions for the show led to his winning numerous ASCAP Top TV Series awards for his music.

===Casting===
The character of Sam Malone was originally intended to be a retired football player and was slated to be played by Fred Dryer, but Danson was chosen in part because he was younger and had more acting experience than Dryer. After casting Ted Danson, it was decided that a former baseball player (Sam &quot;Mayday&quot; Malone) would be more believable than a retired football player. Dryer, however, went on to play sportscaster Dave Richards, an old friend of Sam, in three episodes. Bill Cosby was also considered early in the casting process for the role of Sam, after having been recommended by the network.

Shelley Long was recommended by various sources to the producers for the role of Diane Chambers, but Long wished to be offered the part straight out and had to be coaxed into giving an audition. When she did read for the part, according to Glen Charles, &quot;that was it, we knew that we wanted her.&quot; Before the final decision was made, three pairs of actors were tested in front of the producers and network executives for Sam and Diane: Danson and Long, Fred Dryer and Julia Duffy, and William Devane and Lisa Eichhorn. The chemistry was so apparent between Long and Danson that it secured them the roles. Ted Danson was sent to bartending school to prepare him for the part and according to Burrows, had to learn &quot;how to pretend that he knew a lot about sports&quot; since Danson was not a sports fan in real life and had never been to a baseball game.

The character of Cliff Clavin was created for John Ratzenberger after he auditioned for the role of Norm Peterson, which eventually went to George Wendt. While chatting with producers afterward, he asked if they were going to include a &quot;bar know-it-all&quot;, the part he eventually played. Alley joined the cast when Shelley Long left, and Woody Harrelson joined when Nicholas Colasanto died. Danson, Perlman and Wendt were the only actors to appear in every episode of the series; Ratzenberger appears in all but two (and his name wasn&#x27;t part of the opening credit montage during the first season).

===Filming styles and locations===

Most &quot;Cheers&quot; episodes were, as a voiceover stated at the start of each, &quot;filmed before a live studio audience&quot; on Paramount Stage 25 in Hollywood, generally on Tuesday nights. Scripts for a new episode were issued the Wednesday before for a read-through, Friday was rehearsal day, and final scripts were issued on Monday. Burrows, who directed most episodes, insisted on using film stock rather than videotape. He was also noted for using motion in his directorial style, trying to constantly keep characters moving rather than standing still. Burrows and the Charles brothers emphasized to the cast to &quot;never assume that you&#x27;re not being watched&quot; because the camera would be focused on the actors at all times, so they had to always be reacting and &quot;always be funny&quot;. During the first season when ratings were poor Paramount and NBC asked that the show use videotape to save money, but a poor test taping ended the experiment and &quot;Cheers&quot; continued to use film.

Due to a decision by Glen and Les Charles, the cold open was often not connected to the rest of the episode, with the lowest-ranked writers assigned to create the jokes for them. Some cold opens were taken from episodes that ran too long.

The first year of the show took place entirely within the confines of the bar, the first location outside the bar being Diane&#x27;s apartment in the second year. When the series became a hit, the characters started venturing further afield, first to other sets and eventually to an occasional exterior location. The exterior location shots of the bar are of the Bull &amp; Finch Pub, located directly north of the Boston Public Garden. The pub has become a tourist attraction because of its association with the series, and draws nearly one million visitors annually. It has since been renamed Cheers Beacon Hill; its interior is different from the TV bar. The pub itself is at 84 Beacon Street (on the corner of Brimmer Street). In August 2001, there was a replica made of the bar in Faneuil Hall to capitalize on the popularity of the show.

After the show ended, the 1,000-square-foot bar set from &quot;Cheers&quot; was offered to the Smithsonian, which turned it down because it was too large. It was displayed for a short time at the defunct Hollywood Entertainment Museum, but later returned to storage, where it remained for many years. In 2014, CBS donated the set to the Museum of Television after a years-long campaign by James Burrows and his office on behalf of the museum&#x27;s founder, James Comisar. At the time of the donation, Comisar initiated a planned $100,000 restoration of the set using former conservators from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, although a site for the 10,000 item collection of the museum had not been decided upon.

===Theme song===

Before &quot;Where Everybody Knows Your Name&quot;, written by Gary Portnoy and Judy Hart Angelo, became the show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Cheers&quot;″ producers rejected two of Portnoy&#x27;s and Hart Angelo&#x27;s songs. The songwriters had collaborated to provide music for &quot;Preppies&quot;, an unsuccessful Broadway musical. When told they could not appropriate &quot;People Like Us&quot;, &quot;Preppies&quot;″ opening song, the pair wrote another song, &quot;My Kind of People&quot;, which resembles &quot;People Like Us&quot; and was intended to satirize &quot;the lifestyle of old decadent old-money WASPs&quot;, but to meet producers&#x27; demands, they rewrote the lyrics to be about &quot;likeable losers&quot; in a Boston bar. The show&#x27;s producers rejected this song, as well. After they read the script of the series pilot, they created another song &quot;Another Day&quot;. When Portnoy and Hart Angelo heard that NBC had commissioned thirteen episodes, they created an official theme song &quot;Where Everybody Knows Your Name&quot; and rewrote the lyrics. On syndicated airings of &quot;Cheers&quot;, the theme song was shortened to make room for additional commercials.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Cheers&quot; was critically acclaimed in its first season, though it landed a disappointing 74th out of 96 shows in that year&#x27;s ratings. This critical support, the early success at the Primetime Emmy Awards, and the support of the president of NBC&#x27;s entertainment division Brandon Tartikoff, are thought to be the main reasons for the show&#x27;s survival and eventual success. Tartikoff stated in 1983 that &quot;Cheers&quot; was a sophisticated adult comedy and that NBC executives &quot;never for a second doubted&quot; that the show would be renewed. Writer Levine believes that the most important reason was that the network recognized that it did not have other hit shows to help promote &quot;Cheers&quot;; as he later wrote, &quot;[NBC] had nothing else better to replace it with.&quot;

Writing in 2016, drama critic Chris Jones called &quot;Cheers&quot; &quot;a hinge sitcom – one foot in classic bits and shtick not far removed from Mel Brooks and another in ambitious, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;-like absurdism.&quot; In 2013, &quot;GQ&quot; magazine held an online competition to find the best TV comedy. &quot;Cheers&quot; was voted the greatest comedy show of all time. In 2017, James Charisma of &quot;&quot;Paste&quot;&quot; magazine ranked the show&#x27;s opening sequence No. 5 on a list of &quot;The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Cheers&quot; as the eighth-greatest TV show of all time. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Cheers&quot; #11 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

===Ratings===
Ratings improved for the summer reruns after the first season. The cast went on various talk shows to try to further promote the series after its first season. By the second season &quot;Cheers&quot; was competitive with CBS&#x27;s top-rated show &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;. With the growing popularity of &quot;Family Ties&quot;, which ran in the slot ahead of &quot;Cheers&quot; from January 1984 until &quot;Family Ties&quot; was moved to Sundays in 1987, and the placement of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; in front of both at the start of their third season (1984), the line-up became a runaway ratings success that NBC eventually dubbed &quot;Must See Thursday&quot;. The next season, &quot;Cheers&quot; ratings increased dramatically after Woody Boyd became a regular character as well. The fifth season earned the series the highest rating for the year that it would ever achieve. Although ratings mostly declined each year after that, the show retained a competitive advantage and rose to rank number one for the year for its first and only time in the ninth season. Although ratings and ranking both lost ground in the last two seasons, it still performed well, as it was the only show on NBC during those seasons to be in the top 10. By the end of its final season, the show had a run of eight consecutive seasons in the top ten of the Nielsen ratings; seven of them were in the top five.

NBC dedicated a whole night to the final episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;, following the one-hour season finale of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (which was its lead-in). The show began with a &quot;pregame&quot; show hosted by Bob Costas, followed by the final 98-minute episode itself. NBC affiliates then aired tributes to &quot;Cheers&quot; during their local newscasts, and the night concluded with a special &quot;Tonight Show&quot; broadcast live from the Bull &amp; Finch Pub. Although the episode fell short of its hyped ratings predictions to become the most-watched television episode, it was the most watched show that year, bringing in 93 million viewers (64 percent of all viewers that night), almost 40% of the US population at the time, and ranked 11th all time in entertainment programming. The 1993 final broadcast of &quot;Cheers&quot; also emerged as the highest rated broadcast of NBC to date, as well as the most watched single episode from any television series throughout the decade 1990s on U.S. television.

The episode originally aired in the usual &quot;Cheers&quot; spot of Thursday night, and was then rebroadcast on Sunday. While the original broadcast did not outperform the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; finale, the combined non-repeating audiences for the Thursday and Sunday showings did. Television had greatly changed between the two finales, leaving &quot;Cheers&quot; with a broader array of competition for ratings.

NBC timeslots:
* Season 1 Episodes 1–12: Thursday at 9:00 pm
* Season 1 Episode 13 – Season 2 Episode 10: Thursday at 9:30 pm
* Season 2 Episode 11 – Season 11 Episode 28: Thursday at 9:00 pm

===Serialized storylines===
Although not the first sitcom to do it, &quot;Cheers&quot; employed the use of end-of-season cliffhangers and, starting with the third season, the show&#x27;s storylines became more serialized. The show&#x27;s success helped make such multi-episode story arcs popular on sitcoms, which Les Charles regrets.
[W]e may have been partly responsible for what&#x27;s going on now, where if you miss the first episode or two, you are lost. You have to wait until you can get the whole thing on DVD and catch up with it. If that blood is on our hands, I feel kind of badly about it. It can be very frustrating.&quot;

&quot;Cheers&quot; began with a limited five-character ensemble consisting of Ted Danson, Shelley Long, Rhea Perlman, Nicholas Colasanto and George Wendt. &quot;Cheers&quot; was able to gradually phase in characters such as Cliff, Frasier, Lilith, Rebecca, and Woody. By the time season 10 began, the show had eight front characters in its roster.

===Awards and honors===

Over its eleven-season run, the &quot;Cheers&quot; cast and crew earned many awards. The show garnered a record 111 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with a total of 28 wins. In addition, &quot;Cheers&quot; earned 31 Golden Globe nominations, with a total of six wins. Danson, Long, Alley, Perlman, Wendt, Ratzenberger, Harrelson, Grammer, Neuwirth, and Colasanto all received Emmy nominations for their roles. &quot;Cheers&quot; won the Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best TV-Series – Comedy/Musical&quot; in 1991 and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1983, 1984, 1989, and 1991. The series was presented with the &quot;Legend Award&quot; at the 2006 TV Land Awards, with many of the surviving cast members attending the event.

The following are awards that have been earned by the &quot;Cheers&quot; cast and crew over its 11-season run:
==Distribution==

===Syndication===
&quot;Cheers&quot; grew in popularity as it aired on American television and entered off-network syndication in 1987, initially distributed by Paramount Domestic Television. When the show went off the air in 1993, &quot;Cheers&quot; was syndicated in 38 countries, with 179 American television markets and 83 million viewers. When the quality of some earlier footage of &quot;Cheers&quot; began to deteriorate, it underwent a careful restoration in 2001. The series aired on Nick at Nite from 2001 to 2004 and on TV Land from 2004 to 2008, with Nick at Nite airing week-long &quot;Cheers&quot; &quot;Everybody Knows Your Name&quot; marathons. The show was removed from the lineup in 2004.
The series began airing on Hallmark Channel in the United States in October 2008, and WGN America in 2009. In January 2011, Reelz Channel began airing the series in hour-long blocks. MeTV began airing &quot;Cheers&quot; weeknights in 2010. USA Network has aired the series on Sunday early mornings and weekday mornings to allow it to show extended-length films of hours and maintain symmetric schedules.

In 2011, &quot;Cheers&quot; was made available on the Netflix and Amazon Prime Video streaming services.

&quot;Cheers&quot; began airing on Eleven (a digital channel of Network Ten) in Australia on January 11, 2011. NCRV in the Netherlands aired all 275 episodes in sequence, once per night, repeating the series a total of three times.

In Italy, it has previously aired on Italia 1 &amp; Canale 5 as &quot;Cin Cin&quot; from 1985 until 1995.

&quot;Cheers&quot; was first screened in the UK on Channel 4, and was one of the then-fledgling network&#x27;s first imports. As of 2012, &quot;Cheers&quot; has been repeated on UK satellite channel CBS Drama. It has also been shown on the UK free-to-air channel ITV4, with two episodes every weeknight. On March 16, 2015, the series began airing on UK subscription channel Gold on weekdays at 9:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. &quot;Cheers&quot; aired again daily in 2019 on Channel 4.

====High definition====
A high-definition transfer of &quot;Cheers&quot; began running on HDNet in the United States in August 2010. The program was originally shot on film (but transferred to and edited on videotape) and broadcast in a 4:3 aspect ratio.

===Home media===
Paramount Home Entertainment and (from 2006 onward) CBS Home Entertainment have released all 11 seasons of &quot;Cheers&quot; on DVD in Region 1, Region 2, and Region 4. In the US, some episodes from the final three seasons appear on the DVDs with music substitutions. For example, in the episode &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; was replaced even though its removal affects the comedic value of the scenes in which it was originally heard. The finale episode (73 minutes long without commercials) is presented in its three-part syndicated cut. The series is also available in high-definition Blu-ray.

On March 6, 2012, CBS released &quot;Fan Favorites: The Best of Cheers&quot;. Based on the 2012 Facebook poll, the selected episodes are:

# &quot;Give Me a Ring Sometime&quot; (season 1, episode 1)
# &quot;Diane&#x27;s Perfect Date&quot; (season 1, episode 17)
# &quot;Pick a Con, Any Con&quot; (season 1, episode 19)
# &quot;Abnormal Psychology&quot; (season 5, episode 4)
# &quot;Thanksgiving Orphans&quot; (season 5, episode 9)
# &quot;Dinner at Eight-ish&quot; (season 5, episode 20)
# &quot;Simon Says&quot; (season 5, episode 21)
# &quot;An Old-Fashioned Wedding&quot;, parts one and two (season 10, episodes 25)

On May 5, 2015, CBS DVD released &quot;Cheers – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

===Digital media distribution===
The complete 11 seasons of &quot;Cheers&quot; are available through the iTunes Store, Amazon Prime Video, Peacock and Hulu in high definition. In Canada, all seasons are available on streaming service Crave.

The entire series was available in the UK on All 4.

==Licensing==
The series lent itself naturally to the development of &quot;Cheers&quot; bar-related merchandise, culminating in the development of a chain of &quot;Cheers&quot; themed pubs. Paramount&#x27;s licensing group, led by Tom McGrath, developed the &quot;Cheers&quot; pub concept initially in partnership with Host Marriott, which placed &quot;Cheers&quot; themed pubs in over 15 airports around the world. Boston boasts the original &quot;Cheers&quot; bar, historically known to Boston insiders as the Bull and Finch; a Cheers restaurant in the Faneuil Hall marketplace; and Sam&#x27;s Place, a spin-off sports bar concept also located in Faneuil Hall. In 1997, Europe&#x27;s first officially licensed &quot;Cheers&quot; bar opened in London&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Street W1. Like Cheers Faneuil Hall, Cheers London is a replica of the set. The gala opening was attended by James Burrows and cast members George Wendt and John Ratzenberger. The &quot;Cheers&quot; bar in London closed on December 31, 2008. The actual bar set had been on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum until the museum&#x27;s closing in early 2006.

The theme song to the show was eventually licensed to a Canadian restaurant, Kelsey&#x27;s Neighbourhood Bar &amp; Grill.

CBS currently holds the rights to the &quot;Cheers&quot; franchise as a result of the 2005 Viacom split which saw Paramount transfer its entire television studio to CBS (both CBS and Viacom would reunite in 2019).

==Spin-offs==
Some of the actors and actresses from &quot;Cheers&quot; brought their characters onto other television shows, either in a guest appearance or on a new spin-off series. The most successful &quot;Cheers&quot; spin-off was &quot;Frasier&quot;, which featured Frasier Crane following his relocation back to Seattle, Washington. Sam, Diane, and Woody all individually appeared in &quot;Frasier&quot; episodes, with Lilith appearing as a guest on multiple episodes. In the season nine episode &quot;Cheerful Goodbyes&quot;, Frasier returns to Boston and meets up with the Cheers gang, later attending Cliff&#x27;s retirement party. &quot;Frasier&quot; was revived in 2023, moving back to Boston like &quot;Cheers&quot;.

Although &quot;Frasier&quot; was more successful, &quot;The Tortellis&quot; was the first series to spin off from &quot;Cheers&quot;, premiering in 1987. The show featured Carla&#x27;s ex-husband Nick Tortelli and his wife Loretta, but was canceled after 13 episodes and drew protests for its stereotypical depictions of Italian Americans.

==Crossovers==

In addition to direct spin-offs, several &quot;Cheers&quot; characters had guest appearance crossovers with other shows, including &quot;Wings&quot; and &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; (episode &quot;Cheers&quot;). &quot;Cheers&quot; has also been spoofed or referenced in other media, including &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (spoofing the title sequence and theme song in &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot;; actually visiting the place with vocal role reprises of the majority of the principal cast in &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;), &quot;Scrubs&quot; (episode &quot;My Life in Four Cameras&quot;), and the 2012 comedy film &quot;Ted&quot;.

The eighth-anniversary special of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, airing in 1990, begins with a scene at Cheers in which the bar&#x27;s TV gets stuck on NBC and all the bar patrons decide to go home instead of staying to watch David Letterman. The scene was re-used to open Letterman&#x27;s final episode in 1993. A similar scene aired in the Super Bowl XVII Pregame Show on NBC, in which the characters briefly discuss the upcoming game.

In 2019, members of the &quot;Cheers&quot; cast, Rhea Perlman, George Wendt, John Ratzenberger and Kirstie Alley reprised their characters in an episode of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; where they play customers of Geoff&#x27;s short-lived food delivery business.

In the 2010 show &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, the show &quot;Cheers&quot; is referenced a few times, usually by Ice King/Simon because it was his favorite show back when he was a human living in the 20th century. This is explored in greater detail in the 2023 spin-off series &quot;Fionna and Cake&quot;, which is partially set within the mind of Simon. All televisions in that world simply play an animated rendition of &quot;Cheers&quot; reruns on every channel, and the characters sometimes sing the theme song in difficult moments. The season finale of the show is simply entitled &quot;Cheers&quot;.

==Cultural references==
In Australia, &quot;Cheers&quot; is remembered for its role in the infamous cancellation of the 1992 Nine Network special &quot;Australia&#x27;s Naughtiest Home Videos&quot;. Due to the then-owner of Nine Network Kerry Packer&#x27;s objections to its content, &quot;Australia&#x27;s Naughtiest Home Videos&quot; was pulled off the air during its first and only broadcast; viewers saw the network abruptly begin airing a rerun of &quot;Cheers&quot; midway through the special, either after a scheduled commercial break or a Nine Network bumper claiming a technical problem. Nine Network&#x27;s affiliate in Perth didn&#x27;t air the special at all and filled its timeslot with two episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot;. When the program was re-aired in its entirety in 2008, it abruptly cut away to the opening of &quot;Cheers&quot; midway through in a reenactment of the incident before resuming the second half that didn&#x27;t get aired.

In an issue of X-Force, Vanessa Carlysle and her friend Tina Valentino go to a bar in Boston called &quot;Cheers&quot; with patrons bearing a striking resemblance to Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin, and flirt with a bartender named Sam who looks exactly like Sam Malone.

In the Cheers episode &quot;Woody For Hire, Norman Meets the Apes&quot; Woody shows and tells everyone how he was an extra on Boston based drama &quot;&quot;. In the season 4 episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; titled &quot;The Pitch&quot;, Jerry and George are presenting their idea for a sitcom to NBC executives. George is unhappy with their offer and feels that he deserves the same salary as Ted Danson which he claims was $800,000 per episode, being that &quot;Cheers&quot; is also an NBC show. Danson&#x27;s reported salary was actually $250,000 per episode. At this point Cheers was in its 10th season and Ted Danson had won an Emmy and a Golden Globe the year before. In another Seinfeld episode, The Trip, George runs into George Wendt (portraying himself) while backstage on the set of The Tonight Show and annoys him by suggesting that the series change its setting from a bar to a rec room or community center.

In the seventh episode of the second season of &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, a coffee shop barista mistakenly hears Barney&#x27;s name as &quot;Swarley&quot; and writes it on his cup. This leads to a running gag in which everyone mercilessly refers to Barney as &quot;Swarley&quot; despite his protests, which culminates in everyone in McClaren&#x27;s bar shouting &quot;Swarley&quot; when he enters and playing the Cheers theme song. The credits are then shown in the &quot;Cheers&quot; style. In the season seven episode, In Tailgate, Ted and Barney are outraged with the price to get into MacLaren&#x27;s on New Year&#x27;s Eve, so they offer for everyone to come upstairs. In the apartment, there is a puzzles sign that is designed to parody Cheers. Ted and Barney employ Kevin as their bartender, and they invent a theme song which also parodies the Cheers theme song.

In the 2004 video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;, &quot;Jeers&quot; is set in Boston, with the typeface referencing the &quot;Cheers&quot; logo. It is located down a set of stairs, and when near the front door, there is bar chatter coming from inside.

In the 2015 video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, which is set in Boston, there is a bar named Prost Bar near Boston Common that, when entered, is an almost exact replica of the bar featured on the series. It includes two dead bodies sitting at the end of the bar, with one of them wearing a mail carrier&#x27;s uniform, a direct reference to regular barfly Cliff Clavin.

In the season 2 finale of the NBC sitcom &quot;The Good Place&quot;, Ted Danson&#x27;s character Michael appears as a bartender while wearing a blue plaid button-down, in a clear homage to Danson&#x27;s character in &quot;Cheers&quot;.

==Remake==
In September 2011, Plural Entertainment debuted a remake of the series on Spanish television, also titled &quot;Cheers&quot;. Set at an Irish pub, it starred Alberto San Juan as Nicolás &quot;Nico&quot; Arnedo, the equivalent of Sam Malone on the original series. It also used the original theme song, rerecorded in Spanish by Dani Martín, under the title &quot;Donde la gente se divierte.&quot;

In December 2012, The Irish Film and Television Network announced that casting was underway on an Irish-language version of &quot;Cheers&quot; produced by production company Sideline. The new show, tentatively titled &quot;Teach Seán&quot;, would air on Ireland&#x27;s TG4 and features a main character who, like Sam Malone, is a bar owner, a retired athlete, and a recovering alcoholic. However, because of being set in Ireland, the barman is a &quot;former hurling star&quot; rather than an ex-baseball player. As of August 2019, the Irish remake has not occurred.

==&quot;Cheers: Live on Stage&quot;==
On September 9, 2016, a stage adaptation called &quot;Cheers: Live on Stage&quot; opened at the Shubert Theatre in Boston. Comprising pieces of the original TV series, the play was adapted by Erik Forrest Jackson. It was produced by Troika/Stageworks. The director was Matt Lenz. It starred Grayson Powell as Sam Malone, Jillian Louis as Diane Chambers, Barry Pearl as Ernie &quot;Coach&quot; Pantusso, Sarah Sirotta as Carla Tortelli, Paul Vogt as Norm Peterson, and Buzz Roddy as Cliff Clavin. The production was scheduled to tour through 2017, but was cancelled in 2016.

<text>In music theory, counterpoint is the relationship of two or more simultaneous musical lines (also called voices) that are harmonically interdependent yet independent in rhythm and melodic contour. The term originates from the Latin &quot;punctus contra punctum&quot; meaning &quot;point against point&quot;, i.e. &quot;note against note&quot;. John Rahn describes counterpoint as follows:

Counterpoint has been most commonly identified in the European classical tradition, strongly developing during the Renaissance and in much of the common practice period, especially in the Baroque period. In Western pedagogy, counterpoint is taught through a system of species (see below).

There are several different forms of counterpoint, including imitative counterpoint and free counterpoint. Imitative counterpoint involves the repetition of a main melodic idea across different vocal parts, with or without variation. Compositions written in free counterpoint often incorporate non-traditional harmonies and chords, chromaticism and dissonance.

==General principles==
The term &quot;counterpoint&quot; has been used to designate a voice or even an entire composition. Counterpoint focuses on melodic interaction—only secondarily on the harmonies produced by that interaction.

Work initiated by Guerino Mazzola (born 1947) has given counterpoint theory a mathematical foundation. In particular, Mazzola&#x27;s model gives a structural (and not psychological) foundation of forbidden parallels of fifths and the dissonant fourth. Octavio Agustin has extended the model to microtonal contexts. Another theorist who has tried to incorporate mathematical principles in his study of counterpoint is Sergei Taneyev (1856-1915). Inspired by Spinoza, Taneyev developed a theory which covers and generalizes a wide range of advanced contrapuntal phenomena, including what is known to the english-speaking theorists as invertible counterpoint (although he describes them mainly using his own, custom-built terminology), by means of linking them to simple algebraic procedures.

In counterpoint, the &quot;functional independence&quot; of voices is the prime concern. The violation of this principle leads to special effects, which are avoided in counterpoint. In organ registers, certain interval combinations and chords are activated by a single key so that playing a melody results in parallel voice leading. These voices, losing independence, are fused into one and the parallel chords are perceived as single tones with a new timbre. This effect is also used in orchestral arrangements; for instance, in Ravel&#x27;s Bolero #5 the parallel parts of flutes, horn and celesta resemble the sound of an electric organ. In counterpoint, parallel voices are prohibited because they violate the heterogeneity of musical texture when independent voices occasionally disappear turning into a new timbre quality and vice versa.

==Development==
Some examples of related compositional techniques include: the round (familiar in folk traditions), the canon, and perhaps the most complex contrapuntal convention: the fugue. All of these are examples of imitative counterpoint.

==Examples from the repertoire==
There are many examples of song melodies that are harmonically interdependent yet independent in rhythm and melodic contour. For example, &quot;Frère Jacques&quot; and &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; combine euphoniously when sung together. A number of popular songs that share the same chord progression can also be sung together as counterpoint. A well-known pair of examples is &quot;My Way&quot; combined with &quot;Life on Mars&quot;.

Johann Sebastian Bach is revered as one of the greatest masters of counterpoint. For example the harmony implied in the opening subject of the Fugue in G-sharp minor from Book II of &quot;the Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; is heard anew in a subtle way when a second voice is added. &quot;The counterpoint in bars 5-8... sheds an unexpected light on the tonality of the Subject.&quot;: 

Bach&#x27;s 3-part Invention in F minor combines three independent melodies:

According to pianist András Schiff, Bach&#x27;s counterpoint influenced the composing of both Mozart and Beethoven. In the development section of the opening movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata in E minor, Beethoven demonstrates this influence by adding &quot;a wonderful counterpoint&quot; to one of the main themes.

A further example of fluid counterpoint in late Beethoven may be found in the first orchestral variation on the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; theme in the last movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9, bars 116–123. The famous theme is heard on the violas and cellos, while &quot;the basses add a bass-line whose sheer unpredictability gives the impression that it is being spontaneously improvised. Meantime a solo bassoon adds a counterpoint that has a similarly impromptu quality.&quot;

In the Prelude to Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, three themes from the opera are combined simultaneously. According to Gordon Jacob, &quot;This is universally and justly acclaimed as an extraordinary feat of virtuosity.&quot; However, Donald Tovey points out that here &quot;the combination of themes ... unlike classical counterpoint, really do not of themselves combine into complete or euphonious harmony.&quot;

One spectacular example of 5-voice counterpoint can be found in the finale to Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No 41 (&quot;Jupiter&quot; Symphony). Here five tunes combine simultaneously in &quot;a rich tapestry of dialogue&quot;:
See also Invertible counterpoint.

== Species counterpoint ==

Species counterpoint was developed as a pedagogical tool in which students progress through several &quot;species&quot; of increasing complexity, with a very simple part that remains constant known as the cantus firmus (Latin for &quot;fixed melody&quot;). Species counterpoint generally offers less freedom to the composer than other types of counterpoint and therefore is called a &quot;strict&quot; counterpoint. The student gradually attains the ability to write &quot;free&quot; counterpoint (that is, less rigorously constrained counterpoint, usually without a cantus firmus) according to the given rules at the time. The idea is at least as old as 1532, when Giovanni Maria Lanfranco described a similar concept in his &quot;Scintille di musica&quot; (Brescia, 1533). The 16th-century Venetian theorist Zarlino elaborated on the idea in his influential &quot;Le institutioni harmoniche&quot;, and it was first presented in a codified form in 1619 by Lodovico Zacconi in his &quot;Prattica di musica&quot;. Zacconi, unlike later theorists, included a few extra contrapuntal techniques, such as invertible counterpoint.

In 1725 Johann Joseph Fux published &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; (Steps to Parnassus), in which he described five species:

# Note against note;
# Two notes against one;
# Four notes against one;
# Notes offset against each other (as suspensions);
# All the first four species together, as &quot;florid&quot; counterpoint.

A succession of later theorists quite closely imitated Fux&#x27;s seminal work, often with some small and idiosyncratic modifications in the rules. Many of Fux&#x27;s rules concerning the purely linear construction of melodies have their origin in solfeggio. Concerning the common practice era, alterations to the melodic rules were introduced to enable the function of certain harmonic forms. The combination of these melodies produced the basic harmonic structure, the figured bass.

===Considerations for all species===
The following rules apply to melodic writing in each species, for each part:

# The final note must be approached by step. If the final is approached from below, then the leading tone must be raised in a minor key (Dorian, Hypodorian, Aeolian, Hypoaeolian), but not in Phrygian or Hypophrygian mode. Thus, in the Dorian mode on D, a C is necessary at the cadence.
# Permitted melodic intervals are the perfect unison, fourth, fifth, and octave, as well as the major and minor second, major and minor third, and ascending minor sixth. The ascending minor sixth must be immediately followed by motion downwards.
# If writing two skips in the same direction—something that must be only rarely done—the second must be smaller than the first, and the interval between the first and the third note may not be dissonant. The three notes should be from the same triad; if this is impossible, they should not outline more than one octave. In general, do not write more than two skips in the same direction.
# If writing a skip in one direction, it is best to proceed after the skip with step-wise motion in the other direction.
# The interval of a tritone in three notes should be avoided (for example, an ascending melodic motion F–A–B) as is the interval of a seventh in three notes.
# There must be a climax or high point in the line countering the cantus firmus. This usually occurs somewhere in the middle of exercise and must occur on a strong beat.
# An outlining of a seventh is avoided within a single line moving in the same direction.

And, in all species, the following rules govern the combination of the parts:

# The counterpoint must begin and end on a perfect consonance.
# Contrary motion should dominate.
# Perfect consonances must be approached by oblique or contrary motion.
# Imperfect consonances may be approached by any type of motion.
# The interval of a tenth should not be exceeded between two adjacent parts unless by necessity.
# Build from the bass, upward.

=== First species ===
In &quot;first species&quot; counterpoint, each note in every added part (parts being also referred to as &quot;lines&quot; or &quot;voices&quot;) sounds against one note in the cantus firmus. Notes in all parts are sounded simultaneously, and move against each other simultaneously. Since all notes in First species counterpoint are whole notes, rhythmic independence is not available.

In the present context, a &quot;step&quot; is a melodic interval of a half or whole step. A &quot;skip&quot; is an interval of a third or fourth. (See Steps and skips.) An interval of a fifth or larger is referred to as a &quot;leap&quot;.

A few further rules given by Fux, by study of the Palestrina style, and usually given in the works of later counterpoint pedagogues, are as follows.

# Begin and end on either the unison, octave, or fifth, unless the added part is underneath, in which case begin and end only on unison or octave.
# Use no unisons except at the beginning or end.
# Avoid parallel fifths or octaves between any two parts; and avoid &quot;hidden&quot; parallel fifths or octaves: that is, movement by similar motion to a perfect fifth or octave, unless one part (sometimes restricted to the &quot;higher&quot; of the parts) moves by step.
# Avoid moving in parallel fourths. (In practice Palestrina and others frequently allowed themselves such progressions, especially if they do not involve the lowest of the parts.)
# Do not use an interval more than three times in a row.
# Attempt to use up to three parallel thirds or sixths in a row.
# Attempt to keep any two adjacent parts within a tenth of each other, unless an exceptionally pleasing line can be written by moving outside that range.
# Avoid having any two parts move in the same direction by skip.
# Attempt to have as much contrary motion as possible.
# Avoid dissonant intervals between any two parts: major or minor second, major or minor seventh, any augmented or diminished interval, and perfect fourth (in many contexts).

In the adjacent example in two parts, the cantus firmus is the lower part. (The same cantus firmus is used for later examples also. Each is in the Dorian mode.)

===Second species===
In &quot;second species&quot; counterpoint, two notes in each of the added parts work against each longer note in the given part.
Additional considerations in second species counterpoint are as follows, and are in addition to the considerations for first species:
# It is permissible to begin on an upbeat, leaving a half-rest in the added voice.
# The accented beat must have only consonance (perfect or imperfect). The unaccented beat may have dissonance, but only as a passing tone, i.e. it must be approached and left by step in the same direction.
# Avoid the interval of the unison except at the beginning or end of the example, except that it may occur on the unaccented portion of the bar.
# Use caution with successive accented perfect fifths or octaves. They must not be used as part of a sequential pattern. The example shown is weak due to similar motion in the second measure in both voices. A good rule to follow: if one voice skips or jumps try to use step-wise motion in the other voice or at the very least contrary motion.

===Third species===

In &quot;third species&quot; counterpoint, four (or three, etc.) notes move against each longer note in the given part.

Three special figures are introduced into third species and later added to fifth species, and ultimately outside the restrictions of &quot;species writing&quot;. There are three figures to consider: The &quot;nota cambiata&quot;, &quot;double neighbor tones&quot;, and &quot;double passing tones&quot;.

Double neighbor tones: the figure is prolonged over four beats and allows special dissonances. The upper and lower tones are prepared on beat 1 and resolved on beat 4. The fifth note or downbeat of the next measure should move by step in the same direction as the last two notes of the double neighbor figure. Lastly a double passing tone allows two dissonant passing tones in a row. The figure would consist of 4 notes moving in the same direction by step. The two notes that allow dissonance would be beat 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. The dissonant interval of a fourth would proceed into a diminished fifth and the next note would resolve at the interval of a sixth.


===Fourth species===
In &quot;fourth species&quot; counterpoint, some notes are sustained or &quot;suspended&quot; in an added part while notes move against them in the given part, often creating a dissonance on the beat, followed by the suspended note then changing (and &quot;catching up&quot;) to create a subsequent consonance with the note in the given part as it continues to sound. As before, fourth species counterpoint is called &quot;expanded&quot; when the added-part notes vary in length among themselves. The technique requires chains of notes sustained across the boundaries determined by beat, and so creates syncopation. A dissonant interval is allowed on beat 1 because of the syncopation created by the suspension. While it is not incorrect to start with a half note, it is also common to start 4th species with a half rest.

===Fifth species (florid counterpoint)===
In &quot;fifth species&quot; counterpoint, sometimes called &quot;florid counterpoint&quot;, the other four species of counterpoint are combined within the added parts. In the example, the first and second bars are second species, the third bar is third species, the fourth and fifth bars are third and embellished fourth species, and the final bar is first species. In florid counterpoint it is important that no one species dominates the composition.

==Contrapuntal derivations==
Since the Renaissance period in European music, much contrapuntal music has been written in imitative counterpoint. In imitative counterpoint, two or more voices enter at different times, and (especially when entering) each voice repeats some version of the same melodic element. The fantasia, the ricercar, and later, the canon and fugue (the contrapuntal form &quot;par excellence&quot;) all feature imitative counterpoint, which also frequently appears in choral works such as motets and madrigals. Imitative counterpoint spawned a number of devices, including:

;Melodic inversion: The inverse of a given fragment of melody is the fragment turned upside down—so if the original fragment has a rising major third (see interval), the inverted fragment has a falling major (or perhaps minor) third, etc. (Compare, in twelve-tone technique, the inversion of the tone row, which is the so-called prime series turned upside down.) (Note: in &quot;invertible counterpoint&quot;, including &quot;double&quot; and &quot;triple counterpoint&quot;, the term &quot;inversion&quot; is used in a different sense altogether. At least one pair of parts is switched, so that the one that was higher becomes lower. See Inversion in counterpoint; it is not a kind of imitation, but a rearrangement of the parts.)
;Retrograde: Whereby an imitative voice sounds the melody backwards in relation to the leading voice.
;Retrograde inversion: Where the imitative voice sounds the melody backwards and upside-down at once.
;Augmentation: When in one of the parts in imitative counterpoint the note values are extended in duration compared to the rate at which they were sounded when introduced.
;Diminution: When in one of the parts in imitative counterpoint the note values are reduced in duration compared to the rate at which they were sounded when introduced.

==Free counterpoint==
Broadly speaking, due to the development of harmony, from the Baroque period on, most contrapuntal compositions were written in the style of free counterpoint. This means that the general focus of the composer had shifted away from how the intervals of added melodies related to a &quot;cantus firmus&quot;, and more toward how they related to each other.

Nonetheless, according to Kent Kennan: &quot;...actual teaching in that fashion (free counterpoint) did not become widespread until the late nineteenth century.&quot; Young composers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Schumann, were still educated in the style of &quot;strict&quot; counterpoint, but in practice, they would look for ways to expand on the traditional concepts of the subject.

Main features of free counterpoint:
# All forbidden chords, such as second-inversion, seventh, ninth etc., can be used freely as long as they resolve to a consonant triad
# Chromaticism is allowed
# The restrictions about rhythmic-placement of dissonance are removed. It is possible to use passing tones on the accented beat
# Appoggiatura is available: dissonance tones can be approached by leaps.

==Linear counterpoint==
Linear counterpoint is &quot;a purely horizontal technique in which the integrity of the individual melodic lines is not sacrificed to harmonic considerations. &quot;Its distinctive feature is rather the concept of melody, which served as the starting-point for the adherents of the &#x27;new objectivity&#x27; when they set up linear counterpoint as an anti-type to the Romantic harmony.&quot; The voice parts move freely, irrespective of the effects their combined motions may create.&quot; In other words, either &quot;the domination of the horizontal (linear) aspects over the vertical&quot; is featured or the &quot;harmonic control of lines is rejected.&quot;

Associated with neoclassicism, the technique was first used in Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Octet&quot; (1923), inspired by J. S. Bach and Giovanni Palestrina. However, according to Knud Jeppesen: &quot;Bach&#x27;s and Palestrina&#x27;s points of departure are antipodal. Palestrina starts out from lines and arrives at chords; Bach&#x27;s music grows out of an ideally harmonic background, against which the voices develop with a bold independence that is often breath-taking.&quot;

According to Cunningham, linear harmony is &quot;a frequent approach in the 20th century...[in which lines] are combined with almost careless abandon in the hopes that new &#x27;chords&#x27; and &#x27;progressions&#x27;...will result.&quot; It is possible with &quot;any kind of line, diatonic or duodecuple&quot;.

==Dissonant counterpoint==
Dissonant counterpoint was originally theorized by Charles Seeger as &quot;at first purely a school-room discipline,&quot; consisting of species counterpoint but with all the traditional rules reversed. First species counterpoint must be all dissonances, establishing &quot;dissonance, rather than consonance, as the rule,&quot; and consonances are &quot;resolved&quot; through a skip, not step. He wrote that &quot;the effect of this discipline&quot; was &quot;one of purification&quot;. Other aspects of composition, such as rhythm, could be &quot;dissonated&quot; by applying the same principle.

Seeger was not the first to employ dissonant counterpoint, but was the first to theorize and promote it. Other composers who have used dissonant counterpoint, if not in the exact manner prescribed by Charles Seeger, include Johanna Beyer, John Cage, Ruth Crawford-Seeger, Vivian Fine, Carl Ruggles, Henry Cowell, Carlos Chávez, John J. Becker, Henry Brant, Lou Harrison, Wallingford Riegger, and Frank Wigglesworth.

<text>In chemistry, cyanide () is a chemical compound that contains a functional group. This group, known as the cyano group, consists of a carbon atom triple-bonded to a nitrogen atom.

In inorganic cyanides, the cyanide group is present as the cyanide anion . This anion is extremely poisonous. Soluble salts such as sodium cyanide (NaCN) and potassium cyanide (KCN) are highly toxic. Hydrocyanic acid, also known as hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, is a highly volatile liquid that is produced on a large scale industrially. It is obtained by acidification of cyanide salts.

Organic cyanides are usually called nitriles. In nitriles, the group is linked by a single covalent bond to carbon. For example, in acetonitrile (), the cyanide group is bonded to methyl (). Although nitriles generally do not release cyanide ions, the cyanohydrins do and are thus toxic.

==Bonding==
The cyanide ion is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide and with molecular nitrogen N≡N. A triple bond exists between C and N. The negative charge is concentrated on carbon C.

==Occurrence==

===In nature===

Cyanides are produced by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae. It is an antifeedant in a number of plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of bitter almonds, apricots, apples, and peaches. Chemical compounds that can release cyanide are known as cyanogenic compounds. In plants, cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.

The Madagascar bamboo &quot;Cathariostachys madagascariensis&quot; produces cyanide as a deterrent to grazing. In response, the golden bamboo lemur, which eats the bamboo, has developed a high tolerance to cyanide.

The hydrogenase enzymes contain cyanide ligands attached to iron in their active sites. The biosynthesis of cyanide in the NiFe hydrogenases proceeds from carbamoyl phosphate, which converts to cysteinyl thiocyanate, the donor.

===Interstellar medium===
The cyanide radical •CN has been identified in interstellar space. Cyanogen, , is used to measure the temperature of interstellar gas clouds.

===Pyrolysis and combustion product===
Hydrogen cyanide is produced by the combustion or pyrolysis of certain materials under oxygen-deficient conditions. For example, it can be detected in the exhaust of internal combustion engines and tobacco smoke. Certain plastics, especially those derived from acrylonitrile, release hydrogen cyanide when heated or burnt.

===Organic derivatives===
In IUPAC nomenclature, organic compounds that have a functional group are called nitriles. An example of a nitrile is acetonitrile, . Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions. A functional group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon atom is called cyanohydrin (). Unlike nitriles, cyanohydrins do release poisonous hydrogen cyanide.

==Reactions==
===Protonation===
Cyanide is basic. The p&quot;K&quot;a of hydrogen cyanide is 9.21. Thus, addition of acids stronger than hydrogen cyanide to solutions of cyanide salts releases hydrogen cyanide.

===Hydrolysis===
Cyanide is unstable in water, but the reaction is slow until about 170 °C. It undergoes hydrolysis to give ammonia and formate, which are far less toxic than cyanide:
Cyanide hydrolase is an enzyme that catalyzes this reaction.

===Alkylation===
Because of the cyanide anion&#x27;s high nucleophilicity, cyano groups are readily introduced into organic molecules by displacement of a halide group (e.g., the chloride on methyl chloride). In general, organic cyanides are called nitriles. In organic synthesis, cyanide is a C-1 synthon; i.e., it can be used to lengthen a carbon chain by one, while retaining the ability to be .

===Redox===
The cyanide ion is a reductant and is oxidized by strong oxidizing agents such as molecular chlorine (), hypochlorite (), and hydrogen peroxide (). These oxidizers are used to destroy cyanides in effluents from gold mining.

===Metal complexation===
The cyanide anion reacts with transition metals to form M-CN bonds. This reaction is the basis of cyanide&#x27;s toxicity. The high affinities of metals for this anion can be attributed to its negative charge, compactness, and ability to engage in π-bonding.

Among the most important cyanide coordination compounds are the potassium ferrocyanide and the pigment Prussian blue, which are both essentially nontoxic due to the tight binding of the cyanides to a central iron atom.
Prussian blue was first accidentally made around 1706, by heating substances containing iron and carbon and nitrogen, and other cyanides made subsequently (and named after it). Among its many uses, Prussian blue gives the blue color to blueprints, bluing, and cyanotypes.

==Manufacture==

The principal process used to manufacture cyanides is the Andrussow process in which gaseous hydrogen cyanide is produced from methane and ammonia in the presence of oxygen and a platinum catalyst.

Sodium cyanide, the precursor to most cyanides, is produced by treating hydrogen cyanide with sodium hydroxide:

==Toxicity==

Among the most toxic cyanides are hydrogen cyanide (), sodium cyanide (), potassium cyanide (), and calcium cyanide (). The cyanide anion is an inhibitor of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (also known as aa3), the fourth complex of the electron transport chain found in the inner membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. It attaches to the iron within this protein. The binding of cyanide to this enzyme prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that depend highly on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. This is an example of histotoxic hypoxia.

The most hazardous compound is hydrogen cyanide, which is a gas and kills by inhalation. For this reason, working with hydrogen cyanide requires wearing an air respirator supplied by an external oxygen source. Hydrogen cyanide is produced by adding acid to a solution containing a cyanide salt. Alkaline solutions of cyanide are safer to use because they do not evolve hydrogen cyanide gas. Hydrogen cyanide may be produced in the combustion of polyurethanes; for this reason, polyurethanes are not recommended for use in domestic and aircraft furniture. Oral ingestion of a small quantity of solid cyanide or a cyanide solution of as little as 200 mg, or exposure to airborne cyanide of 270 ppm, is sufficient to cause death within minutes.

Organic nitriles do not readily release cyanide ions, and so have low toxicities. By contrast, compounds such as trimethylsilyl cyanide readily release HCN or the cyanide ion upon contact with water.

===Antidote===
Hydroxocobalamin reacts with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, which can be safely eliminated by the kidneys. This method has the advantage of avoiding the formation of methemoglobin (see below). This antidote kit is sold under the brand name Cyanokit and was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2006.

An older cyanide antidote kit included administration of three substances: amyl nitrite pearls (administered by inhalation), sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate. The goal of the antidote was to generate a large pool of ferric iron () to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a3 (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The nitrites oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the cytochrome oxidase enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to thiocyanate by the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese. Thiocyanate is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for rhodanese, needed in order to produce thiocyanate.

===Sensitivity===
Minimum risk levels (MRLs) may not protect for delayed health effects or health effects acquired following repeated sublethal exposure, such as hypersensitivity, asthma, or bronchitis. MRLs may be revised after sufficient data accumulates.

==Applications==

===Mining===

Cyanide is mainly produced for the mining of silver and gold: It helps dissolve these metals allowing separation from the other solids. In the &quot;cyanide process&quot;, finely ground high-grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (at a ratio of about 1:500 parts NaCN to ore); low-grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (at a ratio of about 1:1000 parts NaCN to ore). The precious metals are complexed by the cyanide anions to form soluble derivatives, e.g., (dicyanoargentate(I)) and (dicyanoaurate(I)). Silver is less &quot;noble&quot; than gold and often occurs as the sulfide, in which case redox is not invoked (no is required). Instead, a displacement reaction occurs:
:
The &quot;pregnant liquor&quot; containing these ions is separated from the solids, which are discarded to a tailing pond or spent heap, the recoverable gold having been removed. The metal is recovered from the &quot;pregnant solution&quot; by reduction with zinc dust or by adsorption onto activated carbon. This process can result in environmental and health problems. A number of environmental disasters have followed the overflow of tailing ponds at gold mines. Cyanide contamination of waterways has resulted in numerous cases of human and aquatic species mortality.

Aqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, especially in sunlight. It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present. Gold can also be associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is similar to iron pyrite (fool&#x27;s gold), wherein half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by arsenic. Gold-containing arsenopyrite ores are similarly reactive toward inorganic cyanide.

===Industrial organic chemistry===
The second major application of alkali metal cyanides (after mining) is in the production of CN-containing compounds, usually nitriles. Acyl cyanides are produced from acyl chlorides and cyanide. Cyanogen, cyanogen chloride, and the trimer cyanuric chloride are derived from alkali metal cyanides.

===Medical uses===
The cyanide compound sodium nitroprusside is used mainly in clinical chemistry to measure urine ketone bodies mainly as a follow-up to diabetic patients. On occasion, it is used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in blood pressure in humans; it is also used as a vasodilator in vascular research. The cobalt in artificial vitamin B12 contains a cyanide ligand as an artifact of the purification process; this must be removed by the body before the vitamin molecule can be activated for biochemical use. During World War I, a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by Japanese physicians for the treatment of tuberculosis and leprosy.

===Illegal fishing and poaching===

Cyanides are illegally used to capture live fish near coral reefs for the aquarium and seafood markets. The practice is controversial, dangerous, and damaging but is driven by the lucrative exotic fish market.

Poachers in Africa have been known to use cyanide to poison waterholes, to kill elephants for their ivory.

===Pest control===
M44 cyanide devices are used in the United States to kill coyotes and other canids. Cyanide is also used for pest control in New Zealand, particularly for possums, an introduced marsupial that threatens the conservation of native species and spreads tuberculosis amongst cattle. Possums can become bait shy but the use of pellets containing the cyanide reduces bait shyness. Cyanide has been known to kill native birds, including the endangered kiwi. Cyanide is also effective for controlling the dama wallaby, another introduced marsupial pest in New Zealand. A licence is required to store, handle and use cyanide in New Zealand.

Cyanides are used as insecticides for fumigating ships. Cyanide salts are used for killing ants, and have in some places been used as rat poison (the less toxic poison arsenic is more common).

===Niche uses===
Potassium ferrocyanide is used to achieve a blue color on cast bronze sculptures during the final finishing stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue. It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.

Cyanide is also used in jewelry-making and certain kinds of photography such as sepia toning.

Although usually thought to be toxic, cyanide and cyanohydrins increase germination in various plant species.

====Human poisoning====

Deliberate cyanide poisoning of humans has occurred many times throughout history.
Common salts such as sodium cyanide are involatile but water-soluble, so are poisonous by ingestion. Hydrogen cyanide is a gas, making it more indiscriminately dangerous, however it is lighter than air and rapidly disperses up into the atmosphere, which makes it ineffective as a chemical weapon.

====Food additive====
Because of the high stability of their complexation with iron, ferrocyanides (Sodium ferrocyanide E535, Potassium ferrocyanide E536, and Calcium ferrocyanide E538) do not decompose to lethal levels in the human body and are used in the food industry as, e.g., an anticaking agent in table salt.

==Chemical tests for cyanide==
Cyanide is quantified by potentiometric titration, a method widely used in gold mining. It can also be determined by titration with silver ion. 
Some analyses begin with an air-purge of an acidified boiling solution, sweeping the vapors into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt absorbed in the basic solution is then analyzed.

===Qualitative tests===
Because of the notorious toxicity of cyanide, many methods have been investigated. Benzidine gives a blue coloration in the presence of ferricyanide. Iron(II) sulfate added to a solution of cyanide, such as the filtrate from the sodium fusion test, gives prussian blue. A solution of &quot;para&quot;-benzoquinone in DMSO reacts with inorganic cyanide to form a cyanophenol, which is fluorescent. Illumination with a UV light gives a green/blue glow if the test is positive.

<text>A carbonate is a salt of carbonic acid, (), characterized by the presence of the carbonate ion, a polyatomic ion with the formula . The word &quot;carbonate&quot; may also refer to a carbonate ester, an organic compound containing the carbonate group .

The term is also used as a verb, to describe carbonation: the process of raising the concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate ions in water to produce carbonated water and other carbonated beverageseither by the addition of carbon dioxide gas under pressure or by dissolving carbonate or bicarbonate salts into the water.

In geology and mineralogy, the term &quot;carbonate&quot; can refer both to carbonate minerals and carbonate rock (which is made of chiefly carbonate minerals), and both are dominated by the carbonate ion, . Carbonate minerals are extremely varied and ubiquitous in chemically precipitated sedimentary rock. The most common are calcite or calcium carbonate, , the chief constituent of limestone (as well as the main component of mollusc shells and coral skeletons); dolomite, a calcium-magnesium carbonate ; and siderite, or iron(II) carbonate, , an important iron ore. Sodium carbonate (&quot;soda&quot; or &quot;natron&quot;), , and potassium carbonate (&quot;potash&quot;), , have been used since antiquity for cleaning and preservation, as well as for the manufacture of glass. Carbonates are widely used in industry, such as in iron smelting, as a raw material for Portland cement and lime manufacture, in the composition of ceramic glazes, and more. New applications of alkali metal carbonates include: thermal energy storage, catalysis and electrolyte both in fuel cell technology as well as in electrosynthesis of  in aqueous media.

==Structure and bonding==

The carbonate ion is the simplest oxocarbon anion. It consists of one carbon atom surrounded by three oxygen atoms, in a trigonal planar arrangement, with &quot;D&quot;3h molecular symmetry. It has a molecular mass of 60.01 g/mol and carries a total formal charge of −2. It is the conjugate base of the hydrogencarbonate (bicarbonate) ion, , which is the conjugate base of , carbonic acid.

The Lewis structure of the carbonate ion has two (long) single bonds to negative oxygen atoms, and one short double bond to a neutral oxygen atom.

This structure is incompatible with the observed symmetry of the ion, which implies that the three bonds are the same length and that the three oxygen atoms are equivalent. As in the case of the isoelectronic nitrate ion, the symmetry can be achieved by a resonance among three structures:

This resonance can be summarized by a model with fractional bonds and delocalized charges:

==Chemical properties==

Metal carbonates generally decompose on heating, liberating carbon dioxide leaving behind an oxide of the metal. This process is called calcination, after &quot;calx&quot;, the Latin name of quicklime or calcium oxide, CaO, which is obtained by roasting limestone in a lime kiln:
As illustrated by its affinity for , carbonate is a ligand for many metal cations. Transition metal carbonate and bicarbonate complexes feature metal ions covalently bonded to carbonate in a variety of bonding modes.

Lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and ammonium carbonates are water-soluble salts, but carbonates of 2+ and 3+ ions are often poorly soluble in water. Of the insoluble metal carbonates,  is important because, in the form of scale, it accumulates in and impedes flow through pipes. Hard water is rich in this material, giving rise to the need for infrastructural water softening.

Acidification of carbonates generally liberates carbon dioxide:
Thus, scale can be removed with acid.

In solution the equilibrium between carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide and carbonic acid is sensitive to pH, temperature, and pressure. Although di- and trivalent carbonates have low solubility, bicarbonate salts are far more soluble. This difference is related to the disparate lattice energies of solids composed of mono- vs dianions, as well as mono- vs dications.

In aqueous solution, carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and carbonic acid participate in a dynamic equilibrium. In strongly basic conditions, the carbonate ion predominates, while in weakly basic conditions, the bicarbonate ion is prevalent. In more acid conditions, aqueous carbon dioxide, , is the main form, which, with water, , is in equilibrium with carbonic acidthe equilibrium lies strongly towards carbon dioxide. Thus sodium carbonate is basic, sodium bicarbonate is weakly basic, while carbon dioxide itself is a weak acid.

==Organic carbonates==

In organic chemistry a carbonate can also refer to a functional group within a larger molecule that contains a carbon atom bound to three oxygen atoms, one of which is double bonded. These compounds are also known as organocarbonates or carbonate esters, and have the general formula , or . Important organocarbonates include dimethyl carbonate, the cyclic compounds ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, and the phosgene replacement, triphosgene.

==Buffer==
Three reversible reactions control the pH balance of blood and act as a buffer to stabilise it in the range 7.37–7.43:
# 

Exhaled depletes , which in turn consumes , causing the equilibrium of the first reaction to try to restore the level of carbonic acid by reacting bicarbonate with a hydrogen ion, an example of Le Châtelier&#x27;s principle. The result is to make the blood more alkaline (raise pH). By the same principle, when the pH is too high, the kidneys excrete bicarbonate () into urine as urea via the urea cycle (or Krebs–Henseleit ornithine cycle). By removing the bicarbonate, more is generated from carbonic acid (), which comes from produced by cellular respiration.

Crucially, a similar buffer operates in the oceans. It is a major factor in climate change and the long-term carbon cycle, due to the large number of marine organisms (especially coral) which are made of calcium carbonate. Increased solubility of carbonate through increased temperatures results in lower production of marine calcite and increased concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This, in turn, increases Earth temperature. The amount of available is on a geological scale and substantial quantities may eventually be redissolved into the sea and released to the atmosphere, increasing levels even more.

==Carbonate salts==

* Carbonate overview:
==Presence outside Earth==
It is generally thought that the presence of carbonates in rock is strong evidence for the presence of liquid water. Recent observations of the planetary nebula NGC 6302 show evidence for carbonates in space, where aqueous alteration similar to that on Earth is unlikely. Other minerals have been proposed which would fit the observations.

Small amounts of carbonate deposits have been found on Mars via spectral imaging and Martian meteorites also contain small amounts. Groundwater may have existed at Gusev and Meridiani Planum.

<doc id="5914" wikidata="Q82264" url="?curid=5914" title="Catalysis">
<text>Catalysis () is the increase in rate of a chemical reaction due to an added substance known as a catalyst (). Catalysts are not consumed by the reaction and remain unchanged after it. If the reaction is rapid and the catalyst recycles quickly, very small amounts of catalyst often suffice; mixing, surface area, and temperature are important factors in reaction rate. Catalysts generally react with one or more reactants to form intermediates that subsequently give the final reaction product, in the process of regenerating the catalyst.

The rate increase occurs because the catalyst allows the reaction to occur by an alternative mechanism which may be much faster than the non-catalyzed mechanism. However the non-catalyzed mechanism does remain possible, so that the total rate (catalyzed plus non-catalyzed) can only increase in the presence of the catalyst and never decrease.

Catalysis may be classified as either homogeneous, whose components are dispersed in the same phase (usually gaseous or liquid) as the reactant, or heterogeneous, whose components are not in the same phase. Enzymes and other biocatalysts are often considered as a third category.

Catalysis is ubiquitous in chemical industry of all kinds. Estimates are that 90% of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture.

The term &quot;catalyst&quot; is derived from Greek , &quot;kataluein&quot;, meaning &quot;loosen&quot; or &quot;untie&quot;. The concept of catalysis was invented by chemist Elizabeth Fulhame, based on her novel work in oxidation-reduction experiments.

==General principles==

===Example===
An illustrative example is the effect of catalysts to speed the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen:
:2 HO → 2 HO + O
This reaction proceeds because the reaction products are more stable than the starting compound, but this decomposition is so slow that hydrogen peroxide solutions are commercially available. In the presence of a catalyst such as manganese dioxide this reaction proceeds much more rapidly. This effect is readily seen by the effervescence of oxygen. The catalyst is not consumed in the reaction, and may be recovered unchanged and re-used indefinitely. Accordingly, manganese dioxide is said to &quot;catalyze&quot; this reaction. In living organisms, this reaction is catalyzed by enzymes (proteins that serve as catalysts) such as catalase.

Another example is the effect of catalysts on air pollution and reducing the amount of carbon monoxide. Development of active and selective catalysts for the conversion of carbon monoxide into desirable products is one of the most important roles of catalysts. Using catalysts for hydrogenation of carbon monoxide helps to remove this toxic gas and also attain useful materials.

===Units===
The SI derived unit for measuring the catalytic activity of a catalyst is the katal, which is quantified in moles per second. The productivity of a catalyst can be described by the turnover number (or TON) and the catalytic activity by the &quot;turn over frequency&quot; (TOF), which is the TON per time unit. The biochemical equivalent is the enzyme unit. For more information on the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis, see the article on &quot;enzymes&quot;.

===Catalytic reaction mechanisms===

In general, chemical reactions occur faster in the presence of a catalyst because the catalyst provides an alternative reaction mechanism (reaction pathway) having a lower activation energy than the non-catalyzed mechanism. In catalyzed mechanisms, the catalyst is regenerated.

As a simple example occurring in the gas phase, the reaction 2 SO2 + O2 → 2 SO3 can be catalyzed by adding nitric oxide. The reaction occurs in two steps: 
: 2NO + O2 → 2NO2 (rate-determining)
: NO2 + SO2 → NO + SO3 (fast)
The NO catalyst is regenerated. The overall rate is the rate of the slow step 
:v=2k1[NO]2[O2].

An example of heterogeneous catalysis is the reaction of oxygen and hydrogen on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO, or &quot;titania&quot;) to produce water. Scanning tunneling microscopy showed that the molecules undergo adsorption and dissociation. The dissociated, surface-bound O and H atoms diffuse together. The intermediate reaction states are: HO, HO, then HO and the reaction product (water molecule dimers), after which the water molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

===Reaction energetics===

Catalysts enable pathways that differ from the uncatalyzed reactions. These pathways have lower activation energy. Consequently, more molecular collisions have the energy needed to reach the transition state. Hence, catalysts can enable reactions that would otherwise be blocked or slowed by a kinetic barrier. The catalyst may increase the reaction rate or selectivity, or enable the reaction at lower temperatures. This effect can be illustrated with an energy profile diagram.

In the catalyzed elementary reaction, catalysts do not change the extent of a reaction: they have no effect on the chemical equilibrium of a reaction. The ratio of the forward and the reverse reaction rates is unaffected (see also thermodynamics). The second law of thermodynamics describes why a catalyst does not change the chemical equilibrium of a reaction. Suppose there was such a catalyst that shifted an equilibrium. Introducing the catalyst to the system would result in a reaction to move to the new equilibrium, producing energy. Production of energy is a necessary result since reactions are spontaneous only if Gibbs free energy is produced, and if there is no energy barrier, there is no need for a catalyst. Then, removing the catalyst would also result in a reaction, producing energy; i.e. the addition and its reverse process, removal, would both produce energy. Thus, a catalyst that could change the equilibrium would be a perpetual motion machine, a contradiction to the laws of thermodynamics. Thus, catalysts do not alter the equilibrium constant. (A catalyst can however change the equilibrium concentrations by reacting in a subsequent step. It is then consumed as the reaction proceeds, and thus it is also a reactant. Illustrative is the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of esters, where the produced carboxylic acid immediately reacts with the base catalyst and thus the reaction equilibrium is shifted towards hydrolysis.)

The catalyst stabilizes the transition state more than it stabilizes the starting material. It decreases the kinetic barrier by decreasing the &quot;difference&quot; in energy between starting material and the transition state. It does not change the energy difference between starting materials and products (thermodynamic barrier), or the available energy (this is provided by the environment as heat or light).

===Related concepts===
Some so-called catalysts are really precatalysts. Precatalysts convert to catalysts in the reaction. For example, Wilkinson&#x27;s catalyst RhCl(PPh) loses one triphenylphosphine ligand before entering the true catalytic cycle. Precatalysts are easier to store but are easily activated in situ. Because of this preactivation step, many catalytic reactions involve an induction period.

In cooperative catalysis, chemical species that improve catalytic activity are called cocatalysts or promoters.

In tandem catalysis two or more different catalysts are coupled in a one-pot reaction.

In autocatalysis, the catalyst &quot;is&quot; a product of the overall reaction, in contrast to all other types of catalysis considered in this article. The simplest example of autocatalysis is a reaction of type A + B → 2 B, in one or in several steps. The overall reaction is just A → B, so that B is a product. But since B is also a reactant, it may be present in the rate equation and affect the reaction rate. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of B increases and can accelerate the reaction as a catalyst. In effect, the reaction accelerates itself or is autocatalyzed. An example is the hydrolysis of an ester such as aspirin to a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. In the absence of added acid catalysts, the carboxylic acid product catalyzes the hydrolysis.

Switchable catalysis refers to a type of catalysis where the catalyst can be toggled between different ground states possessing distinct reactivity, typically by applying an external stimulus. This ability to reversibly switch the catalyst allows for spatiotemporal control over catalytic activity and selectivity. The external stimuli used to switch the catalyst can include changes in temperature, pH, light, electric fields, or the addition of chemical agents.

A true catalyst can work in tandem with a sacrificial catalyst. The true catalyst is consumed in the elementary reaction and turned into a deactivated form.
The sacrificial catalyst regenerates the true catalyst for another cycle. The sacrificial catalyst is consumed in the reaction, and as such, it is not really a catalyst, but a reagent. For example, osmium tetroxide (OsO4) is a good reagent for dihydroxylation, but it is highly toxic and expensive. In Upjohn dihydroxylation, the sacrificial catalyst N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO) regenerates OsO4, and only catalytic quantities of OsO4 are needed.

===Classification===
Catalysis may be classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous catalysis is one whose components are dispersed in the same phase (usually gaseous or liquid) as the reactant&#x27;s molecules. A heterogeneous catalysis is one where the reaction components are not in the same phase. Enzymes and other biocatalysts are often considered as a third category. Similar mechanistic principles apply to heterogeneous, homogeneous, and biocatalysis.

==Heterogeneous catalysis==


Heterogeneous catalysts act in a different phase than the reactants. Most heterogeneous catalysts are solids that act on substrates in a liquid or gaseous reaction mixture. Important heterogeneous catalysts include zeolites, alumina, higher-order oxides, graphitic carbon, transition metal oxides, metals such as Raney nickel for hydrogenation, and vanadium(V) oxide for oxidation of sulfur dioxide into sulfur trioxide by the contact process.

Diverse mechanisms for reactions on surfaces are known, depending on how the adsorption takes place (Langmuir-Hinshelwood, Eley-Rideal, and Mars-van Krevelen). The total surface area of a solid has an important effect on the reaction rate. The smaller the catalyst particle size, the larger the surface area for a given mass of particles.

A heterogeneous catalyst has active sites, which are the atoms or crystal faces where the substrate actually binds. Active sites are atoms but are often described as a facet (edge, surface, step, etc.) of a solid. Most of the volume but also most of the surface of a heterogeneous catalyst may be catalytically inactive. Finding out the nature of the active site is technically challenging.

For example, the catalyst for the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen is often described as iron. But detailed studies and many optimizations have led to catalysts that are mixtures of iron-potassium-calcium-aluminum-oxide. The reacting gases adsorb onto active sites on the iron particles. Once physically adsorbed, the reagents partially or wholly dissociate and form new bonds. In this way the particularly strong triple bond in nitrogen is broken, which would be extremely uncommon in the gas phase due to its high activation energy. Thus, the activation energy of the overall reaction is lowered, and the rate of reaction increases. Another place where a heterogeneous catalyst is applied is in the oxidation of sulfur dioxide on vanadium(V) oxide for the production of sulfuric acid. Many heterogeneous catalysts are in fact nanomaterials.

Heterogeneous catalysts are typically &quot;supported&quot;, which means that the catalyst is dispersed on a second material that enhances the effectiveness or minimizes its cost. Supports prevent or minimize agglomeration and sintering of small catalyst particles, exposing more surface area, thus catalysts have a higher specific activity (per gram) on support. Sometimes the support is merely a surface on which the catalyst is spread to increase the surface area. More often, the support and the catalyst interact, affecting the catalytic reaction. Supports can also be used in nanoparticle synthesis by providing sites for individual molecules of catalyst to chemically bind. Supports are porous materials with a high surface area, most commonly alumina, zeolites, or various kinds of activated carbon. Specialized supports include silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, and barium sulfate.

===Electrocatalysts===

In the context of electrochemistry, specifically in fuel cell engineering, various metal-containing catalysts are used to enhance the rates of the half reactions that comprise the fuel cell. One common type of fuel cell electrocatalyst is based upon nanoparticles of platinum that are supported on slightly larger carbon particles. When in contact with one of the electrodes in a fuel cell, this platinum increases the rate of oxygen reduction either to water or to hydroxide or hydrogen peroxide.

==Homogeneous catalysis==

Homogeneous catalysts function in the same phase as the reactants. Typically homogeneous catalysts are dissolved in a solvent with the substrates. One example of homogeneous catalysis involves the influence of H on the esterification of carboxylic acids, such as the formation of methyl acetate from acetic acid and methanol. High-volume processes requiring a homogeneous catalyst include hydroformylation, hydrosilylation, hydrocyanation. For inorganic chemists, homogeneous catalysis is often synonymous with organometallic catalysts. Many homogeneous catalysts are however not organometallic, illustrated by the use of cobalt salts that catalyze the oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic acid.

===Organocatalysis===
Whereas transition metals sometimes attract most of the attention in the study of catalysis, small organic molecules without metals can also exhibit catalytic properties, as is apparent from the fact that many enzymes lack transition metals. Typically, organic catalysts require a higher loading (amount of catalyst per unit amount of reactant, expressed in mol% amount of substance) than transition metal(-ion)-based catalysts, but these catalysts are usually commercially available in bulk, helping to lower costs. In the early 2000s, these organocatalysts were considered &quot;new generation&quot; and are competitive to traditional metal(-ion)-containing catalysts. 

Organocatalysts are supposed to operate akin to metal-free enzymes utilizing, e.g., non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding. The discipline organocatalysis is divided into the application of covalent (e.g., proline, DMAP) and non-covalent (e.g., thiourea organocatalysis) organocatalysts referring to the preferred catalyst-substrate binding and interaction, respectively. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2021 was awarded jointly to Benjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan &quot;for the development of asymmetric organocatalysis.&quot;

===Photocatalysts===

Photocatalysis is the phenomenon where the catalyst can receive light to generate an excited state that effect redox reactions. Singlet oxygen is usually produced by photocatalysis. Photocatalysts are components of dye-sensitized solar cells.

===Enzymes and biocatalysts===
In biology, enzymes are protein-based catalysts in metabolism and catabolism. Most biocatalysts are enzymes, but other non-protein-based classes of biomolecules also exhibit catalytic properties including ribozymes, and synthetic deoxyribozymes.

Biocatalysts can be thought of as an intermediate between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, although strictly speaking soluble enzymes are homogeneous catalysts and membrane-bound enzymes are heterogeneous. Several factors affect the activity of enzymes (and other catalysts) including temperature, pH, the concentration of enzymes, substrate, and products. A particularly important reagent in enzymatic reactions is water, which is the product of many bond-forming reactions and a reactant in many bond-breaking processes.

In biocatalysis, enzymes are employed to prepare many commodity chemicals including high-fructose corn syrup and acrylamide.

Some monoclonal antibodies whose binding target is a stable molecule that resembles the transition state of a chemical reaction can function as weak catalysts for that chemical reaction by lowering its activation energy. Such catalytic antibodies are sometimes called &quot;abzymes&quot;.

==Significance==

Estimates are that 90% of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture. In 2005, catalytic processes generated about $900 billion in products worldwide. Catalysis is so pervasive that subareas are not readily classified. Some areas of particular concentration are surveyed below.

===Energy processing===
Petroleum refining makes intensive use of catalysis for alkylation, catalytic cracking (breaking long-chain hydrocarbons into smaller pieces), naphtha reforming and steam reforming (conversion of hydrocarbons into synthesis gas). Even the exhaust from the burning of fossil fuels is treated via catalysis: Catalytic converters, typically composed of platinum and rhodium, break down some of the more harmful byproducts of automobile exhaust.
:2 CO + 2 NO → 2 CO + N

With regard to synthetic fuels, an old but still important process is the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas, which itself is processed via water-gas shift reactions, catalyzed by iron. The Sabatier reaction produces methane from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Biodiesel and related biofuels require processing via both inorganic and biocatalysts.

Fuel cells rely on catalysts for both the anodic and cathodic reactions.

Catalytic heaters generate flameless heat from a supply of combustible fuel.

===Bulk chemicals===

Some of the largest-scale chemicals are produced via catalytic oxidation, often using oxygen. Examples include nitric acid (from ammonia), sulfuric acid (from sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide by the contact process), terephthalic acid from p-xylene, acrylic acid from propylene or propane and acrylonitrile from propane and ammonia.

The production of ammonia is one of the largest-scale and most energy-intensive processes. In the Haber process nitrogen is combined with hydrogen over an iron oxide catalyst. Methanol is prepared from carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide but using copper-zinc catalysts.

Bulk polymers derived from ethylene and propylene are often prepared using Ziegler–Natta catalyst. Polyesters, polyamides, and isocyanates are derived via acid–base catalysis.

Most carbonylation processes require metal catalysts, examples include the Monsanto acetic acid process and hydroformylation.

===Fine chemicals===
Many fine chemicals are prepared via catalysis; methods include those of heavy industry as well as more specialized processes that would be prohibitively expensive on a large scale. Examples include the Heck reaction, and Friedel–Crafts reactions. Because most bioactive compounds are chiral, many pharmaceuticals are produced by enantioselective catalysis (catalytic asymmetric synthesis). (R)-1,2-Propandiol, the precursor to the antibacterial levofloxacin, can be synthesized efficiently from hydroxyacetone by using catalysts based on BINAP-ruthenium complexes, in Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation:
===Food processing===
One of the most obvious applications of catalysis is the hydrogenation (reaction with hydrogen gas) of fats using nickel catalyst to produce margarine. Many other foodstuffs are prepared via biocatalysis (see below).

===Environment===
Catalysis affects the environment by increasing the efficiency of industrial processes, but catalysis also plays a direct role in the environment. A notable example is the catalytic role of chlorine free radicals in the breakdown of ozone. These radicals are formed by the action of ultraviolet radiation on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
:Cl + O → ClO + O
:ClO + O → Cl + O

==History==
The term &quot;catalyst&quot;, broadly defined as anything that increases the rate of a process, is derived from Greek , meaning &quot;to annul&quot;, or &quot;to untie&quot;, or &quot;to pick up&quot;. The concept of catalysis was invented by chemist Elizabeth Fulhame and described in a 1794 book, based on her novel work in oxidation–reduction reactions. The first chemical reaction in organic chemistry that knowingly used a catalyst was studied in 1811 by Gottlieb Kirchhoff, who discovered the acid-catalyzed conversion of starch to glucose. The term &quot;catalysis&quot; was later used by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1835 to describe reactions that are accelerated by substances that remain unchanged after the reaction. Fulhame, who predated Berzelius, did work with water as opposed to metals in her reduction experiments. Other 18th century chemists who worked in catalysis were Eilhard Mitscherlich who referred to it as &quot;contact&quot; processes, and Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner who spoke of &quot;contact action. &quot;He developed Döbereiner&#x27;s lamp, a lighter based on hydrogen and a platinum sponge, which became a commercial success in the 1820s that lives on today. Humphry Davy discovered the use of platinum in catalysis. In the 1880s, Wilhelm Ostwald at Leipzig University started a systematic investigation into reactions that were catalyzed by the presence of acids and bases, and found that chemical reactions occur at finite rates and that these rates can be used to determine the strengths of acids and bases. For this work, Ostwald was awarded the 1909 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Vladimir Ipatieff performed some of the earliest industrial scale reactions, including the discovery and commercialization of oligomerization and the development of catalysts for hydrogenation.

==Inhibitors, poisons, and promoters==
An added substance that lowers the rate is called a reaction inhibitor if reversible and catalyst poisons if irreversible. Promoters are substances that increase the catalytic activity, even though they are not catalysts by themselves.

Inhibitors are sometimes referred to as &quot;negative catalysts&quot; since they decrease the reaction rate. However the term inhibitor is preferred since they do not work by introducing a reaction path with higher activation energy; this would not lower the rate since the reaction would continue to occur by the non-catalyzed path. Instead, they act either by deactivating catalysts or by removing reaction intermediates such as free radicals. In heterogeneous catalysis, coking inhibits the catalyst, which becomes covered by polymeric side products.

The inhibitor may modify selectivity in addition to rate. For instance, in the hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes, a palladium (Pd) catalyst partly &quot;poisoned&quot; with lead(II) acetate (Pb(CHCO)) can be used (Lindlar catalyst). Without the deactivation of the catalyst, the alkene produced would be further hydrogenated to alkane.

The inhibitor can produce this effect by, e.g., selectively poisoning only certain types of active sites. Another mechanism is the modification of surface geometry. For instance, in hydrogenation operations, large planes of metal surface function as sites of hydrogenolysis catalysis while sites catalyzing hydrogenation of unsaturates are smaller. Thus, a poison that covers the surface randomly will tend to lower the number of uncontaminated large planes but leave proportionally smaller sites free, thus changing the hydrogenation vs. hydrogenolysis selectivity. Many other mechanisms are also possible.

Promoters can cover up the surface to prevent the production of a mat of coke, or even actively remove such material (e.g., rhenium on platinum in platforming). They can aid the dispersion of the catalytic material or bind to reagents.

==Prebiotic catalysis in the origin of life==

Life is based on an interplay between information processing and catalytic activity carried out by biological polymers. A possible evolutionary pathway for the emergence of catalytic functions in prebiotic information coding polymers was proposed. It has also been proposed that life emerged as an RNA-protein system in which the two components cross catalyzed the formation of each other.

<text>In geometry, the circumference (from Latin &quot;circumferens&quot;, meaning &quot;carrying around&quot;) is the perimeter of a circle or ellipse. The circumference is the arc length of the circle, as if it were opened up and straightened out to a line segment. More generally, the perimeter is the curve length around any closed figure. 
Circumference may also refer to the circle itself, that is, the locus corresponding to the edge of a disk. 
The is the circumference, or length, of any one of its great circles.

== Circle ==
The circumference of a circle is the distance around it, but if, as in many elementary treatments, distance is defined in terms of straight lines, this cannot be used as a definition. Under these circumstances, the circumference of a circle may be defined as the limit of the perimeters of inscribed regular polygons as the number of sides increases without bound. The term circumference is used when measuring physical objects, as well as when considering abstract geometric forms.

=== Relationship with ===
The circumference of a circle is related to one of the most important mathematical constants. This constant, pi, is represented by the Greek letter formula_1 Its first few decimal digits are 3.141592653589793... Pi is defined as the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference formula_2 to its diameter formula_3
formula_4

Or, equivalently, as the ratio of the circumference to twice the radius. The above formula can be rearranged to solve for the circumference:
formula_5

The ratio of the circle&#x27;s circumference to its radius is equivalent to formula_6. This is also the number of radians in one turn. The use of the mathematical constant is ubiquitous in mathematics, engineering, and science.

In &quot;Measurement of a Circle&quot; written circa 250 BCE, Archimedes showed that this ratio (written as formula_7 since he did not use the name ) was greater than 3 but less than 3 by calculating the perimeters of an inscribed and a circumscribed regular polygon of 96 sides. This method for approximating was used for centuries, obtaining more accuracy by using polygons of larger and larger number of sides. The last such calculation was performed in 1630 by Christoph Grienberger who used polygons with 1040 sides.
== Ellipse ==
Some authors use circumference to denote the perimeter of an ellipse. There is no general formula for the circumference of an ellipse in terms of the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse that uses only elementary functions. However, there are approximate formulas in terms of these parameters. One such approximation, due to Euler (1773), for the canonical ellipse, 
formula_8
is 
formula_9
Some lower and upper bounds on the circumference of the canonical ellipse with formula_10 are:
formula_11
formula_12
formula_13

Here the upper bound formula_14 is the circumference of a circumscribed concentric circle passing through the endpoints of the ellipse&#x27;s major axis, and the lower bound formula_15 is the perimeter of an inscribed rhombus with vertices at the endpoints of the major and minor axes.

The circumference of an ellipse can be expressed exactly in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. More precisely,
formula_16
where formula_17 is the length of the semi-major axis and formula_18 is the eccentricity formula_19

<text>Continuum mechanics is a branch of mechanics that deals with the deformation of and transmission of forces through materials modeled as a continuous medium (also called a continuum) rather than as discrete particles. 

Continuum mechanics deals with &quot;deformable bodies&quot;, as opposed to rigid bodies. 
A continuum model assumes that the substance of the object completely fills the space it occupies. While ignoring the fact that matter is made of atoms, this provides a sufficiently accurate description of matter on length scales much greater than that of inter-atomic distances. The concept of a continuous medium allows for intuitive analysis of bulk matter by using differential equations that describe the behavior of such matter according to physical laws, such as mass conservation, momentum conservation, and energy conservation. Information about the specific material is expressed in constitutive relationships.

Continuum mechanics treats the physical properties of solids and fluids independently of any particular coordinate system in which they are observed. These properties are represented by tensors, which are mathematical objects with the salient property of being independent of coordinate systems. This permits definition of physical properties at any point in the continuum, according to mathematically convenient continuous functions. The theories of elasticity, plasticity and fluid mechanics are based on the concepts of continuum mechanics.

==Concept of a continuum==
The concept of a continuum underlies the mathematical framework for studying large-scale forces and deformations in materials. Although materials are composed of discrete atoms and molecules, separated by empty space or microscopic cracks and crystallographic defects, physical phenomena can often be modeled by considering a substance distributed throughout some region of space. A continuum is a body that can be continually sub-divided into infinitesimal elements with local material properties defined at any particular point. Properties of the bulk material can therefore be described by continuous functions, and their evolution can be studied using the mathematics of calculus.

Apart from the assumption of continuity, two other independent assumptions are often employed in the study of continuum mechanics. These are homogeneity (assumption of identical properties at all locations) and isotropy (assumption of directionally invariant vector properties). If these auxiliary assumptions are not globally applicable, the material may be segregated into sections where they are applicable in order to simplify the analysis. For more complex cases, one or both of these assumptions can be dropped. In these cases, computational methods are often used to solve the differential equations describing the evolution of material properties.

==Major areas==

An additional area of continuum mechanics comprises elastomeric foams, which exhibit a curious hyperbolic stress-strain relationship. The elastomer is a true continuum, but a homogeneous distribution of voids gives it unusual properties.

==Formulation of models==

Continuum mechanics models begin by assigning a region in three-dimensional Euclidean space to the material body formula_1 being modeled. The points within this region are called particles or material points. Different &quot;configurations&quot; or states of the body correspond to different regions in Euclidean space. The region corresponding to the body&#x27;s configuration at time formula_2 is labeled formula_3.

A particular particle within the body in a particular configuration is characterized by a position vector 
:formula_4
where formula_5 are the coordinate vectors in some frame of reference chosen for the problem (See figure 1). This vector can be expressed as a function of the particle position formula_6 in some &quot;reference configuration&quot;, for example the configuration at the initial time, so that

:formula_7

This function needs to have various properties so that the model makes physical sense. formula_8 needs to be:
* continuous in time, so that the body changes in a way which is realistic,
* globally invertible at all times, so that the body cannot intersect itself,
* orientation-preserving, as transformations which produce mirror reflections are not possible in nature.
For the mathematical formulation of the model, formula_8 is also assumed to be twice continuously differentiable, so that differential equations describing the motion may be formulated.

==Forces in a continuum==

A solid is a deformable body that possesses shear strength, &quot;sc.&quot; a solid can support shear forces (forces parallel to the material surface on which they act). Fluids, on the other hand, do not sustain shear forces.

Following the classical dynamics of Newton and Euler, the motion of a material body is produced by the action of externally applied forces which are assumed to be of two kinds: surface forces formula_10 and body forces formula_11. Thus, the total force formula_12 applied to a body or to a portion of the body can be expressed as:

:formula_13

===Surface forces===

&quot;Surface forces&quot; or &quot;contact forces&quot;, expressed as force per unit area, can act either on the bounding surface of the body, as a result of mechanical contact with other bodies, or on imaginary internal surfaces that bound portions of the body, as a result of the mechanical interaction between the parts of the body to either side of the surface (Euler-Cauchy&#x27;s stress principle). When a body is acted upon by external contact forces, internal contact forces are then transmitted from point to point inside the body to balance their action, according to Newton&#x27;s third law of motion of conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum (for continuous bodies these laws are called the Euler&#x27;s equations of motion). The internal contact forces are related to the body&#x27;s deformation through constitutive equations. The internal contact forces may be mathematically described by how they relate to the motion of the body, independent of the body&#x27;s material makeup.

The distribution of internal contact forces throughout the volume of the body is assumed to be continuous. Therefore, there exists a &quot;contact force density&quot; or &quot;Cauchy traction field&quot; formula_14 that represents this distribution in a particular configuration of the body at a given time formula_15. It is not a vector field because it depends not only on the position formula_16 of a particular material point, but also on the local orientation of the surface element as defined by its normal vector formula_17.

Any differential area formula_18 with normal vector formula_17 of a given internal surface area formula_20, bounding a portion of the body, experiences a contact force formula_21 arising from the contact between both portions of the body on each side of formula_20, and it is given by

:formula_23

where formula_24 is the &quot;surface traction&quot;, also called &quot;stress vector&quot;, &quot;traction&quot;, or &quot;traction vector&quot;. The stress vector is a frame-indifferent vector (see Euler-Cauchy&#x27;s stress principle).

The total contact force on the particular internal surface formula_20 is then expressed as the sum (surface integral) of the contact forces on all differential surfaces formula_18:

:formula_27

In continuum mechanics a body is considered stress-free if the only forces present are those inter-atomic forces (ionic, metallic, and van der Waals forces) required to hold the body together and to keep its shape in the absence of all external influences, including gravitational attraction. Stresses generated during manufacture of the body to a specific configuration are also excluded when considering stresses in a body. Therefore, the stresses considered in continuum mechanics are only those produced by deformation of the body, &quot;sc.&quot; only relative changes in stress are considered, not the absolute values of stress.

===Body forces===

&quot;Body forces&quot; are forces originating from sources outside of the body that act on the volume (or mass) of the body. Saying that body forces are due to outside sources implies that the interaction between different parts of the body (internal forces) are manifested through the contact forces alone. These forces arise from the presence of the body in force fields, &quot;e.g.&quot; gravitational field (gravitational forces) or electromagnetic field (electromagnetic forces), or from inertial forces when bodies are in motion. As the mass of a continuous body is assumed to be continuously distributed, any force originating from the mass is also continuously distributed. Thus, body forces are specified by vector fields which are assumed to be continuous over the entire volume of the body, &quot;i.e.&quot; acting on every point in it. Body forces are represented by a body force density formula_28 (per unit of mass), which is a frame-indifferent vector field.

In the case of gravitational forces, the intensity of the force depends on, or is proportional to, the mass density formula_29 of the material, and it is specified in terms of force per unit mass (formula_30) or per unit volume (formula_31). These two specifications are related through the material density by the equation formula_32. Similarly, the intensity of electromagnetic forces depends upon the strength (electric charge) of the electromagnetic field.

The total body force applied to a continuous body is expressed as

:formula_33

Body forces and contact forces acting on the body lead to corresponding moments of force (torques) relative to a given point. Thus, the total applied torque formula_34 about the origin is given by

:formula_35

In certain situations, not commonly considered in the analysis of the mechanical behavior of materials, it becomes necessary to include two other types of forces: these are &quot;couple stresses&quot; (surface couples, contact torques) and &quot;body moments&quot;. Couple stresses are moments per unit area applied on a surface. Body moments, or body couples, are moments per unit volume or per unit mass applied to the volume of the body. Both are important in the analysis of stress for a polarized dielectric solid under the action of an electric field, materials where the molecular structure is taken into consideration (&quot;e.g.&quot; bones), solids under the action of an external magnetic field, and the dislocation theory of metals.

Materials that exhibit body couples and couple stresses in addition to moments produced exclusively by forces are called &quot;polar materials&quot;. &quot;Non-polar materials&quot; are then those materials with only moments of forces. In the classical branches of continuum mechanics the development of the theory of stresses is based on non-polar materials.

Thus, the sum of all applied forces and torques (with respect to the origin of the coordinate system) in the body can be given by

:formula_36
:formula_37

==Kinematics: motion and deformation==

A change in the configuration of a continuum body results in a displacement. The displacement of a body has two components: a rigid-body displacement and a deformation. A rigid-body displacement consists of a simultaneous translation and rotation of the body without changing its shape or size. Deformation implies the change in shape and/or size of the body from an initial or undeformed configuration formula_38 to a current or deformed configuration formula_3 (Figure 2).

The motion of a continuum body is a continuous time sequence of displacements. Thus, the material body will occupy different configurations at different times so that a particle occupies a series of points in space which describe a path line.

There is continuity during motion or deformation of a continuum body in the sense that:
* The material points forming a closed curve at any instant will always form a closed curve at any subsequent time.
* The material points forming a closed surface at any instant will always form a closed surface at any subsequent time and the matter within the closed surface will always remain within.

It is convenient to identify a reference configuration or initial condition which all subsequent configurations are referenced from. The reference configuration need not be one that the body will ever occupy. Often, the configuration at formula_40 is considered the reference configuration, formula_41. The components formula_42 of the position vector formula_6 of a particle, taken with respect to the reference configuration, are called the material or reference coordinates.

When analyzing the motion or deformation of solids, or the flow of fluids, it is necessary to describe the sequence or evolution of configurations throughout time. One description for motion is made in terms of the material or referential coordinates, called material description or Lagrangian description.

===Lagrangian description===
In the Lagrangian description the position and physical properties of the particles are described in terms of the material or referential coordinates and time. In this case the reference configuration is the configuration at formula_40. An observer standing in the frame of reference observes the changes in the position and physical properties as the material body moves in space as time progresses. The results obtained are independent of the choice of initial time and reference configuration, formula_38. This description is normally used in solid mechanics.

In the Lagrangian description, the motion of a continuum body is expressed by the mapping function formula_46 (Figure 2),

:formula_47

which is a mapping of the initial configuration formula_38 onto the current configuration formula_3, giving a geometrical correspondence between them, i.e. giving the position vector formula_50 that a particle formula_51, with a position vector formula_6 in the undeformed or reference configuration formula_38, will occupy in the current or deformed configuration formula_3 at time formula_2. The components formula_56 are called the spatial coordinates.

Physical and kinematic properties formula_57, i.e. thermodynamic properties and flow velocity, which describe or characterize features of the material body, are expressed as continuous functions of position and time, i.e. formula_58.

The material derivative of any property formula_57 of a continuum, which may be a scalar, vector, or tensor, is the time rate of change of that property for a specific group of particles of the moving continuum body. The material derivative is also known as the &quot;substantial derivative&quot;, or &quot;comoving derivative&quot;, or &quot;convective derivative&quot;. It can be thought as the rate at which the property changes when measured by an observer traveling with that group of particles.

In the Lagrangian description, the material derivative of formula_57 is simply the partial derivative with respect to time, and the position vector formula_6 is held constant as it does not change with time. Thus, we have

:formula_62

The instantaneous position formula_16 is a property of a particle, and its material derivative is the &quot;instantaneous flow velocity&quot; formula_64 of the particle. Therefore, the flow velocity field of the continuum is given by

:formula_65

Similarly, the acceleration field is given by

:formula_66

Continuity in the Lagrangian description is expressed by the spatial and temporal continuity of the mapping from the reference configuration to the current configuration of the material points. All physical quantities characterizing the continuum are described this way. In this sense, the function formula_46 and formula_68 are single-valued and continuous, with continuous derivatives with respect to space and time to whatever order is required, usually to the second or third.

===Eulerian description===
Continuity allows for the inverse of formula_46 to trace backwards where the particle currently located at formula_16 was located in the initial or referenced configuration formula_38. In this case the description of motion is made in terms of the spatial coordinates, in which case is called the spatial description or Eulerian description, i.e. the current configuration is taken as the reference configuration.

The Eulerian description, introduced by d&#x27;Alembert, focuses on the current configuration formula_3, giving attention to what is occurring at a fixed point in space as time progresses, instead of giving attention to individual particles as they move through space and time. This approach is conveniently applied in the study of fluid flow where the kinematic property of greatest interest is the rate at which change is taking place rather than the shape of the body of fluid at a reference time.

Mathematically, the motion of a continuum using the Eulerian description is expressed by the mapping function

:formula_73

which provides a tracing of the particle which now occupies the position formula_16 in the current configuration formula_3 to its original position formula_6 in the initial configuration formula_38.

A necessary and sufficient condition for this inverse function to exist is that the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, often referred to simply as the Jacobian, should be different from zero. Thus,

:formula_78

In the Eulerian description, the physical properties formula_57 are expressed as

:formula_80

where the functional form of formula_81 in the Lagrangian description is not the same as the form of formula_82 in the Eulerian description.

The material derivative of formula_83, using the chain rule, is then

:formula_84

The first term on the right-hand side of this equation gives the &quot;local rate of change&quot; of the property formula_83 occurring at position formula_16. The second term of the right-hand side is the &quot;convective rate of change&quot; and expresses the contribution of the particle changing position in space (motion).

Continuity in the Eulerian description is expressed by the spatial and temporal continuity and continuous differentiability of the flow velocity field. All physical quantities are defined this way at each instant of time, in the current configuration, as a function of the vector position formula_16.

===Displacement field===
The vector joining the positions of a particle formula_88 in the undeformed configuration and deformed configuration is called the displacement vector formula_89, in the Lagrangian description, or formula_90, in the Eulerian description.

A &quot;displacement field&quot; is a vector field of all displacement vectors for all particles in the body, which relates the deformed configuration with the undeformed configuration. It is convenient to do the analysis of deformation or motion of a continuum body in terms of the displacement field, In general, the displacement field is expressed in terms of the material coordinates as

:formula_91

or in terms of the spatial coordinates as

:formula_92

where formula_93 are the direction cosines between the material and spatial coordinate systems with unit vectors formula_94 and formula_5, respectively. Thus

:formula_96

and the relationship between formula_97 and formula_98 is then given by

:formula_99

Knowing that
:formula_100
then
:formula_101

It is common to superimpose the coordinate systems for the undeformed and deformed configurations, which results in formula_102, and the direction cosines become Kronecker deltas, i.e.

:formula_103

Thus, we have

:formula_104

or in terms of the spatial coordinates as

:formula_105
==Governing equations==
Continuum mechanics deals with the behavior of materials that can be approximated as continuous for certain length and time scales. The equations that govern the mechanics of such materials include the balance laws for mass, momentum, and energy. Kinematic relations and constitutive equations are needed to complete the system of governing equations. Physical restrictions on the form of the constitutive relations can be applied by requiring that the second law of thermodynamics be satisfied under all conditions. In the continuum mechanics of solids, the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied if the Clausius–Duhem form of the entropy inequality is satisfied.

The balance laws express the idea that the rate of change of a quantity (mass, momentum, energy) in a volume must arise from three causes:

#the physical quantity itself flows through the surface that bounds the volume,
#there is a source of the physical quantity on the surface of the volume, or/and,
#there is a source of the physical quantity inside the volume.

Let formula_106 be the body (an open subset of Euclidean space) and let formula_107 be its surface (the boundary of formula_106).

Let the motion of material points in the body be described by the map
:formula_109
where formula_110 is the position of a point in the initial configuration and formula_111 is the location of the same point in the deformed configuration.

The deformation gradient is given by
:formula_112

===Balance laws===
Let formula_113 be a physical quantity that is flowing through the body. Let formula_114 be sources on the surface of the body and let formula_115 be sources inside the body. Let formula_116 be the outward unit normal to the surface formula_107. Let formula_118 be the flow velocity of the physical particles that carry the physical quantity that is flowing. Also, let the speed at which the bounding surface formula_107 is moving be formula_120 (in the direction formula_121).

Then, balance laws can be expressed in the general form
:formula_122
The functions formula_113, formula_114, and formula_115 can be scalar valued, vector valued, or tensor valued - depending on the physical quantity that the balance equation deals with. If there are internal boundaries in the body, jump discontinuities also need to be specified in the balance laws.

If we take the Eulerian point of view, it can be shown that the balance laws of mass, momentum, and energy for a solid can be written as (assuming the source term is zero for the mass and angular momentum equations)
:formula_126

In the above equations formula_127 is the mass density (current), formula_128 is the material time derivative of formula_129, formula_118 is the particle velocity, formula_131 is the material time derivative of formula_132, formula_133 is the Cauchy stress tensor, formula_134 is the body force density, formula_135 is the internal energy per unit mass, formula_136 is the material time derivative of formula_137, formula_138 is the heat flux vector, and formula_139 is an energy source per unit mass. The operators used are defined below.
With respect to the reference configuration (the Lagrangian point of view), the balance laws can be written as
:formula_140

In the above, formula_141 is the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, and formula_142 is the mass density in the reference configuration. The first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is related to the Cauchy stress tensor by
:formula_143

We can alternatively define the nominal stress tensor formula_144 which is the transpose of the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor such that
:formula_145
Then the balance laws become
:formula_146

====Operators====

The operators in the above equations are defined as
:formula_147
where formula_132 is a vector field, formula_149 is a second-order tensor field, and formula_150 are the components of an orthonormal basis in the current configuration. Also,
:formula_151
where formula_132 is a vector field, formula_149 is a second-order tensor field, and formula_154 are the components of an orthonormal basis in the reference configuration.

The inner product is defined as
:formula_155

===Clausius–Duhem inequality===
The Clausius–Duhem inequality can be used to express the second law of thermodynamics for elastic-plastic materials. This inequality is a statement concerning the irreversibility of natural processes, especially when energy dissipation is involved.

Just like in the balance laws in the previous section, we assume that there is a flux of a quantity, a source of the quantity, and an internal density of the quantity per unit mass. The quantity of interest in this case is the entropy. Thus, we assume that there is an entropy flux, an entropy source, an internal mass density formula_129 and an internal specific entropy (i.e. entropy per unit mass) formula_157 in the region of interest.

Let formula_106 be such a region and let formula_107 be its boundary. Then the second law of thermodynamics states that the rate of increase of formula_157 in this region is greater than or equal to the sum of that supplied to formula_106 (as a flux or from internal sources) and the change of the internal entropy density formula_162 due to material flowing in and out of the region.
Let formula_107 move with a flow velocity formula_120 and let particles inside formula_106 have velocities formula_132. Let formula_121 be the unit outward normal to the surface formula_107. Let formula_129 be the density of matter in the region, formula_170 be the entropy flux at the surface, and formula_171 be the entropy source per unit mass. 
Then the entropy inequality may be written as
:formula_172
The scalar entropy flux can be related to the vector flux at the surface by the relation formula_173. Under the assumption of incrementally isothermal conditions, we have
:formula_174
where formula_175 is the heat flux vector, formula_176 is an energy source per unit mass, and formula_177 is the absolute temperature of a material point at formula_111 at time formula_2.

We then have the Clausius–Duhem inequality in integral form:
:formula_180
We can show that the entropy inequality may be written in differential form as
:formula_181
In terms of the Cauchy stress and the internal energy, the Clausius–Duhem inequality may be written as 
:formula_182

==Validity==

The validity of the continuum assumption may be verified by a theoretical analysis, in which either some clear periodicity is identified or statistical homogeneity and ergodicity of the microstructure exist. More specifically, the continuum hypothesis hinges on the concepts of a representative elementary volume and separation of scales based on the Hill–Mandel condition. This condition provides a link between an experimentalist&#x27;s and a theoretician&#x27;s viewpoint on constitutive equations (linear and nonlinear elastic/inelastic or coupled fields) as well as a way of spatial and statistical averaging of the microstructure. 
When the separation of scales does not hold, or when one wants to establish a continuum of a finer resolution than the size of the representative volume element (RVE), a statistical volume element (SVE) is employed, which results in random continuum fields. The latter then provide a micromechanics basis for stochastic finite elements (SFE). The levels of SVE and RVE link continuum mechanics to statistical mechanics. Experimentally, the RVE can only be evaluated when the constitutive response is spatially homogenous.

<text>Constitutional law is a body of law which defines the role, powers, and structure of different entities within a state, namely, the executive, the parliament or legislature, and the judiciary; as well as the basic rights of citizens and, in federal countries such as the United States and Canada, the relationship between the central government and state, provincial, or territorial governments.

Not all nation states have codified constitutions, though all such states have a , or law of the land, that may consist of a variety of imperative and consensual rules. These may include customary law, conventions, statutory law, judge-made law, or international law. Constitutional law deals with the fundamental principles by which the government exercises its authority. In some instances, these principles grant specific powers to the government, such as the power to tax and spend for the welfare of the population. Other times, constitutional principles act to place limits on what the government can do, such as prohibiting the arrest of an individual without sufficient cause.

In most nations, such as the United States, India, and Singapore, constitutional law is based on the text of a document ratified at the time the nation came into being. Other constitutions, notably that of the United Kingdom, rely heavily on uncodified rules, as several legislative statutes and constitutional conventions, their status within constitutional law varies, and the terms of conventions are in some cases strongly contested.

==Legal structure==
Constitutional laws can be considered second order rule making or rules about making rules to exercise power. It governs the relationships between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive with the bodies under its authority. One of the key tasks of constitutions within this context is to indicate hierarchies and relationships of power. For example, in a unitary state, the constitution will vest ultimate authority in one central administration and legislature, and judiciary, though there is often a delegation of power or authority to local or municipal authorities. When a constitution establishes a federal state for instance as seen in India, it will identify multiple levels of government coexisting with exclusive or shared areas of jurisdiction over lawmaking, application and enforcement. Some federal states, most notably the United States, have separate and parallel federal and state judiciaries, with each having its own hierarchy of courts with a supreme court for each state. India, on the other hand, has one judiciary divided into district courts, high courts, and the Supreme Court of India.

==Human rights==

Human rights or civil liberties form a crucial part of a country&#x27;s constitution and uphold the rights of the individual against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the United States and France, have a codified constitution, with a bill of rights. Canada is an example where the constitution is not codified, but includes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to protect human rights for Canadian citizens and residents.

Some countries like the United Kingdom have no entrenched document setting out fundamental rights; in those jurisdictions the constitution is composed of statute, case law and convention. A case named &quot;Entick v. Carrington&quot; is a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. John Entick&#x27;s house was searched and ransacked by Sherriff Carrington. Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the Earl of Halifax was valid authority, even though there was no statutory provision or court order for it. The court, led by Lord Camden stated that,

The common law and the civil law jurisdictions do not share the same constitutional law underpinnings. Common law nations, such as those in the Commonwealth as well as the United States, derive their legal systems from that of the United Kingdom, and as such place emphasis on judicial precedent, whereby consequential court rulings (especially those by higher courts) are a source of law. Civil law jurisdictions, on the other hand, place less emphasis on judicial review and only the parliament or legislature has the power to effect law. As a result, the structure of the judiciary differs significantly between the two, with common law judiciaries being adversarial and civil law judiciaries being inquisitorial. Common law judicatures consequently separate the judiciary from the prosecution, thereby establishing the courts as completely independent from both the legislature and law enforcement. Human rights law in these countries is as a result, largely built on legal precedent in the courts&#x27; interpretation of constitutional law, whereas that of civil law countries is almost exclusively composed of codified law, constitutional or otherwise.

There are also international enactments to protect human rights. One example is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which was intended included in the Treaty of Lisbon. Perhaps the most important international example is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights under the UN Charter. These are intended to ensure basic political, social and economic standards that a nation state, or intergovernmental body is obliged to provide to its citizens but many do include its governments.

==Legislative procedure==
Another main function of constitutions may be to describe the procedure by which parliaments may legislate. For instance, special majorities may be required to alter the constitution. In bicameral legislatures, there may be a process laid out for second or third readings of bills before a new law can enter into force. Alternatively, there may further be requirements for maximum terms that a government can keep power before holding an election.

==Study of constitutional law==

Constitutional law is a major focus of legal studies and research. For example, most law students in the United States are required to take a class in Constitutional Law during their first year, and several law journals are devoted to the discussion of constitutional issues.

== The rule of law ==
The doctrine of the rule of law dictates that government must be conducted according to law. This was first established by British legal theorist A. V. Dicey.

Dicey identified three essential elements of the British Constitution which were indicative of the rule of law:
#Absolute supremacy of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power;
#Equality before the law;
#The Constitution is a result of the ordinary law of the land.

Dicey&#x27;s rule of law formula consists of three classic tenets. The first is that the regular law is supreme over arbitrary and discretionary powers. &quot;[N]o man is punishable ... except for a distinct breach of the law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary courts of the land.&quot;

The second is that all men are to stand equal in the eyes of the law. &quot;...no man is above the law...every man, whatever be his rank or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals&quot; 

The third is that the general ideas and principles that the constitution supports arise directly from the judgements and precedents issued by the judiciary. &quot;We may say that the constitution is pervaded by the rule of law on the ground that the general principles of the constitution... are with us the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons in particular cases brought before the courts&quot; 

==The separation of powers==
Separation of powers is often regarded as a second limb functioning alongside the rule of law to curb the powers of the government. In many modern nation states, power is divided and vested into three branches of government: The legislature, the executive, and the judiciary are known as the horizontal separation of powers. The first and the second are harmonized in traditional Westminster system. Vertical separation of powers is decentralization.

== Election law ==
Election law is a subfield of constitutional law. It includes the rules governing the process of elections. These rules enable the translation of the will of the people into functioning democracies. Election law addresses issues who is entitled to vote, voter registration, ballot access, campaign finance and party funding, redistricting, apportionment, electronic voting and voting machines, accessibility of elections, election systems and formulas, vote counting, election disputes, referendums, and issues such as electoral fraud and electoral silence.

<text>The Celtic languages ( ) are a branch of the Indo-European language family, descended from the hypothetical Proto-Celtic language. The term &quot;Celtic&quot; was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707, following Paul-Yves Pezron, who made the explicit link between the Celts described by classical writers and the Welsh and Breton languages.

During the first millennium BC, Celtic languages were spoken across much of Europe and central Anatolia. Today, they are restricted to the northwestern fringe of Europe and a few diaspora communities. There are six living languages: the four continuously living languages Breton, Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh, and the two revived languages Cornish and Manx. All are minority languages in their respective countries, though there are continuing efforts at revitalisation. Welsh is an official language in Wales and Irish is an official language of Ireland and of the European Union. Welsh is the only Celtic language not classified as endangered by UNESCO. The Cornish and Manx languages became extinct in modern times but have been revived. Each now has several hundred second-language speakers.

Irish, Manx and Scottish Gaelic form the Goidelic languages, while Welsh, Cornish and Breton are Brittonic. All of these are Insular Celtic languages, since Breton, the only living Celtic language spoken in continental Europe, is descended from the language of settlers from Britain. There are a number of extinct but attested continental Celtic languages, such as Celtiberian, Galatian and Gaulish. Gaulish is more closely related to Insular Celtic than either of these two are to Celtiberian; together, Gaulish and Insular Celtic form the Nuclear Celtic subfamily. Beyond that, there is no agreement on the subdivisions of the Celtic language family. They may be divided into P-Celtic and Q-Celtic.

The Celtic languages have a rich literary tradition. The earliest specimens of written Celtic are Lepontic inscriptions from the 6th century BC in the Alps. Early Continental inscriptions used Italic and Paleohispanic scripts. Between the 4th and 8th centuries, Irish and Pictish were occasionally written in an original script, Ogham, but Latin script came to be used for all Celtic languages. Welsh has had a continuous literary tradition from the 6th century AD.

== Living languages ==
SIL Ethnologue lists six living Celtic languages, of which four have retained a substantial number of native speakers. These are: the Goidelic languages (Irish and Scottish Gaelic, both descended from Middle Irish) and the Brittonic languages (Welsh and Breton, descended from Common Brittonic). The other two, Cornish (Brittonic) and Manx (Goidelic), died out in modern times with their presumed last native speakers in 1777 and 1974 respectively. Revitalisation movements in the 2000s led to the reemergence of native speakers for both languages following their adoption by adults and children. By the 21st century, there were roughly one million total speakers of Celtic languages, increasing to 1.4 million speakers by 2010.

=== Demographics ===
=== Mixed languages ===
* Beurla Reagaird, Highland travellers&#x27; language
* Shelta, based largely on Irish and Hiberno-English (some 86,000 speakers in 2009).

== Classification ==

Celtic is divided into various branches:

* Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC). Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy. Coins with Lepontic inscriptions have been found in Noricum and Gallia Narbonensis.
* Celtiberian, also called Eastern or Northeastern Hispano-Celtic, spoken in the ancient Iberian Peninsula, in the eastern part of Old Castile and south of Aragon. Modern provinces: Segovia, Burgos, Soria, Guadalajara, Cuenca, Zaragoza and Teruel. The relationship of Celtiberian with Gallaecian, in northwest Iberia, is uncertain.
* Gallaecian, also known as Western or Northwestern Hispano-Celtic, anciently spoken in the northwest of the peninsula (modern Northern Portugal, and the Spanish regions of Galicia, Asturias and northwestern Castile and León).
* Gaulish languages, including Galatian and possibly Noric. These were once spoken in a wide arc from Belgium to Turkey. They are now all extinct.
* Brittonic, spoken in Great Britain and Brittany. Including the living languages Breton, Cornish, and Welsh, and the lost Cumbric and Pictish, though Pictish may be a sister language rather than a daughter of Common Brittonic. Before the arrival of Scotti on the Isle of Man in the 9th century, there may have been a Brittonic language there. The theory of a Brittonic Ivernic language predating Goidelic speech in Ireland has been suggested, but is not widely accepted.
* Goidelic, including the extant Irish, Manx, and Scottish Gaelic.

=== Continental/Insular Celtic and P/Q-Celtic hypotheses ===
Scholarly handling of Celtic languages has been contentious owing to scarceness of primary source data. Some scholars (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) posit that the primary distinction is between Continental Celtic and Insular Celtic, arguing that the differences between the Goidelic and Brittonic languages arose after these split off from the Continental Celtic languages. Other scholars (such as Schmidt 1988) make the primary distinction between P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages based on the replacement of initial Q by initial P in some words. Most of the Gallic and Brittonic languages are P-Celtic, while the Goidelic and Hispano-Celtic (or Celtiberian) languages are Q-Celtic. The P-Celtic languages (also called Gallo-Brittonic) are sometimes seen (for example by Koch 1992) as a central innovating area as opposed to the more conservative peripheral Q-Celtic languages. According to Ranko Matasović in the introduction to his 2009 &quot;Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic&quot;: &quot;Celtiberian ... is almost certainly an independent branch on the Celtic genealogical tree, one that became separated from the others very early.&quot;

The Breton language is Brittonic, not Gaulish, though there may be some input from the latter, having been introduced from Southwestern regions of Britain in the post-Roman era and having evolved into Breton.

In the P/Q classification schema, the first language to split off from Proto-Celtic was Gaelic. It has characteristics that some scholars see as archaic, but others see as also being in the Brittonic languages (see Schmidt). In the Insular/Continental classification schema, the split of the former into Gaelic and Brittonic is seen as being late.

The distinction of Celtic into these four sub-families most likely occurred about 900 BC according to Gray &amp; Atkinson but, because of estimation uncertainty, it could be any time between 1200 and 800 BC. However, they only considered Gaelic and Brythonic. A controversial paper by Forster &amp; Toth included Gaulish and put the break-up much earlier at 3200 BC ± 1500 years. They support the Insular Celtic hypothesis. The early Celts were commonly associated with the archaeological Urnfield culture, the Hallstatt culture, and the La Tène culture, though the earlier assumption of association between language and culture is now considered to be less strong.

There are legitimate scholarly arguments for both the Insular Celtic hypothesis and the P-/Q-Celtic hypothesis. Proponents of each schema dispute the accuracy and usefulness of the other&#x27;s categories. However, since the 1970s the division into Insular and Continental Celtic has become the more widely held view (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), but in the middle of the 1980s, the P-/Q-Celtic theory found new supporters (Lambert 1994), because of the inscription on the Larzac piece of lead (1983), the analysis of which reveals another common phonetical innovation &quot;-nm-&quot; &gt; &quot;-nu&quot; (Gaelic / Gaulish , Old Welsh &#x27;names&#x27;), that is less accidental than only one. The discovery of a third common innovation would allow the specialists to come to the conclusion of a Gallo-Brittonic dialect (Schmidt 1986; Fleuriot 1986).

The interpretation of this and further evidence is still quite contested, and the main argument for Insular Celtic is connected with the development of verbal morphology and the syntax in Irish and British Celtic, which Schumacher regards as convincing, while he considers the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic division unimportant and treats Gallo-Brittonic as an outdated theory. Stifter affirms that the Gallo-Brittonic view is &quot;out of favour&quot; in the scholarly community as of 2008 and the Insular Celtic hypothesis &quot;widely accepted&quot;.

When referring only to the modern Celtic languages, since no Continental Celtic language has living descendants, &quot;Q-Celtic&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Goidelic&quot; and &quot;P-Celtic&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Brittonic&quot;.

How the family tree of the Celtic languages is ordered depends on which hypothesis is used:
&quot;Insular Celtic hypothesis&quot;

* Proto-Celtic
** Continental Celtic 
*** Celtiberian 
*** Gallaecian 
*** Gaulish 
** Insular Celtic
*** Brittonic
*** Goidelic
&quot;P/Q-Celtic hypothesis&quot;

* Proto-Celtic
** Q-Celtic
*** Celtiberian 
*** Gallaecian 
*** Goidelic
** P-Celtic
*** Gaulish 
*** Brittonic

=== Eska (2010) ===
Eska evaluates the evidence as supporting the following tree, based on shared innovations, though it is not always clear that the innovations are not areal features. It seems likely that Celtiberian split off before Cisalpine Celtic, but the evidence for this is not robust. On the other hand, the unity of Gaulish, Goidelic, and Brittonic is reasonably secure. Schumacher (2004, p. 86) had already cautiously considered this grouping to be likely genetic, based, among others, on the shared reformation of the sentence-initial, fully inflecting relative pronoun &quot;*i̯os, *i̯ā, *i̯od&quot; into an uninflected enclitic particle. Eska sees Cisalpine Gaulish as more akin to Lepontic than to Transalpine Gaulish.
*Celtic
**Hispano-Celtic 
***Celtiberian 
***Gallaecian 
**Nuclear Celtic
***Cisalpine Celtic: Lepontic → Cisalpine Gaulish 
***Core Celtic (secure)
****Transalpine Gaulish (&quot;Transalpine Celtic&quot;)
****Insular Celtic
*****Goidelic
*****Brittonic
Eska considers a division of Transalpine–Goidelic–Brittonic into Transalpine and Insular Celtic to be most probable because of the greater number of innovations in Insular Celtic than in P-Celtic, and because the Insular Celtic languages were probably not in great enough contact for those innovations to spread as part of a sprachbund. However, if they have another explanation (such as an SOV substratum language), then it is possible that P-Celtic is a valid clade, and the top branching would be:
*Core Celtic (P-Celtic hypothesis)
**Goidelic
**Gallo-Brittonic
***Transalpine Gaulish (&quot;Transalpine Celtic&quot;) 
***Brittonic
=== Italo-Celtic ===
Within the Indo-European family, the Celtic languages have sometimes been placed with the Italic languages in a common Italo-Celtic subfamily. This hypothesis fell somewhat out of favour after reexamination by American linguist Calvert Watkins in 1966. Irrespectively, some scholars such as Ringe, Warnow and Taylor and many others have argued in favour of an Italo-Celtic grouping in 21st century theses.

== Characteristics ==
Although there are many differences between the individual Celtic languages, they do show many family resemblances.

* consonant mutations (Insular Celtic only)
* inflected prepositions (Insular Celtic only)
* two grammatical genders (modern Insular Celtic only; Old Irish and the Continental languages had three genders, although Gaulish may have merged the neuter and masculine in its later forms)
* a vigesimal number system (counting by twenties)
** Cornish &quot;fifty-six&quot; (literally &quot;sixteen and two twenty&quot;)
* verb–subject–object (VSO) word order (probably Insular Celtic only)
* an interplay between the subjunctive, future, imperfect, and habitual, to the point that some tenses and moods have ousted others
* an impersonal or autonomous verb form serving as a passive or intransitive
** Welsh &quot;I teach&quot; vs. &quot;is taught, one teaches&quot;
** Irish &quot;I teach&quot; vs. &quot;is taught, one teaches&quot;
* no infinitives, replaced by a quasi-nominal verb form called the verbal noun or verbnoun
* frequent use of vowel mutation as a morphological device, e.g. formation of plurals, verbal stems, etc.
* use of preverbal particles to signal either subordination or illocutionary force of the following clause
** mutation-distinguished subordinators/relativisers
** particles for negation, interrogation, and occasionally for affirmative declarations
* pronouns positioned between particles and verbs
* lack of simple verb for the imperfective &quot;have&quot; process, with possession conveyed by a composite structure, usually BE + preposition
** Cornish &quot;I have a cat&quot;, literally &quot;there is a cat to me&quot;
** Welsh &quot;I have a cat&quot;, literally &quot;a cat is with me&quot;
** Irish &quot;I have a cat&quot;, literally &quot;there is a cat at me&quot;
* use of periphrastic constructions to express verbal tense, voice, or aspectual distinctions
* distinction by function of the two versions of BE verbs traditionally labelled substantive (or existential) and copula
* bifurcated demonstrative structure
* suffixed pronominal supplements, called confirming or supplementary pronouns
* use of singulars or special forms of counted nouns, and use of a singulative suffix to make singular forms from plurals, where older singulars have disappeared

Examples:
: (Literal translation) &quot;Do not bother with son the beggar&#x27;s and not will-bother son the beggar&#x27;s with-you.&quot;
:* is the genitive of . The the result of affection; the is the lenited form of .
:* is the second person singular inflected form of the preposition .
:* The order is verb–subject–object (VSO) in the second half. Compare this to English or French (and possibly Continental Celtic) which are normally subject–verb–object in word order.
: (Literally) &quot;four on fifteen and four twenties&quot;
:* is a mutated form of , which is (&quot;five&quot;) plus (&quot;ten&quot;). Likewise, is a mutated form of .
:* The multiples of ten are .

=== Comparison table ===
The lexical similarity between the different Celtic languages is apparent in their core vocabulary, especially in terms of actual pronunciation. Moreover, the phonetic differences between languages are often the product of regular sound change (i.e. lenition of into or Ø).

The table below has words in the modern languages that were inherited direct from Proto-Celtic, as well as a few old borrowings from Latin that made their way into all the daughter languages. There is often a closer match between Welsh, Breton and Cornish on the one hand and Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx on the other. For a fuller list of comparisons, see the .

== Possible members of the family ==
Several poorly-documented languages may have been Celtic.

*Ancient Belgian
* Camunic is an extinct language spoken in the first millennium BC in the Val Camonica and Valtellina valleys of the Central Alps. It has recently been proposed that it was a Celtic language.
* Ivernic
* Ligurian, on the Northern Mediterranean Coast straddling the southeast French and northwest Italian coasts, including parts of Tuscany, Elba and Corsica. Xavier Delamarre argues that Ligurian was a Celtic language similar to Gaulish. The Ligurian-Celtic question is also discussed by Barruol (1999). Ancient Ligurian is listed as either Celtic (epigraphic), or Para-Celtic (onomastic).
* Lusitanian, spoken in the area between the Douro and Tagus rivers of western Iberia (a region straddling the present border of Portugal and Spain). Known from only five inscriptions and various place names. It is an Indo-European language and some scholars have proposed that it may be a para-Celtic language that evolved alongside Celtic or formed a dialect continuum or sprachbund with Tartessian and Gallaecian. This is tied to a theory of an Iberian origin for the Celtic languages. It is also possible that the Q-Celtic languages alone, including Goidelic, originated in western Iberia (a theory that was first put forward by Edward Lhuyd in 1707) or shared a common linguistic ancestor with Lusitanian. Secondary evidence for this hypothesis has been found in research by biological scientists, who have identified (1) deep-rooted similarities in human DNA found precisely in both the former Lusitania and Ireland, and; (2) the so-called &quot;Lusitanian distribution&quot; of animals and plants unique to western Iberia and Ireland. Both phenomena are now generally thought to have resulted from human emigration from Iberia to Ireland, in the late Paleolithic or early Mesolithic eras. Other scholars see greater linguistic affinities between Lusitanian, Old Gallo-Italic (particularly with Ligurian) and Old European. Prominent modern linguists such as Ellis Evans, believe Gallaecian-Lusitanian was in fact one same language (not separate languages) of the &quot;P&quot; Celtic variant.
* Rhaetic, spoken in central Switzerland, Tyrol in Austria, and the Alpine regions of northeast Italy. Documented by a limited number of short inscriptions (found through Northern Italy and Western Austria) in two variants of the Etruscan alphabet. Its linguistic categorisation is not clearly established, and it presents a confusing mixture of what appear to be Etruscan, Indo-European, and uncertain other elements. Howard Hayes Scullard argues that Rhaetian was also a Celtic language.
* Tartessian, spoken in the southwest of the Iberia Peninsula (mainly southern Portugal and southwest Spain). Tartessian is known by 95 inscriptions, with the longest having 82 readable signs. John T. Koch argues that Tartessian was also a Celtic language.

<text>Color (or colour in Commonwealth English; see spelling differences) is the visual perception based on the electromagnetic spectrum. Though color is not an inherent property of matter, color perception is related to an object&#x27;s light absorption, reflection, emission spectra, and interference. For most humans, colors are perceived in the visible light spectrum with three types of cone cells (trichromacy). Other animals may have a different number of cone cell types or have eyes sensitive to different wavelengths, such as bees that can distinguish ultraviolet, and thus have a different color sensitivity range. Animal perception of color originates from different light wavelength or spectral sensitivity in cone cell types, which is then processed by the brain.

Colors have perceived properties such as hue, colorfulness (saturation), and luminance. Colors can also be additively mixed (commonly used for actual light) or subtractively mixed (commonly used for materials). If the colors are mixed in the right proportions, because of metamerism, they may look the same as a single-wavelength light. For convenience, colors can be organized in a color space, which when being abstracted as a mathematical color model can assign each region of color with a corresponding set of numbers. As such, color spaces are an essential tool for color reproduction in print, photography, computer monitors, and television. Some of the most well-known color models and color spaces are RGB, CMYK, HSL/HSV, CIE Lab, and YCbCr/YUV.

Because the perception of color is an important aspect of human life, different colors have been associated with emotions, activity, and nationality. Names of color regions in different cultures can have different, sometimes overlapping areas. In visual arts, color theory is used to govern the use of colors in an aesthetically pleasing and harmonious way. The theory of color includes the color complements; color balance; and classification of primary colors (traditionally red, yellow, blue), secondary colors (traditionally orange, green, purple), and tertiary colors. The study of colors in general is called color science.

== Physical properties ==
Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390 nm to 700 nm), it is known as &quot;visible light&quot;.

Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source&#x27;s &quot;spectrum&quot; is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class, the members are called &quot;metamers&quot; of the color in question. This effect can be visualized by comparing the light sources&#x27; spectral power distributions and the resulting colors.

=== Spectral colors ===

The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum—named using the Latin word for &quot;appearance&quot; or &quot;apparition&quot; by Isaac Newton in 1671—include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the &quot;pure spectral&quot; or &quot;monochromatic&quot; colors. The spectrum above shows approximate wavelengths (in nm) for spectral colors in the visible range. Spectral colors have 100% purity, and are fully saturated. A complex mixture of spectral colors can be used to describe any color, which is the definition of a light power spectrum.

The spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency. Despite the ubiquitous ROYGBIV mnemonic used to remember the spectral colors in English, the inclusion or exclusion of colors is contentious, with disagreement often focused on indigo and cyan. Even if the subset of color terms is agreed, their wavelength ranges and borders between them may not be.

The &quot;intensity&quot; of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably. For example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive green. Additionally, hue shifts towards yellow or blue happen if the intensity of a spectral light is increased; this is called Bezold–Brücke shift. In color models capable of representing spectral colors, such as CIELUV, a spectral color has the maximal saturation. In Helmholtz coordinates, this is described as 100% purity.

=== Color of objects ===

The physical color of an object depends on how it absorbs and scatters light. Most objects scatter light to some degree and do not reflect or transmit light specularly like glasses or mirrors. A transparent object allows almost all light to transmit or pass through, thus transparent objects are perceived as colorless. Conversely, an opaque object does not allow light to transmit through and instead absorbs or reflects the light it receives. Like transparent objects, translucent objects allow light to transmit through, but translucent objects are seen colored because they scatter or absorb certain wavelengths of light via internal scattering. The absorbed light is often dissipated as heat.

== Color vision ==
=== Development of theories of color vision ===
Although Aristotle and other ancient scientists had already written on the nature of light and color vision, it was not until Newton that light was identified as the source of the color sensation. In 1810, Goethe published his comprehensive &quot;Theory of Colors&quot; in which he provided a rational description of color experience, which &#x27;tells us how it originates, not what it is&#x27;. (Schopenhauer)

In 1801 Thomas Young proposed his trichromatic theory, based on the observation that any color could be matched with a combination of three lights. This theory was later refined by James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz. As Helmholtz puts it, &quot;the principles of Newton&#x27;s law of mixture were experimentally confirmed by Maxwell in 1856. Young&#x27;s theory of color sensations, like so much else that this marvelous investigator achieved in advance of his time, remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to it.&quot;

At the same time as Helmholtz, Ewald Hering developed the opponent process theory of color, noting that color blindness and afterimages typically come in opponent pairs (red-green, blue-orange, yellow-violet, and black-white). Ultimately these two theories were synthesized in 1957 by Hurvich and Jameson, who showed that retinal processing corresponds to the trichromatic theory, while processing at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus corresponds to the opponent theory.

In 1931, an international group of experts known as the &quot;Commission internationale de l&#x27;éclairage&quot; (CIE) developed a mathematical color model, which mapped out the space of observable colors and assigned a set of three numbers to each.

=== Color in the eye ===

The ability of the human eye to distinguish colors is based upon the varying sensitivity of different cells in the retina to light of different wavelengths. Humans are trichromatic—the retina contains three types of color receptor cells, or cones. One type, relatively distinct from the other two, is most responsive to light that is perceived as blue or blue-violet, with wavelengths around 450 nm; cones of this type are sometimes called &quot;short-wavelength cones&quot; or &quot;S cones&quot; (or misleadingly, &quot;blue cones&quot;). The other two types are closely related genetically and chemically: &quot;middle-wavelength cones&quot;, &quot;M cones&quot;, or &quot;green cones&quot; are most sensitive to light perceived as green, with wavelengths around 540 nm, while the &quot;long-wavelength cones&quot;, &quot;L cones&quot;, or &quot;red cones&quot;, are most sensitive to light that is perceived as greenish yellow, with wavelengths around 570 nm.

Light, no matter how complex its composition of wavelengths, is reduced to three color components by the eye. Each cone type adheres to the principle of univariance, which is that each cone&#x27;s output is determined by the amount of light that falls on it over all wavelengths. For each location in the visual field, the three types of cones yield three signals based on the extent to which each is stimulated. These amounts of stimulation are sometimes called &quot;tristimulus values&quot;.

The response curve as a function of wavelength varies for each type of cone. Because the curves overlap, some tristimulus values do not occur for any incoming light combination. For example, it is not possible to stimulate &quot;only&quot; the mid-wavelength (so-called &quot;green&quot;) cones; the other cones will inevitably be stimulated to some degree at the same time. The set of all possible tristimulus values determines the human &quot;color space&quot;. It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors.

The other type of light-sensitive cell in the eye, the rod, has a different response curve. In normal situations, when light is bright enough to strongly stimulate the cones, rods play virtually no role in vision at all. On the other hand, in dim light, the cones are understimulated leaving only the signal from the rods, resulting in a colorless response (furthermore, the rods are barely sensitive to light in the &quot;red&quot; range). In certain conditions of intermediate illumination, the rod response and a weak cone response can together result in color discriminations not accounted for by cone responses alone. These effects, combined, are summarized also in the Kruithof curve, which describes the change of color perception and pleasingness of light as a function of temperature and intensity.

=== Color in the brain ===
While the mechanisms of color vision at the level of the retina are well-described in terms of tristimulus values, color processing after that point is organized differently. A dominant theory of color vision proposes that color information is transmitted out of the eye by three opponent processes, or opponent channels, each constructed from the raw output of the cones: a red–green channel, a blue–yellow channel, and a black–white &quot;luminance&quot; channel. This theory has been supported by neurobiology, and accounts for the structure of our subjective color experience. Specifically, it explains why humans cannot perceive a &quot;reddish green&quot; or &quot;yellowish blue&quot;, and it predicts the color wheel: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes.

The exact nature of color perception beyond the processing already described, and indeed the status of color as a feature of the perceived world or rather as a feature of our &quot;perception&quot; of the world—a type of qualia—is a matter of complex and continuing philosophical dispute.

From the V1 blobs, color information is sent to cells in the second visual area, V2. The cells in V2 that are most strongly color tuned are clustered in the &quot;thin stripes&quot; that, like the blobs in V1, stain for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (separating the thin stripes are interstripes and thick stripes, which seem to be concerned with other visual information like motion and high-resolution form). Neurons in V2 then synapse onto cells in the extended V4. This area includes not only V4, but two other areas in the posterior inferior temporal cortex, anterior to area V3, the dorsal posterior inferior temporal cortex, and posterior TEO. Area V4 was initially suggested by Semir Zeki to be exclusively dedicated to color, and he later showed that V4 can be subdivided into subregions with very high concentrations of color cells separated from each other by zones with lower concentration of such cells though even the latter cells respond better to some wavelengths than to others, a finding confirmed by subsequent studies. The presence in V4 of orientation-selective cells led to the view that V4 is involved in processing both color and form associated with color but it is worth noting that the orientation selective cells within V4 are more broadly tuned than their counterparts in V1, V2, and V3. Color processing in the extended V4 occurs in millimeter-sized color modules called globs. This is the part of the brain in which color is first processed into the full range of hues found in color space.

=== Nonstandard color perception ===

==== Color vision deficiency ====

A color vision deficiency causes an individual to perceive a smaller gamut of colors than the standard observer with normal color vision. The effect can be mild, having lower &quot;color resolution&quot; (i.e. anomalous trichromacy), moderate, lacking an entire dimension or channel of color (e.g. dichromacy), or complete, lacking all color perception (i.e. monochromacy). Most forms of color blindness derive from one or more of the three classes of cone cells either being missing, having a shifted spectral sensitivity or having lower responsiveness to incoming light. In addition, cerebral achromatopsia is caused by neural anomalies in those parts of the brain where visual processing takes place.

Some colors that appear distinct to an individual with normal color vision will appear metameric to the color blind. The most common form of color blindness is congenital red–green color blindness, affecting ~8% of males. Individuals with the strongest form of this condition (dichromacy) will experience blue and purple, green and yellow, teal, and gray as colors of confusion, i.e. metamers.

==== Tetrachromacy ====

Outside of humans, which are mostly &quot;trichromatic&quot; (having three types of cones), most mammals are dichromatic, possessing only two cones. However, outside of mammals, most vertebrates are &quot;tetrachromatic&quot;, having four types of cones. This includes most birds, reptiles, amphibians, and bony fish. An extra dimension of color vision means these vertebrates can see two distinct colors that a normal human would view as metamers. Some invertebrates, such as the mantis shrimp, have an even higher number of cones (12) that could lead to a richer color gamut than even imaginable by humans.

The existence of human tetrachromats is a contentious notion. As many as half of all human females have 4 distinct cone classes, which could enable tetrachromacy. However, a distinction must be made between &quot;retinal&quot; (or &quot;weak&quot;) &quot;tetrachromats&quot;, which express four cone classes in the retina, and &quot;functional&quot; (or &quot;strong&quot;) &quot;tetrachromats&quot;, which are able to make the enhanced color discriminations expected of tetrachromats. In fact, there is only one peer-reviewed report of a functional tetrachromat. It is estimated that while the average person is able to see one million colors, someone with functional tetrachromacy could see a hundred million colors.

==== Synesthesia ====
In certain forms of synesthesia, perceiving letters and numbers (grapheme–color synesthesia) or hearing sounds (chromesthesia) will evoke a perception of color. Behavioral and functional neuroimaging experiments have demonstrated that these color experiences lead to changes in behavioral tasks and lead to increased activation of brain regions involved in color perception, thus demonstrating their reality, and similarity to real color percepts, albeit evoked through a non-standard route. Synesthesia can occur genetically, with 4% of the population having variants associated with the condition. Synesthesia has also been known to occur with brain damage, drugs, and sensory deprivation.

The philosopher Pythagoras experienced synesthesia and provided one of the first written accounts of the condition in approximately 550 BCE. He created mathematical equations for musical notes that could form part of a scale, such as an octave.

=== Afterimages ===
After exposure to strong light in their sensitivity range, photoreceptors of a given type become desensitized. For a few seconds after the light ceases, they will continue to signal less strongly than they otherwise would. Colors observed during that period will appear to lack the color component detected by the desensitized photoreceptors. This effect is responsible for the phenomenon of afterimages, in which the eye may continue to see a bright figure after looking away from it, but in a complementary color. Afterimage effects have also been used by artists, including Vincent van Gogh.

=== Color constancy ===

When an artist uses a limited color palette, the human visual system tends to compensate by seeing any gray or neutral color as the color which is missing from the color wheel. For example, in a limited palette consisting of red, yellow, black, and white, a mixture of yellow and black will appear as a variety of green, a mixture of red and black will appear as a variety of purple, and pure gray will appear bluish.

The trichromatic theory is strictly true when the visual system is in a fixed state of adaptation. In reality, the visual system is constantly adapting to changes in the environment and compares the various colors in a scene to reduce the effects of the illumination. If a scene is illuminated with one light, and then with another, as long as the difference between the light sources stays within a reasonable range, the colors in the scene appear relatively constant to us. This was studied by Edwin H. Land in the 1970s and led to his retinex theory of color constancy.

Both phenomena are readily explained and mathematically modeled with modern theories of chromatic adaptation and color appearance (e.g. CIECAM02, iCAM). There is no need to dismiss the trichromatic theory of vision, but rather it can be enhanced with an understanding of how the visual system adapts to changes in the viewing environment.

== Reproduction ==

Color reproduction is the science of creating colors for the human eye that faithfully represent the desired color. It focuses on how to construct a spectrum of wavelengths that will best evoke a certain color in an observer. Most colors are not spectral colors, meaning they are mixtures of various wavelengths of light. However, these non-spectral colors are often described by their dominant wavelength, which identifies the single wavelength of light that produces a sensation most similar to the non-spectral color. Dominant wavelength is roughly akin to hue.

There are many color perceptions that by definition cannot be pure spectral colors due to desaturation or because they are purples (mixtures of red and violet light, from opposite ends of the spectrum). Some examples of necessarily non-spectral colors are the achromatic colors (black, gray, and white) and colors such as pink, tan, and magenta.

Two different light spectra that have the same effect on the three color receptors in the human eye will be perceived as the same color. They are metamers of that color. This is exemplified by the white light emitted by fluorescent lamps, which typically has a spectrum of a few narrow bands, while daylight has a continuous spectrum. The human eye cannot tell the difference between such light spectra just by looking into the light source, although the color rendering index of each light source may affect the color of objects illuminated by these metameric light sources.

Similarly, most human color perceptions can be generated by a mixture of three colors called &quot;primaries&quot;. This is used to reproduce color scenes in photography, printing, television, and other media. There are a number of methods or color spaces for specifying a color in terms of three particular primary colors. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular application.

No mixture of colors, however, can produce a response truly identical to that of a spectral color, although one can get close, especially for the longer wavelengths, where the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram has a nearly straight edge. For example, mixing green light (530 nm) and blue light (460 nm) produces cyan light that is slightly desaturated, because response of the red color receptor would be greater to the green and blue light in the mixture than it would be to a pure cyan light at 485 nm that has the same intensity as the mixture of blue and green.

Because of this, and because the &quot;primaries&quot; in color printing systems generally are not pure themselves, the colors reproduced are never perfectly saturated spectral colors, and so spectral colors cannot be matched exactly. However, natural scenes rarely contain fully saturated colors, thus such scenes can usually be approximated well by these systems. The range of colors that can be reproduced with a given color reproduction system is called the gamut. The CIE chromaticity diagram can be used to describe the gamut.

Another problem with color reproduction systems is connected with the initial measurement of color, or colorimetry. The characteristics of the color sensors in measurement devices (e.g. cameras, scanners) are often very far from the characteristics of the receptors in the human eye.

A color reproduction system &quot;tuned&quot; to a human with normal color vision may give very inaccurate results for other observers, according to color vision deviations to the standard observer.

The different color response of different devices can be problematic if not properly managed. For color information stored and transferred in digital form, color management techniques, such as those based on ICC profiles, can help to avoid distortions of the reproduced colors. Color management does not circumvent the gamut limitations of particular output devices, but can assist in finding good mapping of input colors into the gamut that can be reproduced.

=== Additive coloring ===

Additive color is light created by mixing together light of two or more different colors. Red, green, and blue are the additive primary colors normally used in additive color systems such as projectors, televisions, and computer terminals.

=== Subtractive coloring ===
Subtractive coloring uses dyes, inks, pigments, or filters to absorb some wavelengths of light and not others. The color that a surface displays comes from the parts of the visible spectrum that are not absorbed and therefore remain visible. Without pigments or dye, fabric fibers, paint base and paper are usually made of particles that scatter white light (all colors) well in all directions. When a pigment or ink is added, wavelengths are absorbed or &quot;subtracted&quot; from white light, so light of another color reaches the eye.

If the light is not a pure white source (the case of nearly all forms of artificial lighting), the resulting spectrum will appear a slightly different color. Red paint, viewed under blue light, may appear black. Red paint is red because it scatters only the red components of the spectrum. If red paint is illuminated by blue light, it will be absorbed by the red paint, creating the appearance of a black object.

The subtractive model also predicts the color resulting from a mixture of paints, or similar medium such as fabric dye, whether applied in layers or mixed together prior to application. In the case of paint mixed before application, incident light interacts with many different pigment particles at various depths inside the paint layer before emerging.

=== Structural color ===

Structural colors are colors caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. Color effects are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel thin layers, or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the color&#x27;s wavelength. If the microstructures are spaced randomly, light of shorter wavelengths will be scattered preferentially to produce Tyndall effect colors: the blue of the sky (Rayleigh scattering, caused by structures much smaller than the wavelength of light, in this case, air molecules), the luster of opals, and the blue of human irises. If the microstructures are aligned in arrays, for example, the array of pits in a CD, they behave as a diffraction grating: the grating reflects different wavelengths in different directions due to interference phenomena, separating mixed &quot;white&quot; light into light of different wavelengths. If the structure is one or more thin layers then it will reflect some wavelengths and transmit others, depending on the layers&#x27; thickness.

Structural color is studied in the field of thin-film optics. The most ordered or the most changeable structural colors are iridescent. Structural color is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the blue jay, for example), as well as certain butterfly wings and beetle shells. Variations in the pattern&#x27;s spacing often give rise to an iridescent effect, as seen in peacock feathers, soap bubbles, films of oil, and mother of pearl, because the reflected color depends upon the viewing angle. Numerous scientists have carried out research in butterfly wings and beetle shells, including Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Since 1942, electron micrography has been used, advancing the development of products that exploit structural color, such as &quot;photonic&quot; cosmetics.

== Optimal colors ==

Optimal colors are the most chromatic colors that surfaces can have. That is, optimal colors are the theoretical limit for the color of objects*. For now, we are unable to produce objects with such colors, at least not without recurring to more complex physical phenomena.

&quot;*(with classical reflection. Phenomena like fluorescence or structural color may produce objects whose color lies outside the optimal color solid)&quot;

The plot of the gamut bounded by optimal colors in a color space is called the optimal color solid or Rösch–MacAdam color solid.

The reflectance spectrum of a color is the amount of light of each wavelength that it reflects, in proportion to a given maximum, which is total reflection of light of that wavelength, and has the value of 1 (100%). If the reflectance spectrum of a color is 0 (0%) or 1 (100%) across the entire visible spectrum, and it has no more than two transitions between 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, then it is an optimal color. With the current state of technology, we are unable to produce any material or pigment with these properties.

Thus four types of &quot;optimal color&quot; spectra are possible: 
* The transition goes from zero at both ends of the spectrum to one in the middle, as shown in the image at right. 
*It goes from one at the ends to zero in the middle.
*It goes from 1 at the start of the visible spectrum to 0 in some point in the middle until its end.
*It goes from 0 at the start of the visible spectrum to 1 at some point in the middle until its end. 

The first type produces colors that are similar to the spectral colors and follow roughly the horseshoe-shaped portion of the CIE xy chromaticity diagram (the spectral locus), but are, in surfaces, more chromatic, although less spectrally pure. The second type produces colors that are similar to (but, in surfaces, more chromatic and less spectrally pure than) the colors on the straight line in the CIE xy chromaticity diagram (the line of purples), leading to magenta or purple-like colors. The third type produces the colors located in the &quot;warm&quot; sharp edge of the optimal color solid (this will be explained later in the article). The fourth type produces the colors located in the &quot;cold&quot; sharp edge of the optimal color solid.

In optimal color solids, the colors of the visible spectrum are theoretically black, because their reflectance spectrum is 1 (100%) in only one wavelength, and 0 in all of the other infinite visible wavelengths that there are, meaning that they have a lightness of 0 with respect to white, and will also have 0 chroma, but, of course, 100% of spectral purity. In short: In optimal color solids, spectral colors are equivalent to black (0 lightness, 0 chroma), but have full spectral purity (they are located in the horseshoe-shaped spectral locus of the chromaticiy diagram).

In linear color spaces that contain all colors visible by humans, such as LMS or CIE 1931 XYZ, the set of half-lines that start at the origin (black, (0, 0, 0)) and pass through all the points that represent the colors of the visible spectrum, and the portion of a plane that passes through the violet half-line and the red half-line (both ends of the visible spectrum), generate the &quot;spectrum cone&quot;. The black point (coordinates (0, 0, 0)) of the optimal color solid (and only the black point) is tangent to the &quot;spectrum cone&quot;, and the white point ((1, 1, 1)) (only the white point) is tangent to the &quot;inverted spectrum cone&quot;, with the &quot;inverted spectrum cone&quot; being symmetrical to the &quot;spectrum cone&quot; with respect to the middle gray point ((0.5, 0.5, 0.5)). This means that, in linear color spaces, the optimal color solid is centrally symmetric.

In most color spaces, the surface of the optimal color solid is smooth, except for two points (black and white); and two sharp edges: the &quot;warm&quot; edge, which goes from black, to red, to orange, to yellow, to white; and the &quot;cold&quot; edge, which goes from black, to deep violet, to blue, to cyan, to white. This is due to the following: If the portion of the reflectance spectrum of a color is spectral red (which is located at one end of the spectrum), it will be seen as black. If the size of the portion of total reflectance is increased, now covering from the red end of the spectrum to the yellow wavelengths, it will be seen as red or orange. If the portion is expanded even more, covering some green wavelengths, it will be seen as yellow. If it is expanded even more, it will cover more wavelengths than the yellow semichrome does, approaching white, until it is reached when the full spectrum is reflected. The described process is called &quot;cumulation&quot;. Cumulation can be started at either end of the visible spectrum (we just described cumulation starting from the red end of the spectrum, generating the &quot;warm&quot; sharp edge), cumulation starting at the violet end of the spectrum will generate the &quot;cold&quot; sharp edge.

On modern computers, it is possible to calculate an optimal color solid with great precision in seconds. Usually, only the MacAdam limits (the optimal colors, the boundary of the Optimal color solid) are computed, because all the other (non-optimal) possible surface colors exist inside the boundary.

=== Maximum chroma colors, semichromes, or full colors ===
Each hue has a maximum chroma point, semichrome, or full color; objects cannot have a color of that hue with a higher chroma. They are the most chromatic, vibrant colors that objects can have. They were called semichromes or full colors by the German chemist and philosopher Wilhelm Ostwald in the early 20th century.

If B is the complementary wavelength of wavelength A, then the straight line that connects A and B passes through the achromatic axis in a linear color space, such as LMS or CIE 1931 XYZ. If the reflectance spectrum of a color is 1 (100%) for all the wavelengths between A and B, and 0 for all the wavelengths of the other half of the color space, then that color is a maximum chroma color, semichrome, or full color (this is the explanation to why they were called semichromes). Thus, maximum chroma colors are a type of optimal color.

As explained, full colors are far from being monochromatic (physically, not perceptually). If the spectral purity of a semichrome is increased, its chroma decreases, because it will approach the visible spectrum, ergo, it will approach black.

In perceptually uniform color spaces, the lightness of the full colors varies from around 30% in the violetish blue hues, to around 90% in the yellowish hues. The chroma of each maximum chroma point also varies depending on the hue; in optimal color solids plotted in perceptually uniform color spaces, semichromes like red, green, violet, and magenta have a high chroma, while semichromes like yellow, orange, and cyan have a slightly lower chroma.

== Cultural perspective ==

The meanings and associations of colors can play a major role in works of art, including literature.

=== Associations ===
Individual colors have a variety of cultural associations such as national colors (in general described in individual color articles and color symbolism). The field of color psychology attempts to identify the effects of color on human emotion and activity. Chromotherapy is a form of alternative medicine attributed to various Eastern traditions. Colors have different associations in different countries and cultures.

Different colors have been demonstrated to have effects on cognition. For example, researchers at the University of Linz in Austria demonstrated that the color red significantly decreases cognitive functioning in men. The combination of the colors red and yellow together can induce hunger, which has been capitalized on by a number of chain restaurants.

Color plays a role in memory development too. A photograph that is in black and white is slightly less memorable than one in color. Studies also show that wearing bright colors makes one more memorable to people they meet.

=== Terminology ===
Colors vary in several different ways, including hue (shades of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet, etc.), saturation, brightness. Some color words are derived from the name of an object of that color, such as &quot;orange&quot; or &quot;salmon&quot;, while others are abstract, like &quot;red&quot;.

In the 1969 study &quot;Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution&quot;, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay describe a pattern in naming &quot;basic&quot; colors (like &quot;red&quot; but not &quot;red-orange&quot; or &quot;dark red&quot; or &quot;blood red&quot;, which are &quot;shades&quot; of red). All languages that have two &quot;basic&quot; color names distinguish dark/cool colors from bright/warm colors. The next colors to be distinguished are usually red and then yellow or green. All languages with six &quot;basic&quot; colors include black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow. The pattern holds up to a set of twelve: black, gray, white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and azure (distinct from blue in Russian and Italian, but not English).

<text>A computation is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is well-defined. Common examples of computation are mathematical equation solving and the execution of computer algorithms.

Mechanical or electronic devices (or, historically, people) that perform computations are known as &quot;computers&quot;. 

Computer science is an academic field that involves the study of computation.

== Introduction ==
The notion that mathematical statements should be &#x27;well-defined&#x27; had been argued by mathematicians since at least the 1600s, but agreement on a suitable definition proved elusive. A candidate definition was proposed independently by several mathematicians in the 1930s. The best-known variant was formalised by the mathematician Alan Turing, who defined a well-defined statement or calculation as any statement that could be expressed in terms of the initialisation parameters of a Turing machine. Other (mathematically equivalent) definitions include Alonzo Church&#x27;s &quot;lambda-definability&quot;, Herbrand-Gödel-Kleene&#x27;s &quot;general recursiveness&quot; and Emil Post&#x27;s &quot;1-definability&quot;.

Today, any formal statement or calculation that exhibits this quality of well-definedness is termed computable, while the statement or calculation itself is referred to as a computation.

Turing&#x27;s definition apportioned &quot;well-definedness&quot; to a very large class of mathematical statements, including all well-formed algebraic statements, and all statements written in modern computer programming languages.

Despite the widespread uptake of this definition, there are some mathematical concepts that have no well-defined characterisation under this definition. This includes the halting problem and the busy beaver game. It remains an open question as to whether there exists a more powerful definition of &#x27;well-defined&#x27; that is able to capture both computable and &#x27;non-computable&#x27; statements.

Some examples of mathematical statements that are computable include:
* All statements characterised in modern programming languages, including C++, Python, and Java.
* All calculations carried by an electronic computer, calculator or abacus.
* All calculations carried out on an analytical engine.
* All calculations carried out on a Turing Machine.
* The majority of mathematical statements and calculations given in maths textbooks.

Some examples of mathematical statements that are &quot;not&quot; computable include:

* Calculations or statements which are ill-defined, such that they cannot be unambiguously encoded into a Turing machine: (&quot;Paul loves me twice as much as Joe&quot;).
* Problem statements which do appear to be well-defined, but for which it can be proved that no Turing machine exists to solve them (such as the halting problem).

=== The Physical process of computation ===
Computation can be seen as a purely physical process occurring inside a closed physical system called a computer. Turing&#x27;s 1937 proof, &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot;, demonstrated that there is a formal equivalence between computable statements and particular physical systems, commonly called computers. Examples of such physical systems are: Turing machines, human mathematicians following strict rules, digital computers, mechanical computers, analog computers and others.

== Alternative accounts of computation ==

=== The mapping account ===
An alternative account of computation is found throughout the works of Hilary Putnam and others. Peter Godfrey-Smith has dubbed this the &quot;simple mapping account.&quot; Gualtiero Piccinini&#x27;s summary of this account states that a physical system can be said to perform a specific computation when there is a mapping between the state of that system and the computation such that the &quot;microphysical states [of the system] mirror the state transitions between the computational states.&quot;

=== The semantic account ===
Philosophers such as Jerry Fodor have suggested various accounts of computation with the restriction that semantic content be a necessary condition for computation (that is, what differentiates an arbitrary physical system from a computing system is that the operands of the computation represent something). This notion attempts to prevent the logical abstraction of the mapping account of pancomputationalism, the idea that everything can be said to be computing everything.

=== The mechanistic account ===
Gualtiero Piccinini proposes an account of computation based on mechanical philosophy. It states that physical computing systems are types of mechanisms that, by design, perform physical computation, or the manipulation (by a functional mechanism) of a &quot;medium-independent&quot; vehicle according to a rule. &quot;Medium-independence&quot; requires that the property can be instantiated by multiple realizers and multiple mechanisms, and that the inputs and outputs of the mechanism also be multiply realizable. In short, medium-independence allows for the use of physical variables with properties other than voltage (as in typical digital computers); this is imperative in considering other types of computation, such as that which occurs in the brain or in a quantum computer. A rule, in this sense, provides a mapping among inputs, outputs, and internal states of the physical computing system.

== Mathematical models ==

In the theory of computation, a diversity of mathematical models of computation has been developed.
Typical mathematical models of computers are the following:
* State models including Turing machine, pushdown automaton, finite-state automaton, and PRAM
* Functional models including lambda calculus
* Logical models including logic programming
* Concurrent models including actor model and process calculi
Giunti calls the models studied by computation theory &quot;computational systems,&quot; and he argues that all of them are mathematical dynamical systems with discrete time and discrete state space. He maintains that a computational system is a complex object which consists of three parts. First, a mathematical dynamical system formula_1 with discrete time and discrete state space; second, a computational setup formula_2, which is made up of a theoretical part formula_3, and a real part formula_4; third, an interpretation formula_5, which links the dynamical system formula_1 with the setup formula_7.

<doc id="5928" wikidata="Q7358" url="?curid=5928" title="Clown">
<text>A clown is a person who performs physical comedy and arts in an open-ended fashion, typically while wearing distinct makeup or costuming and reversing folkway-norms. The art of performing as a clown is known as clowning or buffoonery, and the term &quot;clown&quot; may be used synonymously with predecessors like jester, joker, buffoon, fool, or harlequin. Clowns have a diverse tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable clowns are those that commonly perform in the circus, characterized by colorful wigs, red noses, and oversized shoes. However, clowns have also played roles in theater and folklore, like the court jesters of the Middle Ages and the jesters and ritual clowns of various indigenous cultures. Their performances can elicit a range of emotions, from humor and laughter to fear and discomfort, reflecting complex societal and psychological dimensions. Through the centuries, clowns have continued to play significant roles in society, evolving alongside changing cultural norms and artistic expressions.

== History ==
The most ancient clowns have been found in the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt, around 2400 BC. Unlike court jesters, clowns have traditionally served a socio-religious and psychological role, and traditionally the roles of priest and clown have been held by the same persons.
Peter Berger writes, &quot;It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society.&quot; For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a physical performance discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.

In anthropology, the term &quot;clown&quot; has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such clowns have an important position are termed &quot;clown societies&quot;, and a clown character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a &quot;ritual clown&quot;.

Many native tribes have a history of clowning, such as the Pueblo clown of the Kachina culture. A Heyoka is an individual in Lakota and Dakota cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles, playing the role of a backwards clown by doing everything in reverse. The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a Winkte. Canadian First Nations also feature jester-like ritual performers, translated by one Anishinaabe activist as &quot;Harlequins&quot;, though the exact nature of their role is kept secret from non-members of the tribe into the present day.

The Canadian clowning method developed by Richard Pochinko and furthered by his former apprentice, Sue Morrison, combines European and Native American clowning techniques. In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator&#x27;s eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the medicine wheel. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.
The circus clown tradition developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or &quot;Varieté&quot; shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries. This recognizable character features outlandish costumes, distinctive makeup, colorful wigs, exaggerated footwear, and colorful clothing, with the style generally being designed to entertain large audiences.

The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by Joseph Grimaldi (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of Clown in the harlequinade that formed part of British pantomimes, notably at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Sadler&#x27;s Wells and Covent Garden theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as &quot;Joey&quot;, and both the nickname and Grimaldi&#x27;s whiteface make-up design are still used by other clowns.

The comedy that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition.

The modern clowning school of comedy in the 21st century diverged from white-face clown tradition, with more of an emphasis on personal vulnerability and heightened sexuality.

=== Origin ===
The &quot;clown&quot; character developed out of the zanni &quot;rustic fool&quot; characters of the early modern commedia dell&#x27;arte, which were themselves directly based on the &quot;rustic fool&quot; characters of ancient Greek and Roman theatre. Rustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as &quot;sklêro-paiktês&quot; (from &quot;paizein&quot;: &quot;to play (like a child)&quot;) or &quot;deikeliktas&quot;, besides other generic terms for &quot;rustic&quot; or &quot;peasant&quot;. In Roman theater, a term for clown was &quot;fossor&quot;, literally &quot;digger; labourer&quot;.
The English word &quot;clown&quot; was first recorded c. 1560 (as &quot;clowne, cloyne&quot;) in the generic meaning &quot;rustic, boor, peasant&quot;. The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with &quot;clumsy&quot;. It is in this sense that &quot;Clown&quot; is used as the name of fool characters in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The sense of &quot;clown&quot; as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on Elizabethan &quot;rustic fool&quot; characters such as Shakespeare&#x27;s.

The harlequinade developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by Arlecchino and the commedia dell&#x27;arte. It was here that &quot;Clown&quot; came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for Harlequin&#x27;s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants&#x27; garb.

The now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by Joseph Grimaldi, who played Clown in Charles Dibdin&#x27;s 1800 pantomime &quot;Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World&quot; at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.

===Modern circuses ===

The circus clown developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from Philip Astley&#x27;s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian George L. Fox became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.
Tom Belling senior (1843–1900) developed the &quot;red clown&quot; or &quot;Auguste&quot; (&quot;Dummer August&quot;) character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated &quot;white clown&quot;. Belling worked for Circus Renz in Vienna. Belling&#x27;s costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children&#x27;s clown, based on a lower class or &quot;hobo&quot; character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s 1892 opera &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (&quot;Clowns&quot;).
Belling&#x27;s &quot;Auguste&quot; character was further popularized by Nicolai Poliakoff&#x27;s &quot;Coco&quot; in the 1920s to 1930s.

The English word &quot;clown&quot; was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, by many other languages, such as French &quot;clown&quot;, German &quot;Clown&quot;, Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian &quot;klovn&quot;, Romanian &quot;clovn&quot; etc.

Italian retains &quot;Pagliaccio&quot;, a Commedia dell&#x27;arte zanni character, and derivations of the Italian term are found in French &quot;Paillasse&quot;, Spanish &quot;payaso&quot;, Catalan/Galician &quot;pallasso&quot;, Portuguese &quot;palhaço&quot;, Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish &quot;palyaço&quot;, German &quot;Bajass&quot; or &quot;Bajazzo&quot;, Yiddish פּאַיאַץ (&quot;payats&quot;), Russian пая́ц, Romanian &quot;paiață&quot;.

=== 20th-century North America ===
In the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the tramp or hobo. Examples include Marceline Orbes, who performed at the Hippodrome Theater (1905), Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Tramp&quot; (1914), and Emmett Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Weary Willie&quot; based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by Otto Griebling during the 1930s to 1950s. Red Skelton&#x27;s Dodo the Clown in &quot;The Clown&quot; (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, &quot;a funny man with a drinking problem&quot;.

In the United States, Bozo the Clown was an influential &quot;Auguste&quot; character since the late 1950s. &quot;The Bozo Show&quot; premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. McDonald&#x27;s derived its mascot clown, Ronald McDonald, from the &quot;Bozo&quot; character in the 1960s. Willard Scott, who had played &quot;Bozo&quot; during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald&#x27;s trademark application for the character dates to 1967.

Based on the &quot;Bozo&quot; template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children&#x27;s parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (&quot;Bozo&quot;-derived) clown character with children&#x27;s entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to Clown Care or &quot;hospital clowning&quot; in children&#x27;s hospitals by the mid-1980s. Clowns of America International (established 1984) and World Clown Association (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.

The shift of the &quot;Auguste&quot; or &quot;red clown&quot; character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a &quot;Bozo&quot;-derived standalone character in children&#x27;s entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the evil clown character, with the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature. The fear of clowns, particularly circus clowns, has become known by the term &quot;coulrophobia.&quot;

== Types ==
There are different types of clowns portrayed around the world. They include

* Auguste
* Blackface
* Buffoon
* Harlequin
* Jester
* Mime artist
* Pierrot
* Pueblo
* Rodeo clown
* Tramp
* Whiteface
=== Circus ===
=== Pierrot and Harlequin ===

The classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition
has a precedent in the pairing of Pierrot and Harlequin in the Commedia dell&#x27;arte.
Originally, Harlequin&#x27;s role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.

In the 18th-century English Harlequinade, Harlequin was now paired with Clown.
As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.

===White and Auguste ===

The &quot;white clown&quot;, or &quot;clown blanc&quot; in French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy Auguste. The two types are also distinguished as the &quot;sad clown&quot; (blanc) and &quot;happy clown&quot; (Auguste).

The Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the Auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or a costume that does not fit – oversize or too small, either is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.

The Auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the Auguste character to perform his bidding. The Auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the Auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface&#x27;s directions. Sometimes the Auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.

The &quot;contra-auguste&quot; plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the Auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the Auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the Auguste when he is doing something wrong.
There are two major types of clowns with whiteface makeup:
The classic &quot;white clown&quot; is derived from the Pierrot character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque &quot;Auguste&quot; types. Francesco Caroli and Glenn &quot;Frosty&quot; Little are examples of this type. The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the &quot;Bozo&quot; type, known as &quot;Comedy&quot; or &quot;Grotesque Whiteface&quot;. This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. 
In the comedic partnership of Abbott and Costello, Bud Abbott would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.

Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses &quot;clown white&quot; makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible. In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.

Whiteface makeup was originally designed by Joseph Grimaldi in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi&#x27;s design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi&#x27;s biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.

America&#x27;s first great whiteface clown was stage star George &quot;G.L.&quot; Fox. Inspired by Grimaldi, Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the U.S. in the 1860s.

=== In horror ===
The scary clown, also known as the evil clown or killer clown, is a subversion of the traditional comic clown character, in which the playful trope is instead depicted in a more disturbing nature through the use of horror elements and dark humor. The character can be seen as playing on the sense of unease felt by those with coulrophobia, the fear of clowns. The modern archetype of the evil clown was popularized by DC Comics character the Joker starting in 1940 and again by Pennywise in Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;It&quot;, which introduced the fear of an evil clown to a modern audience. In the novel, the eponymous character is a pan-dimensional monster which feeds mainly on children by luring them in the form of a clown, named &quot;Pennywise&quot;, and then assuming the shape of whatever the victim fears the most.

=== Character ===
The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or hobo. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps Otto Griebling and Emmett Kelly. Red Skelton, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Rowan Atkinson and Sacha Baron Cohen would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the &quot;hobo&quot;, &quot;tramp&quot; or &quot;bum&quot; clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is attitude. According to American circus expert Hovey Burgess, they are:
* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive attitude.
* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his luck and depressed about his situation.
* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.

== Organizations ==
The World Clown Association is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.

Clowns of America International is a Minnesota-based non-profit clown arts membership organization which aims &quot;to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns&quot;.

Clowns International is a British clowning organisation dating back to the 1940s. It is responsible for the Clown Egg Register.

== Terminology ==

=== Roles and skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as tightrope, juggling, unicycling, Master of Ceremonies, or ride an animal. Clowns may also &quot;sit in&quot; with the orchestra. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.

=== Frameworks ===
Frameworks are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act. Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown&#x27;s creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

Shows are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of &quot;entrées, side dishes, clown stops, track gags, gags&quot; and &quot;bits&quot;.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
* Business – the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown&#x27;s character.
* Gag – very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a &quot;bit&quot; or &quot;routine&quot;, may become a &quot;running gag&quot;. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end – or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.
* Bit – the clown&#x27;s sketch or routine, made up of one or more gags either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material

=== Menu ===
* Entrée — clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a &quot;blow-off&quot; — the comedic ending of a show segment, bit, gag, stunt, or routine.
* Side dish — shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the &quot;entrée,&quot; typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a &quot;blow-off.&quot;

=== Interludes ===
&quot;Clown Stops&quot; or &quot;interludes&quot; are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few &quot;gags&quot; or several &quot;bits&quot;. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called &quot;reprises&quot; or &quot;run-ins&quot; by many, and in today&#x27;s circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of &quot;business&quot; usually parodying the preceding act. If for instance there had been a tightrope walker the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the &quot;artiste&quot; by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the &quot;too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car&quot; stunt; doing just about anything with a rubber chicken, tripping over one&#x27;s own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or clown bicycles. Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.

<text>Coffea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. &quot;Coffea&quot; species are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and southern Africa and tropical Asia. The seeds of some species, called coffee beans, are used to flavor various beverages and products. The fruits, like the seeds, contain a large amount of caffeine, and have a distinct sweet taste.

The plant ranks as one of the world&#x27;s most valuable and widely traded commodity crops and is an important export product of several countries, including those in Central and South America, the Caribbean and Africa. The coffee trade relies heavily on two of the over 120 species, &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; (commonly known simply as &quot;Arabica&quot;), which accounts for 60–80% of the world&#x27;s coffee production, and &quot;Coffea canephora&quot; (known as &quot;Robusta&quot;), which accounts for about 20–40%. 

Both coffee species are vulnerable to shifts, caused by climate change, in their growing zones, which are likely to result in a decline in production in some of the most important growing regions.

== Cultivation and use ==

There are over 130 species of &quot;Coffea&quot;, which is grown from seed. The two most popular are &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; (commonly known simply as &quot;Arabica&quot;), which accounts for 60–80% of the world&#x27;s coffee production, and &quot;Coffea canephora&quot; (known as &quot;Robusta&quot;), which accounts for about 20–40%. &quot;C. arabica&quot; is preferred for its sweeter taste, while &quot;C. canephora&quot; has a higher caffeine content. &quot;C. arabica&quot; has its origins in the highlands of Ethiopia and the Boma Plateau of Sudan, and came about as the result of a hybrid between &quot;C. canephora&quot; and &quot;C. eugenioides&quot;.

The trees produce edible red or purple fruits that are either epigynous berries or indehiscent drupes. The fruit is often referred to as a &quot;coffee cherry&quot;, and it contains two seeds, called &quot;coffee beans&quot;. Despite these terms, coffee is neither a true cherry (the fruit of certain species in the genus &quot;Prunus&quot;) nor a true bean (seeds from plants in the family &quot;Fabaceae&quot;).

In any coffee crop, about 5–10% of fruits contain only a single bean. Called a peaberry, it is smaller and rounder than a normal coffee bean.

When grown in the tropics, coffee is a vigorous bush or small tree that usually grows to a height of . Most commonly cultivated coffee species grow best at high elevations, but do not tolerate freezing temperatures.

The &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; tree grows fruit after three to five years, producing for an average of 50 to 60 years, though up to 100 years is possible. The white flowers are highly scented. The fruit takes about nine months to ripen.



== Ecology ==
The caffeine in coffee beans serves as a toxic substance that protects against insects and other pests, a form of natural plant defense against herbivory. Caffeine simultaneously attracts pollinators, specifically honeybees, by creating an olfactory memory that signals bees to return to the plant&#x27;s flowers. Not all &quot;Coffea&quot; species contain caffeine, and the earliest species had little or no caffeine content. Caffeine has evolved independently in multiple lineages of &quot;Coffea&quot; in Africa, perhaps in response to high pest predation in the humid environments of West-Central Africa. 

Caffeine has also evolved independently in the more distantly related genera &quot;Theobroma&quot; (cacao) and &quot;Camellia&quot; (tea). This suggests that caffeine production is an adaptive trait in coffee and plant evolution. The fruit and leaves also contain caffeine, and can be used to make coffee cherry tea and coffee-leaf tea. The fruit is also used in many brands of soft drink as well as pre-packaged teas.

Several insect pests affect coffee production, including the coffee borer beetle (&quot;Hypothenemus hampei&quot;) and the coffee leafminer (&quot;Leucoptera caffeina&quot;).

Coffee is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, &quot;Dalcera abrasa&quot;, turnip moth and some members of the genus &quot;Endoclita&quot;, including &quot;E. damor&quot; and &quot;E. malabaricus&quot;.

== Research ==
New species of &quot;Coffea&quot; are still being identified in the 2000s. In 2008 and 2009, researchers from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, named seven from the mountains of northern Madagascar, including &quot;C. ambongensis&quot;, &quot;C. boinensis&quot;, &quot;C. labatii&quot;, &quot;C. pterocarpa&quot;, &quot;C. bissetiae&quot;, and &quot;C. namorokensis&quot;.

In 2008, two new species were discovered in Cameroon: &quot;Coffea charrieriana&quot;, which is caffeine-free, and &quot;Coffea anthonyi&quot;. By crossing the new species with other known coffees, two new features might be introduced to cultivated coffee plants: beans without caffeine and self-pollination.

In 2011, &quot;Coffea&quot; absorbed the twenty species of the former genus &quot;Psilanthus&quot; due to the morphological and genetic similarities between the two genera. Historically, the two have been considered distinct genera due to differences in the length of the corolla tube and the anther arrangement: &quot;Coffea&quot; with a short corolla tube and exserted style and anthers; &quot;Psilanthus&quot; with a long corolla tube and included anthers. However, these characteristics were not present in all species of either respective genus, making the two genera overwhelmingly similar in both morphology and genetic sequence. This transfer expanded &quot;Coffea&quot; from 104 species to 124, and extended its native distribution to tropical Asia and Australasia.

The coffee genome was published in 2014, with more than 25,000 genes identified. This revealed that coffee plants make caffeine using a different set of genes from those found in tea, cacao and other such plants.

A robust and almost fully resolved phylogeny of the entire genus was published in 2017. In addition to resolving the relationships of &quot;Coffea&quot; species, this study&#x27;s results suggest Africa or Asia as the likely ancestral origin of Coffea and point to several independent radiations across Africa, Asia, and the Western Indian Ocean Islands.

In 2020, a technique of DNA fingerprinting, or genetic authentication of plant material, was proven effective for coffee. For the study, scientists used DNA extraction and SSR marker analysis. This technique or similar ones may allow for several improvements to coffee production such as improved information for farmers as to the susceptibility of their coffee plants to pests and disease, a professionalized coffee seed system, and transparency and traceability for buyers of green, un-roasted coffee.

<text>Cycling, also known as bicycling or biking, is the activity of riding a bicycle or other types of pedal-driven human-powered vehicles such as balance bikes, unicycles, tricycles, and quadricycles. Cycling is practised around the world for purposes including transport, recreation, exercise, and competitive sport.

==History==
Cycling became popularized in Europe and North America in the latter part and especially the last decade of the 19th century. Today, over 50 percent of the human population knows how to ride a bike.

===War===
The bicycle has been used as a method of reconnaissance as well as transporting soldiers and supplies to combat zones. In this it has taken over many of the functions of horses in warfare. In the Second Boer War, both sides used bicycles for scouting. In World War I, France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand used bicycles to move troops. In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops, and similar forces were instrumental in Japan&#x27;s march or &quot;roll&quot; through Malaya in World War II. Germany used bicycles again in World War II, while the British employed airborne &quot;Cycle-commandos&quot; with folding bikes.

In the Vietnam War, communist forces used bicycles extensively as cargo carriers along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

The last country known to maintain a regiment of bicycle troops was Switzerland, which disbanded its last unit in 2003.

==Equipment==


In many countries, the most commonly used vehicle for road transport is a utility bicycle. These have frames with relaxed geometry, protecting the rider from shocks of the road and easing steering at low speeds. Utility bicycles tend to be equipped with accessories such as mudguards, pannier racks and lights, which extend their usefulness on a daily basis. Since the bicycle is so effective as a means of transportation, various companies have developed methods of carrying anything from the weekly shop to children on bicycles. Certain countries rely heavily on bicycles and their culture has developed around the bicycle as a primary form of transport. In Europe, Denmark and the Netherlands have the most bicycles per capita and most often use bicycles for everyday transport.

Road bikes tend to have a more upright shape and a shorter wheelbase, which make the bike more mobile but harder to ride slowly. The design, coupled with low or dropped handlebars, requires the rider to bend forward more, making use of stronger muscles (particularly the gluteus maximus) and reducing air resistance at high speed.

Road bikes are designed for speed and efficiency on paved roads. They are characterized by their lightweight frames, skinny tires, drop handlebars, and narrow saddles. Road bikes are ideal for racing, long-distance riding, and fitness training.

Other common types of bikes include gravel bikes, designed for use on gravel roads or trails, but with the ability to ride well on pavement; mountain bikes, which are designed for more rugged, undulating terrain; and e-bikes, which provide some level of motorized assist for the rider. There are additional variations of bikes and types of biking as well.

The price of a new bicycle can range from US$50 to more than US$20,000 (the highest priced bike in the world is the custom Madone by Damien Hirst, sold at US$500,000), depending on quality, type and weight (the most exotic road bicycles can weigh as little as 3.2 kg (7 lb)). However, UCI regulations stipulate a legal race bike cannot weigh less than 6.8 kg (14.99 lbs). Being measured for a bike and taking it for a test ride are recommended before buying.

The drivetrain components of the bike should also be considered. A middle grade dérailleur is sufficient for a beginner, although many utility bikes are equipped with hub gears. If the rider plans a significant amount of hillclimbing, a triple-chainrings crankset gear system may be preferred. Otherwise, the relatively lighter, simpler, and less expensive double chainring is preferred, even on high-end race bikes. Much simpler fixed wheel bikes are also available.

Many road bikes, along with mountain bikes, include clipless pedals to which special shoes attach, via a cleat, enabling the rider to pull on the pedals as well as push. Other possible accessories for the bicycle include front and rear lights, bells or horns, child carrying seats, cycling computers with GPS, locks, bar tape, fenders (mud-guards), baggage racks, baggage carriers and pannier bags, water bottles and bottle cages.

For basic maintenance and repairs cyclists can carry a pump (or a CO2 cartridge), a puncture repair kit, a spare inner tube, and tire levers and a set of allen keys. Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special shoes, gloves, and shorts. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes and high-visibility clothing is advisable to reduce the risk from motor vehicle users.

Items legally required in some jurisdictions, or voluntarily adopted for safety reasons, include bicycle helmets, generator or battery operated lights, reflectors, and audible signalling devices such as a bell or horn. Extras include studded tires and a bicycle computer.

Bikes can also be heavily customized, with different seat designs and handle bars, for example. Gears can also be customized to better suit the rider&#x27;s strength in relation to the terrain.

==Skills==
Many schools and police departments run educational programs to instruct children in bicycle handling skills, especially to introduce them to the rules of the road as they apply to cyclists. In some countries these may be known as bicycle rodeos, or operated as schemes such as Bikeability in the UK. Education for adult cyclists is available from organizations such as the League of American Bicyclists.

Beyond simply riding, another skill is riding efficiently and safely in traffic. One popular approach to riding in motor vehicle traffic is vehicular cycling, occupying road space as car does. Alternately, in countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands, where cycling is popular, cyclists are often segregated into bike lanes at the side of, or more often separate from, main highways and roads. Many primary schools participate in the national road test in which children individually complete a circuit on roads near the school while being observed by testers.

==Infrastructure==


Cyclists, pedestrians and motorists make different demands on road design which may lead to conflicts. Some jurisdictions give priority to motorized traffic, for example setting up one-way street systems, free-right turns, high capacity roundabouts, and slip roads. Others share priority with cyclists so as to encourage more cycling by applying varying combinations of traffic calming measures to limit the impact of motorized transport, and by building bike lanes, bike paths and cycle tracks. The provision of cycling infrastructure varies widely between cities and countries, particularly since cycling for transportation almost entirely occurs in public streets. And, the development of computer vision and street view imagery has provided significant potential to assess infrastructure for cyclists.

In jurisdictions where motor vehicles were given priority, cycling has tended to decline while in jurisdictions where cycling infrastructure was built, cycling rates have remained steady or increased. Occasionally, extreme measures against cycling may occur. In Shanghai, where bicycles were once the dominant mode of transport, bicycle travel on a few city roads was banned temporarily in December 2003.

In areas in which cycling is popular and encouraged, cycle-parking facilities using bicycle stands, lockable mini-garages, and patrolled cycle parks are used to reduce theft. Local governments promote cycling by permitting bicycles to be carried on public transport or by providing external attachment devices on public transport vehicles. Conversely, an absence of secure cycle-parking is a recurring complaint by cyclists from cities with low modal share of cycling.

Extensive cycling infrastructure may be found in some cities. Such dedicated paths in some cities often have to be shared with in-line skaters, scooters, skateboarders, and pedestrians. Dedicated cycling infrastructure is treated differently in the law of every jurisdiction, including the question of liability of users in a collision. There is also some debate about the safety of the various types of separated facilities.

Bicycles are considered a sustainable mode of transport, especially suited for urban use and relatively shorter distances when used for transport (compared to recreation). Case studies and good practices (from European cities and some worldwide examples) that promote and stimulate this kind of functional cycling in cities can be found at Eltis, Europe&#x27;s portal for local transport.

A number of cities, including Paris, London and Barcelona, now have successful bike hire schemes designed to help people cycle in the city. Typically these feature utilitarian city bikes which lock into docking stations, released on payment for set time periods. Costs vary from city to city. In London, initial hire access costs £2 per day. The first 30 minutes of each trip is free, with £2 for each additional 30 minutes until the bicycle is returned.

In the Netherlands, many roads have one or two separate cycleways alongside them, or cycle lanes marked on the road. On roads where adjacent bike paths or cycle tracks exist, the use of these facilities is compulsory, and cycling on the main carriageway is not permitted. Some 35,000 km of cycle-track has been physically segregated from motor traffic, equal to a quarter of the country&#x27;s entire 140,000 km road network. A quarter of all trips in the country are made on bicycles, one quarter of them to work. Even the prime minister goes to work by bicycle, when weather permits. This saves the lives of 6,000 citizens per year, prolongs life expectancy by 6 months, saves the country 20 million dollars per year, and prevents 150 grams of from being emitted per kilometer of cycling.

==Types==

===Utility===

Utility cycling refers both to cycling as a mode of daily commuting transport as well as the use of a bicycle in a commercial activity, mainly to transport goods, mostly accomplished in an urban environment.

The postal services of many countries have long relied on bicycles. The British Royal Mail first started using bicycles in 1880; now bicycle delivery fleets include 37,000 in the UK, 25,700 in Germany, 10,500 in Hungary and 7000 in Sweden. In Australia, Australia Post has also reintroduced bicycle postal deliveries on some routes due to an inability to recruit sufficient licensed riders willing to use their uncomfortable motorbikes. The London Ambulance Service has recently introduced bicycling paramedics, who can often get to the scene of an incident in Central London more quickly than a motorized ambulance.

The use of bicycles by police has been increasing, since they provide greater accessibility to bicycle and pedestrian zones and allow access when roads are congested. In some cases, bicycle officers have been used as a supplement or a replacement for horseback officers.

Bicycles enjoy substantial use as general delivery vehicles in many countries. In the UK and North America, as their first jobs, generations of teenagers have worked at delivering newspapers by bicycle. London has many delivery companies that use bicycles with trailers. Most cities in the West, and many outside it, support a sizeable and visible industry of cycle couriers who deliver documents and small packages. In India, many of Mumbai&#x27;s Dabbawalas use bicycles to deliver home cooked lunches to the city&#x27;s workers. In Bogotá, Colombia the city&#x27;s largest bakery recently replaced most of its delivery trucks with bicycles. Even the car industry uses bicycles. At the huge Mercedes-Benz factory in Sindelfingen, Germany workers use bicycles, color-coded by department, to move around the factory.

===Recreational===

====Bicycle touring====

Bicycles are used for recreation at all ages. Bicycle touring, also known as cyclotourism, involves touring and exploration or sightseeing by bicycle for leisure. Bicycle tourism has been one of the most popular sports for recreational benefit. A brevet or randonnée is an organized long-distance ride.

One popular Dutch pleasure is the enjoyment of relaxed cycling in the countryside of the Netherlands. The land is very flat and full of public bicycle trails and cycle tracks where cyclists are not bothered by cars and other traffic, which makes it ideal for cycling recreation. Many Dutch people subscribe every year to an event called &quot;fietsvierdaagse&quot; — four days of organised cycling through the local environment. Paris–Brest–Paris (PBP), which began in 1891, is the oldest bicycling event still run on a regular basis on the open road, covers over and imposes a 90-hour time limit. Similar if smaller institutions exist in many countries.

A study conducted in Taiwan improved the environmental quality for bicyclist tourists which demonstrated greater health benefits in tourists and even in natives. The number of bicyclists in Taiwan increased from 700,000 in 2008 to 5.1 million in 2017. Thus, this resulted in more and safer bicycle routes to be established. When cycling, cyclists take into account the safety on the road, bicycle lanes, smooth roads, diverse scenery, and ride length. Thus, the environment plays a huge role in people&#x27;s decision factor to use bicycle touring more. This study used many questionnaires and conducted statistical analysis to come up with the conclusion of cyclists&#x27; top 5 factors that they consider before making a decision to bike are: safety, lighting facility, design of lanes, the surrounding landscape, and how clean the environment is. Thus, after improving these 5 factors, they found much more recreational benefits to bicycle tourism.

====Organized rides====
Many cycling clubs hold organized rides in which bicyclists of all levels participate. The typical organized ride starts with a large group of riders, called the mass, bunch or even peloton. This will thin out over the course of the ride. Many riders choose to ride together in groups of the same skill level to take advantage of drafting.

Most organized rides, for example cyclosportives (or gran fondos), Challenge Rides or reliability trials, and hill climbs include registration requirements and will provide information either through the mail or online concerning start times and other requirements. Rides usually consist of several different routes, sorted by mileage, and with a certain number of rest stops that usually include refreshments, first aid and maintenance tools. Routes can vary by as much as .
Some organized rides are entirely social events. One example is the monthly San Jose Bike Party which can reach attendance of one to two thousand riders in Summer months.

====Mountain====
Mountain biking began in the 1970s, originally as a downhill sport, practised on customized cruiser bicycles around Mount Tamalpais. Most mountain biking takes place on dirt roads, trails and in purpose-built parks. Downhill mountain biking has just evolved in the recent years and is performed at places such as Whistler Mountain Bike Park. Slopestyle, a form of downhill, is when riders do tricks such as tailwhips, 360s, backflips and front flips.
There are several disciplines of mountain biking besides downhill, including: cross country (often referred to as XC), all mountain, trail, free ride, and newly popular enduro.

In 2020, due to COVID-19, mountain bikes saw a surge in popularity in the US, with some vendors reporting that they were sold out of bikes under US$1000.

====Other====
The Marching and Cycling Band HHK from Haarlem (the Netherlands) is one of the few marching bands around the world which also performs on bicycles.

===Racing===


Shortly after the introduction of bicycles, competitions developed independently in many parts of the world. Early races involving boneshaker style bicycles were predictably fraught with injuries. Large races became popular during the 1890s &quot;Golden Age of Cycling&quot;, with events across Europe, and in the U.S. and Japan as well. At one point, almost every major city in the US had a velodrome or two for track racing events, however since the middle of the 20th century cycling has become a minority sport in the US whilst in Continental Europe it continues to be a major sport, particularly in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. The most famous of all bicycle races is the Tour de France. This began in 1903, and continues to capture the attention of the sporting world.

In 1899, Charles Minthorn Murphy became the first man to ride his bicycle a mile in under a minute (hence his nickname, Mile-a-Minute Murphy), which he did by drafting a locomotive at New York&#x27;s Long Island.

As the bicycle evolved its various forms, different racing formats developed. Road races may involve both team and individual competition, and are contested in various ways. They range from the one-day road race, criterium, and time trial to multi-stage events like the Tour de France and its sister events which make up cycling&#x27;s Grand Tours. Recumbent bicycles were banned from bike races in 1934 after Marcel Berthet set a new hour record in his &quot;Velodyne streamliner&quot; (49.992 km on 18 November 1933). Track bicycles are used for track cycling in Velodromes, while cyclo-cross races are held on outdoor terrain, including pavement, grass, and mud. Cyclocross races feature human-made features such as small barriers which riders either bunny hop over or dismount and walk over. Time trial races, another form of road racing require a rider to ride against the clock. Time trials can be performed as a team or as a single rider. Bikes are changed for time trial races, using aero bars. In the past decade, mountain bike racing has also reached international popularity and is even an Olympic sport.

Professional racing organizations place limitations on the bicycles that can be used in the races that they sanction. For example, the Union Cycliste Internationale, the governing body of international cycle sport (which sanctions races such as the Tour de France), decided in the late 1990s to create additional rules which prohibit racing bicycles weighing less than 6.8 kilograms (14.96 pounds). The UCI rules also effectively ban some bicycle frame innovations (such as the recumbent bicycle) by requiring a double triangle structure.

==Activism==

Many broad and correlated themes run in bicycle activism: one is about advocating the bicycle as an alternative mode of transport, and another is about the creation of conditions to permit and/or encourage bicycle use, both for utility and recreational cycling. Although the first emphasizes the potential for energy and resource conservation and health benefits gained from cycling versus automobile use, is relatively undisputed, the second is the subject of much debate.

It is generally agreed that improved local and inter-city rail services and other methods of mass transportation (including greater provision for cycle carriage on such services) create conditions to encourage bicycle use. However, there are different opinions on the role of various types of cycling infrastructure in building bicycle-friendly cities and roads.

Some bicycle activists (including some traffic management advisers) seek the construction of bike paths, cycle tracks and bike lanes for journeys of all lengths and point to their success in promoting safety and encouraging more people to cycle. Some activists, especially those from the vehicular cycling tradition, view the safety, practicality, and intent of such facilities with suspicion. They favor a more holistic approach based on the 4 &#x27;E&#x27;s: &quot;education&quot; (of everyone involved), &quot;encouragement&quot; (to apply the education), &quot;enforcement&quot; (to protect the rights of others), and &quot;engineering&quot; (to facilitate travel while respecting every person&#x27;s equal right to do so). Some groups offer training courses to help cyclists integrate themselves with other traffic.

Critical Mass is an event typically held on the last Friday of every month in cities around the world where bicyclists take to the streets &quot;en masse&quot;. While the ride was founded with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists, the leaderless structure of Critical Mass makes it impossible to assign it any one specific goal. In fact, the purpose of Critical Mass is not formalized beyond the direct action of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city streets.

There is a long-running cycle helmet debate among activists. The most heated controversy surrounds the topic of compulsory helmet use.

It is paradoxical that in many developing countries cycling is in decline as bicycles are replaced by motorbikes and cars, while in many developed countries cycling is on the rise.

=== Equality ===
Within western societies the demographic of those who cycle is often not representative of broader society. Research by TfL in London, UK, suggests that cyclists in London are typically &#x27;white, under 40, male, with medium to high household income.&#x27; Studies from large-scale representative data from Germany show that people with higher levels of education cycle substantially more often than those with lower levels of education. Even for trips of the same distance and among people from the same city with the same income level, those with higher education cycle more. As a result, there are various forms of activism focused on diversifying the cycling community. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement are organizations such as Street Riders NYC that seek to protest while on bicycles about systemic racism and police brutality. An incidental experience for Street Riders NYC protest participants is the inequity in where safe bicycling infrastructure exists by neighbourhood, which is interpreted as a form of classism within cycling and urbanism. The bicycle has acted as a means for women&#x27;s liberation and thus has links to feminism.

==Associations==
Cyclists form associations, both for specific interests (trails development, road maintenance, bike maintenance, urban design, racing clubs, touring clubs, etc.) and for more global goals (energy conservation, pollution reduction, promotion of fitness). Some bicycle clubs and national associations became prominent advocates for improvements to roads and highways. In the United States, the League of American Wheelmen lobbied for the improvement of roads in the last part of the 19th century, founding and leading the national Good Roads Movement. Their model for political organization, as well as the paved roads for which they argued, facilitated the growth of the automobile.

In Europe, the European Cyclists&#x27; Federation represents around 70 local, regional and national civil society organisations across more than 40 countries that work to promote cycling as a mode of transport and leisure.

As a sport, cycling is governed internationally by the Union Cycliste Internationale in Switzerland, USA Cycling (merged with the United States Cycling Federation in 1995) in the United States, (for upright bicycles) and by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association (for other HPVs, or human-powered vehicles). Cycling for transport and touring is promoted on a European level by the European Cyclists&#x27; Federation, with associated members from Great Britain, Japan and elsewhere. Regular conferences on cycling as transport are held under the auspices of Velo City; global conferences are coordinated by Velo Mondial.

==Cycling as a means of transportation==
Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances.

Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air and noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and greatly reduced traffic congestion. These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.

Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadricycles) for the rider to have certain level of basic skill to remain upright, the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles, often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances.

==Health effects==

Cycling provides a variety of health benefits and reduces the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles. Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip surgery. Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress and better vitality.

The health benefits of cycling outweigh the risks, when cycling is compared to a sedentary lifestyle. A Dutch study found that cycling can extend lifespans by up to 14 months, but the risks equated to a reduced lifespan of 40 days or less. Mortality rate reduction was found to be directly correlated to the average time spent cycling, totaling to approximately 6500 deaths prevented by cycling. Cycling in the Netherlands is often safer than in other parts of the world, so the risk-benefit ratio will be different in other regions. Overall, benefits of cycling or walking have been shown to exceed risks by ratios of 9:1 to 96:1 when compared with no exercise at all, including a wide variety of physical and mental outcomes.

===Exercise===

The physical exercise gained from cycling is generally linked with increased health and well-being. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), physical inactivity is second only to tobacco smoking as a health risk in developed countries, and is associated with 20-30% increased risk of various cancers, heart disease, and diabetes and tens of billions of dollars of healthcare costs. The WHO&#x27;s 2009 report suggests that increasing physical activity is a public health &quot;best buy&quot;, and that cycling is a &quot;highly suitable activity&quot; for this purpose. The charity Sustrans reports that investment in cycling provision can give a 20:1 return from health and other benefits. It has been estimated that, on average, approximately 20 life-years are gained from the health benefits of road bicycling for every life-year lost through injury.

Bicycles are often used by people seeking to improve their fitness and cardiovascular health. Recent studies on the use of cycling for commutes have shown that it reduces the risk of cardiovascular outcomes by 11%, with slightly more risk reduction in women than in men. In addition, cycling is especially helpful for those with arthritis of the lower limbs who are unable to pursue sports that cause impact to the knees and other joints. Since cycling can be used for the practical purpose of transportation, there can be less need for self-discipline to exercise.

Cycling while seated is a relatively non-weight bearing exercise that, like swimming, does little to promote bone density. Cycling up and out of the saddle, on the other hand, does a better job by transferring more of the rider&#x27;s body weight to the legs. However, excessive cycling while standing can cause knee damage It used to be thought that cycling while standing was less energy efficient, but recent research has proven this not to be true. Other than air resistance, there is no wasted energy from cycling while standing, if it is done correctly.

Cycling on a stationary cycle is frequently advocated as a suitable exercise for rehabilitation, particularly for lower limb injury, owing to the low impact which it has on the joints. In particular, cycling is commonly used within knee rehabilitation programs, to strengthen the quadriceps muscles with minimal stress on the knee ligaments. Further stress of the knee can be relieved by changing seat heights and pedal position to improve the rehabilitation. Cycling is also used for rehabilitation after hip surgery to manage soft-tissue healing, control swelling and pain, and allow a larger range of motion to the nearby muscles earlier during recovery. As a result, many institutions have established a rehabilitation protocol that involves stationary cycling as part of the recovery process. One such protocol offered by Mayo Clinic recommends 2–4 weeks of cycling on an upright stationary bike following hip arthroscopy, starting from 5 minutes per session and slowly increasing to 30 minutes per session. The goal of these sessions are to reduce joint inflammation and maintain the widest range of motion possible with limited pain. 
As a response to the increased global sedentary lifestyles and consequent overweight and obesity, one response that has been adopted by many organizations concerned with health and environment is the promotion of Active travel, which seeks to promote walking and cycling as safe and attractive alternatives to motorized transport. Given that many journeys are for relatively short distances, there is considerable scope to replace car use with walking or cycling, though in many settings this may require some infrastructure modification, particularly to attract the less experienced and confident.

An Italian study assessed the impact of cycling for commute on major non-communicable diseases and public healthcare costs. Using a health economic assessment model, the study found a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke in individuals that cycled compared to those that did not actively commute. This model estimated that public healthcare costs would reduce by 5% over a 10-year period.

Illinois designated cycling as its official state exercise in 2007.

=== Mental health ===
The effects of cycling on overall mental health have often been studied. A European study surveying participants from seven cities about self-perceived health based on primary modes of transportation reported favorable results in the bicycle use population. The bicycle use group reported predominantly good self-perceived health, less perceived stress, better mental health, better vitality, and less loneliness. The study attributed these results to possible economic benefits and senses of both independence and identity as a member of a cyclist community. An English study recruiting non-cyclist older adults aged 50 to 83 to participate as either conventional pedal bike cyclists, electrically assisted e-bike cyclists, or a non-cyclist control group in outdoor trails measured cognitive function through executive function, spatial reasoning, and memory tests and well-being through questionnaires. The study did not find significant differences in spatial reasoning or memory tests. It did, however, find that both cyclists groups had improved executive function and well-being, both with greater improvement in the e-bike group. This suggested that non-physical factors of cycling such as independence, engagement with the outdoor environment, and mobility play a greater role in improving mental health.

A 15-month randomized controlled trial in the U.S. examined the impact of self-paced cycling on cognitive function in institutionalized older adults without cognitive impairment. Researchers used three cognitive assessments: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Fuld object memory evaluation, and symbol digit modality test. The study found that long-term cycling for at least 15 minutes per day in older adults without cognitive impairment had a protective effect on cognition and attention.

Cycling has also been shown to be effective adjunct therapy in certain mental health conditions.

==Bicycle safety==

Cycling suffers from a perception that it is unsafe. This perception is not always backed by hard numbers, because of under reporting of crashes and lack of bicycle use data (amount of cycling, kilometers cycled) which make it hard to assess the risk and monitor changes in risks.
In the UK, fatality rates per mile or kilometre are slightly less than those for walking. In the US, bicycling fatality rates are less than 2/3 of those walking the same distance. However, in the UK for example the fatality and serious injury rates &quot;per hour of travel&quot; are just over double for cycling than those for walking.

Despite the risk factors associated with bicycling, cyclists have a lower overall mortality rate when compared to other groups. A Danish study in 2000 found that even after adjustment for other risk factors, including leisure time physical activity, those who did not cycle to work experienced a 39% higher mortality rate than those who did.

Injuries (to cyclists, from cycling) can be divided into two types:
* Physical trauma (extrinsic)
* Overuse (intrinsic)

===Physical trauma===
Acute physical trauma includes injuries to the head and extremities resulting from falls and collisions. Most cycle deaths result from a collision with a car or heavy goods vehicle. Drivers are at fault in the majority of these crashes. Segregated cycling infrastructure reduces the rate of crashes between bicycles and motor vehicles.

Although a majority of bicycle collisions occur during the day, bicycle lighting is recommended for safety when bicycling at night to increase visibility.


===Overuse injuries===
Of a study of 518 cyclists, a large majority reported at least one overuse injury, with over one third requiring medical treatment. The most common injury sites were the neck (48.8%) and the knees (41.7%), as well as the groin/buttocks (36.1%), hands (31.1%), and back (30.3%). Women were more likely to suffer from neck and shoulder pain than men.

Many cyclists suffer from overuse injuries to the knees, affecting cyclists at all levels. These are caused by many factors:
*Incorrect bicycle fit or adjustment, particularly the saddle.
*Incorrect adjustment of clipless pedals.
*Too many hills, or too many miles, too early in the training season.
*Poor training preparation for long touring rides.
*Selecting too high a gear. A lower gear for uphill climb protects the knees, even though muscles may be well able to handle a higher gear.

Overuse injuries, including chronic nerve damage at weight bearing locations, can occur as a result of repeatedly riding a bicycle for extended periods of time. Damage to the ulnar nerve in the palm, carpal tunnel in the wrist, the genitourinary tract or bicycle seat neuropathy may result from overuse. Recumbent bicycles are designed on different ergonomic principles and eliminate pressure from the saddle and handlebars, due to the relaxed riding position.

Note that overuse is a relative term, and capacity varies greatly between individuals. Someone starting out in cycling must be careful to increase length and frequency of cycling sessions slowly, starting for example at an hour or two per day, or a hundred miles or kilometers per week. Bilateral muscular pain is a normal by-product of the training process, whereas unilateral pain may reveal &quot;exercise-induced arterial endofibrosis&quot;. Joint pain and numbness are also early signs of overuse injury.

A Spanish study of top triathletes found those who cover more than 186 miles (300 km) a week on their bikes have less than 4% normal looking sperm, where normal adult males would be expected to have from 15% to 20%.

===Saddle related===
Much work has been done to investigate optimal bicycle saddle shape, size and position, and negative effects of extended use of less than optimal seats or configurations.

Excessive saddle height can cause posterior knee pain, while setting the saddle too low can cause pain in the anterior of the knee. An incorrectly fitted saddle may eventually lead to muscle imbalance. A 25 to 35-degree knee angle is recommended to avoid an overuse injury.

Although cycling is beneficial to health, men can be negatively affected by cycling more than three hours a week due to the significant weight on their perineum, an area located between the scrotum and the anus which hold some of the nerves and arteries that pass to the penis. This weight for continuous hours a week can cause men to experience numbness or tingling which can lead to them losing the ability to achieve an erection due to reduced blood flow; which 13% of males did experience in a study by Norwegian researchers who gathered data from 160 men participating in a long-distance bike tour. Fitting a proper sized seat can prevent this effect. In extreme cases, pudendal nerve entrapment can be a source of intractable perineal pain. Some cyclists with induced pudendal nerve pressure neuropathy gained relief from improvements in saddle position and riding techniques.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has investigated the potential health effects of prolonged bicycling in police bicycle patrol units, including the possibility that some bicycle saddles exert excessive pressure on the urogenital area of cyclists, restricting blood flow to the genitals. Their study found that using bicycle seats without protruding noses reduced pressure on the groin by at least 65% and significantly reduced the number of cases of urogenital paresthesia. A follow-up found that 90% of bicycle officers who tried the no-nose seat were using it six months later. NIOSH recommends that riders use a no-nose bicycle seat for workplace bicycling.

Despite rumors to the contrary, there is no scientific evidence linking cycling with testicular cancer.

===Exposure to air pollution===
One concern is that riding in traffic may expose the cyclist to higher levels of air pollution, especially cyclists regularly traveling on or along busy roads. Some authors have claimed this to be untrue, showing that the pollutant and irritant count within cars is consistently higher, presumably because of limited circulation of air within the car and due to the air intake being directly in the stream of other traffic. Other authors have found small or inconsistent differences in concentrations but claim that exposure of cyclists is higher due to increased minute ventilation and is associated with minor biological changes. A 2010 study estimated that the gained life expectancy from the health benefits of cycling (approximately 3–14 months gained) greatly exceeded the lost life expectancy from air pollution (approximately 0.8–40 days lost). However, a systematic review comparing the effects of air pollution exposure on the health of cyclists was conducted, but the authors concluded that the differing methodologies and measuring parameters of each study made it difficult to compare results and suggested a more holistic approach was needed to accomplish this. The significance of the associated health effect, if any, is unclear but probably much smaller than the health impacts associated with accidents and the health benefits derived from additional physical activity.
