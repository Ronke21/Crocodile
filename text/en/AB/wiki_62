The manga spawned a media franchise. Three anime TV series have been adapted in 1973, 1979, and 2005.

The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America, via Amazon Kindle, by a collaboration of Fujiko F. Fujio Pro with Voyager Japan and AltJapan Co., Ltd. The anime series was licensed by Disney for an English-language release in North America in 2014, and LUK International in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

&quot;Doraemon&quot; was well received by critics and became a hit in many Asian countries. It won numerous awards, including the Japan Cartoonists Association Award in 1973 and 1994, the Shogakukan Manga Award for children&#x27;s manga in 1982, and the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 1997. As of 2024, it has sold over 300 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling manga series of all time. The character of Doraemon has been viewed as a Japanese cultural icon, and was appointed as the first &quot;anime ambassador&quot; in 2008 by the country&#x27;s Foreign Ministry.

== Synopsis ==

Nobita Nobi is a ten-year-old Japanese school boy, who is kind-hearted and honest, but also lazy, unlucky, weak, gets bad grades and is bad at sports. One day, a blue robot cat from the 22nd century named Doraemon is sent back to the past by Nobita&#x27;s future great-great-grandson, Sewashi Nobi, to take care of Nobita so that his descendants can have a better life. Doraemon has a four-dimensional pocket in which he stores tools, inventions, and gadgets from the future to aid Nobita whenever he is faced with a problem. Although Doraemon is a cat robot, he has a fear of mice because of an incident where robotic mice chewed off his ears. This is why Doraemon lost his original yellow color and turned blue, from sadness.

Nobita has three main friends: Takeshi Goda (nicknamed Gian), Suneo Honekawa (Gian&#x27;s sidekick), and Shizuka Minamoto, Nobita&#x27;s best friend and love-interest. Gian is a strong, leading and domineering boy, but also loyal to his friends. Suneo is a wealthy and spoiled boy who uses his friendship with Gian to win the respect of other schoolmates. Shizuka is a gentle and kind girl who frequently plays with Nobita. Nobita has a crush on Shizuka; she is his prospective future wife (Nobita&#x27;s future wife is initially Gian&#x27;s younger sister). Although Gian and Suneo are Nobita&#x27;s friends, they also typically bully and abuse him. Nobita normally responds by using Doraemon&#x27;s gadgets to fight back against them, but Nobita has a tendency to get carried away with using the gadgets (or Gian and Suneo, if they steal it away), which typically results in unintended consequences for him and others.

In addition to Gian, Suneo, and Shizuka, Dorami and Hidetoshi Dekisugi are also recurring characters. Dorami is Doraemon&#x27;s younger sister, and Dekisugi is a gifted student boy who as Shizuka&#x27;s close friend, frequently attracts the jealousy of Nobita.

== Creation and conception ==

=== Development and themes ===
&quot;Doraemon&quot; is written and illustrated by Fujiko F. Fujio, the pen name of Japanese manga artist Hiroshi Fujimoto. According to Fujio, it was originally conceived following a series of three events: when searching for ideas for a new manga, he wished a machine existed that would come up with ideas for him, he tripped over his daughter&#x27;s toy, and heard cats fighting in his neighborhood. To set up the plot and characters, he used some elements from his earlier manga series, &quot;Obake no Q-Tarō&quot;, which involve an living with humans, with a similar formula. Fujio said that the idea for &quot;Doraemon&quot; came after &quot;an accumulation of trial and error&quot;, during which he finally found the most suitable style of manga to him. Initially, the series achieved little success as was well known at the time, and only became a hit after its adaptation into an anime TV series and multiple feature films.

&quot;Doraemon&quot; is mainly aimed at children, so Fujio chose to create the character with a simple graphic style, based on shapes such as circles and ellipses. He used the same sequences of cartoons with regularity and continuity to enhance the reader&#x27;s ease of understanding. In addition, blue, a characteristic color of Doraemon, was chosen as the main color in magazine publications, which used to have a yellow cover and red title. Set in Tokyo, the manga reflected parts of Japan&#x27;s society, such as the class system and the &quot;ideal&quot; of Japanese childhood. Problems, if occur, were resolved in a way so as not to rely on violence and eroticism, and the stories were integrated with the concept of environmentalism. The manga also insisted on the ethical values of integrity, perseverance, courage, family and respect.

In order to underline the crucial role of the young generation in society, the manga&#x27;s creator chose to have the act carried out in a &quot;children&#x27;s domain&quot; where young people can live with happiness, freedom and power without adult&#x27;s interference. As Saya S. Shiraishi noted, the existence of the &quot;domain&quot; helped &quot;Doraemon&quot; to have a strong appeal in various Asian countries. During &quot;Doraemon&quot;&#x27;s development, Fujio did not express a change in characters; he said, &quot;When a manga hero become a success, the manga suddenly stops being interesting. So the hero has to be like the stripes on a barber pole; he seems to keep moving upward, but actually he stays in the same place.&quot;

According to Zensho Ito, Fujio&#x27;s former student, the &quot;length&quot; of time in the universe is one of the ideas that inspired Fujio to make &quot;Doraemon&quot;. Frequently displayed in its stories is Nobita&#x27;s desire to control time, and there exist time-control gadgets that he uses to satisfy that desire, particularly the &quot;Time Machine&quot;, which lies in his desk drawer. Unlike Western works on science fiction, the manga did not explain the theory nor the applied technology behind these tools, but instead focusing on how the characters exploit their advantages, making it more children-friendly.

=== Origin of the name ===
The name &quot;Doraemon&quot; can be roughly translated to &quot;stray&quot;. Unusually, the name is written in a mixture of two Japanese scripts: Katakana () and Hiragana (). &quot;Dora&quot; derives from , and is a corruption of nora (stray), while &quot;-emon&quot; (in kanji ) is an old-fashioned suffix for male names (for example, as in Ishikawa Goemon). Nobita&#x27;s home address in Tsukimidai (&quot;moon-view-heights&quot;), Nerima refers to Fujimidai (&quot;Fuji-view-heights&quot;), where Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s residence and animation studio is based. The name &quot;Nobita Nobi&quot; refers to &quot;nobi nobi&quot;, meaning &quot;the way a young child grows up free, healthy, and happy, unrestrained in any sense&quot;.

=== Gadgets ===

Gadgets, or , are Doraemon&#x27;s tools from the future, usually used to help the characters. Fujio said that Doraemon has a total of 1,293 gadgets; according to a 2004 analysis by Yasuyuki Yokoyama of Toyama University, there are 1,963 gadgets found in 1,344 sketches. The most important gadgets include &quot;Take-Copter&quot;, a small piece of headgear made out of bamboo that can allow its users to fly; &quot;Time Machine&quot;, a machine used for time travel; &quot;Anywhere Door&quot;, a pink-colored door that allows people to travel according to the thoughts of the person who turns the knob; &quot;Time Kerchief&quot;, a handkerchief which can turn an object new or old or a person young or old; &quot;Translator Tool&quot;, a cuboid jelly that allow one to converse in any language; and &quot;Designer&quot;, a camera used to instantly dress-up the user.

Saya S. Shiraishi wrote that most of the gadgets were &quot;an impressive testimony to the standards of quality control and innovation that exist in the twenty-second century&quot;. The gadgets were an essential part of the series so as to reflect a positive point of view about the association of technology in children, and to express the wishes of modern society.

=== Conclusion ===
The series ceased its original run in 1994 and was not given an ending before Fujimoto&#x27;s death in 1996; this has since aroused numerous urban legends throughout the years. One of the most well-known &quot;endings&quot; of the manga was by an amateur manga cartoonist under the pen name &quot;Yasue T. Tajima&quot;, first appeared on the Internet in 1998 and made up into a manga in 2005. The story takes place when Doraemon&#x27;s battery dies, and Nobita later grows up becoming a robot engineer, potentially revive Doraemon and live a happy life. Tajima issued an apology in 2007, and the profits were shared with Shogakukan and the copyright owner, Fujiko F. Fujio Pro.

Ryūichi Yagi and Takashi Yamazaki, the directors of &quot;Stand by Me Doraemon&quot;, confirmed that it had only one opening, while the ending has been rewritten several times. Because of this, Shogakukan had to clarify that only if the marriage of Nobita and Shizuka is finalized will the mission be accomplished, and then Doraemon will return to the future.

=== Anime ===

The first attempt of a &quot;Doraemon&quot; animated series was in 1973, by Nippon Television. After a January 1973 pilot named &quot;Doraemon Mirai Kara Yattekuru&quot; , twenty-six episodes, each with two segments, were broadcast on Nippon TV from April 1 to September 30 of the same year. The series was directed by Mitsuo Kaminashi with voice cast from Aoni Production; the character Doraemon was voiced by Kōsei Tomita, then later by Masako Nozawa. Later in the series, the animation studio, Nippon TeleMovie Productions, went bankrupt, and the masters were sold off or destroyed. The series was re-aired on Nippon TV and several local stations until 1979, when Shogakukan requested Toyama Television to cease broadcasting. Some of the segments were found in the archives of Imagica in 1995, and some others were recovered by Jun Masami in 2003. As of 2013, 21 of 52 segments are known to survive, two of which have no audio.

&quot;Doraemon&quot; remained fairly exclusive in manga form until 1979 when an animation studio, Shin-Ei Animation (now owned by TV Asahi) produced an animated second attempt of &quot;Doraemon&quot;. The series aired on TV Asahi from April 2, 1979. Ryo Motohira served as chief director from 1981, and Tsutomu Shibayama from 1984. Eiichi Nakamura served as director of character designer, while Shunsuke Kikuchi was the composer. Nobuyo Ōyama voiced Doraemon in the series; because of this, in Asia, this version is sometimes referred to as the Ōyama Edition. In total, 1,787 episodes were produced and released in VHS and DVD by Toho. On April 15, 2005, a major renewal was carried out, including the replacement of voice actors and staff, and updated character designs. The third series is sometimes referred to in Asia as the Mizuta Edition, as a tribute for the voice actress for Doraemon, Wasabi Mizuta. It was released in DVD on February 10, 2006, under the title &quot;New TV-ban Doraemon&quot; with Shogakukan Video banner.

In May 2014, TV Asahi Corporation announced an agreement with The Walt Disney Company to bring the 2005 series to the Disney XD television channel and Disney Channel in the United States beginning in the summer of that year. Besides using the name changes that were used in AltJapan&#x27;s English adaptation of the original manga, other changes and edits have also been made to make the show more relatable to an American audience, such as Japanese text being replaced with English text on certain objects like signs and graded papers, items such as yen notes being replaced by US dollar bills, and the setting being changed from Japan to the United States. Initial response to the edited dub was positive. The Disney adaptation began broadcast in Japan on Disney Channel from February 1, 2016. The broadcast offered the choice of the English voice track or a newly recorded Japanese track by the Japanese cast of the 2005 series.

The anime has also been aired in over sixty countries worldwide. It premiered in Thailand in 1982, the Philippines in 1999, India in 2005, and Vietnam in 2010.

== Reception ==
=== General ===
&quot;Doraemon&quot; is considered one of the best-known manga of all time, a true Japanese cultural icon, and an essential part of family life of the Japanese post-war generation. Akihiro Motoyama observed that &quot;mothers who watched the movies when they were children are now taking their own children to see them&quot;. It was also commercially successful: over books were sold in Japan by 1996. The 1979 and 2005 anime series also achieved high ratings on television. With the film &quot;&quot;, the &quot;Doraemon&quot; anime film series reached 100 million tickets sold at the Japanese box office, surpassing &quot;Godzilla&quot; as the highest-grossing film franchise in Japan. By 2015, it had sold over 103 million tickets, and was the largest franchise by numbers of admissions in the country.

&quot;Doraemon&quot; was also a hit in Asia in general, and was considered one of the typical cases of Japanese soft power, although it was published without a license in some countries. The anime television series is available in over 60 countries, and reportedly getting high ratings in at least 30 countries. However, &quot;Doraemon&quot; was less successful in Western countries, because it was viewed as a children-only series, and there were some tight restrictions about publishing manga and broadcasting anime series there. The manga has sold over copies worldwide by 2012; over 250 million by 2019; and over 300 million by 2024. Estimates show that &quot;Doraemon&quot; has generated at least more than in merchandise sales by 2019, and over $1.7 billion from anime feature films by 2020, making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

Outside Japan, &quot;Doraemon&quot; achieved particular success in Vietnam, with a record-breaking 40 million copies sold by 2006. The manga was first launched there in 1992 by Kim Đồng Publishing House, but the copyright from Shogakukan was not fully acquired until 1996. In 1993, the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture considered the manga&#x27;s publication to be &quot;an impactful event for the improvement of children, youth and adult&#x27;s likings ... [&quot;Doraemon&quot;] is a comprehensively educational book series which has the effect of developing children&#x27;s personality&quot;. Doraemon is now a cultural icon in Vietnam, having featured in many cultural events.

=== Critical response and analysis ===
&quot;Doraemon&quot; received favorable reviews. Mark Schilling wrote, &quot;For kids whose lives are often so regulated, Doraemon represents a welcome breath of freedom and a glimpse of a funnier, friendlier world where all dreams, even foolish ones, can come true.&quot; Italian writer Massimo Nicora wrote that the manga &quot;can be interpreted as a type of book that criticizes, with irony, the omnipotence of science that pretends to solve every problem with its tools&quot;, alluding to the fact that Doraemon&#x27;s gadgets often end up making the problems even worse than they initially were, more than anything else. He added that it represents &quot;the metaphor of the childish imagination, which always manages to find the most bizarre and original solutions, in a continuous game of transformation of reality&quot;.

Some critics considered that Nobita&#x27;s flawed personality and modest background is different from the special or extraordinary characteristics usually seen in other typical anime and manga protagonists; this portrayal has been seen as reasons of its appeal as well as the contrary, especially in the United States. According to the Italian Parents Movement (Moige), in the manga, &quot;the lazy Nobita does not know any kind of appreciable evolution&quot;, though there are still good points including &quot;the criticism of bullying, the goodness that transpires from the little Nobita and the positive figure of Shizuka&quot;.

In his 2000 article, Leo Ching explained that the success of &quot;Doraemon&quot; in Asia was because it had reflected the Asian values such as imagination and responsibility, the same reason that &quot;Oshin&quot;, another Japanese cultural export, became well known there. On the other hand, according to an analysis by Anne Allison, professor of cultural anthropology at Duke University, the strong point of it was not the variety of the gadgets, but the relationship between Doraemon and Nobita, which was particularly appreciated. Jason Thompson praised the &quot;silly situations&quot; and &quot;old fashioned, simple artwork&quot;, with Doraemon&#x27;s expression and comments adding to the &quot;surrounding elementary-school mischief&quot;. On the manga&#x27;s 50th anniversary, an op-ed published on &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; stated that the manga &quot;has already become a contemporary classic&quot;.

=== Awards, accolades and public recognition ===
&quot;Doraemon&quot; has received numerous accolades. It won the Japan Cartoonists Association Award twice in 1973 and 1994, the former for Excellence Award while the latter for Minister of Education, Science and Technology Award. In 1982, it received the first Shogakukan Manga Award for children&#x27;s manga. In 1997, the manga won the Grand Prize at the first Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize. The 1979 series won the award from the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs four times for best television series in 1984, 1985, 1988 and 1989.

A 2006 poll among 80,000 Japanese fans for the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival placed &quot;Doraemon&quot; at fifth among the top ten best manga of all time. The 2005 and 2006 surveys conducted by TV Asahi found the &quot;Doraemon&quot; anime ranked fifth and third, respectively, among the 100 most favorite anime series of all time. In 2010, a survey conducted by researchers of Tokyo Polytechnic University found that most responders considered &quot;Doraemon&quot;, along with &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise, to be the anime series that represents Cool Japan. In a 2013 survey, &quot;Doraemon&quot; was found to be the best anime recommended for foreign people.

=== Criticisms ===
&quot;Doraemon&quot; has been blamed for having a negative impact on children, due to the controversial traits of the characters in the anime. The character has received criticism in China, where some media outlets considered Doraemon to be a politically subversive character and that it was a tool of Japan&#x27;s &quot;cultural invasion&quot;. Some education groups in Taiwan demanded the anime to be banned, as the plot involve bullying which would encourage campus bullying. In 2016, a resolution to ban Hindi dubbed &quot;Doraemon&quot; anime series was submitted in Pakistan. Around the same time, legal notices were served against several companies in India, targeting &quot;Doraemon&quot; and &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot; for bans (which did not materialize), as having an adverse effect on children. Disney Channel India, the regional broadcaster of the anime, was banned in Bangladesh and Pakistan citing non-availability of localized dubs for content including &quot;Doraemon&quot;.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

The &quot;Doraemon&quot; manga has inspired many other mangakas; these include Eiichiro Oda, the creator of &quot;One Piece&quot; with the idea of &quot;Devil Fruits&quot;, and Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of &quot;Naruto&quot;, who showed interest in drawing characters from anime shows during his childhood, including Doraemon. The manga has also been mentioned in &quot;Gin Tama&quot; and &quot;Great Teacher Onizuka&quot;. The character Doraemon is considered one of the cultural icons in Japan, and one of the most well-known characters in manga history; some critics compared his notability with Mickey Mouse and Snoopy. Mark Schilling noted that Doraemon&#x27;s &quot;Take-Copter&quot; is familiar among Japanese people &quot;just as Snoopy&#x27;s biplane is familiar to most Americans&quot;.

On April 22, 2002, on the special issue of &quot;Asian Hero&quot; in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Doraemon was the only anime character to be named one of the twenty-two Asian Heroes, and was described as &quot;The Cuddliest Hero in Asia&quot;. A 2007 poll by Oricon shown that Doraemon was the second-strongest manga character ever, behind only Son Goku of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. Doraemon is also referred as something with the ability to satisfy all wishes.

In 2005, the Taiwan Society of New York selected &quot;Doraemon&quot; as a culturally significant work of Japanese otaku pop-culture in its exhibit &quot;Little Boy: The Arts of Japan&#x27;s Exploding Subculture&quot;, curated by renowned artist Takashi Murakami. In 2008, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Doraemon as the first anime cultural ambassador; a Ministry spokesperson explained the decision as an attempt to help people in other countries understand Japanese anime better and to deepen their interest in Japanese culture. On September 3, 2012, Doraemon was granted official residence in the city of Kawasaki, Kanagawa, one hundred years before he was born. In the same year, Hong Kong celebrated the birthday of Doraemon 100 years early with a series of displays of the character. In April 2013, Doraemon was chosen as Japan&#x27;s ambassador in Tokyo&#x27;s bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics. He appeared in the 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony to promote the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

A Fujiko F. Fujio museum opened in Kawasaki on September 3, 2011, featuring Doraemon as the star of the museum. The National Museum of Singapore held a time-travelling exhibition in October 2020 as a tribute to the manga. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Shogakukan released an earthquake survival guidebook, which included the main cast of the &quot;Doraemon&quot; manga series. TV Asahi launched the &quot;Doraemon Fund&quot; charity fund to raise money for natural disasters in 2004, and in 2011. In 2020, Mumbai&#x27;s Sion Friends Circle group distributed food and books to kids using mascots, one being Doraemon, to help during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Vietnam, a Doraemon scholarship fund was established in 1996, and the Doraemon character has been used for education of traffic safety. &quot;Doraemon&quot;&#x27;s creator, Fujiko F. Fujio, received the Culture Fighter Medal from the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture in 1996 for his contributions to young education through the manga.

Many prominent figures have been nicknamed after the cast of &quot;Doraemon&quot;: politician Osamu Fujimura is known as the &quot;Doraemon of Nagatacho&quot; due to his figure and warm personality, and sumo wrestler Takamisugi was nicknamed &quot;Doraemon&quot; because of his resemblance to the character. In 2015, a group of people in a drought-affected village in northern Thailand used a Doraemon toy to complete a rain-ritual, in order to avoid controversies that would occur by using real animals.

A parody of &quot;Doraemon&quot; created by Hikari Fujisaki, titled &quot;Nozoemon&quot; , was first serialized in Nihon Bungeisha&#x27;s &quot;Comic Heaven&quot; magazine in September 2014, with the compiled book volume released on June 9, 2015; however, it was discontinued in August 2015 due to content issues.

<text>Dartmoor Preservation Association (DPA) is one of the oldest environmental or amenity bodies in the UK. It was founded in 1883. It concerns itself with Dartmoor, a National Park in Devon, south-west England. It began with two main areas of concern. Firstly, commoners&#x27; rights were being eroded through army use, including the firing of live artillery shells, and piecemeal enclosure of land around the margins. Secondly, there was increasing public interest in Dartmoor&#x27;s scenery, archaeology, history and wildlife

The DPA has opposed what it considered to be unsuitable developments on Dartmoor throughout its history. In its founding year, the secretary, Robert Burnard persuaded the War Department not to fire on the Okehampton Firing Range on Saturdays to allow access to the public. Many battles have been fought since, particularly against the military presence and the proposed building of reservoirs on the moor, notably under the Chairmanship of Lady Sayer, granddaughter of Robert Burnard.

The DPA continues to follow the same objectives as when it was founded. For example, in June 2015, it supported the inhabitants of Widecombe-in-the-Moor against the erecting of a telecommunications mast in an area of pristine countryside against the wishes of the local population.

Dartmoor Preservation Association is a registered charity, Number 215665.

==Background==
Dartmoor is said to be one of the last remaining areas of wilderness in Britain, but it has been a managed landscape since the late Neolithic (3,000-2,500 BCE). The Bronze Age inhabitants (from 2,500 to 750 BCE) cleared ancient forest and developed farming. They made extensive use of surface in the construction of roundhouses (their remains now seen as &quot;hut circles&quot;), enclosures, land-dividing reaves, stone rows, stone circles, menhirs and kistvaens.

Farming has continued through the medieval period to the present day, but a more disruptive activity to the landscape was the appearance of tin-mining, firstly by stream-working, then by lode-working and finally by underground mining. Many valleys have been dug over and scarred, leaving a rich industrial archaeology. Other activities such as newtake wall building, peat cutting, rabbit warrening, quarrying, clay extraction and the building of a prominent prison have all left marks on the moor. Recent undertakings have left more obvious changes: the building of reservoirs and the planting of conifer forests.

==History of the association==
The use of moorstone continued up to recent times with the extensive building of dry stone walls around farm newtakes. Later, stone was cut and dressed. The use of moorstone continued to such an extent that in 1847 boundary markers were cut around Pew Tor to protect it. Marker stones were erected around Roos Tor. The taking of stone started to change the Dartmoor landscape: for example Eric Hemery (writing in 1983) stated that Swell Tor had been &quot;decapitated and disembowelled by the quarrymen&quot;.

In August 1881, a public meeting was convened by the Portreeve of Tavistock in the Guildhall to discuss the continued taking of stone, particularly from landmark tors. The DPA was founded in 1883. The protected area around Pew Tor was extended in December 1896. In 1901, the DPA commissioned a report into damage to ancient monuments, caused by the taking of stone for building and road-mending, and into unlawful enclosures of common land.

===Commoners&#x27; rights===
The first publication of the DPA, in 1890, was a short history of commoners&#x27; rights on Dartmoor and the commons of Devon. This notes a decrease in the numbers of animals even in medieval times: in 1296 – 5,000 cattle, 487 horses, 131 folds of sheep; in 1316 – 3,292 cattle, 368 horses, 100 folds of sheep. &quot;An important battle occurred in 1894 when the Corporation of London attempted to buy the whole of Dartmoor in order to pipe its water to Paddington alongside Brunel’s recently converted railway, when it went from broad gauge to standard gauge. The DPA led the revolt against this&quot;. In 1897, the DPA went to court to fight successfully the enclosure of a section of Peter Tavy Great Common, in support of a farmer. Commoners rights seem to have been a settled issue in recent years: except for where they are impinged upon by the military presence.

===Military use===
Dartmoor Training Area has been used regularly for military training since 1873, although it was used earlier during the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars. In 1906–07, seven miles of roads were built on the north moor to facilitate the movement of guns. There are three established firing ranges at Okehampton, Willsworthy and Merrivale. The area taken up with live firing ranges is and they are used on average 120 days each year. They are used for small arms, mortars and artillery smoke and illuminating shells.

The use of the moor by the military has been a major concern of the DPA since its founding. In its first year, Robert Burnard (DPA Secretary) persuaded the War Department not to fire on the Okehampton Firing Range on Saturdays so that there may be some public access to the area. Lady Sylvia Sayer was very outspoken about it being totally at odds with the area being designated as a National Park. In 1963 the DPA published a widely circulated 24-page booklet entitled &quot;Misuse of a National Park&quot; which includes photographs of unexploded shells lying on the open moor, corrugated iron buildings, large craters, a derelict tank used as a target, bullet marks on standing stones, etc. It also contains details of a 1958 incident in which a young boy was killed by a mortar shell near Cranmere Pool.

Since the 1960s there has been much less military damage and litter as a result of the DPA persuading the Services to be more cautious. The military have changed since the Victorian era, they now have 120 conservation groups across the Ministry of Defence (MOD), including Dartmoor Military Conservation Group. The current leases run for many years, with Cramber Tor most recently being granted a further 40-year licence.

===Afforestation===
Early afforestation occurred when Brimpts was planted with trees in 1862. The Forestry Commission was founded in 1919, following World War I and in that year the Duchy of Cornwall planted 800 acres of conifers at Fernworthy. In 1921, Plymouth Corporation planted conifers around Burrator Reservoir. The Forestry Commission planted Bellever and Laughter Tor farms in 1930-32 and in 1944-1945 Soussons Down was also planted. The DPA opposed these post-war plantings and R. Hansford Worth (1868–1950, a Plymouth engineer, scientist and antiquarian) delivered a lecture fiercely critical of the Duchy of Cornwall as the landowners at The Plymouth Athenaeum, using the argument of encroachment on the rights of common and loss of ancient monuments. DPA opposition to forestry on Dartmoor arose again in 1953 when it wrote a policy on woodlands in the then-new national park. Opposition was exercised when Hawn, Dendles and High House Wastes, all near Cornwood, were designated for tree planting in 1959. Argument continued while Hawns and Dendles Wastes were ploughed in 1960. High House Waste was purchased by the DPA in 1964 and the Nature Conservancy (UK) bought neighbouring Dendles in 1965. The situation in 2015 is that some of the Dartmoor plantations have been affected by the fungal disease Phytophthora ramorum which results in widespread clear felling to prevent further spread of the disease. The policy now is to replant with more native hardwood trees although more resistant conifers are also being used.

===Reservoirs===
There are eight Dartmoor reservoirs, with the earliest being Tottiford Reservoir, 1861. Three were built in the mid-20th century: Fernworthy, 1942; Avon, 1957 and Meldon, 1972, and the DPA fought many battles over these. It opposed plans for reservoirs on Brent Moor (1899) and Holne Moor (1901) where, later, the Avon Reservoir and Venford Reservoirs were respectively built. The DPA&#x27;s opposition was supported in the House of Commons with argument made regarding the effects on the local water table. The DPA was one of many local and national amenity bodies that fought the building of the Meldon dam. The preservation battle for the Meldon valley was recorded in a DPA publication. The DPA offered a viable alternative site, Gorhuish Valley, for various reasons, including the fact that minerals such as arsenic would leach into the water supply if Meldon were selected. The Meldon story was discussed many times in Parliament. Another battle was fought against the flooding of the Swincombe valley to form another reservoir. This was rejected in parliament in 1970, revived in 1974 and finally resolved by the building of the Roadford Reservoir to the west of the moor. In 1985 the DPA used funds from a bequest to purchase 50 acres of land where the dam of a reservoir at Swincombe would have to be.

===National Park designation===
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 led to Dartmoor being one of the first four parks to be designated, by an order made on 15 August 1951 and confirmed on 30 October 1951. Shortly after this, the DPA tried to ensure that the new National Park was run by an independent committee and not by the Dartmoor Standing Committee that was a subcommittee of Devon County Council Planning Committee. The committee was reformed as Dartmoor National Park Committee under the Local Government Act 1972 but it was still a subcommittee of Devon County Council and as such it was not seen to be an independent guardian of the moor by the DPA. It was not until 1997 that an independent Dartmoor National Park Authority was enabled under the Environment Act 1995 as a free-standing local authority, forty-four years after the park was created, although it is still dominated by local authorities and government appointees.

===North Hessary Tor TV mast===
The DPA learned in October 1951 that the BBC planned to build a 750-foot television mast on North Hessary Tor, near Princetown, that was erected in 1955. This was to be a relay from a transmitting station at Wenvoe, South Wales. The DPA objected to this threat and sought expert opinion, offered alternative solutions, pressed for a public enquiry, engaged a lawyer, held public meetings, distributed pamphlets, wrote to the press and petitioned parliament. Eventually, a public enquiry was announced. When the decision was made to permit the mast, there were a number of conditions, included among them was that the development was built near the tor, leaving it still intact, and that its new approach road should not be fenced. During the process of obtaining land for the transmitter, one MP asked in the House of Commons: &quot;Will the Assistant Postmaster-General bear in mind that we have no desire to hinder the provision of this station but that it is felt that ancient common rights such as these, that have existed for a thousand years, should be adequately protected or properly extinguished by due process of law?&quot;

===Sharpitor===
During World War II, the Royal Air Force (RAF) built a mast and buildings on Peek Hill, as RAF Sharpitor. In 1956, permission was granted to rebuild the station as part of the &quot;Gee&quot; radio navigation system, to be occupied for ten years. There followed delay in leaving and a proposal was made in 1970 by Devon &amp; Cornwall Police to use the mast, which was rejected. Then later that year Plymouth Corporation wanted to use the exposed site for housing juvenile offenders. This was also rejected, but Plymouth appealed. At a public enquiry in June 1973 Lady Sylvia Sayer represented the DPA and permission for development on the site was refused. A few years later, DPA fought successfully in support of South West Water (SWW) against renewed calls for a new reservoir at Swincombe. To mark the victory, Sylvia Sayer asked SWW if DPA could purchase the rocky outcrop of Sharpitor. The DPA purchased 32 acres in February 1984.

===Okehampton bypass===
Okehampton lies on the A30 main road, the shortest route from London to west Devon and Cornwall. The need for a bypass was mooted in 1963. In 1975, three routes were considered: a northern route through mainly farmland, a central route using a railway, and a southern route through Dartmoor National Park. In August 1976, the Department of the Environment announced the preferred route was through the National Park. A major event on the timeline of this project was a 96-day public enquiry from 1 May 1979 to 4 February 1980 held in Okehampton. In March 1984, the DPA with other organisations petitioned Parliament opposing compulsory purchase orders on public open spaces. The Secretary of State announced in July 1985 that he was introducing a bill to reverse the decision of a Joint Parliamentary Committee and confirm a route through the National Park. This was followed by a confirmation bill in November 1985 that was passed in the House of Lords on 5 December 1985. Construction started in November 1986 and the road was opened on 19 July 1988.

==Since 2000==
The DPA continues to follow the same objectives as when it was founded. The activities have widened, involving local partners, it has a calendar of events, walks and work days with its Conservation Team undertaking a variety of moorland projects, it funds the supply of walking boots to some children who need them for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme through the Moor Boots Scheme, it collaborates with the Campaign for National Parks, it monitors the activities of Dartmoor National Park Authority who run the National Park. It objected to eight planning proposals (with success in seven cases), with many other achievements in the DPA Director&#x27;s Annual Report. The DPA remains true to its original objectives and has also added other activities in support of Dartmoor and its inhabitants.

===China clay expansion===
The china clay industry on Dartmoor was established long before the DPA was founded. The earliest record of a china clay pit refers to Hook Lake in 1502. The area was surveyed around 1827 by Cornishmen with thirty years experience in the clay industry. They obtained a 21-year lease in 1830, from the Earl of Morley who owned the land, to work the area between Lee Moor and Shaugh Moor. A rival pit was opened at Leftlake in about 1850 and at Hemerdon and Broomage in about 1855. Further pits were opened at Cholwichtown, Whitehill Yeo and Wigford Down/Brisworthy (circa 1860). Others followed at Smallhanger and Headon in the 1870s. Redlake started working in 1910. China clay pits are open cast mines that result in large holes in the ground accompanied by large waste tips. Over time, the pits become larger and more ground is needed for the waste, changing the landscape: the effect of this can be seen from space.

The DPA argues that this is an activity that does not agree with the ethos of a National Park, whose purpose is to protect landscape from unsuitable development. In 1994, the National Park boundaries were changed to include common land at Shaugh Moor and exclude china clay worked land at Lee Moor. The DPA revived its campaign with the publication of a booklet in 1999 when the Blackabrook Valley, Crownhill Down and Shaugh Moor, near the popular tourist area of Cadover Bridge, all came under threat from exploitation or dumping of waste. The china clay companies relinquished planning permissions in 2001. However, in November 2009, the clay companies, Sibelco and Imerys, produced a report reviewing old mineral permissions under the Environment Act 1995 with a view to joining up two pits. A presumed Bronze Age barrow, known as Emmets Post, was to be removed and three other monuments may be affected. The DPA were recorded twice, with other bodies, in a Devon County Council Development Management Committee Report for their representations in securing the future of the three areas where planning permissions were relinquished in 2001. Oxford Archaeology held an open day during their excavation of Emmets Post in 2014 prior to its removal.

===House of Lords reception===
The DPA and Exmoor Society held a joint reception at the House of Lords on 6 November 2008, hosted by Baroness Mallalieu, to lobby members of both Houses of Parliament and relevant Ministers about ensuring that environmental schemes for the uplands are &quot;fit for purpose&quot;. Both organisations funded an invited number of upland hill farmers to attend.

===Whitehorse Hill excavation===
The excavation in August 2011 on the north moor of a Bronze Age burial kistvaen, or cist, that was originally uncovered in 2001 was part-funded by the DPA, along with other bodies.

===South West Uplands Federation Conference===
A conference for the upland farmers of Bodmin Moor, Exmoor and Dartmoor was held as a joint venture between the South West Uplands Federation and the DPA. It was run by the DPA at Exeter Racecourse in October 2012, with 150 delegates. Speakers came from the Foundation for Common Land, the Forest of Dartmoor Commoners, the University of Gloucestershire, the National Farmers Union of England and Wales and the Open Spaces Society. The CEO raised sponsorship from Dartmoor National Park, Exmoor National Park, Natural England, Duchy of Cornwall and the Exmoor Society - this reflecting the standing of the DPA with those bodies.

===Undergrounding power cables===
Two major projects to underground overhead power cables in Dartmoor National Park have been completed in a joint project between Western Power Distribution, the South West Protected Landscapes Forum (SWPLF) and Dartmoor National Park Authority. The two schemes on Holne Moor and Walkhampton Common between them remove nearly 6 km of overhead line from open moorland. At nearly 5 km, the Walkhampton scheme is the largest to be undertaken in the South West region by Western Power Distribution. The old overhead line was readily visible from the B3212 Princetown to Yelverton Road, strung across Walkhampton Common from Devil&#x27;s Elbow to just above Horseyeatt at Peek Hill. The works to provide the new underground supply were mainly undertaken on the highway to minimise the impact on the sensitive moorland landscape, its archaeology, wildlife and livestock. The DPA has supported the undergrounding of these visually intrusive power lines for many years.

===The Dartmoor Conservation Garden===
The Dartmoor Conservation Garden is a joint project between DPA and Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA) and is located in the Jack Wigmore Garden behind the High Moorland Centre in Princetown: this is a memorial garden to a former Chair of the Authority. It is planted with a cross-section of typical native Dartmoor plants. It also houses some typical Dartmoor archaeological features, such as a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age burial kistvaen (or cist) and a medieval granite cross from Ter Hill. This marked the Monk&#x27;s Path but was constantly being pushed over by cattle. The purpose of the Garden is to illustrate the biodiversity on Dartmoor. The project came online in June 2015.

===Widecombe telecommunications mast===
The DPA were involved in a campaign in June 2015 against four telecommunications masts planned for Dartmoor, with the first to be erected in the village of Widecombe. At short notice, the DPA banners were taken out, letters written, press interviews given and support given to the villagers when an inflatable mast was demonstrated – with the effect that the planning application was withdrawn.

===Friends of Dartmoor===
In common with other amenity bodies, such as those for the Lake District, Peak District, Pembrokeshire Coast, Yorkshire Dales Three Peaks and the New Forest Trust, the image of Dartmoor Preservation Association is evolving from its Victorian origins, although the original name is being retained. Friends of Dartmoor projects a more modern image of preservation where several years of diplomacy have achieved good relations with the partner agencies that operate in the Dartmoor arena. This is due mainly to the efforts of the previous CEO, James Paxman and his successor, Phil Hutt.

===Constitution, objectives and policies===
The DPA Constitution, objectives and policies are published on the DPA web site.

The objectives enshrined in the constitution are the protection, preservation and enhancement in the public interest of the landscape, antiquities, flora and fauna, natural beauty, cultural heritage and scientific interest of Dartmoor. Also the protection and preservation of public access to and on Dartmoor subject to the ancient rights of commoners. Co-operation with the commoners and any organisation in achieving DPA objectives, also the study of and the recording and publication of information upon the antiquities, history and natural history of Dartmoor.

The DPA has twenty-two policies listed on its web site: regarding access and rights of way, fencing, protecting monuments, diverse habitats, bracken, china clay quarrying, military training and live firing, hill farming and small scale traditional local industries, quarrying, television and telephone masts, wind farms, planning applications, housing developments, woodlands and forestry, ponies, swaling, and recreational activities.

===Conservation===
The DPA conservation team meet throughout the year to work on a number of ongoing projects; from gorse clearance, to habitat protection and archaeological surveying. A quarterly timetable is released both on the organisation&#x27;s website and through its member publications, along with details of how to get involved. The team also host an annual open day at the DPA land holding of Pudsham Meadows.

<text>Dartmouth College ( ) is a private Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, Dartmouth is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth has since been considered among the most prestigious undergraduate colleges in the United States.

Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by &quot;Dartmouth College&quot; to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.

Following a liberal arts curriculum, Dartmouth provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs, including 60 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized concentrations or engage in dual degree programs. In addition to the undergraduate faculty of arts and sciences, Dartmouth has four professional and graduate schools: the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies. The university also has affiliations with the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center. Dartmouth is home to the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences, the Hood Museum of Art, the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. With a student enrollment of about 6,700, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. Undergraduate admissions are highly selective with an acceptance rate of 5.3% for the class of 2028, including a 3.8% rate for regular decision applicants.

Situated on a terrace above the Connecticut River, Dartmouth&#x27;s main campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England. The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, Greek culture, and campus traditions. Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. The university has many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the United States Congress, 25 U.S. governors, 8 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. vice president. Other notable alumni include 81 Rhodes Scholars, 26 Marshall Scholarship recipients, 13 Pulitzer Prize recipients, 10 CEOs of &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies, and 51 Olympic medalists.

== History ==

Dartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock, a Yale graduate and Congregational minister from Windham, Connecticut, who had sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries. It was one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Wheelock&#x27;s ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks.

Wheelock founded Moor&#x27;s Indian Charity School in 1755. The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school&#x27;s operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. The first major donation to the school was given by John Phillips in 1762, who went on to found Phillips Exeter Academy. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock. The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.

Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the Province of New Hampshire. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, John Wentworth, provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued a royal charter in the name of King George III establishing the college. That charter created a college &quot;for the education and instruction of youth of the Indian tribes in this land in reading, writing, and all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing and christianizing children of pagans as well as in all liberal arts and sciences and also of English youth and any others&quot;. The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable the use of the Charity School&#x27;s unspent trust funds. Named for William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth – an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock&#x27;s earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the college and never donated to it – Dartmouth is the nation&#x27;s ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under colonial rule. The college granted its first degrees in 1771.

Given the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites. Occom, disappointed with Wheelock&#x27;s departure from the school&#x27;s original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York.

In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case, which challenged New Hampshire&#x27;s 1816 attempt to amend the college&#x27; charter to make the school a public university. An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby. Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the college&#x27;s case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth&#x27;s charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire&#x27;s takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: &quot;It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.&quot;

Dartmouth taught its first African-American students in 1775 and 1808. By the end of the Civil War, 20 black men had attended the college or its medical school. and Dartmouth &quot;was recognized in the African-American community as a place where a man of color could go to get educated&quot;. One of them, Jonathan C. Gibbs, served as Secretary of State and Superintendent of Public Instruction for the state of Florida.

In 1866, the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth&#x27;s president. The new college was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, in 1891, and later became known as the University of New Hampshire.

Dartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded. Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux. 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having &quot;refounded Dartmouth&quot; and bringing it into national prestige. Presidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909–16) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916–45) continued Tucker&#x27;s trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s. In 1945, Hopkins was subject to no small amount of controversy, as he openly admitted to Dartmouth&#x27;s practice of using racial quotas to deny Jews entry into the university. John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations. During World War II, Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.

The Dartmouth workshop, which was held in 1956, is widely considered to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field.

In 1970, longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth. Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college. Dartmouth, which had been a men&#x27;s institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy. At about the same time, the college adopted its &quot;Dartmouth Plan&quot; of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.

In 1988, Dartmouth&#x27;s alma mater song&#x27;s lyrics changed from &quot;Men of Dartmouth&quot; to &quot;Dear old Dartmouth&quot;.

During the 1990s, the college saw a major academic overhaul under President James O. Freedman and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school&#x27;s single-sex Greek houses to go coed. The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.5 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college&#x27;s history, which surpassed $1 billion in 2008. The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center. In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance &quot;whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial&quot;, citing &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot; and Dartmouth&#x27;s successful self-reinvention in the late 19th century.

Since the election of a number of petition-nominated trustees to the Board of Trustees starting in 2004, the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing conflict. President James Wright announced his retirement in February 2008 and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician Jim Yong Kim on July 1, 2009. Kim was succeeded by Philip J. Hanlon in June 2013.

In May 2010 Dartmouth joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Durham University (UK), Queen&#x27;s University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Tübingen (Germany), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).

In early August 2019, Dartmouth College agreed to pay nine current and former students a total of $14 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging they were sexually harassed by three former neuroscience professors.

In 2019, Dartmouth College was elected to the Association of American Universities (AAU).

In April 2022, Dartmouth College returned the papers of Samson Occom, who helped Eleazar Wheelock secure the funds for Dartmouth College for what Occom believed would be a school for Native students in Connecticut, to the Mohegan Tribe.

On June 12, 2023 Sian Beilock began her tenure as the first female president of Dartmouth.

In September of 2023, Dartmouth convened an event entitled The Future of Mental Health and Wellness, which included the seven living U.S. Surgeons General at the time. In 2024, the College hired a chief wellness office in order to provide increased mental health support on campus and to help students to manage daily stressors.

In April of 2024, Dartmouth announced the creation of the Dartmouth Climate Collaboration, pledging $500 million towards the goal of eliminating carbon emissions on campus by 2050. The plan includes the installation of high-capacity heat pumps and a geoexchange system, making it the largest operational change in the College’s history.

== Academics ==
Dartmouth, a liberal arts institution, offers a four-year Bachelor of Arts and ABET-accredited Bachelor of Engineering degree to undergraduate students. The college has 39 academic departments offering 56 major programs, while students are free to design special majors or engage in dual majors. For the graduating class of 2017, the most popular majors were economics, government, computer science, engineering sciences, and history. The Economics Department, whose prominent professors include David Blanchflower, Andrew Samwick, and Diego Comin, among others, also holds the distinction as the top-ranked bachelor&#x27;s-only economics program in the world. The Government Department similarly includes numerous eminent faculty members, such as Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth, and is among Dartmouth&#x27;s most popular majors. These two departments are known for enforcing a median grade of B+ in most of their courses in order to curb the burgeoning trend of grade inflation at American universities. 

In order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program. Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten &quot;distributive requirements&quot; in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing. Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in &quot;independent, sustained work&quot;, culminating in the production of a thesis. In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs.
Through the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master&#x27;s degrees in 19 Arts &amp; Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s. Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: the Geisel School of Medicine (established 1797), Thayer School of Engineering (1867)—which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences—and Tuck School of Business (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of &quot;Dartmouth University&quot;; however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot;), the school uses the name &quot;Dartmouth College&quot; to refer to the entire institution.

Dartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities, and the first black woman tenure-track faculty member in computer science at an Ivy League university. Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the Dartmouth Workshop, the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, Dartmouth BASIC, and Dartmouth ALGOL 30. In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.

Dartmouth served as the host member of the University Press of New England, a university press founded in 1970 that included Brandeis University, Tufts University, the University of New Hampshire, and Northeastern University. The University Press of New England shut down in 2018. With the exception of Dartmouth College Press titles, in 2021, Brandeis become the sole owner of all copyrights and titles of UPNE.

=== Rankings ===


Dartmouth was ranked 12th among undergraduate programs at national universities by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2022 rankings. &quot;U.S. News&quot; also ranked the school 3rd best for veterans, tied for 5th best in undergraduate teaching, and 7th for &quot;best value&quot; national universities. Dartmouth&#x27;s undergraduate teaching was previously ranked 1st by &quot;U.S. News&quot; for five years in a row (2009–2013). Dartmouth College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

In &quot;Forbes&quot;″ 2019 rankings of 650 universities, liberal arts colleges and service academies, Dartmouth ranked 10th overall and 10th in research universities. In the &quot;Forbes&quot; 2018 &quot;grateful graduate&quot; rankings, Dartmouth came in first for the second year in a row.

The 2021&quot; Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; ranked Dartmouth among the 90–110th best universities in the nation. However, this specific ranking has drawn criticism from scholars for not adequately adjusting for the size of an institution, which leads to larger institutions ranking above smaller ones like Dartmouth.

The 2006 Carnegie Foundation classification listed Dartmouth as the only &quot;majority-undergraduate&quot;, &quot;arts-and-sciences focus[ed]&quot;, &quot;research university&quot; in the country that also had &quot;some graduate coexistence&quot; and &quot;very high research activity&quot;.

=== Admissions ===
Undergraduate admission to Dartmouth College is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as &quot;most selective&quot;. The &quot;Princeton Review&quot;, in its 2024 edition, gave the university an admissions selectivity rating of 99 out of 99.

For the freshman class entering Fall 2023, Dartmouth received a record 28,841 applications of which 6.2% were accepted, consistent with the prior two years; approximately 67% of those accepted are expected to matriculate. Of those admitted students who reported class rank, 444 were ranked first or second in their class, while 96% ranked in the top decile. The admitted students&#x27; academic profile showed an all-time high SAT average score of 1501, while the average composite ACT score remained at 33.

Additionally, for the 2016–2017 academic year, Dartmouth received 685 transfer applications of which 5.1% were accepted, with an average SAT composite score of 1490, average composite ACT score of 34, and average college GPA of about 3.85. Dartmouth meets 100% of students&#x27; demonstrated financial need in order to attend the college, and currently admits all students, including internationals, on a need-blind basis.

In 2020, Dartmouth made it optional for students applying to the college to submit their SAT scores due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2024, the college became the first Ivy League school to announce that it would once again require applicants to submit their test scores.

=== Financial aid ===
Dartmouth guarantees to meet 100% of the demonstrated need of every admitted student who applies for financial aid at the time of admission. Dartmouth is one of seven American universities to practice international need-blind admissions. This means that all applicants, including U.S. permanent residents, undocumented students in the U.S., and international students, are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $125,000 or less and possessing typical assets. Dartmouth is also one of a few U.S. universities to eliminate undergraduate student loans and replace them with expanded scholarship grants. In 2015, $88.8 million (~$ in ) in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.

The median family income of Dartmouth students is $200,400, with 58% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 14% from the bottom 60%.

However, a 2022 article from &quot;The Dartmouth&quot; disputes the college&#x27;s claims by saying the following: &quot;To put it all together with the $9 million of student debt from the Class of 2021, this change in Dartmouth policy, hailed as &quot;eliminat[ing] loans for undergraduate students&quot; actually eliminated only about a quarter—27.4% to be exact—of student loans for undergraduate students. So, while Dartmouth gets glowing coverage in news publications across the country, 72.6% of the debt it saddles its students with remains.&quot;

In March 2024, the estate of Glenn Britt gifted over $150 million to Dartmouth to enable students from middle-income families to attend the college for free.

=== The Dartmouth Plan ===

Dartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply &quot;D-Plan&quot;) is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student&#x27;s academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman year and two terms of their senior year, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year. However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during terms of their senior year or sophomore summer terms. During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects. The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.

The D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as &quot;a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds&quot;. Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.

=== Board of trustees ===
Dartmouth is governed by a board of trustees comprising the college president (&quot;ex officio&quot;), the state governor (&quot;ex officio&quot;), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called &quot;charter trustees&quot;), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board (&quot;alumni trustees&quot;). The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.

Although the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007, the board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees. In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action. In 2008, the board added five new charter trustees.

== Campus ==


Dartmouth College is situated in the rural town of Hanover, New Hampshire, located in the Upper Valley along the Connecticut River in New England. Its campus is centered on a &quot;Green&quot;, a former field of pine trees cleared in 1771. Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover, and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $434 million. In addition to its campus in Hanover, Dartmouth owns of Mount Moosilauke in the White Mountains and a tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the Second College Grant.

Dartmouth&#x27;s campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s (the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the college) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006. Most of Dartmouth&#x27;s buildings are designed in the Georgian colonial architecture style, a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions. The college has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning it the grade of A− from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008.

A notable feature of the Dartmouth campus is its many trees which (despite Dutch elm disease) include some 200 American elms. The campus also has the largest Kentucky coffeetree in New Hampshire, at 91 ft tall.

While Dartmouth&#x27;s campus is located in a rural setting, it is connected to several major cities by intercity bus services that directly serve Dartmouth and Hanover. Dartmouth Coach provides service from Hanover to South Station and Logan International Airport in Boston as well as New York City, while Greyhound Lines operates a daily route connecting Hanover and Montreal. All three cities are popular weekend/vacation destinations for Dartmouth students.

=== Academic facilities ===

The college&#x27;s creative and performing arts facility is the Hopkins Center for the Arts (&quot;the Hop&quot;). Opened in 1962, the Hop houses the college&#x27;s drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty. The building was designed by the famed architect Wallace Harrison, who would later design the similar-looking façade of Manhattan&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center. Its facilities include two theaters and one 900-seat auditorium and the Courtyard Café dining facility. The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, arguably North America&#x27;s oldest museum in continuous operation, and the Loew Auditorium, where films are screened.
In addition to its 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools. The Geisel School of Medicine is located in a complex on the north side of campus and includes laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a biomedical library. The Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, located several miles to the south in Lebanon, New Hampshire, contains a 396-bed teaching hospital for the Medical School. The Thayer School of Engineering and the Tuck School of Business are both located at the end of Tuck Mall, west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River. The Thayer School comprises two buildings; Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings, as well as several common areas. The two graduate schools share a library, the Feldberg Business &amp; Engineering Library. In December 2018, Dartmouth began a major expansion of the west end of campus by breaking ground on the $200 million (~$ in ) Center for Engineering and Computer Science. The center will house the Computer Science department and Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship. In October 2019, construction began on the Irving Institute of Energy and Society. Both were completed by Spring 2022, and the Center for Engineering and Computer Science was renamed the Class of 1982 Engineering and Computer Science Center.

Dartmouth&#x27;s libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library, which comprises 2.48 million volumes and 6 million total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and photographs. Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries, Evans Map Room, Feldberg Business &amp; Engineering Library, Jones Media Center, Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sherman Art Library. Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth, consisting of a merger of the Baker Memorial Library (opened 1928) and the Berry Library (completed 2002). Located on the northern side of the Green, Baker&#x27;s tower is an iconic symbol of the college.

=== Athletic facilities ===

Dartmouth&#x27;s original sports field was the Green, where students played cricket and old division football during the 19th century. Today, two of Dartmouth&#x27;s athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus. The center of athletic life is the Alumni Gymnasium, which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13th-mile (123 m) indoor track. Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts (Leede Arena), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center. Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is Memorial Field, a 15,600-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth&#x27;s football field and track. The nearby Thompson Arena, designed by Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth&#x27;s ice rink. Also visible from Memorial Field is the Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track. The new softball field, Dartmouth Softball Park, was constructed in 2012, sharing parking facilities with Thompson arena and replacing Sachem Field, located over a mile from campus, as the primary softball facility.

Dartmouth&#x27;s other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse and the old rowing house storage facility (both located along the Connecticut River), the Hanover Country Club, Dartmouth&#x27;s oldest remaining athletic facility (established in 1899), and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse. The college also maintains the Dartmouth Skiway, a skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in Lyme Center, New Hampshire, that serves as the winter practice grounds for the Dartmouth Ski Team, which is a perennial contender for the NCAA Division I championship.

Dartmouth&#x27;s close association and involvement in the development of the downhill skiing industry is featured in the 2010 book &quot;Passion for Skiing&quot; as well as the 2013 documentary based on the book &quot;Passion for Snow&quot;.

=== Residential housing and student life facilities ===
Beginning in the fall term of 2016, Dartmouth placed all undergraduate students in one of six House communities, similar to residential colleges, including Allen House, East Wheelock House, North Park House, School House, South House, and West House, alongside independent Living Learning Communities. Dartmouth used to have nine residential communities located throughout campus, instead of ungrouped dormitories or residential colleges. The dormitories varied in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites. Since 2006, the college has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years. More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by college.

In November 2022, Dartmouth Hall was rededicated after a $42 million renovation. Fundraising for the project was led by over 1700 alumnae as part of the celebration of 50 years of coeducation at Dartmouth College.

Campus meals are served by Dartmouth Dining Services, which operates 11 dining establishments around campus. The Class of 1953 Commons, commonly referred to as &quot;Foco&quot;, is the all-you-can-eat dining hall, located at the center of campus. Dartmouth also operates à la carte cafes around campus (Collis Café, Courtyard Café, Novack Café, The Fern Coffee &amp; Tea Bar, Ramekin, and Café@Baker), a convenience store (Collis Market), and three snack bars located in the Allen House Commons (also called the &quot;Cube&quot;), McLaughlin Cluster, and East Wheelock Cluster.

The Collis Center is the center of student life and programming, serving as what would be generically termed the &quot;student union&quot; or &quot;campus center&quot;. It contains a café, study space, common areas, and a number of administrative departments, including the Academic Skills Center. Robinson Hall, next door to both the Collis Center and the Class of 1953 Commons, contains the offices of a number of student organizations, including the Dartmouth Outing Club and &quot;The Dartmouth&quot; daily newspaper.

==== House communities ====

== Student life ==
Dartmouth Student Government represents students on issues related to student life. Annually, students elect a student body president, vice president, and undergraduate senate to represent them in the following academic year. In 2006, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; ranked Dartmouth third in its &quot;Quality of Life&quot; category, and sixth for having the &quot;Happiest Students&quot;. Athletics and participation in the Greek system are the most popular campus activities. In all, Dartmouth offers more than 350 organizations, teams, and sports. The school is also home to a variety of longstanding traditions and celebrations and has a loyal alumni network; Dartmouth ranked #2 in &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; in 2006 for Best Alumni Network.

In 2014, Dartmouth College was the third highest in the nation in &quot;total of reports of rape&quot; on their main campus, with 42 reports of rape. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; attributed the high number of rape reports to the fact that a growing number of sexual assault victims feel comfortable enough to report sexual assaults that would have gone unreported in previous years. In 2015, the Huffington Post reported that Dartmouth had the highest rate of bystander intervention of any college surveyed, with 57.7% of Dartmouth students reporting that they would take some sort of action if they saw someone acting in a &quot;sexually violent or harassing manner,&quot; compared to 45.5% of students nationally.

Dartmouth fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.

=== Student groups ===

Dartmouth&#x27;s more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests. In 2007, the college hosted eight academic groups, 17 cultural groups, two honor societies, 30 &quot;issue-oriented&quot; groups, 25 performing groups, 12 pre-professional groups, 20 publications, and 11 recreational groups. Notable student groups include the nation&#x27;s largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club, the Dartmouth Outing Club, which includes the nationally recognized Big Green Bus; the campus&#x27;s oldest a cappella group, The Dartmouth Aires; the controversial independent newspaper &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;; Dartmouth Student Government, the college&#x27;s official undergraduate student government; and &quot;The Dartmouth&quot;, arguably the nation&#x27;s oldest university newspaper. &quot;The Dartmouth&quot; describes itself as &quot;America&#x27;s Oldest College Newspaper, Founded 1799&quot;.

Partially because of Dartmouth&#x27;s rural, isolated location, the Greek system dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students. Dartmouth is home to 32 recognized Greek houses: 17 fraternities, 12 sororities, and three coeducational organizations. In 2007, roughly 70% of eligible students belonged to a Greek organization; since 1987, students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year. Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to desegregate fraternity houses, doing so in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s. In the early first decade of the 21st century, campus-wide debate focused on a board of trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become &quot;substantially coeducational&quot;; this attempt to change the Greek system eventually failed.

Dartmouth also has a number of secret societies, which are student- and alumni-led organizations often focused on preserving the history of the college and initiating service projects. Most prominent among them is the Sphinx society, housed in a prominent Egyptian tomb-like building near the center of campus. The Sphinx has been the subject of numerous rumors as to its facilities, practices, and membership.

The college has an additional classification of social/residential organizations known as undergraduate societies.

=== Athletics ===

Approximately 20% of students participate in a varsity sport, and nearly 80% participate in some form of club, varsity, intramural, or other athletics. In 2021, Dartmouth College fielded 33 intercollegiate varsity teams: 15 for men, 17 for women, and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs. Dartmouth&#x27;s athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I eight-member Ivy League conference; some teams also participate in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships. In addition to the traditional American team sports (football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey), Dartmouth competes at the varsity level in many other sports including track and field, softball, squash, sailing, tennis, rowing, soccer, skiing, and lacrosse.

The college also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as fencing, rugby, water polo, figure skating, boxing, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and cricket, leading to a 75% participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body. The Dartmouth Fencing Team, despite being entirely self-coached, won the USACFC club national championship in 2014. The Dartmouth Men&#x27;s Rugby Team, founded in 1951, has been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport, winning for example the Ivy Rugby Conference every year between 2008 and 2020. The figure skating team won the national championship five straight times from 2004 through 2008. In addition to the academic requirements for graduation, Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a swim and three terms of physical education.

=== Native Americans at Dartmouth ===

The charter of Dartmouth College, granted to Wheelock in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created &quot;for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others&quot;. However, Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate white youth, and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education. The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Mohegan named Samson Occom, and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college.

The college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first 200 years. In 1970, the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a &quot;new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment&quot;. Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 700 Native American students from over 200 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.

=== Traditions ===
Dartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions. The college functions on a quarter system, and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as &quot;big weekends&quot; or &quot;party weekends&quot;. In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class. Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports. This tradition is the oldest in the United States, and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges. In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.

The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the Connecticut River. Begun in 1986, Tubestock was ended in 2006 by town ordinance. The Class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the college.

Another longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run First-Year Trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge. In 2011, over 96% of freshmen elected to participate.

== Insignia and other representations ==

=== Motto and song ===
Dartmouth&#x27;s motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is &quot;Vox clamantis in deserto&quot;. The Latin motto is literally translated as &quot;The voice of one crying in the wilderness&quot;, but is more often rendered as &quot;A voice crying out in the wilderness&quot;. The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college&#x27;s location on what was once the frontier of European settlement. Richard Hovey&#x27;s &quot;Men of Dartmouth&quot; was elected as the best of Dartmouth&#x27;s songs in 1896, and became the school&#x27;s official song in 1926. The song was retitled to &quot;Alma Mater&quot; in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.

=== Seal ===

Dartmouth&#x27;s 1769 royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas. The college&#x27;s founder, Eleazar Wheelock, designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education. Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:

On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter&#x27;s reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone. The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer William Addison Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins&#x27; design was modified during 1957 to change the date from &quot;1770&quot; to &quot;1769&quot;, to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of &quot;1769&quot; to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use. The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.

=== Shield ===
On October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a &quot;Dartmouth College Shield&quot; for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins&#x27; seal, had its date changed from &quot;1770&quot; to &quot;1769&quot; around 1958. That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.

College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald&#x27;s design. The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of the Geisel School of Medicine, and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across. The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka&#x27;s Bicentennial Medal (Philadelphia Mint, 1969) and elsewhere.

=== Nickname, symbol, and mascot ===

Dartmouth has never had an official mascot. The nickname &quot;The Big Green&quot;, originating in the 1860s, is based on students&#x27; adoption of a shade of forest green (&quot;Dartmouth Green&quot;) as the school&#x27;s official color in 1866. Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname &quot;the Indians&quot;, a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists. This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the &quot;use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education&quot;. Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;, have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence, but never succeeded in doing so.

Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot, but none has become &quot;official&quot;. One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the &quot;Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern&quot; was Keggy the Keg, an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy, the mascot has received approval from only the student government. In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the &quot;Dartmoose&quot; as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.

== Alumni ==

Dartmouth&#x27;s alumni are known for frequently donating to their alma mater. According to a 2008 article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; based on data from payscale.com, Dartmouth graduates also earn higher median salaries at least 10 years after graduation than alumni of any other American university surveyed.

By 2008, Dartmouth had graduated 238 classes of students, and had over 60,000 living alumni in a variety of fields. Finance, consulting, and technology have consistently been the most popular industries to enter for students. Top employers of new graduates include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey &amp; Company, Bain &amp; Company, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.

Nelson A. Rockefeller, 41st Vice President of the United States and 49th Governor of New York, graduated cum laude from Dartmouth with a degree in economics in 1930.

== In popular culture ==
Dartmouth College has appeared in or been referenced by a number of popular media. Some of the most prominent include:

* The 1978 comedy film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, was co-written by Chris Miller &#x27;63 and is based loosely on a series of stories he wrote about his fraternity days at Dartmouth. In a CNN interview, John Landis said the movie was &quot;based on Chris Miller&#x27;s real fraternity at Dartmouth&quot;, Alpha Delta Phi. 
* Dartmouth&#x27;s Winter Carnival tradition was the subject of the 1939 film &quot;Winter Carnival&quot; starring Ann Sheridan and written by Budd Schulberg &#x27;36 and F. Scott Fitzgerald.

<text>Dartmouth () is a town and civil parish in the English county of Devon. It is a tourist destination set on the western bank of the estuary of the River Dart, which is a long narrow tidal ria that runs inland as far as Totnes. It lies within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and South Hams district, and had a population of 5,512 in 2001, reducing to 5,064 at the 2011 census. There are two electoral wards in the &quot;Dartmouth&quot; area (Townstal &amp; Kingswear). Their combined population at the above census was 6,822.

==History==
In 1086, the Domesday Book listed &quot;Dunestal&quot; as the only settlement in the area which now makes up the parish of Dartmouth. It was held by Walter of Douai. It paid tax on half a hide, and had two plough teams, two slaves, five villagers and four smallholders. There were six cattle, 40 sheep and 15 goats. At this time Townstal (as the name became) was apparently a purely agricultural settlement, centred around the church. Walter of Douai rebelled against William II, and his lands were confiscated and added to the Honour of Marshwood (Dorset), which sublet Townstal and Dartmouth to the FitzStephens. It was probably during the early part of their proprietorship that Dartmouth began to grow as a port, as it was of strategic importance as a deep-water port for sailing vessels. The port was used as the sailing point for the Crusades of 1147 and 1190, and Warfleet Creek, close to Dartmouth Castle is supposed by some to be named for the vast fleets which assembled there. Dartmouth was a home of the Royal Navy from the reign of Edward III and was twice surprised and sacked during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, after which the mouth of the estuary was closed every night with a great chain. The narrow mouth of the Dart is protected by two fortified castles, Dartmouth Castle and Kingswear Castle. Originally Dartmouth&#x27;s only wharf was Bayard&#x27;s Cove, a relatively small area protected by a fort at the southern end of the town.

In 1373 Geoffrey Chaucer visited and among the pilgrims in his &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;,
Notwithstanding Dartmouth&#x27;s connections with the crown and respectable society, it was a major base for privateering in medieval times. John Hawley or Hauley, a licensed privateer and sometime mayor of Dartmouth is reputed to be a model for Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;schipman&quot;.

The earliest street in Dartmouth to be recorded by name (in the 13th century) is Smith Street. Several of the houses on the street are originally late 16th century or early 17th century and probably rebuilt on the site of earlier medieval dwellings. The street name undoubtedly derives from the smiths and shipwrights who built and repaired ships here when the tidal waters reached as far as this point. Smith Street was also the site of the town pillory in medieval times.

The first church in the parish was St Clement&#x27;s, Townstal, which may have existed in some form before the 1190s. It was granted by the FitzStephens to Torre Abbey in about 1198, the Abbey having been founded in 1196, and the present stone-built church was probably started shortly after this.
Manorial transactions are first recorded in 1220, when the manor house was at Norton, about half a mile west of Townstal. Names of occupations also started to appear, including taverner, tailor, coggar, korker, goldsmith, glover, skinner and baker. The &quot;Fosse&quot;, now Foss Street, a dam across the creek known later as The Mill Pool, was first mentioned in 1243. The flow of water out of the pool through the Mill Gullet powered a tidal mill. The dam was used as an unofficial footpath linking Clifton, to the south, with Hardness, to the north. Before this it was necessary to go westwards to the head of the creek at Ford to travel between the two settlements. The lord of the manor was given the rights to hold a weekly market and an annual fair in 1231. In 1281, a legal case proved that the Lord of Totnes had the right to charge tolls on ships using the river, and this right was bought by Nicholas of Tewkesbury in 1306, who conveyed the town, river and port to the king in 1327, so making Dartmouth a Royal Borough. The king gave the river to the Duchy of Cornwall in 1333, who still own the &quot;fundus&quot; or bed of the river. In 1335 Edward III granted Dartmouth to Joan of Carew, whose husband was Lord of Stoke Fleming, and almost immediately she obediently passed the lordship to Guy de Bryan, one of the king&#x27;s leading ministers. In 1341, the town was granted a Royal Charter, which allowed for the election of a mayor. The borough was required to provide two ships for forty days per year. After 1390, no more is heard of lordship rights, and the borough became effectively independent of any lord.

St Saviour&#x27;s Church was constructed in 1335 and consecrated in 1372. It contains a pre-Reformation oak rood screen built in 1480 and several monuments including the tomb of John Hawley (died 1408) and his two wives, covered with a large brass plate effigy of all three. A large medieval ironwork door is decorated with two leopards of the Plantagenets and is possibly the original portal. Although it is dated &quot;1631&quot;, this is thought to be the date of a subsequent refurbishment coincidental with major renovations of the church in the 17th century. The gallery of the church is decorated with the heraldic crests of prominent local families and is reputed to be constructed of timbers from ships captured during the defeat of the Spanish Armada, although this has not been categorically substantiated. An engraving of a painting by Thomas Allom of the interior of the church, showing the rood screen, provided the inspiration for Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration &quot;Dartmouth Church&quot; in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room scrap Book, 1833.
In medieval times, land access from the Totnes direction passed the manor at Norton and the parish church at Townstal before falling steeply along what are now Church Road, Mount Boone and Ridge Hill to the river at Hardness. There were steeper routes via Townstal Hill and Clarence Street and also via Brown&#x27;s Hill. These were all too steep for vehicles, so the only land access was by packhorse. In 1671 there is the first mention of the building of the &quot;New Ground&quot;. A previously existing sandbank was built up using ships&#x27; ballast, and a quay wall was built around it to provide more mooring space. The area proved too unstable to be built on, and is now the Royal Avenue Gardens. It was originally linked to the corner of the Quay by a bridge, opposite Duke Street. At the other end of The Quay, Spithead extended into the river for a few yards. 
Dartmouth sent numerous ships to join the English fleet that attacked the Spanish Armada, including the Roebuck, Crescent and Hart. The &quot;Nuestra Señora del Rosario&quot;, the Spanish Armada&#x27;s &quot;payship&quot; commanded by Admiral Pedro de Valdés, was captured along with all its crew by Sir Francis Drake. It was reportedly anchored in the River Dart for more than a year and the crew were used as labourers on the nearby Greenway Estate which was the home of Sir Humphrey Gilbert and his half-brother Sir Walter Raleigh. Greenway was later the home of Dame Agatha Christie.

In 1592 the &quot;Madre de Deus&quot;, a Portuguese treasure ship captured by the English in the Azores, docked at Dartmouth Harbour. It attracted all manner of traders, dealers, cutpurses and thieves and by the time Sir Walter Raleigh arrived to reclaim the Crown&#x27;s share of the loot, a cargo estimated at half a million pounds had been reduced to £140,000. Still, ten freighters were needed to carry the treasure to London.

Henry Hudson put into Dartmouth on his return from North America, and was arrested for sailing under a foreign flag. The Pilgrim Fathers put into Dartmouth&#x27;s Bayard&#x27;s Cove, en route from Southampton to America. They rested a while before setting off on their journey in the &quot;Mayflower&quot; and the &quot;Speedwell&quot; on 20 August 1620. About 300 miles west of Land&#x27;s End, upon realising that the &quot;Speedwell&quot; was unseaworthy, it returned to Plymouth. The &quot;Mayflower&quot; departed alone to complete the crossing to Cape Cod. Dartmouth&#x27;s sister city is Dartmouth, Massachusetts.
The town contains many medieval and Elizabethan streetscapes and is a patchwork of narrow lanes and stone stairways. A significant number of the historic buildings are listed. One of the most obvious is the Butterwalk, built 1635 to 1640. Its intricately carved wooden fascia is supported on granite columns. Charles II held court in the Butterwalk whilst sheltering from storms in 1671 in a room which now forms part of Dartmouth Museum. Much of the interior survives from that time.

The Royal Castle Hotel was built in 1639 on the then new quay. The building was re-fronted in the 19th century, and as the new frontage is itself listed, it is not possible to see the original which lies beneath. A claimant for the oldest building is a former merchant&#x27;s house in Higher Street, now a Good Beer Guide listed public house called &quot;the Cherub&quot;, built circa 1380. Agincourt House (next to the Lower Ferry) is also 14th century.

The remains of a fort at Gallants Bower just outside the town are some of the best preserved remains of a Civil War defensive structure. The fort was built by Royalist occupation forces in c. 1643 to the south east of the town, with a similar fort at Mount Ridley on the opposite slopes of what is now Kingswear. The Parliamentarian General Fairfax attacked from the north in 1646, taking the town and forcing the Royalists to surrender, after which Gallants Bower was demolished.

===19th century===
Before 1671, what is now the town centre was almost entirely tidal mud flats. The New Road (now Victoria Road) was constructed across the bed of the (silted up) Mill Pool and up the Ford valley after 1823. Spithead was extended in 1864 when the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway arrived in Kingswear and a pontoon was constructed, linked to Spithead by a bridge. The railway directors and others formed the Dartmouth Harbour Commissioners. 
At this time, all the roads in those parts of Dartmouth which were not land reclamations were very narrow. In 1864-7 Higher Street was widened into Southtown and linked to Lower Street, which was also widened, with the northern part renamed Fairfax Place. Some of the buildings were rebuilt further back with decorative frontages.
In 1881 the Harbour Commissioners produced a scheme for an embankment or esplanade from near the Lower Ferry to Hardness, across the remains of The Pool, to provide an attraction for tourists and further mooring space. It was completed in 1885 after much disagreement between the Borough, the Commissioners and the Railway (now the Great Western Railway). A new station was also built at this time. The building of the Embankment left a section of river isolated between Spithead and the New Ground, which is known as The Boatfloat, and is linked to the river by a bridge for small vessels under the road.

The coming of steam ships led to Dartmouth being used as a bunkering port, with coal being brought in by ship or train. Coal lumpers were members of gangs, who competed to bunker the ships by racing to be first to a ship. This led to the men living as close as possible to the river, and their tenements became grossly overcrowded, with the families living in slum conditions, with up to 15 families in one house, one family to a room.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution opened the Dart Lifeboat Station at the Sand Quay in 1878, but it was closed in 1896. In all this time only one effective rescue was made by the lifeboat.

===20th century===
The area to the north of Ridge Hill was a shallow and muddy bay (&quot;Coombe Mud&quot;) with a narrow road running along the shore linking with the Higher Ferry. The mud was a dumping ground for vessels, including a submarine. The reclamation was completed in 1937 by the extension of the Embankment and the reclamation of the mud behind it, which became Coronation Park. 

In the 1920s, aided by government grants, the council made a start on clearing the slums. This was aided by the decline in the use of coal as a fuel for ships. The slums were demolished, and the inhabitants were rehoused in new houses in the Britannia Avenue area, to the west of the old village or hamlet of Townstal. The process was interrupted by the second world war, but was resumed with the construction of many prefabs, and later more houses. Community facilities were minimal at first, but a central area was reserved for a church, which was used by the Baptists and opened in 1954, together with a speedway track. The latter was later used for housing, but a new community centre was opened nearby, together with a leisure centre, an outdoor swimming pool, and later an indoor pool, and supermarkets. There are also light industrial units.

In the latter part of the Second World War the town was a base for American forces and one of the departure points for Utah Beach in the D Day landings. Slipways and harbour improvements were also constructed. Much of the surrounding countryside and notably Slapton Sands was closed to the public while it was used by US troops for practise landings and manoeuvres. 
Between 1985 and 1990 the Embankment was widened by 6 metres and raised to prevent flooding at spring tides. A tidal lock gate was provided at the Boatfloat bridge, which could be closed at such times.

===21st century===
Dart Lifeboat Station was reopened in 2007, the first time that a lifeboat had been stationed in the town since 1896. It has initially been kept in a temporary building in Coronation Park.

In 2010, a fire seriously damaged numerous historical properties in Fairfax Place and Higher Street. Several were Tudor and Grade I or Grade II listed buildings.

==Governance==
The town was an ancient borough, incorporated by Edward III, known formally as Clifton-Dartmouth-Hardness, and consisting of the three parishes of &quot;St Petrox&quot;, &quot;St Saviour&quot; and &quot;Townstal&quot;, and incorporating the hamlets of Ford, Old Mill and Norton. It was reformed under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The town returned two members of parliament from the 13th century until 1835, after which one Member of Parliament (MP) was elected until the town was disenfranchised in 1868. It remained a municipal borough until 1974, when it was merged into the South Hams district, and became a successor parish of Dartmouth with a town council.

Dartmouth Town Council is the lowest of three tiers of local government. It consists of 16 councillors representing the two wards of Clifton and Townstal. At the second tier, Dartmouth forms part of the Dartmouth and Kingswear ward of South Hams District Council, which returns three councillors. At the upper tier of local government Dartmouth and Kingswear Electoral Division elects one member to Devon County Council.

==Culture and tourism==

The Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta takes place annually over three days at the end of August. The event sees the traditional regatta boat races along with markets, fun fairs, community games, musical performances, air displays including the Red Arrows and fireworks. A Royal Navy guard ship is often present at the event.
Other cultural events include beer festivals in February and July (the latter in Kingswear), a music festival and an art and craft weekend in June, a food festival in October and a Christmas candlelit event.

The Flavel Centre incorporates the public library and performance spaces, featuring films, live music and comedy and exhibitions.

Bayard&#x27;s Cove has been used in several television productions, including &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; a popular BBC television drama series that ran from 1971 to 1980. Many of the scenes from the BBC&#x27;s popular series &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, starring Ricky Tomlinson, were filmed at various locations around the town.

Notable tourist attractions include the Dartmouth Royal Naval College, Bayard&#x27;s Cove Fort, Dartmouth Castle and the Dartmouth Steam Railway which terminates at Kingswear on the opposite bank of the river.

Boat cruises to nearby places along the coast (such as Torbay and Start Bay) and up the river (to Totnes, Dittisham and the Greenway Estate) are provided by several companies. The paddlesteamer PS Kingswear Castle returned to the town in 2013. The South West Coast Path National Trail passes through the town, and also through extensive National Trust coastal properties at Little Dartmouth and Brownstone (Kingswear). The Dart Valley Trail starts in Dartmouth, with routes either side of the River Dart as far as Dittisham, and continuing to Totnes via Cornworthy, Tuckenhay and Ashprington. The area has long been well regarded for yachting, and there are extensive marinas at Sandquay, Kingswear and Noss (approximately one mile north of Kingswear).

==Climate==
The nearest Met Office weather station is Slapton, about 5 miles south-south west of Dartmouth and a similar distance from the coast. As with the rest of the British Isles and South West England, the area experiences a maritime climate with warm summers and mild winters—this is particularly pronounced due to its position near the coast—extremes range from a record low of just in January 1987 up to a record high of during June 1976.

==Transport==
Dartmouth is linked to Kingswear, on the other side of the River Dart, by three ferries. The Higher Ferry and the Lower Ferry are both vehicular ferries. The Passenger Ferry, as its name suggests, carries only passengers, principally to connect with the Dartmouth Steam Railway at Kingswear railway station. The nearest bridge across the Dart is in Totnes, some away by road.

The A379 road runs through Dartmouth, linking the town to Slapton and Kingsbridge to the southwest and to Torbay to the east across the Higher Ferry. The A3122 connects Dartmouth to a junction with the A381, and hence to both Totnes and a more direct route to Kingsbridge.
Stagecoach South West provides local town bus services and links to Plymouth, Totnes and Exeter, and Kingsbridge. In addition it provides links to the Torbay resorts of Brixham, Paignton and Torquay from Kingswear via the ferry.

No railway has ever run to Dartmouth, but the town does have a railway station, opened on 31 March 1890 to replace the original facility on the pontoon, although it is now a restaurant. In fact Dartmouth Railway Station was built while the line from Paignton to the River Dart was still being built, anticipating a bridge across the river being built near the present Greenway Halt. The railway line to Kingswear was opened in 1864. As a result of shortage of capital, a deviation from the original scheme to run the line from Churston to Greenway with a steamer service to Dartmouth was proposed, but defeated in Parliament. It had been suggested that this could, at a later date, be used as a jumping off point for a bridge to the west bank of the Dart and a line direct to Dartmouth. In 1900, a Light Railway scheme was proposed for a crossing of the Dart near Maypool to join another line from Totnes and then proceed to Kingsbridge and Yealmpton, with a branch to Salcombe. This was also defeated by lack of funds. The railway terminated at a station called &quot;Kingswear for Dartmouth&quot; (now on the Dartmouth Steam Railway) and a ferry took passengers across the river to the station at Dartmouth railway station, which had a dedicated pontoon. British Railways formally closed the line to mainline passenger trains in 1973, but it immediately re-opened as a heritage line and has run as one ever since.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Beacon Hill TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated south east of the town.

Local radio stations include BBC Radio Devon on 104.3 FM, Heart West on 96.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South Devon on 105.5 FM, and Radio Exe on 107.3 FM.

&quot;The Dartmouth Chronicle&quot; is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

==Education==

===Britannia Royal Naval College===
The town is home to the Royal Navy&#x27;s officer training college (Britannia Royal Naval College), where all officers of the Royal Navy and many foreign naval officers are trained.

===Schools===
Dartmouth has one primary school—St John the Baptist R.C. Primary School, and one all-through school—Dartmouth Academy—for those aged 3–16. Dartmouth also has a pre-school in the centre of town, established for over 40 years and based in the old Victorian school rooms at South Ford Road. It provides care for 2- to 5-year-olds and is run as a charitable organisation.

==Sport and leisure==
Dartmouth has a Non-League football club Dartmouth A.F.C. who play at Long Cross.

Dartmouth also hosts the annual &quot;World Indoor Rally Championship&quot;, based on slot car racing in the late summer.

At the end of August and early September there is the annual Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta.

Since 1905 Dartmouth has had a greenhouse as part of the Royal Avenue Gardens. In May 2013 this building, used for the previous 10 years by Dartmouth in Bloom, a not-for-profit organisation affiliated with Britain in Bloom, was closed as structurally unsound. There are proposals to restore the greenhouse to its prior Edwardian style.

<doc id="8420" wikidata="Q43502" url="?curid=8420" title="Dodo">
<text>The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, which is east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The dodo&#x27;s closest relative was the also-extinct and flightless Rodrigues solitaire. The two formed the subtribe Raphina, a clade of extinct flightless birds that were a part of the family which includes pigeons and doves. The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon. A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of Réunion, but it is now believed that this assumption was merely confusion based on the also-extinct Réunion ibis and paintings of white dodos.

Subfossil remains show the dodo measured about in height and may have weighed in the wild. The dodo&#x27;s appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and written accounts from the 17th century. Since these portraits vary considerably, and since only some of the illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens, the dodos&#x27; exact appearance in life remains unresolved, and little is known about its behaviour. It has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage, yellow feet, a tuft of tail feathers, a grey, naked head, and a black, yellow, and green beak. It used gizzard stones to help digest its food, which is thought to have included fruits, and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius. One account states its clutch consisted of a single egg. It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius. Though the dodo has historically been portrayed as being fat and clumsy, it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem. 

The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the following years, the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species, while its habitat was being destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662. Its extinction was not immediately noticed, and some considered the bird to be a myth. In the 19th century, research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century. Among these is a dried head, the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today. Since then, a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius, mostly from the Mare aux Songes swamp. The extinction of the dodo less than a century after its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species. The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, and it has since become a fixture in popular culture, often as a symbol of extinction and obsolescence.

== Taxonomy ==
The dodo was variously declared a small ostrich, a rail, an albatross, or a vulture, by early scientists. In 1842, Danish zoologist Johannes Theodor Reinhardt proposed that dodos were ground pigeons, based on studies of a dodo skull he had discovered in the collection of the Natural History Museum of Denmark. This view was met with ridicule, but was later supported by English naturalists Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville in their 1848 monograph &quot;The Dodo and Its Kindred&quot;, which attempted to separate myth from reality. After dissecting the preserved head and foot of the specimen at the Oxford University Museum and comparing it with the few remains then available of the extinct Rodrigues solitaire (&quot;Pezophaps solitaria&quot;), they concluded that the two were closely related. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features of the leg bones, otherwise known only in pigeons.

Strickland and Melville established that the dodo was anatomically similar to pigeons in many features. They pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak, with its long, slender, naked basal part. Other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes, almost reaching their beak, as in dodos. The forehead was high in relation to the beak, and the nostril was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with pigeons. The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial pigeons than of other birds, both in their scales and in their skeletal features. Depictions of the large crop hinted at a relationship with pigeons, in which this feature is more developed than in other birds. Pigeons generally have very small clutches, and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg. Like pigeons, the dodo lacked the vomer and septum of the nostrils, and it shared details in the mandible, the zygomatic bone, the palate, and the hallux. The dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion to the rest of the cranium.

Throughout the 19th century, several species were classified as congeneric with the dodo, including the Rodrigues solitaire and the Réunion solitaire, as &quot;Didus solitarius&quot; and &quot;Raphus solitarius&quot;, respectively (&quot;Didus&quot; and &quot;Raphus&quot; being names for the dodo genus used by different authors of the time). An atypical 17th-century description of a dodo and bones found on Rodrigues, now known to have belonged to the Rodrigues solitaire, led Abraham Dee Bartlett to name a new species, &quot;Didus nazarenus&quot;, in 1852. Based on solitaire remains, it is now a synonym of that species. Crude drawings of the red rail of Mauritius were also misinterpreted as dodo species; &quot;Didus broeckii&quot; and &quot;Didus herberti&quot;.

For many years the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire were placed in a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was also placed in its own monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was thought that they had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in the columbid subfamily Raphinae and tribe Raphini, along with their closest relatives. In 2024, the new subtribe Raphina was created to include only the dodo and the solitaire.

=== Evolution ===
In 2002, American geneticist Beth Shapiro and colleagues analysed the DNA of the dodo for the first time. Comparison of mitochondrial cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and 12S rRNA sequences isolated from a tarsal of the Oxford specimen and a femur of a Rodrigues solitaire confirmed their close relationship and their placement within the Columbidae. The genetic evidence was interpreted as showing the Southeast Asian Nicobar pigeon (&quot;Caloenas nicobarica&quot;) to be their closest living relative, followed by the crowned pigeons (&quot;Goura&quot;) of New Guinea, and the superficially dodo-like tooth-billed pigeon (&quot;Didunculus strigirostris&quot;) from Samoa (its scientific name refers to its dodo-like beak). This clade consists of generally ground-dwelling island endemic pigeons. The following cladogram shows the dodo&#x27;s closest relationships within the Columbidae, based on Shapiro and colleagues, 2002:


A similar cladogram was published in 2007, inverting the placement of &quot;Goura&quot; and &quot;Didunculus&quot; and including the pheasant pigeon (&quot;Otidiphaps nobilis&quot;) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (&quot;Trugon terrestris&quot;) at the base of the clade. The DNA used in these studies was obtained from the Oxford specimen, and since this material is degraded, and no usable DNA has been extracted from subfossil remains, these findings still need to be independently verified. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the subfamily Gourinae along with the &quot;Goura&quot; pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (&quot;Caloenas maculata&quot;) was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.

The 2002 study indicated that the ancestors of the dodo and the solitaire diverged around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary, about 23.03 million years ago. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, the ancestors of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed at the base of a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the ancestors of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes and flightlessness. Despite its divergent skull morphology and adaptations for larger size, many features of its skeleton remained similar to those of smaller, flying pigeons. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (&quot;Natunaornis gigoura&quot;), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It was only slightly smaller than the dodo and the solitaire, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.

=== Etymology ===
One of the original names for the dodo was the Dutch &quot;Walghvoghel&quot;&quot;, first used in the journal of Dutch Vice Admiral Wybrand van Warwijck, who visited Mauritius during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia in 1598. &quot;Walghe&quot; means &quot;tasteless&quot;, &quot;insipid&quot;, or &quot;sickly&quot;, and means &quot;bird&quot;. The name was translated by Jakob Friedlib into German as &quot;Walchstök&quot; or &quot;Walchvögel&quot;. The original Dutch report titled &quot;Waarachtige Beschryving&quot; was lost, but the English translation survived:
Another account from that voyage, perhaps the first to mention the dodo, states that the Portuguese referred to them as penguins. The meaning may not have been derived from &quot;penguin&quot; (the Portuguese referred to those birds as &quot;fotilicaios&quot; at the time), but from &quot;pinion&quot;, a reference to the small wings. The crew of the Dutch ship &quot;Gelderland&quot; referred to the bird as &quot;Dronte&quot; (meaning &quot;swollen&quot;) in 1602, a name that is still used in some languages. This crew also called them &quot;griff-eendt&quot; and &quot;kermisgans&quot;, in reference to fowl fattened for the Kermesse festival in Amsterdam, which was held the day after they anchored on Mauritius.
The etymology of the word &quot;dodo&quot; is unclear. Some ascribe it to the Dutch word &quot;dodoor&quot; for &quot;sluggard&quot;, but it is more probably related to &quot;Dodaars&quot;, which means either &quot;fat-arse&quot; or &quot;knot-arse&quot;, referring to the knot of feathers on the hind end. The first record of the word &quot;Dodaars&quot; is in Captain Willem Van West-Zanen&#x27;s journal in 1602. The English writer Sir Thomas Herbert was the first to use the word &quot;dodo&quot; in print in his 1634 travelogue claiming it was referred to as such by the Portuguese, who had visited Mauritius in 1507. Another Englishman, Emmanuel Altham, had used the word in a 1628 letter in which he also claimed its origin was Portuguese. The name &quot;dodar&quot; was introduced into English at the same time as dodo, but was only used until the 18th century. As far as is known, the Portuguese never mentioned the bird. Nevertheless, some sources still state that the word &quot;dodo&quot; derives from the Portuguese word &quot;doudo&quot; (currently &quot;doido&quot;), meaning &quot;fool&quot; or &quot;crazy&quot;. It has also been suggested that &quot;dodo&quot; was an onomatopoeic approximation of the bird&#x27;s call, a two-note pigeon-like sound resembling &quot;doo-doo&quot;.

The Latin name &quot;cucullatus&quot; (&quot;hooded&quot;) was first used in 1635 by the Spanish Jesuit Juan Eusebio Nieremberg as &quot;Cygnus cucullatus&quot;, in reference to Carolus Clusius&#x27;s 1605 depiction of a dodo. In the tenth edition of his 18th-century classic work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus used &quot;cucullatus&quot; as the specific name, but combined it with the genus name &quot;Struthio&quot; (ostrich). Mathurin Jacques Brisson coined the genus name &quot;Raphus&quot; (referring to the bustards) in 1760, resulting in the current name &quot;Raphus cucullatus&quot;. In 1766, Linnaeus coined the new binomial &quot;Didus ineptus&quot; (meaning &quot;inept dodo&quot;). This has become a synonym of the earlier name because of nomenclatural priority.

== Description ==
As no complete dodo specimens exist, its external appearance, such as plumage and colouration, is hard to determine. Illustrations and written accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (1598–1662) are the primary evidence for its external appearance. According to most representations, the dodo had greyish or brownish plumage, with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end. The head was grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and yellowish, with black claws. A study of the few remaining feathers on the Oxford specimen head showed that they were pennaceous rather than plumaceous (downy) and most similar to those of other pigeons.

Subfossil remains and remnants of the birds that were brought to Europe in the 17th century show that dodos were very large birds, measuring about in height. The bird was sexually dimorphic; males were larger and had proportionally longer beaks. Weight estimates have varied from study to study. In 1993, Bradley C. Livezey proposed that males would have weighed and females . Also in 1993, Andrew C. Kitchener attributed a high contemporary weight estimate and the roundness of dodos depicted in Europe to these birds having been overfed in captivity; weights in the wild were estimated to have been in the range of , and fattened birds could have weighed . A 2011 estimate by Angst and colleagues gave an average weight as low as . This has also been questioned, and there is still controversy over weight estimates. A 2016 study estimated the weight at , based on CT scans of composite skeletons. It has also been suggested that the weight depended on the season, and that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but less so during hot.

===Skeleton===
The skull of the dodo differed much from those of other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws. The upper bill was nearly twice as long as the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated along the length of the beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the frontal bone formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The sclerotic rings inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single fenestra (opening), as in other pigeons.
The dodo had about nineteen presynsacral vertebrae (those of the neck and thorax, including three fused into a notarium), sixteen synsacral vertebrae (those of the lumbar region and sacrum), six free tail (caudal) vertebrae, and a pygostyle. The neck had well-developed areas for muscle and ligament attachment, probably to support the heavy skull and beak. On each side, it had six ribs, four of which articulated with the sternum through sternal ribs. The sternum was large, but small in relation to the body compared to those of much smaller pigeons that are able to fly. The sternum was highly pneumatic, broad, and relatively thick in cross-section. The bones of the pectoral girdle, shoulder blades, and wing bones were reduced in size compared to those of flighted pigeon, and were more gracile compared to those of the Rodrigues solitaire, but none of the individual skeletal components had disappeared. The carpometacarpus of the dodo was more robust than that of the solitaire, however. The pelvis was wider than that of the solitaire and other relatives, yet was comparable to the proportions in some smaller, flighted pigeons. Most of the leg bones were more robust than those of extant pigeons and the solitaire, but the length proportions were little different.

Many of the skeletal features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire, its closest relative, from other pigeons have been attributed to their flightlessness. The pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight, and the pectoral region and the small wings were paedomorphic, meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features. The skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, meaning that they changed considerably with age. The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire, such as features of the skull, pelvis, and sternum, as well as their large size. It differed in other aspects, such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire, having a larger skull and beak, a rounded skull roof, and smaller orbits. The dodo&#x27;s neck and legs were proportionally shorter, and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob present on the solitaire&#x27;s wrists.

=== Contemporary descriptions ===

Most contemporary descriptions of the dodo are found in ship&#x27;s logs and journals of the Dutch East India Company vessels that docked in Mauritius when the Dutch Empire ruled the island. These records were used as guides for future voyages. Few contemporary accounts are reliable, as many seem to be based on earlier accounts, and none were written by scientists. One of the earliest accounts, from van Warwijck&#x27;s 1598 journal, describes the bird as follows:
One of the most detailed descriptions is by Herbert in &quot;A Relation of Some Yeares Travaille into Afrique and the Greater Asia&quot; from 1634:
=== Contemporary depictions ===
The travel journal of the Dutch ship &quot;Gelderland&quot; (1601–1603), rediscovered in the 1860s, contains the only known sketches of living or recently killed specimens drawn on Mauritius. They have been attributed to the professional artist Joris Joostensz Laerle, who also drew other now-extinct Mauritian birds, and to a second, less refined artist. Apart from these sketches, it is unknown how many of the twenty or so 17th-century illustrations of the dodos were drawn from life or from stuffed specimens, which affects their reliability. Since dodos are otherwise only known from limited physical remains and descriptions, contemporary artworks are important to reconstruct their appearance in life. While there has been an effort since the mid-19th century to list all historical illustrations of dodos, previously unknown depictions continue to be discovered occasionally.

The traditional image of the dodo is of a very fat and clumsy bird, but this view may be exaggerated. The general opinion of scientists today is that many old European depictions were based on overfed captive birds or crudely stuffed specimens. It has also been suggested that the images might show dodos with puffed feathers, as part of display behaviour. The Dutch painter Roelant Savery was the most prolific and influential illustrator of the dodo, having made at least twelve depictions, often showing it in the lower corners. A famous painting of his from 1626, now called &quot;Edwards&#x27;s Dodo&quot; as it was once owned by the ornithologist George Edwards, has since become the standard image of a dodo. It is housed in the Natural History Museum, London. The image shows a particularly fat bird and is the source for many other dodo illustrations.
An Indian Mughal painting rediscovered in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, in 1955 shows a dodo along with native Indian birds. It depicts a slimmer, brownish bird, and its discoverer Aleksander Iwanow and British palaeontologist Julian Hume regarded it as one of the most accurate depictions of the living dodo; the surrounding birds are clearly identifiable and depicted with appropriate colouring. It is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to the Mughal painter Ustad Mansur. The bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, located in Surat, where the English traveller Peter Mundy also claimed to have seen two dodos sometime between 1628 and 1633. In 2014, another Indian illustration of a dodo was reported, but it was found to be derivative of an 1836 German illustration.

All post-1638 depictions appear to be based on earlier images, around the time reports mentioning dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led ornithologists such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, seasonal variation, and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the &quot;Gelderland&quot;, Cornelis Saftleven, Savery&#x27;s Crocker Art Gallery, and Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to ratites such as the ostrich and kiwi.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Little is known of the behaviour of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, it has been suggested the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. The legs were robust and strong to support the bulk of the bird, and also made it agile and manoeuvrable in the dense, pre-human landscape. Though the wings were small, well-developed muscle scars on the bones show that they were not completely vestigial, and may have been used for display behaviour and balance; extant pigeons also use their wings for such purposes. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, there is no evidence that the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius receives more rainfall and has less seasonal variation than Rodrigues, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the dodo would have less reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. The Rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; the brain-to-body-size ratio was similar to that of modern pigeons, indicating that dodos were probably equal in intelligence.
The preferred habitat of the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions suggest that it inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view is supported by the fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the &quot;Gelderland&quot; journal shows a small island off the coast of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l&#x27;île aux Bénitiers in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and &quot;Pandanus&quot; trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.

Many endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of humans, so the ecosystem of the island is badly damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains of them today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The dodo lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the flightless red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius scops owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail &quot;Tropidophora carinata&quot; lived on Mauritius and Réunion, but vanished from both islands. Some plants, such as &quot;Casearia tinifolia&quot; and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.

=== Diet and feeding ===
A 1631 Dutch letter (long thought lost, but rediscovered in 2017) is the only account of the dodo&#x27;s diet, and also mentions that it used its beak for defence. The document uses word-play to refer to the animals described, with dodos presumably being an allegory for wealthy mayors:
In addition to fallen fruits, the dodo probably subsisted on nuts, seeds, bulbs, and roots. It has also been suggested that the dodo might have eaten crabs and shellfish, like their relatives the crowned pigeons. Its feeding habits must have been versatile, since captive specimens were probably given a wide range of food on the long sea journeys. Oudemans suggested that as Mauritius has marked dry and wet seasons, the dodo probably fattened itself on ripe fruits at the end of the wet season to survive the dry season, when food was scarce; contemporary reports describe the bird&#x27;s &quot;greedy&quot; appetite. The Mauritian ornithologist France Staub suggested in 1996 that they mainly fed on palm fruits, and he attempted to correlate the fat-cycle of the dodo with the fruiting regime of the palms.
Skeletal elements of the upper jaw appear to have been rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears to have been able to withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. Examination of the brain endocast found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.

Several contemporary sources state that the dodo used Gastroliths (gizzard stones) to aid digestion. The English writer Sir Hamon L&#x27;Estrange witnessed a live bird in London and described it as follows:

It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. Contemporary depictions show a large crop, which was probably used to add space for food storage and to produce crop milk. It has been suggested that the maximum size attained by the dodo and the solitaire was limited by the amount of crop milk they could produce for their young during early growth.

In 1973, the tambalacoque, also known as the dodo tree, was thought to be dying out on Mauritius, to which it is endemic. There were supposedly only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. Stanley Temple hypothesised that it depended on the dodo for its propagation, and that its seeds would germinate only after passing through the bird&#x27;s digestive tract. He claimed that the tambalacoque was now nearly coextinct because of the disappearance of the dodo. Temple overlooked reports from the 1940s that found that tambalacoque seeds germinated, albeit very rarely, without being abraded during digestion. Others have contested his hypothesis and suggested that the decline of the tree was exaggerated or seeds were also distributed by other extinct animals such as &quot;Cylindraspis&quot; tortoises, fruit bats, or the broad-billed parrot. According to Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two experts in the ecology of the Mascarene Islands, the tree, while rare, has germinated since the demise of the dodo and numbers several hundred, not 13 as claimed by Temple, hence, discrediting Temple&#x27;s view as to the dodo and the tree&#x27;s sole survival relationship.

The Brazilian ornithologist Carlos Yamashita suggested in 1997 that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and &quot;Cylindraspis&quot; tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, which became food for the parrots. &quot;Anodorhynchus&quot; macaws depended on now-extinct South American megafauna in the same way, but now rely on domesticated cattle for this service.

=== Reproduction and development ===
As it was flightless and terrestrial and there were no mammalian predators or other kinds of natural enemy on Mauritius, the dodo probably nested on the ground. The account by François Cauche from 1651 is the only description of the egg and the call:

Cauche&#x27;s account is problematic, since it also mentions that the bird he was describing had three toes and no tongue, unlike dodos. This led some to believe that Cauche was describing a new species of dodo (&quot;Didus nazarenus&quot;). The description was most probably mingled with that of a cassowary, and Cauche&#x27;s writings have other inconsistencies. A mention of a &quot;young ostrich&quot; taken on board a ship in 1617 is the only other reference to a possible juvenile dodo. An egg claimed to be that of a dodo is stored in the East London Museum in South Africa. It was donated by the South African museum official Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, whose great aunt had received it from a captain who claimed to have found it in a swamp on Mauritius. In 2010, the curator of the museum proposed using genetic studies to determine its authenticity. It may instead be an aberrant ostrich egg.

Because of the possible single-egg clutch and the bird&#x27;s large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced few altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size and the fact that tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.

A 2017 study examined the histology of thin-sectioned dodo bones, modern Mauritian birds, local ecology, and contemporary accounts, to recover information about the life history of the dodo. The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed at the end of July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.

== Relationship with humans ==
Mauritius had previously been visited by Arab vessels in the Middle Ages and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, but was settled by neither. No records of dodos by these are known, although the Portuguese name for Mauritius, &quot;Cerne (swan) Island&quot;, may have been a reference to dodos. The Dutch Empire acquired Mauritius in 1598, renaming it after Maurice of Nassau, and it was used for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company henceforward. The earliest known accounts of the dodo were provided by Dutch travellers during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia, led by admiral Jacob van Neck in 1598. They appear in reports published in 1601, which also contain the first published illustration of the bird. Since the first sailors to visit Mauritius had been at sea for a long time, their interest in these large birds was mainly culinary. The 1602 journal by Willem Van West-Zanen of the ship &quot;Bruin-Vis&quot; mentions that 24–25 dodos were hunted for food, which were so large that two could scarcely be consumed at mealtime, their remains being preserved by salting. An illustration made for the 1648 published version of this journal, showing the killing of dodos, a dugong, and possibly Mascarene grey parakeets, was captioned with a Dutch poem, here in Hugh Strickland&#x27;s 1848 translation:
Some early travellers found dodo meat unsavoury, and preferred to eat parrots and pigeons; others described it as tough, but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters had to be careful not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.

The appearance of the dodo and the red rail led Peter Mundy to speculate, 230 years before Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution:
=== Dodos transported abroad ===
The dodo was found interesting enough that living specimens were sent to Europe and the East. The number of transported dodos that reached their destinations alive is uncertain, and it is unknown how they relate to contemporary depictions and the few non-fossil remains in European museums. Based on a combination of contemporary accounts, paintings, and specimens, Julian Hume has inferred that at least eleven transported dodos reached their destinations alive.

Hamon L&#x27;Estrange&#x27;s description of a dodo that he saw in London in 1638 is the only account that specifically mentions a live specimen in Europe. In 1626 Adriaen van de Venne drew a dodo that he claimed to have seen in Amsterdam, but he did not mention if it was alive, and his depiction is reminiscent of Savery&#x27;s &quot;Edwards&#x27;s Dodo&quot;. Two live specimens were seen by Peter Mundy in Surat, India, between 1628 and 1634, one of which may have been the individual painted by Mansur around 1625. In 1628, Emmanuel Altham visited Mauritius and sent a letter to his brother in England:

Whether the dodo survived the journey is unknown, and the letter was destroyed by fire in the 19th century.
The earliest known picture of a dodo specimen in Europe is from a collection of paintings depicting animals in the royal menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague. This collection includes paintings of other Mauritian animals as well, including a red rail. The dodo, which may be a juvenile, seems to have been dried or embalmed, and had probably lived in the emperor&#x27;s zoo for a while together with the other animals. That whole stuffed dodos were present in Europe indicates they had been brought alive and died there; it is unlikely that taxidermists were on board the visiting ships, and spirits were not yet used to preserve biological specimens. Most tropical specimens were preserved as dried heads and feet.

One dodo was reportedly sent as far as Nagasaki, Japan, in 1647, but it was long unknown whether it arrived. Contemporary documents first published in 2014 proved the story, and showed that it had arrived alive. It was meant as a gift, and, despite its rarity, was considered of equal value to a white deer and a bezoar stone. It is the last recorded live dodo in captivity.

=== Extinction ===
Like many animals that evolved in isolation from significant predators, the dodo was entirely fearless of humans. This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey, but predation by humans was not the main cause of extinction, contrary to popular belief. Although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships&#x27; provisions, archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation. Bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century, which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high, broken terrain. The human population on Mauritius (an area of ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century, but they introduced other animals, including dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and crab-eating macaques, which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources. At the same time, humans destroyed the forest habitat of the dodos. The impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population, especially the pigs and macaques, is today considered more severe than that of hunting. Rats were perhaps not much of a threat to the nests, since dodos would have been used to dealing with local land crabs.

It has been suggested that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climatic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.

Some controversy surrounds the date of its extinction. The last widely accepted record of a dodo sighting is the 1662 report by shipwrecked mariner Volkert Evertsz of the Dutch ship &quot;Arnhem&quot;, who described birds caught on a small islet off Mauritius, now suggested to be Amber Island:
The dodos on this islet may not necessarily have been the last members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. A 2003 statistical analysis of these records by the biologists David L. Roberts and Andrew R. Solow gave a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. These authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave could not be dismissed out of hand.

The British ornithologist Alfred Newton suggested in 1868 that the name of the dodo was transferred to the red rail after the former had gone extinct. Cheke also pointed out that some descriptions after 1662 use the names &quot;Dodo&quot; and &quot;Dodaers&quot; when referring to the red rail, indicating that they had been transferred to it. He therefore pointed to the 1662 description as the last credible observation. A 1668 account by English traveller John Marshall, who used the names &quot;Dodo&quot; and &quot;Red Hen&quot; interchangeably for the red rail, mentioned that the meat was &quot;hard&quot;, which echoes the description of the meat in the 1681 account. Even the 1662 account has been questioned by the writer Errol Fuller, as the reaction to distress cries matches what was described for the red rail. Until this explanation was proposed, a description of &quot;dodos&quot; from 1681 was thought to be the last account, and that date still has proponents.

Cheke stated in 2014 that then recently accessible Dutch manuscripts indicate that no dodos were seen by settlers in 1664–1674. In 2020, Cheke and the British researcher Jolyon C. Parish suggested that all mentions of dodos after the mid-17th century instead referred to red rails, and that the dodo had disappeared due to predation by feral pigs during a hiatus in settlement of Mauritius (1658–1664). The dodo&#x27;s extinction therefore was not realised at the time, since new settlers had not seen real dodos, but as they expected to see flightless birds, they referred to the red rail by that name instead. Since red rails probably had larger clutches than dodos and their eggs could be incubated faster, and their nests were perhaps concealed, they probably bred more efficiently, and were less vulnerable to pigs.

It is unlikely the issue will ever be resolved, unless late reports mentioning the name alongside a physical description are rediscovered. The IUCN Red List accepts Cheke&#x27;s rationale for choosing the 1662 date, taking all subsequent reports to refer to red rails. In any case, the dodo was probably extinct by 1700, about a century after its discovery in 1598. The Dutch left Mauritius in 1710, but by then the dodo and most of the large terrestrial vertebrates there had become extinct.

Even though the rareness of the dodo was reported already in the 17th century, its extinction was not recognised until the 19th century. This was partly because, for religious reasons, extinction was not believed possible until later proved so by Georges Cuvier, and partly because many scientists doubted that the dodo had ever existed. It seemed altogether too strange a creature, and many believed it a myth. The bird was first used as an example of human-induced extinction in &quot;Penny Magazine&quot; in 1833, and has since been referred to as an &quot;icon&quot; of extinction.

== Physical remains ==

=== 17th-century specimens ===
The only extant remains of dodo specimens taken to Europe in the 17th century are a dried head and foot in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, a foot once housed in the British Museum but now lost, a skull in the University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum, and an upper jaw in the National Museum, Prague. The last two were rediscovered and identified as dodo remains in the mid-19th century. Several stuffed dodos were also mentioned in old museum inventories, but none are known to have survived. Apart from these remains, a dried foot which belonged to Dutch professor Pieter Pauw was mentioned by Carolus Clusius in 1605. Its provenance is unknown, and it is now lost, but it may have been collected during the Van Neck voyage. Purported stuffed dodos seen in museums around the world today have in fact been made from feathers of other birds; many by British taxidermist Rowland Ward&#x27;s company.

The only known soft tissue remains, the Oxford head (specimen OUM 11605) and foot, belonged to the last known stuffed dodo, which was first mentioned as part of the Tradescant collection in 1656 and was moved to the Ashmolean Museum in 1659. It has been suggested that this might be the remains of the bird that Hamon L&#x27;Estrange saw in London, the bird sent by Emanuel Altham, or a donation by Thomas Herbert. Since the remains do not show signs of having been mounted, the specimen might instead have been preserved as a study skin. In 2018, it was reported that scans of the Oxford dodo&#x27;s head showed that its skin and bone contained lead shot, which was used to hunt birds in the 17th century. This indicates that the Oxford dodo was shot either before being transported to Britain, or some time after arriving. The circumstances of its killing are unknown, and the pellets are to be examined to identify where the lead was mined from.

Many sources state that the Ashmolean Museum burned the stuffed dodo around 1755 because of severe decay, saving only the head and leg. Statute 8 of the museum states &quot;That as any particular grows old and perishing the keeper may remove it into one of the closets or other repository; and some other to be substituted.&quot; The deliberate destruction of the specimen is now believed to be a myth; it was removed from exhibition to preserve what remained of it. This remaining soft tissue has since degraded further; the head was dissected by Strickland and Melville, separating the skin from the skull in two-halves. The foot is in a skeletal state, with only scraps of skin and tendons. Very few feathers remain on the head. It is probably a female, as the foot is 11% smaller and more gracile than the London foot, yet appears to be fully grown. The specimen was exhibited at the Oxford museum from at least the 1860s and until 1998, where-after it was mainly kept in storage to prevent damage. Casts of the head can today be found in many museums worldwide.
The dried London foot, first mentioned in 1665, and transferred to the British Museum in the 18th century, was displayed next to Savery&#x27;s &quot;Edwards&#x27;s Dodo&quot; painting until the 1840s, and it too was dissected by Strickland and Melville. It was not posed in a standing posture, which suggests that it was severed from a fresh specimen, not a mounted one. By 1896 it was mentioned as being without its integuments, and only the bones are believed to remain today, though its present whereabouts are unknown.

The Copenhagen skull (specimen ZMUC 90-806) is known to have been part of the collection of Bernardus Paludanus in Enkhuizen until 1651, when it was moved to the museum in Gottorf Castle, Schleswig. After the castle was occupied by Danish forces in 1702, the museum collection was assimilated into the Royal Danish collection. The skull was rediscovered by J. T. Reinhardt in 1840. Based on its history, it may be the oldest known surviving remains of a dodo brought to Europe in the 17th century. It is shorter than the Oxford skull, and may have belonged to a female. It was mummified, but the skin has perished.

The front part of a skull (specimen NMP P6V-004389) in the National Museum of Prague was found in 1850 among the remains of the Böhmisches Museum. Other elements supposedly belonging to this specimen have been listed in the literature, but it appears only the partial skull was ever present (a partial right limb in the museum appears to be from a Rodrigues solitaire). It may be what remains of one of the stuffed dodos known to have been at the menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II, possibly the specimen painted by Hoefnagel or Savery there.

=== Subfossil specimens ===

Until 1860, the only known dodo remains were the four incomplete 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word that he should be informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville&#x27;s monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to &quot;The Ibis&quot;, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. Harry Pasley Higginson, a railway engineer from Yorkshire, reports discovering the Mare aux Songes bones at the same time as Clark and there is some dispute over who found them first. Higginson sent boxes of these bones to Liverpool, Leeds and York museums. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.

Clark&#x27;s reports about the finds rekindled interest in the bird. Sir Richard Owen and Alfred Newton both wanted to be first to describe the post-cranial anatomy of the dodo, and Owen bought a shipment of dodo bones originally meant for Newton, which led to rivalry between the two. Owen described the bones in &quot;Memoir on the Dodo&quot; in October 1866, but erroneously based his reconstruction on the &quot;Edwards&#x27;s Dodo&quot; painting by Savery, making it too squat and obese. In 1869 he received more bones and corrected its stance, making it more upright. Newton moved his focus to the Réunion solitaire instead. The remaining bones not sold to Owen or Newton were auctioned off or donated to museums. In 1889, Théodor Sauzier was commissioned to explore the &quot;historical souvenirs&quot; of Mauritius and find more dodo remains in the Mare aux Songes. He was successful, and also found remains of other extinct species.

In 2005, after a hundred years of neglect, a part of the Mare aux Songes swamp was excavated by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct genus &quot;Cylindraspis&quot;, and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.

Louis Étienne Thirioux, an amateur naturalist at Port Louis, also found many dodo remains around 1900 from several locations. They included the first articulated specimen, which is the first subfossil dodo skeleton found outside the Mare aux Songes, and the only remains of a juvenile specimen, a now lost tarsometatarsus. The former specimen was found in 1904 in a cave near Le Pouce mountain, and is the only known complete skeleton of an individual dodo. Thirioux donated the specimen to the Museum Desjardins (now Natural History Museum at Mauritius Institute). Thrioux&#x27;s heirs sold a second mounted composite skeleton (composed of at least two skeletons, with a mainly reconstructed skull) to the Durban Museum of Natural Science in South Africa in 1918. Together, these two skeletons represent the most completely known dodo remains, including bone elements previously unrecorded (such as knee-caps and wing bones). Though some contemporary writers noted the importance of Thrioux&#x27;s specimens, they were not scientifically studied, and were largely forgotten until 2011, when sought out by a group of researchers. The mounted skeletons were laser scanned, from which 3-D models were reconstructed, which became the basis of a 2016 monograph about the osteology of the dodo. In 2006, explorers discovered a complete skeleton of a dodo in a lava cave in Mauritius. This was only the second associated skeleton of an individual specimen ever found, and the only one in recent times.
Worldwide, 26 museums have significant holdings of dodo material, almost all found in the Mare aux Songes. The Natural History Museum, American Museum of Natural History, Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, the Senckenberg Museum, and others have almost complete skeletons, assembled from the dissociated subfossil remains of several individuals. In 2011, a wooden box containing dodo bones from the Edwardian era was rediscovered at the Grant Museum at University College London during preparations for a move. They had been stored with crocodile bones until then.

== White dodo ==


The supposed &quot;white dodo&quot; (or &quot;solitaire&quot;) of Réunion is now considered an erroneous conjecture based on contemporary reports of the Réunion ibis and 17th-century paintings of white, dodo-like birds by Pieter Withoos and Pieter Holsteyn that surfaced in the 19th century. The confusion began when Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe, who visited Réunion around 1619, mentioned fat, flightless birds that he referred to as &quot;Dod-eersen&quot; in his journal, though without mentioning their colouration. When the journal was published in 1646, it was accompanied by an engraving of a dodo from Savery&#x27;s &quot;Crocker Art Gallery sketch&quot;. A white, stocky, and flightless bird was first mentioned as part of the Réunion fauna by Chief Officer J. Tatton in 1625. Sporadic mentions were subsequently made by Sieur Dubois and other contemporary writers.

Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps coined the name &quot;Raphus solitarius&quot; for these birds in 1848, as he believed the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Oudemans suggested that the discrepancy between the paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.

The Pieter Withoos painting, which was discovered first, appears to be based on an earlier painting by Pieter Holsteyn, three versions of which are known to have existed. According to Hume, Cheke, and Valledor de Lozoya, it appears that all depictions of white dodos were based on Roelant Savery&#x27;s painting &quot;Landscape with Orpheus and the animals&quot;, or on copies of it. The painting has generally been dated to 1611, though a post-1614, or even post-1626, date has also been proposed. The painting shows a whitish specimen and was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in Prague; a &quot;walghvogel&quot; described as having a &quot;dirty off-white colouring&quot; was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the Prague collection of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, to whom Savery was contracted at the time (1607–1611). Savery&#x27;s several later images all show greyish birds, possibly because he had by then seen another specimen. Cheke and Hume believe the painted specimen was white, owing to albinism. Valledor de Lozoya has instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait, a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens, or simply artistic license.

In 1987, scientists described fossils of a recently extinct species of ibis from Réunion with a relatively short beak, &quot;Borbonibis latipes&quot;, before a connection to the solitaire reports had been made. Cheke suggested to one of the authors, Francois Moutou, that the fossils may have been of the Réunion solitaire, and this suggestion was published in 1995. The ibis was reassigned to the genus &quot;Threskiornis&quot;, now combined with the specific epithet &quot;&quot; from the binomial &quot;R. solitarius&quot;. Birds of this genus are also white and black with slender beaks, fitting the old descriptions of the Réunion solitaire. No fossil remains of dodo-like birds have ever been found on the island.

== Cultural significance ==
The dodo&#x27;s significance as one of the best-known extinct animals and its singular appearance led to its use in literature and popular culture as a symbol of an outdated concept or object, as in the expression &quot;,&quot; which has come to mean unquestionably dead or obsolete. Similarly, the phrase &quot;&quot; means to become extinct or obsolete, to fall out of common usage or practice, or to become a thing of the past. &quot;Dodo&quot; is also a slang term for a stupid, dull-witted person, as it was said to be stupid and easily caught.

The dodo appears frequently in works of popular fiction, and even before its extinction, it was featured in European literature, as a symbol for exotic lands, and of gluttony, due to its apparent fatness. In 1865, the same year that George Clark started to publish reports about excavated dodo fossils, the newly vindicated bird was featured as a character in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. It is thought that he included the dodo because he identified with it and had adopted the name as a nickname for himself because of his stammer, which made him accidentally introduce himself as &quot;Do-do-dodgson&quot;, his legal surname. Carroll and the girl who served as inspiration for Alice, Alice Liddell, had enjoyed visiting the Oxford museum to see the dodo remains there. The book&#x27;s popularity made the dodo a well-known icon of extinction. Popular depictions of the dodo often became more exaggerated and cartoonish following its &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; fame, which was in line with the inaccurate belief that it was clumsy, tragic, and destined for extinction.

The dodo is used as a mascot for many kinds of products, especially in Mauritius. It appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Mauritius, on Mauritius coins, is used as a watermark on all Mauritian rupee banknotes, and features as the background of the Mauritian immigration form. A smiling dodo is the symbol of the Brasseries de Bourbon, a popular brewer on Réunion, whose emblem displays the white species once thought to have lived there. 

The dodo is used to promote the protection of endangered species by environmental organisations, such as the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Durrell Wildlife Park. The Center for Biological Diversity gives an annual &#x27;Rubber Dodo Award&#x27;, to &quot;those who have done the most to destroy wild places, species and biological diversity&quot;. In 2011, the nephiline spider &quot;Nephilengys dodo&quot;, which inhabits the same woods as the dodo once did, was named after the bird to raise awareness of the urgent need for protection of the Mauritius biota. Two species of ant from Mauritius have been named after the dodo: &quot;Pseudolasius dodo&quot; in 1946 and &quot;Pheidole dodo&quot; in 2013. A species of isopod from a coral reef off Réunion was named &quot;Hansenium dodo&quot; in 1991.

The name dodo has been used by scientists naming genetic elements, honouring the dodo&#x27;s flightless nature. A fruitfly gene within a region of a chromosome required for flying ability was named &quot;dodo&quot;. In addition, a defective transposable element family from &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot; was named &quot;DodoPi&quot; as it contained mutations that eliminated the element&#x27;s ability to jump to new locations in a chromosome.

In 2009, a previously unpublished 17th-century Dutch illustration of a dodo went for sale at Christie&#x27;s and was expected to sell for £6,000. It is unknown whether the illustration was based on a specimen or on a previous image, and the artist is unidentified. It sold for £44,450. Parrish suggested it depicts a stuffed specimen, as the legs look dried.

The poet Hilaire Belloc included the following poem about the dodo in his &quot;Bad Child&#x27;s Book of Beasts&quot; from 1896:

<text>Sideroxylon grandiflorum, also known as the tambalacoque or dodo tree, is a long-lived species of tree in the sapote family Sapotaceae. It is endemic to Mauritius.

== Description ==
The fruit of &quot;Sideroxylon grandiflorum&quot; is analogous to a peach. Each is termed a drupe because each has a hard endocarp, or pit, surrounding the seed. The plant itself superficially resembles the unrelated &quot;Plumeria&quot;, but the dodo tree&#x27;s flowers and fruit are cauliflorous.

==Ecology==

In 1973, it was argued that the species was becoming extinct. There were supposedly only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old; the true age could not be determined because tambalacoque has no growth rings. Stanley Temple hypothesized that the dodo, which became extinct in the 17th century, ate tambalacoque fruits, and that only after passing through the digestive tract of the dodo could the seeds germinate. Temple force-fed seventeen tambalacoque fruits to wild turkeys in 1977. Seven of the fruits were crushed by the bird&#x27;s gizzard, while the remaining ten were either regurgitated or passed with the bird&#x27;s feces. Temple planted the remaining ten fruits, three of which germinated. Temple did not try to germinate any seeds from control fruits that had not been fed to turkeys so the effect on germination of feeding fruits to turkeys was unknown. Studies on tambalacoque seed germination by Hill (1941) and King (1946) found that the seeds germinated without abrading.

Temple&#x27;s hypothesis that the tree required the dodo was contested. Others have suggested that the decline of the tree was exaggerated or that other extinct animals, such as giant tortoises, fruit bats, or the broad-billed parrot, may also have been distributing the seeds. The decline of the tree may be due to introduction of domestic pigs and crab-eating macaques, and competition from introduced plants. Alternatively, the difference in reported tree numbers may arise from the fact that young trees are not distinct in appearance and may easily be confused with similar species. Catling (2001) in a summary cites Owadally and Temple (1979) and Witmer (1991), while Hershey (2004) reviewed the flaws in Temple&#x27;s dodo-tambalacoque hypothesis.

In 2004, the Botanical Society of America&#x27;s Plant Science Bulletin disputed Temple&#x27;s research as flawed. The Bulletin published evidence as to why the dodo&#x27;s extinction did not directly cause the increasing disappearance of young trees, including suggestions that the &quot;Cylindraspis&quot; giant tortoises would have been more likely to disperse the seeds than dodos, casting doubt on Temple&#x27;s view as to the dodo and the tree&#x27;s sole survival relationship. More recently, the tree’s decline within native forests was shown to be in fact driven by invasive introduced species: The tree’s first germination in its native habitat were observed in 2001 (26 seedlings) exclusively where invasive alien weeds had been cleared and further observations and controlled experiments showed that invasive introduced macaques (Macaca fascicularis Rafles 1821) pick most of the tree’s fruits when still unripe, killing the seeds, and reducing natural germination rates by up to about 40 times.
==Uses==
The dodo tree is highly valued for its wood in Mauritius, which has led some foresters to scrape the pits by hand to make them sprout and grow.

<doc id="8429" wikidata="Q29539" url="?curid=8429" title="Density">
<text>Density (volumetric mass density or specific mass) is a substance&#x27;s mass per unit of volume. The symbol most often used for density is &quot;ρ&quot; (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter &quot;D&quot; can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: 
formula_1
where &quot;ρ&quot; is the density, &quot;m&quot; is the mass, and &quot;V&quot; is the volume. In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate this quantity is more specifically called specific weight.

For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration.
Different materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. Osmium is the densest known element at standard conditions for temperature and pressure.

To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity &quot;relative density&quot; or &quot;specific gravity&quot;, i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one relative to water means that the substance floats in water.

The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a few exceptions) decreases its density by increasing its volume. In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top, due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid, which causes it to rise relative to denser unheated material.

The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass.

Other conceptually comparable quantities or ratios include specific density, relative density (specific gravity), and specific weight.

== History ==

=== Density, floating, and sinking ===
The understanding that different materials have different densities, and of a relationship between density, floating, and sinking must date to prehistoric times. Much later it was put in writing. Aristotle, for example, wrote:
=== Volume vs. density; volume of an irregular shape ===
In a well-known but probably apocryphal tale, Archimedes was given the task of determining whether King Hiero&#x27;s goldsmith was embezzling gold during the manufacture of a golden wreath dedicated to the gods and replacing it with another, cheaper alloy. Archimedes knew that the irregularly shaped wreath could be crushed into a cube whose volume could be calculated easily and compared with the mass; but the king did not approve of this. Baffled, Archimedes is said to have taken an immersion bath and observed from the rise of the water upon entering that he could calculate the volume of the gold wreath through the displacement of the water. Upon this discovery, he leapt from his bath and ran naked through the streets shouting, &quot;Eureka! Eureka!&quot; (). As a result, the term &quot;eureka&quot; entered common parlance and is used today to indicate a moment of enlightenment.

The story first appeared in written form in Vitruvius&#x27; &quot;books of architecture&quot;, two centuries after it supposedly took place. Some scholars have doubted the accuracy of this tale, saying among other things that the method would have required precise measurements that would have been difficult to make at the time.

Nevertheless, in 1586, Galileo Galilei, in one of his first experiments, made a possible reconstruction of how the experiment could have been performed with ancient Greek resources

==Units==
From the equation for density (), mass density has any unit that is &quot;mass divided by volume&quot;. As there are many units of mass and volume covering many different magnitudes there are a large number of units for mass density in use. The SI unit of kilogram per cubic metre (kg/m3) and the cgs unit of gram per cubic centimetre (g/cm3) are probably the most commonly used units for density. One g/cm3 is equal to 1000 kg/m3. One cubic centimetre (abbreviation cc) is equal to one millilitre. In industry, other larger or smaller units of mass and or volume are often more practical and US customary units may be used. See below for a list of some of the most common units of density.

The litre and tonne are not part of the SI, but are acceptable for use with it, leading to the following units:
* kilogram per litre (kg/L)
* gram per millilitre (g/mL)
* tonne per cubic metre (t/m3)

Densities using the following metric units all have exactly the same numerical value, one thousandth of the value in (kg/m3). Liquid water has a density of about 1 kg/dm3, making any of these SI units numerically convenient to use as most solids and liquids have densities between 0.1 and 20 kg/dm3.
* kilogram per cubic decimetre (kg/dm3)
* gram per cubic centimetre (g/cm3)
** 1 g/cm3 = 1000 kg/m3
* megagram (metric ton) per cubic metre (Mg/m3)

In US customary units density can be stated in:
* Avoirdupois ounce per cubic inch (1 g/cm3 ≈ 0.578036672 oz/cu in)
* Avoirdupois ounce per fluid ounce (1 g/cm3 ≈ 1.04317556 oz/US fl oz = 1.04317556 lb/US fl pint)
* Avoirdupois pound per cubic inch (1 g/cm3 ≈ 0.036127292 lb/cu in)
* pound per cubic foot (1 g/cm3 ≈ 62.427961 lb/cu ft)
* pound per cubic yard (1 g/cm3 ≈ 1685.5549 lb/cu yd)
* pound per US liquid gallon (1 g/cm3 ≈ 8.34540445 lb/US gal)
* pound per US bushel (1 g/cm3 ≈ 77.6888513 lb/bu)
* slug per cubic foot

Imperial units differing from the above (as the Imperial gallon and bushel differ from the US units) in practice are rarely used, though found in older documents. The Imperial gallon was based on the concept that an Imperial fluid ounce of water would have a mass of one Avoirdupois ounce, and indeed 1 g/cm3 ≈ 1.00224129 ounces per Imperial fluid ounce = 10.0224129 pounds per Imperial gallon. The density of precious metals could conceivably be based on Troy ounces and pounds, a possible cause of confusion.

Knowing the volume of the unit cell of a crystalline material and its formula weight (in daltons), the density can be calculated. One dalton per cubic ångström is equal to a density of 1.660 539 066 60 g/cm3.

== Measurement ==
A number of techniques as well as standards exist for the measurement of density of materials. Such techniques include the use of a hydrometer (a buoyancy method for liquids), Hydrostatic balance (a buoyancy method for liquids and solids), immersed body method (a buoyancy method for liquids), pycnometer (liquids and solids), air comparison pycnometer (solids), oscillating densitometer (liquids), as well as pour and tap (solids). However, each individual method or technique measures different types of density (e.g. bulk density, skeletal density, etc.), and therefore it is necessary to have an understanding of the type of density being measured as well as the type of material in question.

===Homogeneous materials===
The density at all points of a homogeneous object equals its total mass divided by its total volume. The mass is normally measured with a scale or balance; the volume may be measured directly (from the geometry of the object) or by the displacement of a fluid. To determine the density of a liquid or a gas, a hydrometer, a dasymeter or a Coriolis flow meter may be used, respectively. Similarly, hydrostatic weighing uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine the density of the object.

===Heterogeneous materials===
If the body is not homogeneous, then its density varies between different regions of the object. In that case the density around any given location is determined by calculating the density of a small volume around that location. In the limit of an infinitesimal volume the density of an inhomogeneous object at a point becomes: formula_2, where formula_3 is an elementary volume at position formula_4. The mass of the body then can be expressed as
formula_5

=== Non-compact materials ===
In practice, bulk materials such as sugar, sand, or snow contain voids. Many materials exist in nature as flakes, pellets, or granules.

Voids are regions which contain something other than the considered material. Commonly the void is air, but it could also be vacuum, liquid, solid, or a different gas or gaseous mixture.

The &quot;bulk volume&quot; of a material —inclusive of the void space fraction— is often obtained by a simple measurement (e.g. with a calibrated measuring cup) or geometrically from known dimensions.

Mass divided by bulk volume determines &quot;bulk density&quot;. This is not the same thing as the material volumetric mass density.
To determine the material volumetric mass density, one must first discount the volume of the void fraction. Sometimes this can be determined by geometrical reasoning. For the close-packing of equal spheres the non-void fraction can be at most about 74%. It can also be determined empirically. Some bulk materials, however, such as sand, have a &quot;variable&quot; void fraction which depends on how the material is agitated or poured. It might be loose or compact, with more or less air space depending on handling.

In practice, the void fraction is not necessarily air, or even gaseous. In the case of sand, it could be water, which can be advantageous for measurement as the void fraction for sand saturated in water—once any air bubbles are thoroughly driven out—is potentially more consistent than dry sand measured with an air void.

In the case of non-compact materials, one must also take care in determining the mass of the material sample. If the material is under pressure (commonly ambient air pressure at the earth&#x27;s surface) the determination of mass from a measured sample weight might need to account for buoyancy effects due to the density of the void constituent, depending on how the measurement was conducted. In the case of dry sand, sand is so much denser than air that the buoyancy effect is commonly neglected (less than one part in one thousand).

Mass change upon displacing one void material with another while maintaining constant volume can be used to estimate the void fraction, if the difference in density of the two voids materials is reliably known.

== Changes of density ==
In general, density can be changed by changing either the pressure or the temperature. Increasing the pressure always increases the density of a material. Increasing the temperature generally decreases the density, but there are notable exceptions to this generalization. For example, the density of water increases between its melting point at 0 °C and 4 °C; similar behavior is observed in silicon at low temperatures.

The effect of pressure and temperature on the densities of liquids and solids is small. The compressibility for a typical liquid or solid is 10−6 bar−1 (1 bar = 0.1 MPa) and a typical thermal expansivity is 10−5 K−1. This roughly translates into needing around ten thousand times atmospheric pressure to reduce the volume of a substance by one percent. (Although the pressures needed may be around a thousand times smaller for sandy soil and some clays.) A one percent expansion of volume typically requires a temperature increase on the order of thousands of degrees Celsius.

In contrast, the density of gases is strongly affected by pressure. The density of an ideal gas is
formula_6

where is the molar mass, is the pressure, is the universal gas constant, and is the absolute temperature. This means that the density of an ideal gas can be doubled by doubling the pressure, or by halving the absolute temperature.

In the case of volumic thermal expansion at constant pressure and small intervals of temperature the temperature dependence of density is
formula_7

where formula_8 is the density at a reference temperature, formula_9 is the thermal expansion coefficient of the material at temperatures close to formula_10.

== Density of solutions ==
The density of a solution is the sum of mass (massic) concentrations of the components of that solution.

Mass (massic) concentration of each given component formula_11 in a solution sums to density of the solution,
formula_12

Expressed as a function of the densities of pure components of the mixture and their volume participation, it allows the determination of excess molar volumes:
formula_13
provided that there is no interaction between the components.

Knowing the relation between excess volumes and activity coefficients of the components, one can determine the activity coefficients:
formula_14

<text>David McAlister Barry (born July 3, 1947) is an American author and columnist who wrote a nationally syndicated humor column for the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; from 1983 to 2005. He has also written numerous books of humor and parody, as well as comic novels and children&#x27;s novels. Barry&#x27;s honors include the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary (1988) and the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism (2005).

Barry has defined a sense of humor as &quot;a measurement of the extent to which we realize that we are trapped in a world almost totally devoid of reason. Laughter is how we express the anxiety we feel at this knowledge.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Barry was born in Armonk, New York, where his father, David W. Barry, was a Presbyterian minister. He was educated at Wampus Elementary School, Harold C. Crittenden Junior High School (both in Armonk), and Pleasantville High School, where he was elected &quot;Class Clown&quot; in 1965. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Haverford College in 1969.

As an alumnus of a Quaker-affiliated college, he avoided military service during the Vietnam War by registering as a religious conscientious objector. Barry decided &quot;early on&quot; that he was an atheist. He said, &quot;The problem with writing about religion is that you run the risk of offending sincerely religious people, and then they come after you with machetes.&quot;

==Writing career==
Barry began his journalism career in 1971, working as a general-assignment reporter for the &quot;Daily Local News&quot; in West Chester, Pennsylvania, near his alma mater, Haverford College. He covered local government and civic events and was promoted to City Editor after about two years. He also started writing a weekly humor column for the paper and began to develop his unique style. He remained at the newspaper through 1974. He then worked briefly as a copy editor at the Associated Press&#x27;s Philadelphia bureau before joining Burger Associates, a consulting firm.

At Burger, he taught effective writing to businesspeople. In his own words, he &quot;spent nearly eight years trying to get various businesspersons to...stop writing things like &#x27;Enclosed please find the enclosed enclosures,&#x27; but...eventually realized that it was hopeless.&quot;

In 1981 he wrote a humorous guest column in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; about watching the birth of his son, which attracted the attention of Gene Weingarten, then an editor of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;″s Sunday magazine &quot;Tropic&quot;. Weingarten hired Barry as a humor columnist in 1983. Barry&#x27;s column was syndicated nationally. Barry won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1988 for &quot;his consistently effective use of humor as a device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns.&quot;

Barry&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Big Trouble&quot;, was published in 1999. The book was adapted into a motion picture directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and starring Tim Allen, Rene Russo, and Patrick Warburton, with a cameo by Barry (deleted in post-production). The movie was originally due for release in September 2001 but was postponed following the September 11, 2001, attacks because the story involved terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon onto an airplane. The film was released in April 2002.

In response to a column in which Barry mocked the cities of Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, for calling themselves the &quot;Grand Cities&quot;, Grand Forks named a sewage pumping station after Barry in January 2002. Barry traveled to Grand Forks for the dedication ceremony.

Articles written by Barry have appeared in publications such as &quot;Boating&quot;, &quot;Home Office Computing&quot;, and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, in addition to the &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; inspirational book series. Two of his articles have been included in &quot;The Best American Sports Writing&quot; series. One of his columns was used as the introduction to the book &quot;Pirattitude!: So You Wanna Be a Pirate? Here&#x27;s How!&quot; (), a follow-up to Barry&#x27;s role in publicizing International Talk Like a Pirate Day. His books have frequently appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

On October 31, 2004, Barry announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence of at least a year from his weekly column to spend more time with his family. In December 2005, Barry said in an interview with &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; that he would not resume his weekly column, although he would continue such features as his yearly gift guide, his year-in-review feature, and his blog, as well as an occasional article or column.

In 2005, Barry won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.

==&quot;Dave&#x27;s World&quot; television series==
From 1993 to 1997, CBS broadcast the sitcom &quot;Dave&#x27;s World&quot; based on the books &quot;Dave Barry Turns 40&quot; and &quot;Dave Barry&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. The show starred Harry Anderson as Barry and DeLane Matthews as his wife Beth. In an early episode, Barry appeared in a cameo role. After four seasons, the program was canceled shortly after being moved from its &quot;coveted&quot; Monday night slot to the &quot;Friday night death slot&quot;, so named because of its association with low viewership.

==Music==
During college, Barry was in a band called the Federal Duck (the band actually issued a self-titled album on Musicor Records in 1968, but Barry was no longer in the group by that point). While at the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, he and several of his colleagues created a band called the Urban Professionals, with Barry on lead guitar and vocals. They performed an original song called &quot;The Tupperware Song&quot; at the Tupperware headquarters in Orlando, Florida.

Beginning in 1992, Barry played lead guitar in the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock band made up of published authors. &quot;(Remainder&quot; is a publishing term for a book that does not sell.) The band was founded by Barry&#x27;s sister-in-law, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, for an American Booksellers Association convention, and has also included Stephen King, Amy Tan, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount Jr., Barbara Kingsolver, Matt Groening, and Barry&#x27;s brother Sam, among others. The band&#x27;s members &quot;are not musically skilled, but they are extremely loud,&quot; according to Barry. Several high-profile musicians, including Al Kooper, Warren Zevon, and Roger McGuinn, have performed with the band, and Bruce Springsteen sat in at least once. The band&#x27;s road tour resulted in the book &quot;Mid-Life Confidential: The Rock Bottom Remainders Tour America with Three Chords and an Attitude&quot;. The Rock Bottom Remainders disbanded in 2012 following Goldmark&#x27;s death from breast cancer. They have reunited several times, performing at the Tucson Festival of Books in 2016 and 2018.

==Other activities==
Beginning in 1984, Barry and &quot;Tropic&quot; editors Gene Weingarten and Tom Shroder have organized the Tropic Hunt (now the Herald Hunt), an annual puzzlehunt in Miami. A Washington, D.C., spinoff, the Post Hunt, began in 2008.

Barry has run several mock campaigns for President of the United States, running on a libertarian platform. He has also written for the Libertarian Party&#x27;s national newsletter.

The screen adaptation of Barry&#x27;s book &quot;Dave Barry&#x27;s Complete Guide to Guys&quot; was released in 2005; it is available on DVD.

==Personal life==
Barry married Lois Ann Shelnutt in 1969. He married Beth Lenox in 1976. Barry and Lenox worked together at the &quot;Daily Local News&quot;, where they began their journalism careers on the same day in September 1971; they had one child, Robert, born 1980. Barry and Lenox divorced in 1993. In 1996, Barry married &quot;Miami Herald&quot; sportswriter Michelle Kaufman; they had a daughter, Sophie, in 2000.

Barry&#x27;s father and his youngest brother suffered from alcoholism, and his father died in 1984; his sister Mary Katherine was institutionalized for schizophrenia; and his mother died by suicide in 1987.

Barry has had dogs named Goldie, Earnest, Zippy, and now Lucy. All have been mentioned regularly in Barry&#x27;s columns.

<text>David Lawrence Angell (April 10, 1946 – September 11, 2001) was an American screenwriter and television producer, known for his work in sitcoms. He won multiple Emmy Awards as a &quot;Cheers&quot; writer and as the creator and executive producer of the sitcoms &quot;Wings&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot; with Peter Casey and David Lee. Heading home from their vacation on Cape Cod, Angell and his wife, Lynn, were killed aboard American Airlines Flight 11, the first plane to hit the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks.

==Early life==
Angell was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Henry and Mae (née Cooney) Angell. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature from Providence College. He married Lynn Edwards on August 14, 1971. Soon after Angell entered the U.S. Army upon graduation and served at the Pentagon until 1972. He then moved to Boston and worked as a methods analyst at an engineering company and later at an insurance firm in Rhode Island. His brother, the Most Rev. Kenneth Angell, was a Roman Catholic prelate and Bishop of Burlington, Vermont.

==Career==
Angell moved to Los Angeles in 1977. His first script was sold to the producers of the &quot;Annie Flynn&quot; series. Five years later, he sold his second script, for the sitcom &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;. In 1983, he joined &quot;Cheers&quot; as a staff writer. In 1985, Angell joined forces with Peter Casey and David Lee as &quot;Cheers&quot; supervising producers/writers. The trio received 37 Emmy Award nominations and won 24 Emmy Awards, including the above-mentioned for &quot;Frasier&quot;. They also won an Outstanding Comedy Series Emmy for &quot;Cheers&quot;, in 1989, which Angell, Casey, Lee and the series&#x27; other producers shared, and an Outstanding Writing/Comedy Emmy for &quot;Cheers&quot;, which Angell received in 1984. After working together as producers on &quot;Cheers&quot;, Angell, Casey and Lee formed Grub Street Productions. In 1990, they created and executive-produced the comedy series &quot;Wings&quot;.

==Death==
Angell and his wife Lynn died in the 2001 September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center in Manhattan. They were among the passengers of American Airlines Flight 11, who were all killed when the plane struck the North Tower of the complex.

==Legacy==
The American Screenwriters Association awards the annual David Angell Humanitarian Award to any individual in the entertainment industry who contributes to global well-being through donations of time, expertise or other support to improve the human condition.

In 2004, The Angell Foundation of Los Angeles, California, awarded Providence College a gift of $2 million for the Smith Center for the Arts.

The two-part episode of &quot;Frasier&quot; to air after the attacks, &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; airing on September 25, 2001, ended with the memorial tribute, &quot;In loving memory of our friends Lynn and David Angell&quot;. In &quot;Goodnight, Seattle&quot;, the series finale that aired May 13, 2004, Niles Crane and Daphne Moon&#x27;s son was born, named David in tribute.

At the National September 11 Memorial, Angell and his wife are memorialized at the North Pool, on Panel N-1, along with other passengers from Flight 11.&#x27;

<text>Diedrich Hermann Westermann (24 June 1875 – 31 May 1956) was a German missionary, Africanist, and linguist. He substantially extended and revised the work of Carl Meinhof, his teacher, although he rejected some of Meinhof&#x27;s theories only implicitly. Westermann is seen as one of the founders of modern African linguistics.

He carried out extensive linguistic and anthropological research in the area ranging from Senegal eastwards to the Upper Nile. His linguistic publications cover a wide range of African languages, including the Gbe languages, Nuer, Kpelle, Shilluk, Hausa, and Guang.

Westermann&#x27;s comparative work, begun in 1911, initially brought together much of today&#x27;s Niger–Congo and Nilo-Saharan language phyla under the name Sudanic languages. His most important later publication &quot;Die westlichen Sudansprachen&quot; 1927a divided these into East and West Sudanic languages and laid the basis for what would become Niger–Congo. In this book and a series of associated articles between 1925 and 1928, Westermann both identified a large number of roots that form the basis of our understanding of Niger–Congo and set out the evidence for the coherence of many of the families that constitute it. Much of the classification of African languages associated with Joseph Greenberg actually derives from the work of Westermann.
In 1927 Westermann published a &quot;Practical Orthography of African Languages&quot;, which became later known as the &quot;Westermann script&quot;. Subsequently, he published the influential and oft-reprinted &quot;Practical Phonetics for Students of African Languages&quot; in collaboration with Ida C. Ward (1933).

He was born in Baden near Bremen and also died there.

<doc id="8439" wikidata="Q162940" url="?curid=8439" title="Diacritic">
<text>A diacritic (also diacritical mark, diacritical point, diacritical sign, or accent) is a glyph added to a letter or to a basic glyph. The term derives from the Ancient Greek (, &quot;distinguishing&quot;), from (, &quot;to distinguish&quot;). The word &quot;diacritic&quot; is a noun, though it is sometimes used in an attributive sense, whereas &quot;diacritical&quot; is only an adjective. Some diacritics, such as the acute , grave , and circumflex (all shown above an &#x27;o&#x27;), are often called &quot;accents&quot;. Diacritics may appear above or below a letter or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.

The main use of diacritics in Latin script is to change the sound-values of the letters to which they are added. Historically, English has used the diaeresis diacritic to indicate the correct pronunciation of ambiguous words, such as &quot;coöperate&quot;, without which the &lt;oo&gt; letter sequence could be misinterpreted to be pronounced . Other examples are the acute and grave accents, which can indicate that a vowel is to be pronounced differently than is normal in that position, for example not reduced to /ə/ or silent as in the case of the two uses of the letter e in the noun &quot;résumé&quot; (as opposed to the verb &quot;resume&quot;) and the help sometimes provided in the pronunciation of some words such as &quot;doggèd&quot;, &quot;learnèd&quot;, &quot;blessèd&quot;, and especially words pronounced differently than normal in poetry (for example &quot;movèd&quot;, &quot;breathèd&quot;).

Most other words with diacritics in English are borrowings from languages such as French to better preserve the spelling, such as the diaeresis on and , the acute from , the circumflex in the word , and the cedille in . All these diacritics, however, are frequently omitted in writing, and English is the only major modern European language that does not have diacritics in common usage.

In Latin-script alphabets in other languages, diacritics may distinguish between homonyms, such as the French (&quot;there&quot;) versus (&quot;the&quot;), which are both pronounced . In Gaelic type, a dot over a consonant indicates lenition of the consonant in question. In other writing systems, diacritics may perform other functions. Vowel pointing systems, namely the Arabic harakat and the Hebrew niqqud systems, indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet. The Indic virama ( ् etc.) and the Arabic sukūn (  ) mark the absence of vowels. Cantillation marks indicate prosody. Other uses include the Early Cyrillic titlo stroke ( ◌҃ ) and the Hebrew gershayim (  ), which, respectively, mark abbreviations or acronyms, and Greek diacritical marks, which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as numerals. In Vietnamese and the Hanyu Pinyin official romanization system for Mandarin in China, diacritics are used to mark the tones of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur.

In orthography and collation, a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new, distinct letter or as a letter–diacritic combination. This varies from language to language and may vary from case to case within a language.

In some cases, letters are used as &quot;in-line diacritics&quot;, with the same function as ancillary glyphs, in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them, as in the case of the &quot;h&quot; in the English pronunciation of &quot;sh&quot; and &quot;th&quot;. Such letter combinations are sometimes even collated as a single distinct letter. For example, the spelling sch was traditionally often treated as a separate letter in German. Words with that spelling were listed after all other words spelled with s in card catalogs in the Vienna public libraries, for example (before digitization).

==Types==

Among the types of diacritic used in alphabets based on the Latin script are:
* accents (so called because the acute, grave, and circumflex were originally used to indicate different types of pitch accents in the polytonic transcription of Greek)

** – acute (); for example 
** – grave; for example 
** – circumflex; for example 
** – caron, wedge; for example 
** – double acute; for example 
** – double grave; for example 
* one dot
** – an overdot is used in many orthographies and transcriptions; for example 
** – an underdot is also used in many orthographies and transcriptions; for example 
** – an interpunct is used in the Catalan (l·l)
** – a dot above right is used in Pe̍h-ōe-jī
** tittle, the superscript dot of the modern lowercase Latin and 
*two dots: 
** two overdots () are used for umlaut, diaeresis and others; (for example )
** two underdots () are used in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and the ALA-LC romanization system
** – triangular colon, used in the IPA to mark long vowels (the &quot;dots&quot; are triangular, not circular).
* curves
** – breve; for example 
** – inverted breve; for example 
** – sicilicus, a palaeographic diacritic similar to a caron or breve
** – tilde; for example 
** – titlo
* vertical stroke
** – a subscript vertical stroke is used in IPA to mark syllabicity and in to mark a schwa
** – a superscript vertical stroke is used in Pe̍h-ōe-jī
* macron or horizontal line
** – macron; for example 
** – underbar
* overlays
** – vertical bar through the character
** – slash through the character; for example 
** – crossbar through the character
* ring
** – overring: for example 
* superscript curls
** – apostrophe
** – inverted apostrophe
** – reversed apostrophe
** – hook above ()
** – horn (); for example 
* subscript curls
** – undercomma; for example 
** – cedilla; for example 
** – hook, left or right, sometimes superscript
** – ogonek; for example 
* double marks (over or under two base characters)
** – double breve
** – tie bar or top ligature
** – double circumflex
** – longum
** – double tilde
* double sub/superscript diacritics
** – double cedilla
** – double ogonek
** – double diaeresis
** – double ypogegrammeni

The tilde, dot, comma, titlo, apostrophe, bar, and colon are sometimes diacritical marks, but also have other uses.

Not all diacritics occur adjacent to the letter they modify. In the Wali language of Ghana, for example, an apostrophe indicates a change of vowel quality, but occurs at the beginning of the word, as in the dialects &quot;’Bulengee&quot; and &quot;’Dolimi&quot;. Because of vowel harmony, all vowels in a word are affected, so the scope of the diacritic is the entire word. In abugida scripts, like those used to write Hindi and Thai, diacritics indicate vowels, and may occur above, below, before, after, or around the consonant letter they modify.

The tittle (dot) on the letter or the letter , of the Latin alphabet originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish from the minims (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It first appeared in the 11th century in the sequence &quot;ii&quot; (as in ), then spread to &quot;i&quot; adjacent to &quot;m, n, u&quot;, and finally to all lowercase &quot;i&quot;s. The , originally a variant of &quot;i&quot;, inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today&#x27;s acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of Roman type it was reduced to the round dot we have today.

Several languages of eastern Europe use diacritics on both consonants and vowels, whereas in western Europe digraphs are more often used to change consonant sounds. Most languages in Europe use diacritics on vowels, aside from English where there are typically none (with some exceptions).

==Diacritics specific to non-Latin alphabets==

===Arabic===

* (ئ ؤ إ أ and stand alone ء) : indicates a glottal stop.
* (ــًــٍــٌـ) () symbols: Serve a grammatical role in Arabic. The sign ـً is most commonly written in combination with alif, e.g. .
* (ــّـ) : Gemination (doubling) of consonants.
* (ٱ) : Comes most commonly at the beginning of a word. Indicates a type of that is pronounced only when the letter is read at the beginning of the talk.
* (آ) : A written replacement for a that is followed by an alif, i.e. (). Read as a glottal stop followed by a long , e.g. are written out respectively as . This writing rule does not apply when the alif that follows a is not a part of the stem of the word, e.g. is not written out as as the stem does not have an alif that follows its .
* (ــٰـ) &quot;superscript &quot; (also &quot;short&quot; or &quot;dagger alif&quot;: A replacement for an original alif that is dropped in the writing out of some rare words, e.g. is not written out with the original alif found in the word pronunciation, instead it is written out as .
* (In Arabic: also called ):
** (ــَـ) (a)
** (ــِـ) (i)
** (ــُـ) (u)
** (ــْـ) (no vowel)
* The or vowel points serve two purposes:
** They serve as a phonetic guide. They indicate the presence of short vowels (, , or ) or their absence ().
** At the last letter of a word, the vowel point reflects the inflection case or conjugation mood.
*** For nouns, The is for the nominative, for the accusative, and for the genitive.
*** For verbs, the is for the imperfective, for the perfective, and the is for verbs in the imperative or jussive moods.
* Vowel points or should not be confused with consonant points or () – one, two or three dots written above or below a consonant to distinguish between letters of the same or similar form.

===Greek===
These diacritics are used in addition to the acute, grave, and circumflex accents and the diaeresis:
* – iota subscript () 
* – rough breathing (, ): aspiration
* – smooth (or soft) breathing (, ): lack of aspiration

===Hebrew===
* Niqqud
** – Dagesh
** – Mappiq
** – Rafe
** – Shin dot (at top right corner)
** – Sin dot (at top left corner)
** – Shva
** – Kubutz
** – Holam
** – Kamatz
** – Patakh
** – Segol
** – Tzeire
** – Hiriq

(Cantillation marks do not generally render correctly; refer to Hebrew cantillation#Names and shapes of the ta&#x27;amim for a complete table together with instructions for how to maximize the possibility of viewing them in a web browser.)
* Other
** – Geresh
** – Gershayim

===Korean===

The diacritics 〮 and 〯 , known as Bangjeom (), were used to mark pitch accents in Hangul for Middle Korean. They were written to the left of a syllable in vertical writing and above a syllable in horizontal writing.

===Sanskrit and Indic===


===Syriac===

* A dot above and a dot below a letter represent , transliterated as &quot;a&quot; or &quot;ă&quot;,
* Two diagonally-placed dots above a letter represent , transliterated as &quot;ā&quot; or &quot;â&quot; or &quot;å&quot;,
* Two horizontally-placed dots below a letter represent , transliterated as &quot;e&quot; or &quot;ĕ&quot;; often pronounced and transliterated as &quot;i&quot; in the East Syriac dialect,
* Two diagonally-placed dots below a letter represent , transliterated as &quot;ē&quot;,
* A dot underneath the &quot;Beth&quot; represent a soft sound, transliterated as &quot;v&quot;
* A tilde (~) placed under &quot;Gamel&quot; represent a sound, transliterated as &quot;j&quot;
* The letter &quot;Waw&quot; with a dot below it represents , transliterated as &quot;ū&quot; or &quot;u&quot;,
* The letter &quot;Waw&quot; with a dot above it represents , transliterated as &quot;ō&quot; or &quot;o&quot;,
* The letter &quot;Yōḏ&quot; with a dot beneath it represents , transliterated as &quot;ī&quot; or &quot;i&quot;,
* A tilde (~) under &quot;Kaph&quot; represent a sound, transliterated as &quot;ch&quot; or &quot;č&quot;,
* A semicircle under &quot;Peh&quot; represents an sound, transliterated as &quot;f&quot; or &quot;ph&quot;.

In addition to the above vowel marks, transliteration of Syriac sometimes includes &quot;ə&quot;, &quot;e̊&quot; or superscript &quot;e&quot; (or often nothing at all) to represent an original Aramaic schwa that became lost later on at some point in the development of Syriac. Some transliteration schemes find its inclusion necessary for showing spirantization or for historical reasons.

==Non-alphabetic scripts==
Some non-alphabetic scripts also employ symbols that function essentially as diacritics.
* Non-pure abjads (such as Hebrew and Arabic script) and abugidas use diacritics for denoting vowels. Hebrew and Arabic also indicate consonant doubling and change with diacritics; Hebrew and Devanagari use them for foreign sounds. Devanagari and related abugidas also use a diacritical mark called a &quot;virama&quot; to mark the absence of a vowel. In addition, Devanagari uses the moon-dot &quot;chandrabindu&quot; ( ँ ) for vowel nasalization.
* Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics use several types of diacritics, including the diacritics with alphabetic properties known as Medials and Finals. Although long vowels originally were indicated with a negative line through the Syllabic glyphs, making the glyph appear broken, in the modern forms, a dot above is used to indicate vowel length. In some of the styles, a ring above indicates a long vowel with a [j] off-glide. Another diacritic, the &quot;inner ring&quot; is placed at the glyph&#x27;s head to modify [p] to [f] and [t] to [θ]. Medials such as the &quot;w-dot&quot; placed next to the Syllabics glyph indicates a [w] being placed between the syllable onset consonant and the nucleus vowel. Finals indicate the syllable coda consonant; some of the syllable coda consonants in word medial positions, such as with the &quot;h-tick&quot;, indicate the fortification of the consonant in the syllable following it.
* The Japanese &quot;hiragana&quot; and &quot;katakana&quot; syllabaries use the &quot;dakuten&quot; (◌゛) and &quot;handakuten&quot; (◌゜) (in Japanese: 濁点 and 半濁点) symbols, also known as &quot;nigori&quot; (濁 &quot;muddying&quot;) or &quot;ten-ten&quot; (点々 &quot;dot dot&quot;) and &quot;maru&quot; (丸 &quot;circle&quot;), to indicate voiced consonants or other phonetic changes.
* Emoticons are commonly created with diacritic symbols, especially Japanese emoticons on popular imageboards.

==Alphabetization or collation==

Different languages use different rules to put diacritic characters in alphabetical order. For example, French and Portuguese treat letters with diacritical marks the same as the underlying letter for purposes of ordering and dictionaries. The Scandinavian languages and the Finnish language, by contrast, treat the characters with diacritics , , and as distinct letters of the alphabet, and sort them after . Usually (a-umlaut) and (o-umlaut) [used in Swedish and Finnish] are sorted as equivalent to (ash) and (o-slash) [used in Danish and Norwegian]. Also, &quot;aa&quot;, when used as an alternative spelling to , is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that is frequently sorted as .

Languages that treat accented letters as variants of the underlying letter usually alphabetize words with such symbols immediately after similar unmarked words. For instance, in German where two words differ only by an umlaut, the word without it is sorted first in German dictionaries (e.g. &quot;schon&quot; and then &quot;schön&quot;, or &quot;fallen&quot; and then &quot;fällen&quot;). However, when names are concerned (e.g. in phone books or in author catalogues in libraries), umlauts are often treated as combinations of the vowel with a suffixed ; Austrian phone books now treat characters with umlauts as separate letters (immediately following the underlying vowel).

In Spanish, the grapheme is considered a distinct letter, different from and collated between and , as it denotes a different sound from that of a plain . But the accented vowels , , , , are not separated from the unaccented vowels , , , , , as the acute accent in Spanish only modifies stress within the word or denotes a distinction between homonyms, and does not modify the sound of a letter.

For a comprehensive list of the collating orders in various languages, see Collating sequence.

==Generation with computers==
Modern computer technology was developed mostly in countries that speak Western European languages (particularly English), and many early binary encodings were developed with a bias favoring Englisha language written without diacritical marks. With computer memory and computer storage at premium, early character sets were limited to the Latin alphabet, the ten digits and a few punctuation marks and conventional symbols. The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), first published in 1963, encoded just 95 printable characters. It included just four free-standing diacriticsacute, grave, circumflex and tildewhich were to be used by backspacing and overprinting the base letter. The ISO/IEC 646 standard (1967) defined national variations that replace some American graphemes with precomposed characters (such as , and ), according to languagebut remained limited to 95 printable characters.

Unicode was conceived to solve this problem by assigning every known character its own code; if this code is known, most modern computer systems provide a method to input it. For historical reasons, almost all the letter-with-accent combinations used in European languages were given unique code points and these are called precomposed characters. For other languages, it is usually necessary to use a combining character diacritic together with the desired base letter. Unfortunately, even as of 2024, many applications and web browsers remain unable to operate the combining diacritic concept properly.
Depending on the keyboard layout and keyboard mapping, it is more or less easy to enter letters with diacritics on computers and typewriters. Keyboards used in countries where letters with diacritics are the norm, have keys engraved with the relevant symbols. In other cases, such as when the US international or UK extended mappings are used, the accented letter is created by first pressing the key with the diacritic mark, followed by the letter to place it on. This method is known as the dead key technique, as it produces no output of its own but modifies the output of the key pressed after it.

==Languages with letters containing diacritics==
The following languages have letters with diacritics that are orthographically distinct from those without diacritics.

=== Latin script ===
====Baltic====
:* Latvian has the following letters: , , , , , , , , , , 
:* Lithuanian. In general usage, where letters appear with the caron (, and ), they are considered as separate letters from , or and collated separately; letters with the ogonek (, , and ), the macron () and the overdot () are considered as separate letters as well, but not given a unique collation order.

====Celtic====
:* Welsh uses the circumflex, diaeresis, acute, and grave accents on its seven vowels , , , , , , (hence the composites , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ). However all except the circumflex (which is used as a macron) are fairly rare.
:* Following spelling reforms since the 1970s, Scottish Gaelic uses graves only, which can be used on any vowel (, , , , ). Formerly acute accents could be used on , and , which were used to indicate a specific vowel quality. With the elimination of these accents, the new orthography relies on the reader having prior knowledge of pronunciation of a given word.
:* Manx uses the cedilla diacritic combined with h to give the digraph (pronounced ) to mark the distinction between it and the digraph (pronounced or ). Other diacritics used in Manx included the circumflex and diaeresis, as in , , , etc. to mark the distinction between two similarly spelled words but with slightly differing pronunciation.
:* Irish uses only acute accents to mark long vowels, following the 1948 spelling reform. Lenition is indicated using an overdot in Gaelic type (,, , , , , ); in Roman type, a suffixed is used. Thus, is equivalent to .
:* Breton does not have a single orthography (spelling system), but uses diacritics for a number of purposes. The diaeresis is used to mark that two vowels are pronounced separately and not as a diphthong/digraph. The circumflex is used to mark long vowels, but usually only when the vowel length is not predictable by phonology. Nasalization of vowels may be marked with a tilde, or following the vowel with the letter . The plural suffix -où is used as a unified spelling to represent a suffix with a number of pronunciations in different dialects, and to distinguish this suffix from the digraph which is pronounced as . An apostrophe is used to distinguish , pronounced as the digraph is used in other Celtic languages, from the French-influenced digraph ch, pronounced .

====Finno-Ugric====
:* Estonian has a distinct letter , which contains a tilde. Estonian vowels with double-dot diacritics , , are similar to German, but these are also distinct letters, unlike German umlauted letters. All four have their own place in the alphabet, between and . Carons in or appear only in foreign proper names and loanwords. Also these are distinct letters, placed in the alphabet between &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;.
:* Finnish uses double-dotted vowels ( and ). As in Swedish and Estonian, these are regarded as individual letters, rather than &#x27;vowel + diacritic&#x27; combinations (as happens in German). It also uses the characters , and in foreign names and loanwords. In the Finnish and Swedish alphabets, , and collate as separate letters after , the others as variants of their base letter.
:* Hungarian uses the double-dot, the acute and double acute diacritics (the last is unique to Hungarian): (, ), (, , , , ) and (, ). The acute accent indicates the long form of a vowel (in case of /, /, /) while the double acute performs the same function for and . The acute accent can also indicate a different sound (more open, as in case of /, /). Both long and short forms of the vowels are listed separately in the Hungarian alphabet, but members of the pairs /, /, /, /, /, / and / are collated in dictionaries as the same letter.
:* Livonian has the following letters: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .

====Germanic====
:* German uses the two-dots diacritic (): letters , , , used to indicate the fronting of back vowels (see umlaut (linguistics)).
:* Dutch uses acute, circumflex, grave and two-dots diacritics with most vowels and cedilla with c, as in French. This results in , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . This is mostly on words (and names) originating from French (like &quot;crème, café, gêne, façade&quot;). The acute accent is also used to stress the vowel (like &quot;één&quot;). The two-dots diacritic is used as a linguistic diaeresis (a vowel hiatus) that splits the two vowels, e.g., &quot;reële, reünie, coördinatie&quot;), rather than to indicate a linguistic as used in German.
:* Afrikaans uses 16 additional vowel forms, both uppercase and lowercase: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . 
:* Faroese uses acutes and some additional letters. All are considered separate letters and have their own place in the alphabet: , , , , and .
:* Icelandic uses acutes and other additional letters. All are considered separate letters, and have their own place in the alphabet: , , , , , and .
:* Danish and Norwegian use additional characters like the o-slash and the a-overring . These letters come after and in the order , . Historically, the has developed from a ligature by writing a small superscript over a lowercase ; if an character is unavailable, some Scandinavian languages allow the substitution of a doubled &quot;a&quot;, thus . The Scandinavian languages collate these letters after , but have different national collation standards.
:* Swedish uses a-diaeresis () and o-diaeresis () in the place of () and slashed o () in addition to the a-overring (). Historically, the two-dots diacritic for the Swedish letters and developed from a small Gothic written above the letters. These letters are collated after , in the order , , .

====Romance====
:* In Asturian, Galician and Spanish, the character is a letter and collated between &quot;n&quot; and &quot;o&quot;.
:* Asturian uses an underdot: (lower case, ), and (lower case )
:* Catalan uses the acute accent , , , , the grave accent , , , the diaeresis , , the cedilla , and the interpunct . 
::* In Valencian, the circumflex , , , , may also be used.
:* Corsican uses the following in its alphabet: /, /, /, /, /.
:* French uses four diacritics, appearing on vowels (circumflex, acute, grave, diaeresis) and the cedilla appearing in .
:* Italian uses two diacritics, appearing on vowels (acute, grave)
:* Leonese: could use or .
:* Portuguese uses a tilde with the vowels and and a cedilla with c.
:* Romanian uses a breve on the letter &quot;a&quot; () to indicate the sound schwa , as well as a circumflex over the letters &quot;a&quot; () and &quot;i&quot; () for the sound . Romanian also writes a comma below the letters &quot;s&quot; () and &quot;t&quot; () to represent the sounds and , respectively. These characters are collated after their non-diacritic equivalent.
:* Spanish uses acute accents (, , , , ) to indicate stress falling on a different syllable than the one it would fall on based on default rules, and to distinguish certain one-syllable homonyms (e.g. (masculine singular definite article) and [he]). The acute accent is also used to break up sequences of vowels that would normally be pronouced as a diphthong into two syllables, as in the word . Diaeresis is used on u only, to distinguish the combinations from , e.g. . The tilde on is not considered a diacritic as is considered a distinct letter from , not a mutated form of it.

====Slavic====
:* Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet, used in Croatian and latinized Serbian, has the symbols , , , and , which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. It also has one digraph including a diacritic, &quot;dž&quot;, which is also alphabetized independently, and follows and precedes in the alphabetical order.
:* The Czech alphabet uses the acute (á é í ó ú ý), caron (č ď ě ň ř š ť ž), and for one letter (ů) the ring. (In ď and ť the caron is modified to look rather like an apostrophe.) Letter with caron are considered separate letters, whereas vowels are considered only as longer variants of the unaccented letters. Acute does not affect alphabetical order, letters with caron are ordered after original counterparts.
:* Polish has the following letters: ą ć ę ł ń ó ś ź ż. These are considered to be separate letters: each of them is placed in the alphabet immediately after its Latin counterpart (e.g. between and ), and are placed after in that order.
:* The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet has no diacritics, instead it has a grapheme (glyph) for every letter of its Latin counterpart (including Latin letters with diacritics and the digraphs dž, &quot;lj&quot; and &quot;nj&quot;).
:* The Slovak alphabet uses the acute (á é í ó ú ý ĺ ŕ), caron (č ď ľ ň š ť ž dž), umlaut (ä) and circumflex accent (ô). All of those are considered separate letters and are placed directly after the original counterpart in the alphabet.
:* The basic Slovenian alphabet has the symbols , , and , which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. Letters with a caron are placed right after the letters as written without the diacritic. The letter (&#x27;d with bar&#x27;) may be used in non-transliterated foreign words, particularly names, and is placed after and before .

====Turkic====
:*Azerbaijani includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters Ç, Ğ, I, İ, Ö, Ş and Ü.
:* Crimean Tatar includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters Ç, Ğ, I, İ, Ö, Ş and Ü. Unlike Turkish, Crimean Tatar also has the letter Ñ.
:* Gagauz includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters Ç, Ğ, I, İ, Ö and Ü. Unlike Turkish, Gagauz also has the letters Ä, Ê Ș and Ț. Ș and Ț are derived from the Romanian alphabet for the same sounds. Sometime the Turkish Ş may be used instead of Ș.
:* Turkish uses a with a breve (), two letters with two dots ( and , representing two rounded front vowels), two letters with a cedilla ( and , representing the affricate and the fricative ), and also possesses a dotted capital (and a dotless lowercase representing a high unrounded back vowel). In Turkish each of these are separate letters, rather than versions of other letters, where dotted capital and lower case are the same letter, as are dotless capital and lowercase . Typographically, and are sometimes rendered with an underdot, as in . The new Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, and Gagauz alphabets are based on the Turkish alphabet and its same diacriticized letters, with some additions.
:* Turkmen includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters Ç, Ö, Ş and Ü. In addition, Turkmen uses A with diaeresis (&quot;Ä&quot;) to represent , N with caron () to represent the velar nasal , Y with acute () to represent the palatal approximant , and Z with caron () to represent .

====Other====
:*Albanian has two special letters Ç and Ë upper and lowercase. They are placed next to the most similar letters in the alphabet, c and e correspondingly.
:* Esperanto has the symbols &quot;ŭ&quot;, &quot;ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ&quot; and &quot;ŝ&quot;, which are included in the alphabet, and considered separate letters.
:* Filipino also has the character &quot;ñ&quot; as a letter and is collated between n and o.
:* Modern Greenlandic does not use any diacritics, although &quot;ø&quot; and &quot;å&quot; are used to spell loanwords, especially from Danish and English. From 1851 until 1973, Greenlandic was written in an alphabet invented by Samuel Kleinschmidt, where long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by diacritics on vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name &quot;Kalaallit Nunaat&quot; was spelled &quot;Kalâdlit Nunât&quot;. This scheme uses the circumflex (◌̂) to indicate a long vowel (e.g. ; modern: ), an acute accent (◌́) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (i.e. ; modern: ) and, finally, a tilde (◌̃) or a grave accent (◌̀), depending on the author, indicates vowel length and gemination of the following consonant (e.g. ; modern: ). , used only before , are now written in Greenlandic.
:* Hawaiian uses the kahakō (macron) over vowels, although there is some disagreement over considering them as individual letters. The kahakō over a vowel can completely change the meaning of a word that is spelled the same but without the kahakō.
:*Kurdish uses the symbols Ç, Ê, Î, Ş and Û with other 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.
:*Lakota alphabet uses the caron for the letters &quot;č&quot;, &quot;ȟ&quot;, &quot;ǧ&quot;, &quot;š&quot;, and &quot;ž&quot;. It also uses the acute accent for stressed vowels á, é, í, ó, ú, áŋ, íŋ, úŋ.
:*Malay uses some diacritics such as &quot;á, ā, ç, í, ñ, ó, š, ú&quot;. Uses of diacritics was continued until late 19th century except &quot;ā&quot; and &quot;ē&quot;.
:*Maltese uses a C, G, and Z with a dot over them (Ċ, Ġ, Ż), and also has an H with an extra horizontal bar. For uppercase H, the extra bar is written slightly above the usual bar. For lowercase H, the extra bar is written crossing the vertical, like a &quot;t&quot;, and not touching the lower part (Ħ, ħ). The above characters are considered separate letters. The letter &#x27;c&#x27; without a dot has fallen out of use due to redundancy. &#x27;Ċ&#x27; is pronounced like the English &#x27;ch&#x27; and &#x27;k&#x27; is used as a hard c as in &#x27;cat&#x27;. &#x27;Ż&#x27; is pronounced just like the English &#x27;Z&#x27; as in &#x27;Zebra&#x27;, while &#x27;Z&#x27; is used to make the sound of &#x27;ts&#x27; in English (like &#x27;tsunami&#x27; or &#x27;maths&#x27;). &#x27;Ġ&#x27; is used as a soft &#x27;G&#x27; like in &#x27;geometry&#x27;, while the &#x27;G&#x27; sounds like a hard &#x27;G&#x27; like in &#x27;log&#x27;. The digraph &#x27;għ&#x27; (called &quot;għajn&quot; after the Arabic letter name &quot;ʻayn&quot; for غ) is considered separate, and sometimes ordered after &#x27;g&#x27;, whilst in other volumes it is placed between &#x27;n&#x27; and &#x27;o&#x27; (the Latin letter &#x27;o&#x27; originally evolved from the shape of Phoenician &quot;ʻayin&quot;, which was traditionally collated after Phoenician &quot;nūn&quot;).
:* The romanization of Syriac uses the altered letters of. &quot;Ā, Č, Ḏ, Ē, Ë, Ġ, Ḥ, Ō, Š, Ṣ, Ṭ, Ū, Ž&quot; alongside the 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.
:*Vietnamese uses the horn diacritic for the letters &quot;ơ&quot; and &quot;ư&quot;; the circumflex for the letters &quot;â&quot;, &quot;ê&quot;, and &quot;ô&quot;; the breve for the letter &quot;ă&quot;; and a bar through the letter &quot;đ&quot;. Separately, it also has á, à, ả, ã and ạ, the five tones used for vowels besides the flat tone &#x27;a&#x27;.

===Cyrillic letters===

:*Belarusian and Uzbek Cyrillic have a letter .
:* Belarusian, Bulgarian, Russian and Ukrainian have the letter .
:* Belarusian and Russian have the letter . In Russian, this letter is usually replaced by , although it has a different pronunciation. The use of instead of does not affect the pronunciation. &quot;Ё&quot; is always used in children&#x27;s books and in dictionaries. A minimal pair is все (&quot;vs&#x27;e&quot;, &quot;everybody&quot; pl.) and всё (&quot;vs&#x27;o&quot;, &quot;everything&quot; n. sg.). In Belarusian the replacement by is a mistake; in Russian, it is permissible to use either or for but the former is more common in everyday writing (as opposed to instructional or juvenile writing).
:* The Cyrillic Ukrainian alphabet has the letters , and . Ukrainian Latynka has many more.
:* Macedonian has the letters and .
:* In Bulgarian and Macedonian the possessive pronoun ѝ (&quot;ì&quot;, &quot;her&quot;) is spelled with a grave accent in order to distinguish it from the conjunction и (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;and&quot;).
:* The acute accent above any vowel in Cyrillic alphabets is used in dictionaries, books for children and foreign learners to indicate the word stress, it also can be used for disambiguation of similarly spelled words with different lexical stresses.

==Diacritics that do not produce new letters==
===English===

English is one of the few European languages that does not have many words that contain diacritical marks. Instead, digraphs are the main way the Modern English alphabet adapts the Latin to its phonemes. Exceptions are unassimilated foreign loanwords, including borrowings from French (and, increasingly, Spanish, like &quot;jalapeño&quot; and &quot;piñata&quot;); however, the diacritic is also sometimes omitted from such words. Loanwords that frequently appear with the diacritic in English include &quot;café&quot;, &quot;résumé&quot; or &quot;resumé&quot; (a usage that helps distinguish it from the verb &quot;resume&quot;), &quot;soufflé&quot;, and &quot;naïveté&quot; (see &quot;English terms with diacritical marks&quot;). In older practice (and even among some orthographically conservative modern writers), one may see examples such as &quot;élite&quot;, &quot;mêlée&quot; and &quot;rôle.&quot;

English speakers and writers once used the diaeresis more often than now in words such as &quot;coöperation&quot; (from Fr. &quot;coopération&quot;), &quot;zoölogy&quot; (from Grk. &quot;zoologia&quot;), and &quot;seeër&quot; (now more commonly &quot;see-er &quot;or simply&quot; seer&quot;) as a way of indicating that adjacent vowels belonged to separate syllables, but this practice has become far less common. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine is a major publication that continues to use the diaeresis in place of a hyphen for clarity and economy of space.

A few English words, often when used out of context, especially in isolation, can only be distinguished from other words of the same spelling by using a diacritic or modified letter. These include &quot;exposé&quot;, &quot;lamé&quot;, &quot;maté&quot;, &quot;öre&quot;, &quot;øre&quot;, &quot;résumé&quot; and &quot;rosé.&quot; In a few words, diacritics that did not exist in the original have been added for disambiguation, as in &quot;maté&quot; (&quot;from Sp. and Port.&quot; mate)&quot;, saké&quot; (&quot;the standard Romanization of the Japanese has no accent mark&quot;)&quot;, and&quot; Malé (&quot;from Dhivehi މާލެ&quot;)&quot;,&quot; to clearly distinguish them from the English words &quot;mate, sake,&quot; and &quot;male.&quot;

The acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (&quot;rébel&quot; vs. &quot;rebél&quot;) or nonstandard for metrical reasons (&quot;caléndar&quot;), the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (&quot;warnèd,&quot; &quot;parlìament&quot;).

In certain personal names such as &quot;Renée&quot; and &quot;Zoë&quot;, often two spellings exist, and the person&#x27;s own preference will be known only to those close to them. Even when the name of a person is spelled with a diacritic, like &quot;Charlotte Brontë&quot;, this may be dropped in English-language articles, and even in official documents such as passports, due either to carelessness, the typist not knowing how to enter letters with diacritical marks, or technical reasons (California, for example, does not allow names with diacritics, as the computer system cannot process such characters). They also appear in some worldwide company names and/or trademarks, such as &quot;Nestlé&quot; and &quot;Citroën&quot;.

===Other languages===
The following languages have letter-diacritic combinations that are not considered independent letters.
* Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels that are pronounced separately and not as one would expect where they occur together, for example &quot;voel&quot; (to feel) as opposed to &quot;voël&quot; (bird). The circumflex is used in &quot;ê, î, ô&quot; and &quot;û&quot; generally to indicate long close-mid, as opposed to open-mid vowels, for example in the words &quot;wêreld&quot; (world) and &quot;môre&quot; (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis in the same way as underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example &quot;Dit is jóú boek&quot; (It is your book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example &quot;appel&quot; (apple) and &quot;appèl&quot; (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are in the sayings &quot;òf... òf&quot; (either... or) and &quot;nòg... nòg&quot; (neither... nor) to distinguish them from &quot;of&quot; (or) and &quot;nog&quot; (again, still).
* Aymara uses a diacritical horn over &quot;p, q, t, k, ch&quot;.
* Catalan has the following composite characters: &quot;à, ç, é, è, í, ï, ó, ò, ú, ü, l·l&quot;. The acute and the grave indicate stress and vowel height, the cedilla marks the result of a historical palatalization, the diaeresis indicates either a hiatus, or that the letter &quot;u&quot; is pronounced when the graphemes &quot;gü, qü&quot; are followed by &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, the interpunct (·) distinguishes the different values of &quot;&quot;.
* Some orthographies of Cornish such as Kernowek Standard and Unified Cornish use diacritics, while others such as Kernewek Kemmyn and the Standard Written Form do not (or only use them optionally in teaching materials).
* Dutch uses the diaeresis. For example, in &quot;ruïne&quot; it means that the &quot;u&quot; and the &quot;i&quot; are separately pronounced in their usual way, and not in the way that the combination &quot;ui&quot; is normally pronounced. Thus it works as a separation sign and not as an indication for an alternative version of the &quot;i&quot;. Diacritics can be used for emphasis (&quot;érg koud&quot; for &quot;very&quot; cold) or for disambiguation between a number of words that are spelled the same when context does not indicate the correct meaning (&quot;één appel&quot; = one apple, &quot;een appel&quot; = an apple; &quot;vóórkomen&quot; = to occur, &quot;voorkómen&quot; = to prevent). Grave and acute accents are used on a very small number of words, mostly loanwords. The ç also appears in some loanwords.
* Faroese. Non-Faroese accented letters are not added to the Faroese alphabet. These include &quot;é&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;, &quot;ü&quot;, &quot;å&quot; and recently also letters like &quot;š&quot;, &quot;ł&quot;, and &quot;ć&quot;.
* Filipino has the following composite characters: &quot;á, à, â, é, è, ê, í, ì, î, ó, ò, ô, ú, ù, û&quot;. Everyday use of diacritics for Filipino is, however, uncommon, and meant only to distinguish between homonyms between a word with the usual penultimate stress and one with a different stress placement. This aids both comprehension and pronunciation if both are relatively adjacent in a text, or if a word is itself ambiguous in meaning. The letter &quot;ñ&quot; (&quot;eñe&quot;) is not a &quot;n&quot; with a diacritic, but rather collated as a separate letter, one of eight borrowed from Spanish. Diacritics appear in Spanish loanwords and names observing Spanish orthography rules.
* Finnish. Carons in &quot;š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot; appear only in foreign proper names and loanwords, but may be substituted with &quot;sh&quot; or &quot;zh&quot; if and only if it is technically impossible to produce accented letters in the medium. Contrary to Estonian, &quot;š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot; are not considered distinct letters in Finnish.
* French uses five diacritics. The grave (&quot;accent grave&quot;) marks the sound when over an e, as in &quot;père&quot; (&quot;father&quot;) or is used to distinguish words that are otherwise homographs such as &quot;a&quot;/&quot;à&quot; (&quot;has&quot;/&quot;to&quot;) or &quot;ou&quot;/&quot;où&quot; (&quot;or&quot;/&quot;where&quot;). The acute (&quot;accent aigu&quot;) is only used in &quot;é&quot;, modifying the &quot;e&quot; to make the sound , as in &quot;étoile&quot; (&quot;star&quot;). The circumflex (&quot;accent circonflexe&quot;) generally denotes that an S once followed the vowel in Old French or Latin, as in &quot;fête&quot; (&quot;party&quot;), the Old French being &quot;feste&quot; and the Latin being &quot;festum&quot;. Whether the circumflex modifies the vowel&#x27;s pronunciation depends on the dialect and the vowel. The cedilla (&quot;cédille&quot;) indicates that a normally hard &quot;c&quot; (before the vowels &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;) is to be pronounced , as in &quot;ça&quot; (&quot;that&quot;). The diaeresis diacritic () indicates that two adjacent vowels that would normally be pronounced as one are to be pronounced separately, as in &quot;Noël&quot; (&quot;Christmas&quot;).
* Galician vowels can bear an acute (&quot;á, é, í, ó, ú&quot;) to indicate stress or difference between two otherwise same written words (&quot;é&quot;, &#x27;is&#x27; vs. &quot;e&quot;, &#x27;and&#x27;), but the diaeresis is only used with &quot;ï&quot; and &quot;ü&quot; to show two separate vowel sounds in pronunciation. Only in foreign words may Galician use other diacritics such as &quot;ç&quot; (common during the Middle Ages), &quot;ê&quot;, or &quot;à&quot;.
* German uses the three umlauted characters &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot; and &quot;ü&quot;. These diacritics indicate vowel changes. For instance, the word &quot;Ofen&quot; &quot;oven&quot; has the plural &quot;Öfen&quot; . The mark originated as a superscript &quot;e&quot;; a handwritten blackletter &quot;e&quot; resembles two parallel vertical lines, like a diaeresis. Due to this history, &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot; and &quot;ü&quot; can be written as &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;oe&quot; and &quot;ue&quot; respectively, if the umlaut letters are not available.
* Hebrew has many various diacritic marks known as &quot;niqqud&quot; that are used above and below script to represent vowels. These must be distinguished from cantillation, which are keys to pronunciation and syntax.
* The International Phonetic Alphabet uses diacritic symbols and characters to indicate phonetic features or secondary articulations.
* Irish uses the acute to indicate that a vowel is long: &quot;á&quot;, &quot;é&quot;, &quot;í&quot;, &quot;ó&quot;, &quot;ú&quot;. It is known as &quot;síneadh fada&quot; &quot;long sign&quot; or simply &quot;fada&quot; &quot;long&quot; in Irish. In the older Gaelic type, overdots are used to indicate lenition of a consonant: &quot;ḃ&quot;, &quot;ċ&quot;, &quot;ḋ&quot;, &quot;ḟ&quot;, &quot;ġ&quot;, &quot;ṁ&quot;, &quot;ṗ&quot;, &quot;ṡ&quot;, &quot;ṫ&quot;.
* Italian mainly has the acute and the grave (&quot;à&quot;, &quot;è&quot;/&quot;é&quot;, &quot;ì&quot;, &quot;ò&quot;/&quot;ó&quot;, &quot;ù&quot;), typically to indicate a stressed syllable that would not be stressed under the normal rules of pronunciation but sometimes also to distinguish between words that are otherwise spelled the same way (e.g. &quot;e&quot;, and; &quot;è&quot;, is). Despite its rare use, Italian orthography allows the circumflex (î) too, in two cases: it can be found in old literary context (roughly up to 19th century) to signal a syncope (fêro→fecero, they did), or in modern Italian to signal the contraction of ″-ii″ due to the plural ending -i whereas the root ends with another -i; e.g., s. demonio, p. demonii→demonî; in this case the circumflex also signals that the word intended is not demoni, plural of &quot;demone&quot; by shifting the accent (demònî, &quot;devils&quot;; dèmoni, &quot;demons&quot;).
* Lithuanian uses the acute, grave and tilde in dictionaries to indicate stress types in the language&#x27;s pitch accent system.
* Maltese also uses the grave on its vowels to indicate stress at the end of a word with two syllables or more:– lowercase letters: à, è, ì, ò, ù; capital letters: À, È, Ì, Ò, Ù
* Māori makes use of macrons to mark long vowels.
* Occitan has the following composite characters: &quot;á, à, ç, é, è, í, ï, ó, ò, ú, ü, n·h, s·h&quot;. The acute and the grave indicate stress and vowel height, the cedilla marks the result of a historical palatalization, the diaeresis indicates either a hiatus, or that the letter &quot;u&quot; is pronounced when the graphemes &quot;gü, qü&quot; are followed by &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, and the interpunct (·) distinguishes the different values of &quot;nh/n·h&quot; and &quot;sh/s·h&quot; (i.e., that the letters are supposed to be pronounced separately, not combined into &quot;ny&quot; and &quot;sh&quot;).
* Portuguese has the following composite characters: &quot;à, á, â, ã, ç, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú&quot;. The acute and the circumflex indicate stress and vowel height, the grave indicates crasis, the tilde represents nasalization, and the cedilla marks the result of a historical lenition.
* Acutes are also used in Slavic language dictionaries and textbooks to indicate lexical stress, placed over the vowel of the stressed syllable. This can also serve to disambiguate meaning (e.g., in Russian писа́ть (&quot;pisáť&quot;) means &quot;to write&quot;, but пи́сать (&quot;písať&quot;) means &quot;to piss&quot;), or &quot;бо́льшая часть&quot; (the biggest part) vs &quot;больша́я часть&quot; (the big part).
* Spanish uses the acute and the diaeresis. The acute is used on a vowel in a stressed syllable in words with irregular stress patterns. It can also be used to &quot;break up&quot; a diphthong as in &quot;tío&quot; (pronounced , rather than as it would be without the accent). Moreover, the acute can be used to distinguish words that otherwise are spelled alike, such as &quot;si&quot; (&quot;if&quot;) and &quot;sí&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;), and also to distinguish interrogative and exclamatory pronouns from homophones with a different grammatical function, such as &quot;donde/¿dónde?&quot; (&quot;where&quot;/&quot;where?&quot;) or &quot;como/¿cómo?&quot; (&quot;as&quot;/&quot;how?&quot;). The acute may also be used to avoid typographical ambiguity, as in &quot;1 ó 2&quot; (&quot;1 or 2&quot;; without the acute this might be interpreted as &quot;1 0 2&quot;. The diaeresis is used only over &quot;u&quot; (&quot;ü&quot;) for it to be pronounced in the combinations &quot;gue&quot; and &quot;gui,&quot; where &quot;u&quot; is normally silent, for example &quot;ambigüedad.&quot; In poetry, the diaeresis may be used on &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; as a way to force a hiatus. As foreshadowed above, in nasal &quot;ñ&quot; the tilde (squiggle) is not considered a diacritic sign at all, but a composite part of a distinct glyph, with its own chapter in the dictionary: a glyph that denotes the 15th letter of the Spanish alphabet.
* Swedish uses the acute to show non-standard stress, for example in (café) and (résumé). This occasionally helps resolve ambiguities, such as &quot;ide&quot; (hibernation) versus &quot;idé&quot; (idea). In these words, the acute is not optional. Some proper names use non-standard diacritics, such as Carolina Klüft and Staël von Holstein. For foreign loanwords the original accents are strongly recommended, unless the word has been infused into the language, in which case they are optional. Hence &quot;crème fraîche&quot; but &quot;ampere&quot;. Swedish also has the letters &quot;å&quot;, &quot;ä&quot;, and &quot;ö&quot;, but these are considered distinct letters, not &quot;a&quot; and &quot;o&quot; with diacritics.
* Tamil does not have any diacritics in itself, but uses the Arabic numerals 2, 3 and 4 as diacritics to represent aspirated, voiced, and voiced-aspirated consonants when Tamil script is used to write long passages in Sanskrit.
* Thai has its own system of diacritics derived from Indian numerals, which denote different tones.
* Vietnamese uses the acute (&quot;dấu sắc&quot;), the grave (&quot;dấu huyền&quot;), the tilde (&quot;dấu ngã&quot;), the underdot (&quot;dấu nặng&quot;) and the hook above (&quot;dấu hỏi&quot;) on vowels as tone indicators.
* Welsh uses the circumflex, diaeresis, acute, and grave on its seven vowels &quot;a, e, i, o, u, w, y&quot;. The most common is the circumflex (which it calls &quot;to bach&quot;, meaning &quot;little roof&quot;, or &quot;acen grom&quot; &quot;crooked accent&quot;, or &quot;hirnod&quot; &quot;long sign&quot;) to denote a long vowel, usually to disambiguate it from a similar word with a short vowel or a semivowel. The rarer grave accent has the opposite effect, shortening vowel sounds that would usually be pronounced long. The acute accent and diaeresis are also occasionally used, to denote stress and vowel separation respectively. The &quot;w&quot;-circumflex and the &quot;y&quot;-circumflex are among the most commonly accented characters in Welsh, but unusual in languages generally, and were until recently very hard to obtain in word-processed and HTML documents.

==Transliteration==
Several languages that are not written with the Roman alphabet are transliterated, or romanized, using diacritics. Examples:
* Arabic has several romanisations, depending on the type of the application, region, intended audience, country, etc. many of them extensively use diacritics, e.g., some methods use an underdot for rendering emphatic consonants (ṣ, ṭ, ḍ, ẓ, ḥ). The macron is often used to render long vowels. š is often used for , ġ for .
* Chinese has several romanizations that use the umlaut, but only on &quot;u&quot; (&quot;ü&quot;). In Hanyu Pinyin, the four tones of Mandarin Chinese are denoted by the macron (first tone), acute (second tone), caron (third tone) and grave (fourth tone) diacritics. Example: &quot;ā, á, ǎ, à&quot;.
* Romanized Japanese (Rōmaji) occasionally uses macrons to mark long vowels. The Hepburn romanization system uses macrons to mark long vowels, and the Kunrei-shiki and Nihon-shiki systems use a circumflex.
* Sanskrit, as well as many of its descendants, like Hindi and Bengali, uses a lossless romanization system, IAST. This includes several letters with diacritical markings, such as the macron (ā, ī, ū), over- and underdots (ṛ, ḥ, ṃ, ṇ, ṣ, ṭ, ḍ) as well as a few others (ś, ñ).

==Limits==

===Orthographic===
Possibly the greatest number of combining diacritics &quot;required&quot; to compose a valid character in any Unicode language is 8, for the &quot;well-known grapheme cluster in Tibetan and Ranjana scripts&quot; or .

It consists of

An example of rendering, may be broken depending on browser:

===Unorthographic/ornamental===
Some users have explored the limits of rendering in web browsers and other software by &quot;decorating&quot; words with excessive nonsensical diacritics per character to produce so-called Zalgo text.

<doc id="8443" wikidata="Q189388" url="?curid=8443" title="Didgeridoo">
<text>The didgeridoo (), also spelt didjeridu, among other variants, is a wind instrument, played with vibrating lips to produce a continuous drone while using a special breathing technique called circular breathing. The didgeridoo was developed by Aboriginal peoples of northern Australia at least 1,000 years ago, and is now in use around the world, though still most strongly associated with Indigenous Australian music. In the Yolŋu languages of the indigenous people of northeast Arnhem Land the name for the instrument is the yiḏaki, or more recently by some, mandapul. In the Bininj Kunwok language of West Arnhem Land it is known as mako.

A didgeridoo is usually cylindrical or conical, and can measure anywhere from long. Most are around long. Generally, the longer the instrument, the lower its pitch or key. Flared instruments play a higher pitch than unflared instruments of the same length.

==History==
There are no reliable sources of the exact age of the didgeridoo. Archaeological studies suggest that people of the Kakadu region in Northern Australia have been using the didgeridoo for less than 1,000 years, based on the dating of rock art paintings. A clear rock painting in Ginga Wardelirrhmeng, on the northern edge of the Arnhem Land plateau, from the freshwater period (that had begun 1500 years ago) shows a didgeridoo player and two song-men participating in an Ubarr ceremony. It is thus thought that it was developed by Aboriginal peoples of northern Australia, possibly in Arnhem Land.

T. B. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Narrative of a Voyage Round the World&quot; (1835) includes a drawing of an Aboriginal man from Raffles Bay on the Cobourg Peninsula (about east of Darwin) playing the instrument. Others observed such an instrument in the same area, made of bamboo and about long. In 1893, English palaeontologist Robert Etheridge, Junior observed the use of &quot;three very curious trumpets&quot; made of bamboo in northern Australia. There were then two native species of bamboo growing along the Adelaide River, Northern Territory&quot;.

According to A. P. Elkin, in 1938, the instrument was &quot;only known in the eastern Kimberley [region in Western Australia] and the northern third of the Northern Territory&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;didgeridoo&quot; is not of Aboriginal Australian linguistic origin and is considered to be an onomatopoetic word. The earliest occurrences of the word in print include a 1908 edition of the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; referring to a did-gery-do&#x27; (hollow bamboo)&quot;, a 1914 edition of &quot;The Northern Territory Times and Gazette&quot;, and a 1919 issue of &quot;Smith&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, in which it was referred to as a &quot;didjerry&quot; and was said to produce the sound &quot;didjerry, didjerry, didjerry and so on ad infinitum&quot;.

A rival explanation, that &quot;didgeridoo&quot; is a corruption of the Irish phrase or Scottish Gaelic , is controversial. Irish or , and Scottish Gaelic , are nouns that, depending on the context, may mean &quot;trumpeter&quot;, &quot;hummer&quot;, &quot;crooner&quot; or &quot;er&quot;, while Irish means &quot;black&quot;, and Scottish Gaelic means &quot;native&quot;.

==Other names==
There are numerous names for the instrument among the Aboriginal peoples of northern Australia, none of which closely resemble the word &quot;didgeridoo&quot; (see below). Some didgeridoo enthusiasts, scholars and Aboriginal people advocate using local language names for the instrument.

&quot;Yiḏaki&quot; (transcribed &quot;yidaki&quot; in English, sometimes spelt &quot;yirdaki&quot;) is one of the most commonly used names although, strictly speaking, it refers to a specific type of the instrument made and used by the Yolngu peoples of north-east Arnhem Land. Some Yolngu people began using the word &quot;mandapul&quot; after 2011, out of respect for the passing of a Manggalili man who had a name sounding similar to yidaki.

In west Arnhem Land, it is known as a &quot;mako&quot;, a name popularised by virtuoso player David Blanasi, a Bininj man, whose language was Kunwinjku, and who brought the didgeridoo to world prominence. However the mako is slightly different from the Yiḏaki: usually shorter, and sounding somewhat different – a slightly fuller and richer sound, but without the &quot;overtone&quot; note.

There are at least 45 names for the didgeridoo, several of which suggest its original construction of bamboo, such as &quot;bambu&quot;, &quot;bombo&quot;, &quot;kambu&quot;, and &quot;pampu&quot;, which are still used in the &quot;lingua franca&quot; by some Aboriginal people. The following are some of the more common regional names.
==Description and construction==
A didgeridoo is usually cylindrical or conical, and can measure anywhere from long. Most are around long. Generally, the longer the instrument, the lower its pitch or key. However, flared instruments play a higher pitch than unflared instruments of the same length.

The didgeridoo is classified as a wind instrument and is similar in form to a straight trumpet, but made of wood. It has also been called a dronepipe.

===Traditional===
Traditional didgeridoos are usually made from hardwoods, especially the various eucalyptus species that are endemic to northern and central Australia. Generally the main trunk of the tree is harvested, though a substantial branch may be used instead. Traditional didgeridoo makers seek suitably hollow live trees in areas with obvious termite activity. Termites attack these living eucalyptus trees, removing only the dead heartwood of the tree, as the living sapwood contains a chemical that repels the insects. Various techniques are employed to find trees with a suitable hollow, including knowledge of landscape and termite activity patterns, and a kind of tap or knock test, in which the bark of the tree is peeled back, and a fingernail or the blunt end of a tool, such as an axe, is knocked against the wood to determine if the hollow produces the right resonance. Once a suitably hollow tree is found, it is cut down and cleaned out, the bark is taken off, the ends trimmed, and the exterior is shaped; this results in a finished instrument. A rim of beeswax may be applied to the mouthpiece end.

===Modern===

Non-traditional didgeridoos can be made from native or non-native hard woods (typically split, hollowed and rejoined), glass, fibreglass, metal, agave, clay, resin, PVC piping and carbon fibre. These typically have an upper inside diameter of around down to a bell end of anywhere between and have a length corresponding to the desired key. The end of the pipe can be shaped and smoothed to create a comfortable mouthpiece or an added mouthpiece can be made of any shaped and smoothed material such as rubber, a rubber stopper with a hole or beeswax.

Modern didgeridoo designs are distinct from the traditional Australian Aboriginal didgeridoo, and are innovations recognised by musicologists. Didgeridoo design innovation started in the late 20th century, using non-traditional materials and non-traditional shapes. The practice has sparked, however, a good deal of debate among indigenous practitioners and non-indigenous people about its aesthetic, ethical, and legal issues.

===Decoration===
Didgeridoos can be painted by their maker or a dedicated artist using traditional or modern paints while others retain the natural wood grain design with minimal or no decoration.

==Playing==

A didgeridoo can be played simply by producing a vibrating sound of the lips to produce the basic drone. More advanced playing involves the technique known as circular breathing. The circular breathing technique requires breathing in through the nose whilst simultaneously using the muscles of the cheeks to compress the cheeks and release the stored air out of the mouth. By using this technique, a skilled player can replenish the air in their lungs, and with practice they can sustain a note for as long as desired. Recordings exist of modern didgeridoo players playing continuously for more than 40 minutes; Mark Atkins on &quot;Didgeridoo Concerto&quot; (1994) plays for over 50 minutes continuously. Although circular breathing does eliminate the need to stop playing to take a breath, discomfort might still develop during a period of extended play due to chapped lips or other oral discomfort. 

The didgeridoo functions &quot;...as an aural kaleidoscope of timbres&quot; and &quot;the extremely difficult virtuoso techniques developed by expert performers find no parallel elsewhere.&quot;

The didgeridoo virtuoso and composer William Barton has expanded the role of the instrument in the concert hall both with his own orchestral and chamber music works and with those written or arranged for him by prominent Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe.

== Physics and operation ==

A termite-bored didgeridoo has an irregular shape that, overall, usually increases in diameter towards the lower end. This shape means that its resonances occur at frequencies that are not harmonically spaced in frequency. This contrasts with the harmonic spacing of the resonances in a cylindrical plastic pipe, whose resonant frequencies fall in the ratio 1:3:5 etc. The second resonance of a didgeridoo (the note sounded by overblowing) is usually around an 11th higher than the fundamental frequency (a frequency ratio of 8:3).

The vibration produced by the player&#x27;s lips has harmonics in the ratio 1:2:3 etc. However, the non-harmonic spacing of the instrument&#x27;s resonances means that the harmonics of the fundamental note are not systematically assisted by instrument&#x27;s resonances, as is usually the case for Western wind instruments (e.g., in the low range of the clarinet, the 1st, 3rd, and 5th harmonics of the reed are assisted by resonances of the bore).

Sufficiently strong resonances of the vocal tract can strongly influence the timbre of the instrument.
At some frequencies, whose values depend on the position of the player&#x27;s tongue, resonances of the vocal tract inhibit the oscillatory flow of air into the instrument.
Bands of frequencies that are not thus inhibited produce formants in the output sound.
These formants, and especially their variation during the inhalation and exhalation phases of circular breathing, give the instrument its readily recognisable sound.

Other variations in the didgeridoo&#x27;s sound can be made by adding vocalisations to the drone. Most of the vocalisations are related to sounds emitted by Australian animals, such as the dingo or the kookaburra. To produce these sounds, the players use their vocal folds to produce the sounds of the animals whilst continuing to blow air through the instrument. The results range from very high-pitched sounds to much lower sounds involving interference between the lip and vocal fold vibrations. Adding vocalisations increases the complexity of the playing.

==In popular culture==
Charlie McMahon, who formed the group Gondwanaland, was one of the first non-Aboriginal players to gain fame as a professional didgeridoo player. He has toured internationally with Midnight Oil. He invented the didjeribone, a sliding didgeridoo made from two lengths of plastic tubing; its playing style is somewhat in the manner of a trombone.

The didgeridoo has been used by a number of modern bands in various types of music. 

It was featured on the British children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Blue Peter&quot;.

Industrial music bands like Test Dept use the didgeridoo. 

Early songs by the acid jazz band Jamiroquai featured didgeridoo player Wallis Buchanan, including the band&#x27;s first single &quot;When You Gonna Learn&quot;, which features prominent didgeridoo in the introduction and solo sections.

Ambient artist Steve Roach uses it in his collaborative work &quot;&quot; with Australian Aboriginal artist David Hudson and cellist Sarah Hopkins, as well as &quot;Dreamtime Return&quot;.

It is used in the Indian song &quot;Jaane Kyon&quot; from the film &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot;.

Chris Brooks, lead singer of the New Zealand hard rock band Like a Storm, uses the didgeridoo in some songs, including &quot;Love the Way You Hate Me&quot; from their album &quot;Chaos Theory: Part 1&quot; (2012).

Kate Bush made extensive use of the didgeridoo, played by Australian musician Rolf Harris, on her album &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (1982), which was written and recorded after a holiday in Australia.

Singer and Multi-instrumentalist Xavier Rudd plays the didgeridoo and features the instrument frequently in his recordings 

==Cultural significance==
Traditionally, the didgeridoo was played as an accompaniment to ceremonial dancing and singing and for solo or recreational purposes. For Aboriginal peoples of northern Australia, the yidaki is still used to accompany singers and dancers in cultural ceremonies. For the Yolngu people, the yidaki is part of their whole physical and cultural landscape and environment, comprising the people and spirit beings which belong to their country, kinship system and the Yolngu Matha language. It is connected to Yolngu Law and underpinned by ceremony, in song, dance, visual art and stories.

Pair sticks, sometimes called clapsticks (&quot;bilma&quot; or &quot;bimla&quot; by some traditional groups), establish the beat for the songs during ceremonies. The rhythm of the didgeridoo and the beat of the clapsticks are precise, and these patterns have been handed down for many generations. In the Wangga genre, the song-man starts with vocals and then introduces &quot;bilma&quot; to the accompaniment of didgeridoo.

===Sex-based traditional prohibition debate===
Traditionally, only men play the didgeridoo and sing during ceremonial occasions; playing by women is sometimes discouraged by Aboriginal communities and elders. In 2008, publisher HarperCollins apologised for its book &quot;The Daring Book for Girls&quot;, which openly encouraged girls to play the instrument after Aboriginal academic Mark Rose described such encouragement as &quot;extreme cultural insensitivity&quot; and &quot;an extreme faux pas... part of a general ignorance that mainstream Australia has about Aboriginal culture.&quot; However, Linda Barwick, an ethnomusicologist, said that though traditionally women have not played the didgeridoo in ceremony, in informal situations there is no prohibition in the Dreaming Law. For example, in 1966, ethnomusicologist Alice Marshall Moyle made a recording in Borroloola of Jemima Wimalu, a Mara woman from the Roper River, proficiently playing the didgeridoo. In 1995, musicologist Steve Knopoff observed Yirrkala women performing &quot;djatpangarri&quot; songs that are traditionally performed by men and in 1996, ethnomusicologist Elizabeth MacKinley reported women of the Yanyuwa group giving public performances.

Although there is no prohibition in the area of the didgeridoo&#x27;s origin, such restrictions have been applied by other Indigenous communities. The didgeridoo was introduced to the Kimberleys in the early 20th century but it was only much later, such as in Rose&#x27;s 2008 criticism of &quot;The Daring Book for Girls&quot;, that Aboriginal men showed adverse reactions to women playing the instrument and prohibitions are especially evident in the South East of Australia. The belief that women are prohibited from playing is widespread among non-Aboriginal people and is also common among Aboriginal communities in Southern Australia; some ethnomusicologists believe that the dissemination of the taboo belief and other misconceptions is a result of commercial agendas and marketing. The majority of commercial didgeridoo recordings available are distributed by multinational recording companies and feature non-Aboriginal people playing a New Age style of music with liner notes promoting the instrument&#x27;s spirituality which misleads consumers about the didgeridoo&#x27;s secular role in traditional Aboriginal culture.

The taboo is particularly strong among many Aboriginal groups in the South East of Australia, where it is forbidden and considered &quot;cultural theft&quot; for non-Aboriginal women, and especially performers of New Age music regardless of sex, to play or even touch a didgeridoo.

==Health benefits==
A 2006 study reported in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; found that learning and practising the didgeridoo helped reduce snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by strengthening muscles in the upper airway, thus reducing their tendency to collapse during sleep. In the study, intervention subjects were trained in and practised didgeridoo playing, including circular breathing and other techniques. Control subjects were asked not to play the instrument. Subjects were surveyed before and after the study period to assess the effects of intervention. A small 2010 study noted marked improvements in the asthma management of 10 Aboriginal adults and children following a six-month programme of once-weekly didgeridoo lessons.

<text>Developmental biology is the study of the process by which animals and plants grow and develop. Developmental biology also encompasses the biology of regeneration, asexual reproduction, metamorphosis, and the growth and differentiation of stem cells in the adult organism.

== Perspectives ==
The main processes involved in the embryonic development of animals are: tissue patterning (via regional specification and patterned cell differentiation); tissue growth; and tissue morphogenesis.

* Regional specification refers to the processes that create the spatial patterns in a ball or sheet of initially similar cells. This generally involves the action of cytoplasmic determinants, located within parts of the fertilized egg, and of inductive signals emitted from signaling centers in the embryo. The early stages of regional specification do not generate functional differentiated cells, but cell populations committed to developing to a specific region or part of the organism. These are defined by the expression of specific combinations of transcription factors. 
* Cell differentiation relates specifically to the formation of functional cell types such as nerve, muscle, secretory epithelia, etc. Differentiated cells contain large amounts of specific proteins associated with cell function. 
* Morphogenesis relates to the formation of a three-dimensional shape. It mainly involves the orchestrated movements of cell sheets and of individual cells. Morphogenesis is important for creating the three germ layers of the early embryo (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and for building up complex structures during organ development. 
* Tissue growth involves both an overall increase in tissue size, and also the differential growth of parts (allometry) which contributes to morphogenesis. Growth mostly occurs through cell proliferation but also through changes in cell size or the deposition of extracellular materials. 

The development of plants involves similar processes to that of animals. However, plant cells are mostly immotile so morphogenesis is achieved by differential growth, without cell movements. Also, the inductive signals and the genes involved are different from those that control animal development.

===Generative biology===
Generative biology is the generative science that explores the dynamics guiding the development and evolution of a biological morphological form.

== Developmental processes ==

=== Cell differentiation ===

Cell differentiation is the process whereby different functional cell types arise in development. For example, neurons, muscle fibers and hepatocytes (liver cells) are well known types of differentiated cells. Differentiated cells usually produce large amounts of a few proteins that are required for their specific function and this gives them the characteristic appearance that enables them to be recognized under the light microscope. The genes encoding these proteins are highly active. Typically their chromatin structure is very open, allowing access for the transcription enzymes, and specific transcription factors bind to regulatory sequences in the DNA in order to activate gene expression. For example, NeuroD is a key transcription factor for neuronal differentiation, myogenin for muscle differentiation, and HNF4 for hepatocyte differentiation.
Cell differentiation is usually the final stage of development, preceded by several states of commitment which are not visibly differentiated. A single tissue, formed from a single type of progenitor cell or stem cell, often consists of several differentiated cell types. Control of their formation involves a process of lateral inhibition, based on the properties of the Notch signaling pathway. For example, in the neural plate of the embryo this system operates to generate a population of neuronal precursor cells in which NeuroD is highly expressed.

=== Regeneration ===
Regeneration indicates the ability to regrow a missing part. This is very prevalent amongst plants, which show continuous growth, and also among colonial animals such as hydroids and ascidians. But most interest by developmental biologists has been shown in the regeneration of parts in free living animals. In particular four models have been the subject of much investigation. Two of these have the ability to regenerate whole bodies: &quot;Hydra&quot;, which can regenerate any part of the polyp from a small fragment, and planarian worms, which can usually regenerate both heads and tails. Both of these examples have continuous cell turnover fed by stem cells and, at least in planaria, at least some of the stem cells have been shown to be pluripotent. The other two models show only distal regeneration of appendages. These are the insect appendages, usually the legs of hemimetabolous insects such as the cricket, and the limbs of urodele amphibians. Considerable information is now available about amphibian limb regeneration and it is known that each cell type regenerates itself, except for connective tissues where there is considerable interconversion between cartilage, dermis and tendons. In terms of the pattern of structures, this is controlled by a re-activation of signals active in the embryo.
There is still debate about the old question of whether regeneration is a &quot;pristine&quot; or an &quot;adaptive&quot; property. If the former is the case, with improved knowledge, we might expect to be able to improve regenerative ability in humans. If the latter, then each instance of regeneration is presumed to have arisen by natural selection in circumstances particular to the species, so no general rules would be expected.

== Embryonic development of animals ==

The sperm and egg fuse in the process of fertilization to form a fertilized egg, or zygote. This undergoes a period of divisions to form a ball or sheet of similar cells called a blastula or blastoderm. These cell divisions are usually rapid with no growth so the daughter cells are half the size of the mother cell and the whole embryo stays about the same size. They are called cleavage divisions.

Mouse epiblast primordial germ cells (see Figure: &quot;The initial stages of human embryogenesis&quot;) undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming. This process involves genome-wide DNA demethylation, chromatin reorganization and epigenetic imprint erasure leading to totipotency. DNA demethylation is carried out by a process that utilizes the DNA base excision repair pathway.

Morphogenetic movements convert the cell mass into a three layered structure consisting of multicellular sheets called ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. These sheets are known as germ layers. This is the process of gastrulation. During cleavage and gastrulation the first regional specification events occur. In addition to the formation of the three germ layers themselves, these often generate extraembryonic structures, such as the mammalian placenta, needed for support and nutrition of the embryo, and also establish differences of commitment along the anteroposterior axis (head, trunk and tail).

Regional specification is initiated by the presence of cytoplasmic determinants in one part of the zygote. The cells that contain the determinant become a signaling center and emit an inducing factor. Because the inducing factor is produced in one place, diffuses away, and decays, it forms a concentration gradient, high near the source cells and low further away. The remaining cells of the embryo, which do not contain the determinant, are competent to respond to different concentrations by upregulating specific developmental control genes. This results in a series of zones becoming set up, arranged at progressively greater distance from the signaling center. In each zone a different combination of developmental control genes is upregulated. These genes encode transcription factors which upregulate new combinations of gene activity in each region. Among other functions, these transcription factors control expression of genes conferring specific adhesive and motility properties on the cells in which they are active. Because of these different morphogenetic properties, the cells of each germ layer move to form sheets such that the ectoderm ends up on the outside, mesoderm in the middle, and endoderm on the inside. 
Morphogenetic movements not only change the shape and structure of the embryo, but by bringing cell sheets into new spatial relationships they also make possible new phases of signaling and response between them. In addition, first morphogenetic movements of embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, epiboly and twisting, directly activate pathways involved in endomesoderm specification through mechanotransduction processes. This property was suggested to be evolutionary inherited from endomesoderm specification as mechanically stimulated by marine environmental hydrodynamic flow in first animal organisms (first metazoa). Twisting along the body axis by a left-handed chirality is found in all chordates (including vertebrates) and is addressed by the axial twist theory.

Growth in embryos is mostly autonomous. For each territory of cells the growth rate is controlled by the combination of genes that are active. Free-living embryos do not grow in mass as they have no external food supply. But embryos fed by a placenta or extraembryonic yolk supply can grow very fast, and changes to relative growth rate between parts in these organisms help to produce the final overall anatomy.

The whole process needs to be coordinated in time and how this is controlled is not understood. There may be a master clock able to communicate with all parts of the embryo that controls the course of events, or timing may depend simply on local causal sequences of events.

=== Metamorphosis ===
Developmental processes are very evident during the process of metamorphosis. This occurs in various types of animal such as insects, amphibians, some fish, and many marine invertebrates.Well-known examples are seen in frogs, which usually hatch as a tadpole and metamorphoses to an adult frog, and certain insects which hatch as a larva and then become remodeled to the adult form during a pupal stage.

All the developmental processes listed above occur during metamorphosis. Examples that have been especially well studied include tail loss and other changes in the tadpole of the frog &quot;Xenopus&quot;, and the biology of the imaginal discs, which generate the adult body parts of the fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.

== Plant development ==

Plant development is the process by which structures originate and mature as a plant grows. It is studied in plant anatomy and plant physiology as well as plant morphology.

Plants constantly produce new tissues and structures throughout their life from meristems located at the tips of organs, or between mature tissues. Thus, a living plant always has embryonic tissues. By contrast, an animal embryo will very early produce all of the body parts that it will ever have in its life. When the animal is born (or hatches from its egg), it has all its body parts and from that point will only grow larger and more mature.

The properties of organization seen in a plant are emergent properties which are more than the sum of the individual parts. &quot;The assembly of these tissues and functions into an integrated multicellular organism yields not only the characteristics of the separate parts and processes but also quite a new set of characteristics which would not have been predictable on the basis of examination of the separate parts.&quot;

=== Growth ===
A vascular plant begins from a single celled zygote, formed by fertilisation of an egg cell by a sperm cell. From that point, it begins to divide to form a plant embryo through the process of embryogenesis. As this happens, the resulting cells will organize so that one end becomes the first root, while the other end forms the tip of the shoot. In seed plants, the embryo will develop one or more &quot;seed leaves&quot; (cotyledons). By the end of embryogenesis, the young plant will have all the parts necessary to begin its life.

Once the embryo germinates from its seed or parent plant, it begins to produce additional organs (leaves, stems, and roots) through the process of organogenesis. New roots grow from root meristems located at the tip of the root, and new stems and leaves grow from shoot meristems located at the tip of the shoot. Branching occurs when small clumps of cells left behind by the meristem, and which have not yet undergone cellular differentiation to form a specialized tissue, begin to grow as the tip of a new root or shoot. Growth from any such meristem at the tip of a root or shoot is termed primary growth and results in the lengthening of that root or shoot. Secondary growth results in widening of a root or shoot from divisions of cells in a cambium.

In addition to growth by cell division, a plant may grow through cell elongation. This occurs when individual cells or groups of cells grow longer. Not all plant cells will grow to the same length. When cells on one side of a stem grow longer and faster than cells on the other side, the stem will bend to the side of the slower growing cells as a result. This directional growth can occur via a plant&#x27;s response to a particular stimulus, such as light (phototropism), gravity (gravitropism), water, (hydrotropism), and physical contact (thigmotropism).

Plant growth and development are mediated by specific plant hormones and plant growth regulators (PGRs) (Ross et al. 1983). Endogenous hormone levels are influenced by plant age, cold hardiness, dormancy, and other metabolic conditions; photoperiod, drought, temperature, and other external environmental conditions; and exogenous sources of PGRs, e.g., externally applied and of rhizospheric origin.

=== Morphological variation ===
Plants exhibit natural variation in their form and structure. While all organisms vary from individual to individual, plants exhibit an additional type of variation. Within a single individual, parts are repeated which may differ in form and structure from other similar parts. This variation is most easily seen in the leaves of a plant, though other organs such as stems and flowers may show similar variation. There are three primary causes of this variation: positional effects, environmental effects, and juvenility.

=== Evolution of plant morphology ===
Transcription factors and transcriptional regulatory networks play key roles in plant morphogenesis and their evolution. During plant landing, many novel transcription factor families emerged and are preferentially wired into the networks of multicellular development, reproduction, and organ development, contributing to more complex morphogenesis of land plants.

Most land plants share a common ancestor, multicellular algae. An example of the evolution of plant morphology is seen in charophytes. Studies have shown that charophytes have traits that are homologous to land plants. There are two main theories of the evolution of plant morphology, these theories are the homologous theory and the antithetic theory. The commonly accepted theory for the evolution of plant morphology is the antithetic theory. The antithetic theory states that the multiple mitotic divisions that take place before meiosis, cause the development of the sporophyte. Then the sporophyte will development as an independent organism.

== Developmental model organisms ==

Much of developmental biology research in recent decades has focused on the use of a small number of model organisms. It has turned out that there is much conservation of developmental mechanisms across the animal kingdom. In early development different vertebrate species all use essentially the same inductive signals and the same genes encoding regional identity. Even invertebrates use a similar repertoire of signals and genes although the body parts formed are significantly different. Model organisms each have some particular experimental advantages which have enabled them to become popular among researchers. In one sense they are &quot;models&quot; for the whole animal kingdom, and in another sense they are &quot;models&quot; for human development, which is difficult to study directly for both ethical and practical reasons. Model organisms have been most useful for elucidating the broad nature of developmental mechanisms. The more detail is sought, the more they differ from each other and from humans.

<doc id="8454" wikidata="Q669420" url="?curid=8454" title="Double planet">
<text>In astronomy, a double planet (also binary planet) is a binary satellite system where both objects are planets, or planetary-mass objects, and whose barycenter is external to both planetary bodies.

Although up to a third of the star systems in the Milky Way are binary, double planets are expected to be much rarer given the typical planet to satellite mass ratio is around 1:10,000, they are influenced heavily by the gravitational pull of the parent star and according to the giant-impact hypothesis are gravitationally stable only under particular circumstances.

The Solar System does not have an official double planet, however the Earth–Moon system is sometimes considered to be one. In promotional materials advertising the SMART-1 mission, the European Space Agency referred to the Earth–Moon system as a double planet.

Several dwarf planet candidates can be described as binary planets. At its 2006 General Assembly, the International Astronomical Union considered a proposal that Pluto and Charon be reclassified as a double planet, but the proposal was abandoned in favor of the current IAU definition of planet. Other trans-Neptunian systems with proportionally large planetary-mass satellites include Eris–Dysnomia, Orcus–Vanth and Varda–Ilmarë.

Binary asteroids with components of roughly equal mass are sometimes referred to as double minor planets. These include binary asteroids 69230 Hermes and 90 Antiope and binary Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) 79360 Sila–Nunam and .

== Definition of &quot;double planet&quot; ==
There is debate as to what criteria should be used to distinguish a &quot;double planet&quot; from a &quot;planet–moon system&quot;. The following are considerations.

=== Both bodies satisfy planet criterion ===

A definition proposed in the &quot;Astronomical Journal&quot; calls for both bodies to individually satisfy an orbit-clearing criterion in order to be called a double planet.

=== Mass ratios closer to 1 ===

One important consideration for defining &quot;double planets&quot; is the ratio of the masses of the two bodies. A mass ratio of 1 would indicate bodies of equal mass, and bodies with mass ratios closer to 1 are more attractive to label as &quot;doubles&quot;. Using this definition, the satellites of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune can all easily be excluded; they all have masses less than 0.00025 () of the planets around which they revolve. Some dwarf planets, too, have satellites substantially less massive than the dwarf planets themselves.

The most notable exception is the Pluto–Charon system. The Charon-to-Pluto mass ratio of 0.122 (≈ ) is close enough to 1 that Pluto and Charon have frequently been described by many scientists as &quot;double dwarf planets&quot; (&quot;double planets&quot; prior to the 2006 definition of &quot;planet&quot;). The International Astronomical Union (IAU) earlier classified Charon as a satellite of Pluto, but had also explicitly expressed the willingness to reconsider the bodies as double dwarf planets in the future. However, a 2006 IAU report classified Charon–Pluto as a double planet. 

The Moon-to-Earth mass ratio of 0.01230 (≈ ) is also notably close to 1 when compared to all other satellite-to-planet ratios. Consequently, some scientists view the Earth–Moon system as a double planet as well, though this is a minority view. Eris&#x27;s lone satellite, Dysnomia, has a radius somewhere around that of Eris; assuming similar densities (Dysnomia&#x27;s compositional make-up may or may not differ substantially from Eris&#x27;s), the mass ratio would be near , a value intermediate to the Moon–Earth and Charon–Pluto ratios.

=== Center-of-mass position ===

Currently, the most commonly proposed definition for a double-planet system is one in which the barycenter, around which both bodies orbit, lies outside both bodies. Under this definition, Pluto and Charon are double dwarf planets, since they orbit a point clearly outside of Pluto, as visible in animations created from images of the &quot;New Horizons&quot; space probe in June 2015.

Under this definition, the Earth–Moon system is not currently a double planet; although the Moon is massive enough to cause the Earth to make a noticeable revolution around this center of mass, this point nevertheless lies well within Earth. However, the Moon currently migrates outward from Earth at a rate of approximately per year; in a few billion years, the Earth–Moon system&#x27;s center of mass will lie outside Earth, which would make it a double-planet system.

The center of mass of the Jupiter–Sun system lies outside the surface of the Sun, though arguing that Jupiter and the Sun are a double star is not analogous to arguing Pluto–Charon is a double dwarf planet. Jupiter is too light to be a fusor; were it thirteen times heavier, it would achieve deuterium fusion and become a brown dwarf.

=== Tug-of-war value ===

Isaac Asimov suggested a distinction between planet–moon and double-planet structures based in part on what he called a &quot;tug-of-war&quot; value, which does not consider their relative sizes. This quantity is simply the ratio of the force exerted on the smaller body by the larger (primary) body to the force exerted on the smaller body by the Sun. This can be shown to equal

formula_1

where is the mass of the primary (the larger body), is the mass of the Sun, is the distance between the smaller body and the Sun, and is the distance between the smaller body and the primary. The tug-of-war value does not rely on the mass of the satellite (the smaller body).

This formula actually reflects the relation of the gravitational effects on the smaller body from the larger body and from the Sun. The tug-of-war figure for Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan is 380, which means that Saturn&#x27;s hold on Titan is 380 times as strong as the Sun&#x27;s hold on Titan. Titan&#x27;s tug-of-war value may be compared with that of Saturn&#x27;s moon Phoebe, which has a tug-of-war value of just 3.5; that is, Saturn&#x27;s hold on Phoebe is only 3.5 times as strong as the Sun&#x27;s hold on Phoebe.

Asimov calculated tug-of-war values for several satellites of the planets. He showed that even the largest gas giant, Jupiter, had only a slightly better hold than the Sun on its outer captured satellites, some with tug-of-war values not much higher than one. In nearly every one of Asimov&#x27;s calculations the tug-of-war value was found to be greater than one, so in those cases the Sun loses the tug-of-war with the planets. The one exception was Earth&#x27;s Moon, where the Sun wins the tug-of-war with a value of 0.46, which means that Earth&#x27;s hold on the Moon is less than half as strong as the Sun&#x27;s. Asimov included this with his other arguments that Earth and the Moon should be considered a binary planet.
See the Path of Earth and Moon around Sun section in the &quot;Orbit of the Moon&quot; article for a more detailed explanation.

This definition of double planet depends on the pair&#x27;s distance from the Sun. If the Earth–Moon system happened to orbit farther away from the Sun than it does now, then Earth would win the tug of war. For example, at the orbit of Mars, the Moon&#x27;s tug-of-war value would be 1.05. Also, several tiny moons discovered since Asimov&#x27;s proposal would qualify as double planets by this argument. Neptune&#x27;s small outer moons Neso and Psamathe, for example, have tug-of-war values of 0.42 and 0.44, less than that of Earth&#x27;s Moon. Yet their masses are tiny compared to Neptune&#x27;s, with an estimated ratio of 1.5 () and 0.4 ().

=== Formation of the system ===

A final consideration is the way in which the two bodies came to form a system. Both the Earth–Moon and Pluto–Charon systems are thought to have been formed as a result of giant impacts: one body was impacted by a second body, resulting in a debris disk, and through accretion, either two new bodies formed or one new body formed, with the larger body remaining (but changed). However, a giant impact is not a sufficient condition for two bodies being &quot;double planets&quot; because such impacts can also produce tiny satellites, such as the four small outer satellites of Pluto.

A now-abandoned hypothesis for the origin of the Moon was actually called the &quot;double-planet hypothesis&quot;; the idea was that the Earth and the Moon formed in the same region of the Solar System&#x27;s proto-planetary disk, forming a system under gravitational interaction. This idea, too, is a problematic condition for defining two bodies as &quot;double planets&quot; because planets can &quot;capture&quot; moons through gravitational interaction. For example, the moons of Mars (Phobos and Deimos) are thought to be asteroids captured long ago by Mars. Such a definition would also deem Neptune–Triton a double planet, since Triton was a Kuiper belt body the same size and of similar composition to Pluto, later captured by Neptune.

<text>In biochemistry, denaturation is a process in which proteins or nucleic acids lose folded structure present in their native state due to various factors, including application of some external stress or compound, such as a strong acid or base, a concentrated inorganic salt, an organic solvent (e.g., alcohol or chloroform), agitation and radiation, or heat. If proteins in a living cell are denatured, this results in disruption of cell activity and possibly cell death. Protein denaturation is also a consequence of cell death. Denatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics, from conformational change and loss of solubility or dissociation of cofactors to aggregation due to the exposure of hydrophobic groups. The loss of solubility as a result of denaturation is called &quot;coagulation&quot;. Denatured proteins lose their 3D structure, and therefore, cannot function.

Proper protein folding is key to whether a globular or membrane protein can do its job correctly; it must be folded into the native shape to function. However, hydrogen bonds and cofactor-protein binding, which play a crucial role in folding, are rather weak, and thus, easily affected by heat, acidity, varying salt concentrations, chelating agents, and other stressors which can denature the protein. This is one reason why cellular homeostasis is physiologically necessary in most life forms.

== Common examples ==
When food is cooked, some of its proteins become denatured. This is why boiled eggs become hard and cooked meat becomes firm.

A classic example of denaturing in proteins comes from egg whites, which are typically largely egg albumins in water. Fresh from the eggs, egg whites are transparent and liquid. Cooking the thermally unstable whites turns them opaque, forming an interconnected solid mass. The same transformation can be effected with a denaturing chemical. Pouring egg whites into a beaker of acetone will also turn egg whites translucent and solid. The skin that forms on curdled milk is another common example of denatured protein. The cold appetizer known as ceviche is prepared by chemically &quot;cooking&quot; raw fish and shellfish in an acidic citrus marinade, without heat.

== Protein denaturation ==
Denatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics, from loss of solubility to protein aggregation.

=== Background ===
Proteins or polypeptides are polymers of amino acids. A protein is created by ribosomes that &quot;read&quot; RNA that is encoded by codons in the gene and assemble the requisite amino acid combination from the genetic instruction, in a process known as translation. The newly created protein strand then undergoes posttranslational modification, in which additional atoms or molecules are added, for example copper, zinc, or iron. Once this post-translational modification process has been completed, the protein begins to fold (sometimes spontaneously and sometimes with enzymatic assistance), curling up on itself so that hydrophobic elements of the protein are buried deep inside the structure and hydrophilic elements end up on the outside. The final shape of a protein determines how it interacts with its environment.

Protein folding consists of a balance between a substantial amount of weak intra-molecular interactions within a protein (Hydrophobic, electrostatic, and Van Der Waals Interactions) and protein-solvent interactions. As a result, this process is heavily reliant on environmental state that the protein resides in. These environmental conditions include, and are not limited to, temperature, salinity, pressure, and the solvents that happen to be involved. Consequently, any exposure to extreme stresses (e.g. heat or radiation, high inorganic salt concentrations, strong acids and bases) can disrupt a protein&#x27;s interaction and inevitably lead to denaturation.

When a protein is denatured, secondary and tertiary structures are altered but the peptide bonds of the primary structure between the amino acids are left intact. Since all structural levels of the protein determine its function, the protein can no longer perform its function once it has been denatured. This is in contrast to intrinsically unstructured proteins, which are unfolded in their native state, but still functionally active and tend to fold upon binding to their biological target.

=== How denaturation occurs at levels of protein structure ===

* In quaternary structure denaturation, protein sub-units are dissociated and/or the spatial arrangement of protein subunits is disrupted.
* Tertiary structure denaturation involves the disruption of:
** Covalent interactions between amino acid side-chains (such as disulfide bridges between cysteine groups)
** Non-covalent dipole-dipole interactions between polar amino acid side-chains (and the surrounding solvent)
** Van der Waals (induced dipole) interactions between nonpolar amino acid side-chains.
* In secondary structure denaturation, proteins lose all regular repeating patterns such as alpha-helices and beta-pleated sheets, and adopt a random coil configuration.
* Primary structure, such as the sequence of amino acids held together by covalent peptide bonds, is not disrupted by denaturation.

==== Loss of function ====
Most biological substrates lose their biological function when denatured. For example, enzymes lose their activity, because the substrates can no longer bind to the active site, and because amino acid residues involved in stabilizing substrates&#x27; transition states are no longer positioned to be able to do so. The denaturing process and the associated loss of activity can be measured using techniques such as dual-polarization interferometry, CD, QCM-D and MP-SPR.

==== Loss of activity due to heavy metals and metalloids ====
By targeting proteins, heavy metals have been known to disrupt the function and activity carried out by proteins. Heavy metals fall into categories consisting of transition metals as well as a select amount of metalloid. These metals, when interacting with native, folded proteins, tend to play a role in obstructing their biological activity. This interference can be carried out in a different number of ways. These heavy metals can form a complex with the functional side chain groups present in a protein or form bonds to free thiols. Heavy metals also play a role in oxidizing amino acid side chains present in protein. Along with this, when interacting with metalloproteins, heavy metals can dislocate and replace key metal ions. As a result, heavy metals can interfere with folded proteins, which can strongly deter protein stability and activity.

==== Reversibility and irreversibility ====
In many cases, denaturation is reversible (the proteins can regain their native state when the denaturing influence is removed). This process can be called renaturation. This understanding has led to the notion that all the information needed for proteins to assume their native state was encoded in the primary structure of the protein, and hence in the DNA that codes for the protein, the so-called &quot;Anfinsen&#x27;s thermodynamic hypothesis&quot;.

Denaturation can also be irreversible. This irreversibility is typically a kinetic, not thermodynamic irreversibility, as a folded protein generally has lower free energy than when it is unfolded. Through kinetic irreversibility, the fact that the protein is stuck in a local minimum can stop it from ever refolding after it has been irreversibly denatured.

==== Protein denaturation due to pH ====
Denaturation can also be caused by changes in the pH which can affect the chemistry of the amino acids and their residues. The ionizable groups in amino acids are able to become ionized when changes in pH occur. A pH change to more acidic or more basic conditions can induce unfolding. Acid-induced unfolding often occurs between pH 2 and 5, base-induced unfolding usually requires pH 10 or higher.

== Nucleic acid denaturation ==
Nucleic acids (including RNA and DNA) are nucleotide polymers synthesized by polymerase enzymes during either transcription or DNA replication. Following 5&#x27;-3&#x27; synthesis of the backbone, individual nitrogenous bases are capable of interacting with one another via hydrogen bonding, thus allowing for the formation of higher-order structures. Nucleic acid denaturation occurs when hydrogen bonding between nucleotides is disrupted, and results in the separation of previously annealed strands. For example, denaturation of DNA due to high temperatures results in the disruption of base pairs and the separation of the double stranded helix into two single strands. Nucleic acid strands are capable of re-annealling when &quot;normal&quot; conditions are restored, but if restoration occurs too quickly, the nucleic acid strands may re-anneal imperfectly resulting in the improper pairing of bases.

=== Biologically-induced denaturation ===

The non-covalent interactions between antiparallel strands in DNA can be broken in order to &quot;open&quot; the double helix when biologically important mechanisms such as DNA replication, transcription, DNA repair or protein binding are set to occur. The area of partially separated DNA is known as the denaturation bubble, which can be more specifically defined as the opening of a DNA double helix through the coordinated separation of base pairs.

The first model that attempted to describe the thermodynamics of the denaturation bubble was introduced in 1966 and called the Poland-Scheraga Model. This model describes the denaturation of DNA strands as a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs are increasingly disturbed and &quot;denatured loops&quot; begin to form. However, the Poland-Scheraga Model is now considered elementary because it fails to account for the confounding implications of DNA sequence, chemical composition, stiffness and torsion.

Recent thermodynamic studies have inferred that the lifetime of a singular denaturation bubble ranges from 1 microsecond to 1 millisecond. This information is based on established timescales of DNA replication and transcription. Currently, biophysical and biochemical research studies are being performed to more fully elucidate the thermodynamic details of the denaturation bubble.

=== Denaturation due to chemical agents ===

With polymerase chain reaction (PCR) being among the most popular contexts in which DNA denaturation is desired, heating is the most frequent method of denaturation. Other than denaturation by heat, nucleic acids can undergo the denaturation process through various chemical agents such as formamide, guanidine, sodium salicylate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), propylene glycol, and urea. These chemical denaturing agents lower the melting temperature (Tm) by competing for hydrogen bond donors and acceptors with pre-existing nitrogenous base pairs. Some agents are even able to induce denaturation at room temperature. For example, alkaline agents (e.g. NaOH) have been shown to denature DNA by changing pH and removing hydrogen-bond contributing protons. These denaturants have been employed to make Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis gel (DGGE), which promotes denaturation of nucleic acids in order to eliminate the influence of nucleic acid shape on their electrophoretic mobility.

==== Chemical denaturation as an alternative ====
The optical activity (absorption and scattering of light) and hydrodynamic properties (translational diffusion, sedimentation coefficients, and rotational correlation times) of formamide denatured nucleic acids are similar to those of heat-denatured nucleic acids. Therefore, depending on the desired effect, chemically denaturing DNA can provide a gentler procedure for denaturing nucleic acids than denaturation induced by heat. Studies comparing different denaturation methods such as heating, beads mill of different bead sizes, probe sonication, and chemical denaturation show that chemical denaturation can provide quicker denaturation compared to the other physical denaturation methods described. Particularly in cases where rapid renaturation is desired, chemical denaturation agents can provide an ideal alternative to heating. For example, DNA strands denatured with alkaline agents such as NaOH renature as soon as phosphate buffer is added.

==== Denaturation due to air ====
Small, electronegative molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen, which are the primary gases in air, significantly impact the ability of surrounding molecules to participate in hydrogen bonding. These molecules compete with surrounding hydrogen bond acceptors for hydrogen bond donors, therefore acting as &quot;hydrogen bond breakers&quot; and weakening interactions between surrounding molecules in the environment. Antiparellel strands in DNA double helices are non-covalently bound by hydrogen bonding between base pairs; nitrogen and oxygen therefore maintain the potential to weaken the integrity of DNA when exposed to air. As a result, DNA strands exposed to air require less force to separate and exemplify lower melting temperatures.

=== Applications ===
Many laboratory techniques rely on the ability of nucleic acid strands to separate. By understanding the properties of nucleic acid denaturation, the following methods were created:
* PCR
* Southern blot
* Northern blot
* DNA sequencing

<doc id="8459" wikidata="Q453218" url="?curid=8459" title="Dwight L. Moody">
<text>Dwight Lyman Moody (February 5, 1837 – December 22, 1899), also known as D. L. Moody, was an American evangelist and publisher connected with Keswickianism, who founded the Moody Church, Northfield School and Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts (now Northfield Mount Hermon School), Moody Bible Institute, and Moody Publishers. One of his most famous quotes was &quot;Faith makes all things possible... Love makes all things easy.&quot; Moody gave up his lucrative boot and shoe business to devote his life to revivalism, working first in the Civil War with Union troops through YMCA in the United States Christian Commission. In Chicago, he built one of the major evangelical centers in the nation, which is still active. Working with singer Ira Sankey, he toured the country and the British Isles, drawing large crowds with a dynamic speaking style.

==Early life==
Dwight Moody was born in Northfield, Massachusetts, as the seventh child of a large family. His father, Edwin J. Moody (1800–1841), was a small farmer and stonemason. His mother was Betsey Moody (née Holton; 1805–1896). They had five sons and a daughter before Dwight&#x27;s birth. His father died when Dwight was age four; fraternal twins, a boy, and a girl were born one month after the father&#x27;s death. Their mother struggled to support the nine children, but she still found it necessary to send some off to work for their room and board. Dwight too was sent off, where he received cornmeal porridge, and milk three times a day. He complained to his mother, but when she learned that he was getting all he wanted to eat, she sent him back. During this time, she continued to send the children to church. Together with his eight siblings, Dwight was raised in the Unitarian church. His oldest brother ran away and was not heard from by the family until many years later.

When Moody turned 17, he moved to Boston to work (after receiving many job rejections locally) in an uncle&#x27;s shoe store. One of the uncle&#x27;s requirements was that Moody attend the Congregational Church of Mount Vernon, where Dr. Edward Norris Kirk served as the pastor. In April 1855 Moody was converted to evangelical Christianity when his Sunday school teacher, Edward Kimball, talked to him about how much God loved him. His conversion sparked the start of his career as an evangelist. Moody first applied to the church in May 1855, but he was not received as a church member until May 4, 1856.

According to Moody&#x27;s memoir, his teacher, Edward Kimball, said:

==Civil War==

D. L. Moody &quot;could not conscientiously enlist&quot; in the Union Army during the Civil War, later describing himself as &quot;a Quaker&quot; in this respect. After the Civil War started, he became involved with the United States Christian Commission of YMCA. He paid nine visits to the battlefront, being present among the Union soldiers after the Battle of Shiloh (a.k.a. Pittsburg Landing) and the Battle of Stones River; he also entered Richmond, Virginia, with the troops of General Grant.

On August 28, 1862, Moody married Emma C. Revell, with whom he had a daughter, Emma Reynolds Moody, and two sons, William Revell Moody and Paul Dwight Moody.

==Chicago and the postwar years==
In 1858, he started a Sunday school. 

The growing Sunday School congregation needed a permanent home, so Moody started a church in Chicago, the Illinois Street Church in 1864.

In June 1871 at an International Sunday School Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana, Dwight Moody met Ira D. Sankey. He was a gospel singer, with whom Moody soon began to cooperate and collaborate.
Four months later, in October 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed Moody&#x27;s church building, as well as his house and those of most of his congregation. Many had to flee the flames, saving only their lives, and ending up completely destitute. Moody, reporting on the disaster, said about his own situation that: &quot;...he saved nothing but his reputation and his Bible.&quot;

In the years after the fire, Moody&#x27;s wealthy Chicago patron John V. Farwell tried to persuade him to make his permanent home in the city, offering to build a new house for Moody and his family. But the newly famous Moody, also sought by supporters in New York, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, chose a tranquil farm he had purchased near his birthplace in Northfield, Massachusetts. He felt he could better recover from his lengthy preaching trips in a rural setting.

Northfield became an important location in evangelical Christian history in the late 19th century as Moody organized summer conferences. These were led and attended by prominent Christian preachers and evangelists from around the world. Western Massachusetts has had a rich evangelical tradition including Jonathan Edwards preaching in colonial Northampton and C.I. Scofield preaching in Northfield. A protégé of Moody founded Moores Corner Church, in Leverett, Massachusetts.

Moody founded two schools here: Northfield School for Girls, founded in 1879, and the Mount Hermon School for Boys, founded in 1881. In the late 20th century, these merged, forming today&#x27;s co-educational, nondenominational Northfield Mount Hermon School.

===Evangelistic travels===
During a trip to the United Kingdom in the spring of 1872, Moody became well known as an evangelist. Literary works published by the Moody Bible Institute claim that he was the greatest evangelist of the 19th century. He preached almost a hundred times and came into communion with the Plymouth Brethren. On several occasions, he filled stadia of a capacity of 2,000 to 4,000. According to his memoir, in the Botanic Gardens Palace, he attracted an audience estimated at between 15,000 and 30,000.

That turnout continued throughout 1874 and 1875, with crowds of thousands at all of his meetings. During his visit to Scotland, Moody was helped and encouraged by Andrew A. Bonar. The famous London Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon invited him to speak, and he promoted the American as well. When Moody returned to the US, he was said to frequently attract crowds of 12,000 to 20,000, such crowds being as common as they had been in England. President Grant and some of his cabinet officials attended a Moody meeting on January 19, 1876. Moody held evangelistic meetings from Boston to New York, throughout New England, and as far west as San Francisco, also visiting other West Coast towns from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to San Diego.

Moody aided the work of cross-cultural evangelism by promoting &quot;The Wordless Book&quot;, a teaching tool Charles Spurgeon had developed in 1866. In 1875, Moody added a fourth color to the design of the three-color evangelistic device: gold — to &quot;represent heaven.&quot; This &quot;book&quot; has been and is still used to teach uncounted thousands of illiterate people, young and old, around the globe about the gospel message.
Moody visited Britain with Ira D. Sankey, with Moody preaching and Sankey singing at meetings. Together they published books of Christian hymns. In 1883, they visited Edinburgh and raised £10,000 for the building of a new home for the Carrubbers Close Mission. Moody later preached at the laying of the foundation stone for what is now called the Carrubbers Christian Centre, one of the few buildings on the Royal Mile which continues to be used for its original purpose.

Moody greatly influenced the cause of cross-cultural Christian missions after he met Hudson Taylor, a pioneer missionary to China. He actively supported the China Inland Mission and encouraged many of his congregation to volunteer for service overseas.

===International acclaim===
His influence was felt among Swedes. Being of English heritage, never visiting Sweden or any other Scandinavian country, and never speaking a word of Swedish, nonetheless, he became a hero revivalist among Swedish Mission Friends () in Sweden and America.

News of Moody&#x27;s large revival campaigns in Great Britain from 1873 through 1875 traveled quickly to Sweden, making &quot;Mr. Moody&quot; a household name in homes of many Mission Friends. Moody&#x27;s sermons published in Sweden were distributed in books, newspapers, and colporteur tracts, and they led to the spread of Sweden&#x27;s &quot;Moody fever&quot; from 1875 through 1880.

He preached his last sermon on November 16, 1899, in Kansas City, Missouri. Becoming ill, he returned home by train to Northfield. During the preceding several months, friends had observed he had added some to his already ample frame. Although his illness was never diagnosed, it has been speculated that he suffered from congestive heart failure. He died on December 22, 1899, surrounded by his family. Already installed as the leader of the Chicago Bible Institute, R. A. Torrey succeeded Moody as its pastor.

==Legacy==
Religious historian James Findlay says that:
: Speaking before thousands in the dark business suit, bearded, rotund Dwight L. Moody seemed the epitome of the &quot;businessman in clerical garb&quot; who typified popular religion in late 19th-century America... Earthy, unlettered, a dynamo of energy, the revivalist was very much a man of his times... Moody adapted revivalism, one of the major institutions of evangelical Protestantism, to the urban context. ... His organizational ability, demonstrated in the great revivals he conducted in England, combined to fashion his spectacular career as the creator of modern mass revivalism.

Ten years after Moody&#x27;s death the Chicago Avenue Church was renamed the Moody Church in his honor, and the Chicago Bible Institute was likewise renamed the Moody Bible Institute.

Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was born in 1890, was named after him. During World War II, the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor.

<text>Dieting is the practice of eating food in a regulated way to decrease, maintain, or increase body weight, or to prevent and treat diseases such as diabetes and obesity. As weight loss depends on calorie intake, different kinds of calorie-reduced diets, such as those emphasising particular macronutrients (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, etc.), have been shown to be no more effective than one another. As weight regain is common, diet success is best predicted by long-term adherence. Regardless, the outcome of a diet can vary widely depending on the individual.

The first popular diet was &quot;Banting&quot;, named after William Banting. In his 1863 pamphlet, &quot;Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public&quot;, he outlined the details of a particular low-carbohydrate, low-calorie diet that led to his own dramatic weight loss.

Some guidelines recommend dieting to lose weight for people with weight-related health problems, but not for otherwise healthy people. One survey found that almost half of all American adults attempt to lose weight through dieting, including 66.7% of obese adults and 26.5% of normal weight or underweight adults. Dieters who are overweight (but not obese), who are normal weight, or who are underweight may have an increased mortality rate as a result of dieting.

==History==

The word &quot;diet&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;&quot;, which represents a notion of a whole way healthy lifestyle including both mental and physical health, rather than a narrow weight-loss regimen.

One of the first dietitians was the English doctor George Cheyne. He himself was tremendously overweight and would constantly eat large quantities of rich food and drink. He began a meatless diet, taking only milk and vegetables, and soon regained his health. He began publicly recommending his diet for everyone who was obese. In 1724, he wrote &quot;An Essay of Health and Long Life&quot;, in which he advises exercise and fresh air and avoiding luxury foods.

The Scottish military surgeon, John Rollo, published &quot;Notes of a Diabetic Case&quot; in 1797. It described the benefits of a meat diet for those with diabetes, basing this recommendation on Matthew Dobson&#x27;s discovery of glycosuria in diabetes mellitus. By means of Dobson&#x27;s testing procedure (for glucose in the urine) Rollo worked out a diet that had success for what is now called type 2 diabetes.

The first popular diet was &quot;Banting&quot;, named after the English undertaker William Banting. In 1863, he wrote a booklet called &quot;Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public&quot;, which contained the particular plan for the diet he had successfully followed. His own diet was four meals per day, consisting of meat, greens, fruits, and dry wine. The emphasis was on avoiding sugar, sweet foods, starch, beer, milk and butter. Banting&#x27;s pamphlet was popular for years to come, and would be used as a model for modern diets. The pamphlet&#x27;s popularity was such that the question &quot;Do you bant?&quot; referred to his method, and eventually to dieting in general. His booklet remains in print as of 2007.

The first weight-loss book to promote calorie counting, and the first weight-loss book to become a bestseller, was the 1918 &quot;Diet and Health: With Key to the Calories&quot; by American physician and columnist Lulu Hunt Peters.

It was estimated that over 1000 weight-loss diets have been developed up to 2014.

==Types ==

A restricted diet is most commonly pursued by those who want to lose weight. Some people follow a diet to gain weight (such as people who are underweight or who are attempting to gain more muscle). Diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight or to improve health.

===Low-fat===

Low-fat diets involve the reduction of the percentage of fat in one&#x27;s diet. Calorie consumption is reduced because less fat is consumed. Diets of this type include NCEP Step I and II. A meta-analysis of 16 trials of 2–12 months&#x27; duration found that low-fat diets (without intentional restriction of caloric intake) resulted in average weight loss of over habitual eating.

A low-fat, plant-based diet has been found to improve control of weight, blood sugar levels, and cardiovascular health.

===Low-carbohydrate===
===Low-calorie===

Low-calorie diets usually produce an energy deficit of 500–1,000 calories per day, which can result in a weight loss per week. The National Institutes of Health reviewed 34 randomized controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of low-calorie diets. They found that these diets lowered total body mass by 8% in the short term, over 3–12 months. Women doing low-calorie diets should have at least 1,000 calories per day and men should have approximately 1,200 calories per day. These caloric intake values vary depending on additional factors, such as age and weight.

===Very low-calorie===

Very low calorie diets provide 200–800 calories per day, maintaining protein intake but limiting calories from both fat and carbohydrates. They subject the body to starvation and produce an average loss of per week. &quot;2-4-6-8&quot;, a popular diet of this variety, follows a four-day cycle in which only 200 calories are consumed the first day, 400 the second day, 600 the third day, 800 the fourth day, and then totally fasting, after which the cycle repeats. There is some evidence that these diets results in considerable weight loss. These diets are not recommended for general use and should be reserved for the management of obesity as they are associated with adverse side effects such as loss of lean muscle mass, increased risks of gout, and electrolyte imbalances. People attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications.

The concept of crash dieting is to drastically reduce calories, using a very-low-calorie diet. Crash dieting can be highly dangerous because it can cause various kind of issues for the human body. Crash dieting can produce weight loss but without professional supervision all along, the extreme reduction in calories and potential unbalance in the diet&#x27;s composition can lead to detrimental effects, including sudden death.

===Fasting===

Fasting is the act of intentional taking a long time interval between meals. Lengthy fasting (multiple days in a week) might be dangerous due to the risk of malnutrition. During prolonged fasting or very low calorie diets the reduction of blood glucose, the preferred energy source of the brain, causes the body to deplete its glycogen stores. Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy by the rest of the body. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting, although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of intermittent fasting, have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent the issues of long fasting.

Intermittent fasting commonly takes the form of periodic fasting, alternate-day fasting, time-restricted feeding, and/or religious fasting. It can be a form of reduced-calorie dieting but pertains entirely to when the metabolism is activated during the day for digestion. The changes to eating habits on a regular basis do not have to be severe or absolutely restrictive to see benefits to cardiovascular health, such as improved glucose metabolism, reduced inflammation, and reduced blood pressure. Studies have suggested that for people in intensive care, an intermittent fasting regimen might &quot;[preserve] energy supply to vital organs and tissues... [and] powerfully activates cell-protective and cellular repair pathways, including autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defenses, which may promote resilience to cellular stress.&quot; The effects of decreased serum glucose and depleted hepatic glycogen causing the body to switch to ketogenic metabolism are similar to the effects of reduced carbohydrate-based diets. There is evidence demonstrating profound metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting in rodents. However, evidence is lacking or contradictory in humans and requires further investigation, especially over the long-term. Some evidence suggests that intermittent restriction of caloric intake has no weight-loss advantages over continuous calorie restriction plans. For adults, fasting diets appear to be safe and tolerable, however there is a possibility that periods of fasting and hunger could lead to overeating and to weight regain after the fasting period. Adverse effects of fasting are often moderate and include halitosis, fatigue, weakness, and headaches. Fasting diets may be harmful to children and the elderly.

=== Exclusion Diet ===
This type of diet is based on the restriction of specific foods or food groups. Examples include gluten-free, Paleo, plant-based, and Mediterranean diets.

Plant-based diets include vegetarian and vegan diets, and can range from the simple exclusion of meat products to diets that only include raw vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, and sprouted grains. Exclusion of animal products can reduce the intake of certain nutrients, which might lead to nutritional deficiencies of protein, iron, zinc, calcium, and vitamins D and B12. Therefore, long term implementation of a plant-based diet requires effective counseling and nutritional supplementation as necessary. Plant-based diets are effective for short-term treatment of overweight and obesity, likely due to the high consumption of low energy density foods. However, evidence for long-term efficacy is limited.

The Paleo diet includes foods that it identifies as having been available to Paleolithic peoples including meat, nuts, eggs, some oils, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Overall, it is high in protein and moderate in fats and carbohydrates. Some limited evidence suggests various health benefits and effective weight loss with this diet. However, similar to the plant-based diet, the Paleo diet has potential nutritional deficiency risks, specifically with vitamin D, calcium, and iodine.

Gluten-free diets are often used for weight loss but little has been studied about the efficacy of this diet and metabolic mechanism for its effectiveness is unclear.

The Mediterranean diet is characterized by high consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole-grain cereals, seafood, olive oil, and nuts. Red meat, dairy and alcohol are only recommended in moderation. Studies show that the Mediterranean diet is associated with short term as well as long term weight loss in addition to health and metabolic benefits.

===Detox===

Detox diets are promoted with unsubstantiated claims that they can eliminate &quot;toxins&quot; from the human body. Many of these diets use herbs or celery and other juicy low-calorie vegetables. Detox diets can include fasting or exclusion (as in juice fasting). Detox diets tend to result in short-term weight loss (because of calorie restriction), followed by weight gain.

===Environmentally sustainable===

Another kind of diet focuses not on the dieter&#x27;s health effects, but on its environment. The One Blue Dot plan of the BDA offers recommendations towards reducing diets&#x27; environmental impacts, by:
# Reducing meat to 70g per person per day.
# Prioritising plant proteins.
# Promoting fish from sustainable sources.
# Moderate dairy consumption.
# Focusing on wholegrain starchy foods.
# Promoting seasonal locally sourced fruits and vegetables.
# Reducing high fat, sugar and salty foods overconsumption.
# Promoting tap water and unsweetened tea/coffee as the de facto choice for healthy hydration.
# Reducing food waste.

==Effectiveness==
Several diets are effective for short-term weight loss for obese individuals, with diet success most predicted by adherence and little effect resulting from the type or brand of diet. As weight maintenance depends on calorie intake, diets emphasising certain macronutrients (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, etc.) have been shown to be no more effective than one another and no more effective than diets that maintain a typical mix of foods with smaller portions and perhaps some substitutions (e.g. low-fat milk, or less salad dressing). A meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials found no difference between low-calorie, low-carbohydrate, and low-fat diets in terms of short-term weight loss, with a 2–4 kilogram weight loss over 12–18 months in all studies. Diets that severely restrict calorie intake do not lead to long term weight loss. Extreme diets may, in some cases, lead to malnutrition.

A major challenge regarding weight loss and dieting relates to compliance. While dieting can effectively promote weight loss in the short term, the intervention is hard to maintain over time and suppresses skeletal muscle thermogenesis. Suppressed thermogenesis accelerates weight regain once the diet stops, unless that phase is accompanied by a well-timed exercise intervention, as described by the Summermatter cycle. Most diet studies do not assess long-term weight loss.

Some studies have found that, on average, short-term dieting results in a &quot;meaningful&quot; long-term weight-loss, although limited because of gradual 1 to 2 kg/year weight regain. Because people who do not participate in weight-loss programs also tend to gain weight over time, and baseline data from such &quot;untreated&quot; participants are typically not included in diet studies, it is possible that diets do result in lower weights in the long-term relative to people who do not diet. Others have suggested that dieting is ineffective as a long-term intervention. For each individual, the results will be different, with some even regaining more weight than they lost, while a few others achieve a tremendous loss, so that the &quot;average weight loss&quot; of a diet is not indicative of the results other dieters may achieve. A 2001 meta-analysis of 29 American studies found that participants of structured weight-loss programs maintained an average of 23% (3 kg) of their initial weight loss after five years, representing a sustained 3.2% reduction in body mass. Unfortunately, patients are generally unhappy with weight loss of &lt;10%, and reductions even as high as 10% are insufficient for changing someone with an &quot;obese&quot; BMI to a &quot;normal weight&quot; BMI.

Partly because diets do not reliably produce long-term positive health outcomes, some argue against using weight loss as a goal, preferring other measures of health such as improvements in cardiovascular biomarkers, sometimes called a Health at Every Size (HAES) approach or a &quot;weight neutral&quot; approach.

Long term losses from dieting are best maintained with continuing professional support, long term increases in physical activity, the use of anti-obesity medications, continued use of meal replacements, and additional periods of dieting to undo weight regain. The most effective approach to weight loss is an in-person, high-intensity, comprehensive lifestyle intervention: overweight or obese adults should maintain regular (at least monthly) contact with a trained interventionalist who can help them engage in exercise, monitor their body weight, and reduce their calorie consumption. Even with high-intensity, comprehensive lifestyle interventions (consisting of diet, physical exercise, and bimonthly or even more frequent contact with trained interventionists), gradual weight regain of 1–2 kg/year still occurs. For patients at high medical risk, bariatric surgery or medications may be warranted in addition to the lifestyle intervention, as dieting by itself may not lead to sustained weight loss.

Many studies overestimate the benefits of calorie restriction because the studies confound exercise and diet (testing the effects of diet and exercise as a combined intervention, rather than the effects of diet alone).

=== Adverse effects ===
==== Increased mortality rate ====
A number of studies have found that intentional weight loss is associated with an increase in mortality in people without weight-related health problems. A 2009 meta-analysis of 26 studies found that &quot;intentional weight loss had a small benefit for individuals classified as unhealthy (with obesity-related risk factors), especially unhealthy obese, but appeared to be associated with slightly increased mortality for healthy individuals, and for those who were overweight but not obese.&quot;

==== Dietary supplements ====
Due to extreme or unbalanced diets, dietary supplements are sometimes taken in an attempt to replace missing vitamins or minerals. While some supplements could be helpful for people eating an unbalanced diet (if replacing essential nutrients, for example), overdosing on any dietary supplement can cause a range of side effects depending on the supplement and dose that is taken. Supplements should not replace foods that are important to a healthy diet.

====Eating disorders====
In an editorial for &quot;Psychological Medicine&quot;, George Hsu concludes that dieting is likely to lead to the development of an eating disorder in the presence of certain risk factors. A 2006 study found that dieting and unhealthy weight-control behaviors were predictive of obesity and eating disorders five years later, with the authors recommending a &quot;shift away from dieting and drastic weight-control measures toward the long-term implementation of healthful eating and physical activity&quot;.

==Mechanism==
When the body is expending more energy than it is consuming (e.g. when exercising), the body&#x27;s cells rely on internally stored energy sources, such as complex carbohydrates and fats, for energy. The first source to which the body turns is glycogen (by glycogenolysis). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 kcal in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested macronutrients, mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins lipolysis, the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or fat cells, are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids, which can be used to generate energy. The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.

=== Set-Point Theory ===

The Set-Point Theory, first introduced in 1953, postulated that each body has a preprogrammed fixed weight, with regulatory mechanisms to compensate. This theory was quickly adopted and used to explain failures in developing effective and sustained weight loss procedures. A 2019 systematic review of multiple weight change procedures, including alternate day fasting and time-restricted feeding but also exercise and overeating, found systematic &quot;energetic errors&quot; for all these procedures. This shows that the body cannot precisely compensate for errors in energy/calorie intake, countering the Set-Point Theory and potentially explaining both weight loss and weight gain such as obesity. This review was conducted on short-term studies, therefore such a mechanism cannot be excluded in the long term, as evidence is currently lacking on this timeframe.

==Methods==
===Meal timing===
A meal timing schedule is known to be an important factor of any diet. Recent evidence suggest that new scheduling strategies, such as intermittent fasting or skipping meals, and strategically placed snacks before meals, may be recommendable to reduce cardiovascular risks as part of a broader lifestyle and dietary change.

===Food diary===
A 2008 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that dieters who kept a daily food diary (or diet journal), lost twice as much weight as those who did not keep a food log, suggesting that if a person records their eating, they are more aware of what they consume and therefore eat fewer calories.

===Water===

A 2009 review found limited evidence suggesting that encouraging water consumption and substituting energy-free beverages for energy-containing beverages (i.e., reducing caloric intake) may facilitate weight management. A 2009 article found that drinking 500 ml of water prior to meals for a 12-week period resulted in increased long-term weight reduction. (References given in main article.)

==Society==
It is estimated that about 1 out of 3 Americans is dieting at any given time. 85% of dieters are women. Approximately sixty billion dollars are spent every year in the USA on diet products, including &quot;diet foods&quot;, such as light sodas, gym memberships or specific regimes. 80% of dieters start by themselves, whereas 20% see a professional or join a paid program. The typical dieter attempts 4 tries per year.

===Weight loss groups===
Some weight loss groups aim to make money, others work as charities. The former include Weight Watchers and Peertrainer. The latter include Overeaters Anonymous, TOPS Club and groups run by local organizations.

These organizations&#x27; customs and practices differ widely. Some groups are modelled on twelve-step programs, while others are quite informal. Some groups advocate certain prepared foods or special menus, while others train dieters to make healthy choices from restaurant menus and while grocery-shopping and cooking.

Attending group meetings for weight reduction programmes rather than receiving one-on-one support may increase the likelihood that obese people will lose weight. Those who participated in groups had more treatment time and were more likely to lose enough weight to improve their health. Study authors suggested that one explanation for the difference is that group participants spent more time with the clinician (or whoever delivered the programme) than those receiving one-on-one support.

<doc id="8463" wikidata="Q1232" url="?curid=8463" title="Dubnium">
<text>Dubnium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Db and atomic number 105. It is highly radioactive: the most stable known isotope, dubnium-268, has a half-life of about 16 hours. This greatly limits extended research on the element.

Dubnium does not occur naturally on Earth and is produced artificially. The Soviet Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) claimed the first discovery of the element in 1968, followed by the American Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1970. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the Transfermium Working Group, formed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, resulting in credit for the discovery being officially shared between both teams. The element was formally named &quot;dubnium&quot; in 1997 after the town of Dubna, the site of the JINR.

Theoretical research establishes dubnium as a member of group 5 in the 6d series of transition metals, placing it under vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Dubnium should share most properties, such as its valence electron configuration and having a dominant +5 oxidation state, with the other group 5 elements, with a few anomalies due to relativistic effects. A limited investigation of dubnium chemistry has confirmed this.

==Introduction==
== Discovery ==
===Background===
Uranium, element 92, is the heaviest element to occur in significant quantities in nature; heavier elements can only be practically produced by synthesis. The first synthesis of a new element—neptunium, element 93—was achieved in 1940 by a team of researchers in the United States. In the following years, American scientists synthesized the elements up to mendelevium, element 101, which was synthesized in 1955. From element 102, the priority of discoveries was contested between American and Soviet physicists. Their rivalry resulted in a race for new elements and credit for their discoveries, later named the Transfermium Wars.

=== Reports ===

The first report of the discovery of element 105 came from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Soviet Union, in April 1968. The scientists bombarded 243Am with a beam of 22Ne ions, and reported 9.4 MeV (with a half-life of 0.1–3 seconds) and 9.7 MeV (&quot;t&quot;1/2 &gt; 0.05 s) alpha activities followed by alpha activities similar to those of either 256103 or 257103. Based on prior theoretical predictions, the two activity lines were assigned to 261105 and 260105, respectively.

: + → 265−&quot;x&quot;105 + &quot;x&quot; (&quot;x&quot; = 4, 5)

After observing the alpha decays of element 105, the researchers aimed to observe spontaneous fission (SF) of the element and study the resulting fission fragments. They published a paper in February 1970, reporting multiple examples of two such activities, with half-lives of 14 ms and . They assigned the former activity to 242mfAm and ascribed the latter activity to an isotope of element 105. They suggested that it was unlikely that this activity could come from a transfer reaction instead of element 105, because the yield ratio for this reaction was significantly lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction, in accordance with theoretical predictions. To establish that this activity was not from a (22Ne,&quot;x&quot;n) reaction, the researchers bombarded a 243Am target with 18O ions; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little SF activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, in line with theoretical data. The researchers concluded that the activities observed came from SF of element 105.

In April 1970, a team at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL), in Berkeley, California, United States, claimed to have synthesized element 105 by bombarding californium-249 with nitrogen-15 ions, with an alpha activity of 9.1 MeV. To ensure this activity was not from a different reaction, the team attempted other reactions: bombarding 249Cf with 14N, Pb with 15N, and Hg with 15N. They stated no such activity was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei matched those of 256103, implying that the parent nuclei were of 260105.

: + → 260105 + 4 

These results did not confirm the JINR findings regarding the 9.4 MeV or 9.7 MeV alpha decay of 260105, leaving only 261105 as a possibly produced isotope.

JINR then attempted another experiment to create element 105, published in a report in May 1970. They claimed that they had synthesized more nuclei of element 105 and that the experiment confirmed their previous work. According to the paper, the isotope produced by JINR was probably 261105, or possibly 260105. This report included an initial chemical examination: the thermal gradient version of the gas-chromatography method was applied to demonstrate that the chloride of what had formed from the SF activity nearly matched that of niobium pentachloride, rather than hafnium tetrachloride. The team identified a 2.2-second SF activity in a volatile chloride portraying eka-tantalum properties, and inferred that the source of the SF activity must have been element 105.

In June 1970, JINR made improvements on their first experiment, using a purer target and reducing the intensity of transfer reactions by installing a collimator before the catcher. This time, they were able to find 9.1 MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either 256103 or 257103, implying that the original isotope was either 260105 or 261105.

=== Naming controversy ===
JINR did not propose a name after their first report claiming synthesis of element 105, which would have been the usual practice. This led LBL to believe that JINR did not have enough experimental data to back their claim. After collecting more data, JINR proposed the name &quot;bohrium&quot; (Bo) in honor of the Danish nuclear physicist Niels Bohr, a founder of the theories of atomic structure and quantum theory; they soon changed their proposal to &quot;nielsbohrium&quot; (Ns) to avoid confusion with boron. Another proposed name was &quot;dubnium&quot;. When LBL first announced their synthesis of element 105, they proposed that the new element be named &quot;hahnium&quot; (Ha) after the German chemist Otto Hahn, the &quot;father of nuclear chemistry&quot;, thus creating an element naming controversy.

In the early 1970s, both teams reported synthesis of the next element, element 106, but did not suggest names. JINR suggested establishing an international committee to clarify the discovery criteria. This proposal was accepted in 1974 and a neutral joint group formed. Neither team showed interest in resolving the conflict through a third party, so the leading scientists of LBL—Albert Ghiorso and Glenn Seaborg—traveled to Dubna in 1975 and met with the leading scientists of JINR—Georgy Flerov, Yuri Oganessian, and others—to try to resolve the conflict internally and render the neutral joint group unnecessary; after two hours of discussions, this failed. The joint neutral group never assembled to assess the claims, and the conflict remained unresolved. In 1979, IUPAC suggested systematic element names to be used as placeholders until permanent names were established; under it, element 105 would be &quot;unnilpentium&quot;, from the Latin roots &quot;un-&quot; and &quot;nil-&quot; and the Greek root &quot;pent-&quot; (meaning &quot;one&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;, and &quot;five&quot;, respectively, the digits of the atomic number). Both teams ignored it as they did not wish to weaken their outstanding claims.

In 1981, the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI; &quot;Society for Heavy Ion Research&quot;) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany, claimed synthesis of element 107; their report came out five years after the first report from JINR but with greater precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. GSI acknowledged JINR&#x27;s efforts by suggesting the name &quot;nielsbohrium&quot; for the new element. JINR did not suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to determine its discoverers first.

In 1985, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) formed a Transfermium Working Group (TWG) to assess discoveries and establish final names for the controversial elements. The party held meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognition of an element, and in 1991, they finished the work on assessing discoveries and disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According to the report, the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 LBL experiment, closely followed by the June 1970 JINR experiment, so credit for the discovery of the element should be shared between the two teams.

LBL said that the input from JINR was overrated in the review. They claimed JINR was only able to unambiguously demonstrate the synthesis of element 105 a year after they did. JINR and GSI endorsed the report.

In 1994, IUPAC published a recommendation on naming the disputed elements. For element 105, they proposed &quot;joliotium&quot; (Jl) after the French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie, a contributor to the development of nuclear physics and chemistry; this name was originally proposed by the Soviet team for element 102, which by then had long been called nobelium. This recommendation was criticized by the American scientists for several reasons. Firstly, their suggestions were scrambled: the names &quot;rutherfordium&quot; and &quot;hahnium&quot;, originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were respectively reassigned to elements 106 and 108. Secondly, elements 104 and 105 were given names favored by JINR, despite earlier recognition of LBL as an equal co-discoverer for both of them. Thirdly and most importantly, IUPAC rejected the name &quot;seaborgium&quot; for element 106, having just approved a rule that an element could not be named after a living person, even though the 1993 report had given the LBL team the sole credit for its discovery.

In 1995, IUPAC abandoned the controversial rule and established a committee of national representatives aimed at finding a compromise. They suggested &quot;seaborgium&quot; for element 106 in exchange for the removal of all the other American proposals, except for the established name &quot;lawrencium&quot; for element 103. The equally entrenched name &quot;nobelium&quot; for element 102 was replaced by &quot;flerovium&quot; after Georgy Flerov, following the recognition by the 1993 report that that element had been first synthesized in Dubna. This was rejected by American scientists and the decision was retracted. The name &quot;flerovium&quot; was later used for element 114.

In 1996, IUPAC held another meeting, reconsidered all names in hand, and accepted another set of recommendations; it was approved and published in 1997. Element 105 was named &quot;dubnium&quot; (Db), after Dubna in Russia, the location of the JINR; the American suggestions were used for elements 102, 103, 104, and 106. The name &quot;dubnium&quot; had been used for element 104 in the previous IUPAC recommendation. The American scientists &quot;reluctantly&quot; approved this decision. IUPAC pointed out that the Berkeley laboratory had already been recognized several times, in the naming of berkelium, californium, and americium, and that the acceptance of the names &quot;rutherfordium&quot; and &quot;seaborgium&quot; for elements 104 and 106 should be offset by recognizing JINR&#x27;s contributions to the discovery of elements 104, 105, and 106.

Even after 1997, LBL still sometimes used the name &quot;hahnium&quot; for element 105 in their own material, doing so as recently as 2014. However, the problem was resolved in the literature as Jens Volker Kratz, editor of &quot;Radiochimica Acta&quot;, refused to accept papers not using the 1997 IUPAC nomenclature.
== Isotopes ==

Dubnium, having an atomic number of 105, is a superheavy element; like all elements with such high atomic numbers, it is very unstable. The longest-lasting known isotope of dubnium, 268Db, has a half-life of around a day. No stable isotopes have been seen, and a 2012 calculation by JINR suggested that the half-lives of all dubnium isotopes would not significantly exceed a day. Dubnium can only be obtained by artificial production.

The short half-life of dubnium limits experimentation. This is exacerbated by the fact that the most stable isotopes are the hardest to synthesize. Elements with a lower atomic number have stable isotopes with a lower neutron–proton ratio than those with higher atomic number, meaning that the target and beam nuclei that could be employed to create the superheavy element have fewer neutrons than needed to form these most stable isotopes. (Different techniques based on rapid neutron capture and transfer reactions are being considered as of the 2010s, but those based on the collision of a large and small nucleus still dominate research in the area.)

Only a few atoms of 268Db can be produced in each experiment, and thus the measured lifetimes vary significantly during the process. As of 2022, following additional experiments performed at the JINR&#x27;s Superheavy Element Factory (which started operations in 2019), the half-life of 268Db is measured to be hours. The second most stable isotope, 270Db, has been produced in even smaller quantities: three atoms in total, with lifetimes of 33.4 h, 1.3 h, and 1.6 h. These two are the heaviest isotopes of dubnium to date, and both were produced as a result of decay of the heavier nuclei 288Mc and 294Ts rather than directly, because the experiments that yielded them were originally designed in Dubna for 48Ca beams. For its mass, 48Ca has by far the greatest neutron excess of all practically stable nuclei, both quantitative and relative, which correspondingly helps synthesize superheavy nuclei with more neutrons, but this gain is compensated by the decreased likelihood of fusion for high atomic numbers.

== Predicted properties ==
According to the periodic law, dubnium should belong to group 5, with vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Several studies have investigated the properties of element 105 and found that they generally agreed with the predictions of the periodic law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to relativistic effects, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. These properties have remained challenging to measure for several reasons: the difficulties of production of superheavy atoms, the low rates of production, which only allows for microscopic scales, requirements for a radiochemistry laboratory to test the atoms, short half-lives of those atoms, and the presence of many unwanted activities apart from those of synthesis of superheavy atoms. So far, studies have only been performed on single atoms.

=== Atomic and physical ===
A direct relativistic effect is that as the atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus as a result of an increase of electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for the outermost s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though in dubnium they are not occupied): for example, the 7s orbital contracts by 25% in size and is stabilized by 2.6 eV.

A more indirect effect is that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move in larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are slightly more difficult to extract than its 6d electrons.
Another effect is the spin–orbit interaction, particularly spin–orbit splitting, which splits the 6d subshell—the azimuthal quantum number ℓ of a d shell is 2—into two subshells, with four of the ten orbitals having their ℓ lowered to 3/2 and six raised to 5/2. All ten energy levels are raised; four of them are lower than the other six. (The three 6d electrons normally occupy the lowest energy levels, 6d3/2.)

A singly ionized atom of dubnium (Db+) should lose a 6d electron compared to a neutral atom; the doubly (Db2+) or triply (Db3+) ionized atoms of dubnium should eliminate 7s electrons, unlike its lighter homologs. Despite the changes, dubnium is still expected to have five valence electrons. As the 6d orbitals of dubnium are more destabilized than the 5d ones of tantalum, and Db3+ is expected to have two 6d, rather than 7s, electrons remaining, the resulting +3 oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of tantalum. The ionization potential of dubnium in its maximum +5 oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of tantalum and the ionic radius of dubnium should increase compared to tantalum; this has a significant effect on dubnium&#x27;s chemistry.

Atoms of dubnium in the solid state should arrange themselves in a body-centered cubic configuration, like the previous group 5 elements. The predicted density of dubnium is 21.6 g/cm3.

=== Chemical ===
Computational chemistry is simplest in gas-phase chemistry, in which interactions between molecules may be ignored as negligible. Multiple authors have researched dubnium pentachloride; calculations show it to be consistent with the periodic laws by exhibiting the properties of a compound of a group 5 element. For example, the molecular orbital levels indicate that dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. Compared to its tantalum analog, dubnium pentachloride is expected to show increased covalent character: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).

Calculations of solution chemistry indicate that the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, will be more stable than those of niobium and tantalum and the +3 and +4 states will be less stable. The tendency towards hydrolysis of cations with the highest oxidation state should continue to decrease within group 5 but is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have shown a reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.

== Experimental chemistry ==
Experimental results of the chemistry of dubnium date back to 1974 and 1976. JINR researchers used a system and concluded that the volatility of dubnium bromide was less than that of niobium bromide and about the same as that of hafnium bromide. It is not certain that the detected fission products confirmed that the parent was indeed element 105. These results may imply that dubnium behaves more like hafnium than niobium.

The next studies on the chemistry of dubnium were conducted in 1988, in Berkeley. They examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was then compared with that of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces; the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. Surprisingly, the behavior on extraction from mixed nitric and hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketone differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that complexing behavior could not be predicted purely from simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.

This prompted further exploration of the chemical behavior of complexes of dubnium. Various labs jointly conducted thousands of repetitive chromatographic experiments between 1988 and 1993. All group 5 elements and protactinium were extracted from concentrated hydrochloric acid; after mixing with lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride, small amounts of hydrogen fluoride were added to start selective re-extraction. Dubnium showed behavior different from that of tantalum but similar to that of niobium and its pseudohomolog protactinium at concentrations of hydrogen chloride below 12 moles per liter. This similarity to the two elements suggested that the formed complex was either or . After extraction experiments of dubnium from hydrogen bromide into diisobutyl carbinol (2,6-dimethylheptan-4-ol), a specific extractant for protactinium, with subsequent elutions with the hydrogen chloride/hydrogen fluoride mix as well as hydrogen chloride, dubnium was found to be less prone to extraction than either protactinium or niobium. This was explained as an increasing tendency to form non‐extractable complexes of multiple negative charges. Further experiments in 1992 confirmed the stability of the +5 state: Db(V) was shown to be extractable from cation‐exchange columns with α‐hydroxyisobutyrate, like the group 5 elements and protactinium; Db(III) and Db(IV) were not. In 1998 and 1999, new predictions suggested that dubnium would extract nearly as well as niobium and better than tantalum from halide solutions, which was later confirmed.

The first isothermal gas chromatography experiments were performed in 1992 with 262Db (half-life 35 seconds). The volatilities for niobium and tantalum were similar within error limits, but dubnium appeared to be significantly less volatile. It was postulated that traces of oxygen in the system might have led to formation of , which was predicted to be less volatile than . Later experiments in 1996 showed that group 5 chlorides were more volatile than the corresponding bromides, with the exception of tantalum, presumably due to formation of . Later volatility studies of chlorides of dubnium and niobium as a function of controlled partial pressures of oxygen showed that formation of oxychlorides and general volatility are dependent on concentrations of oxygen. The oxychlorides were shown to be less volatile than the chlorides.

In 2004–05, researchers from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay product of the newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow further chemical experimentation, with a half-life of over a day. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer with dubnium was removed from the surface of the target and dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and a lanthanum carrier, from which various +3, +4, and +5 species were precipitated on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, where it converted to nitrate form and was then dried on a film and counted. Mostly containing a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, it also had a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further in both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and never in niobium-only fractions. It was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.

In 2009, at the JAEA tandem accelerator in Japan, dubnium was processed in nitric and hydrofluoric acid solution, at concentrations where niobium forms and tantalum forms . Dubnium&#x27;s behavior was close to that of niobium but not tantalum; it was thus deduced that dubnium formed . From the available information, it was concluded that dubnium often behaved like niobium, sometimes like protactinium, but rarely like tantalum.

In 2021, the volatile heavy group 5 oxychlorides MOCl3 (M = Nb, Ta, Db) were experimentally studied at the JAEA tandem accelerator. The trend in volatilities was found to be NbOCl3 &gt; TaOCl3 ≥ DbOCl3, so that dubnium behaves in line with periodic trends.

<doc id="8464" wikidata="Q173600" url="?curid=8464" title="Disaccharide">
<text>A disaccharide (also called a double sugar or biose) is the sugar formed when two monosaccharides are joined by glycosidic linkage. Like monosaccharides, disaccharides are simple sugars soluble in water. Three common examples are sucrose, lactose, and maltose.

Disaccharides are one of the four chemical groupings of carbohydrates (monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides). The most common types of disaccharides—sucrose, lactose, and maltose—have 12 carbon atoms, with the general formula C12H22O11. The differences in these disaccharides are due to atomic arrangements within the molecule.

The joining of monosaccharides into a double sugar happens by a condensation reaction, which involves the elimination of a water molecule from the functional groups only. Breaking apart a double sugar into its two monosaccharides is accomplished by hydrolysis with the help of a type of enzyme called a disaccharidase. As building the larger sugar ejects a water molecule, breaking it down consumes a water molecule. These reactions are vital in metabolism. Each disaccharide is broken down with the help of a corresponding disaccharidase (sucrase, lactase, and maltase).

==Classification==
There are two functionally different classes of disaccharides: 
*Reducing disaccharides, in which one monosaccharide, the reducing sugar of the pair, still has a free hemiacetal unit that can perform as a reducing aldehyde group; lactose, maltose and cellobiose are examples of reducing disaccharides, each with one hemiacetal unit, the other occupied by the glycosidic bond, which prevents it from acting as a reducing agent. They can easily be detected by the Woehlk test or Fearon&#x27;s test on methylamine.
*Non-reducing disaccharides, in which the component monosaccharides bond through an acetal linkage between their anomeric centers. This results in neither monosaccharide being left with a hemiacetal unit that is free to act as a reducing agent. Sucrose and trehalose are examples of non-reducing disaccharides because their glycosidic bond is between their respective hemiacetal carbon atoms. The reduced chemical reactivity of the non-reducing sugars, in comparison to reducing sugars, may be an advantage where stability in storage is important.

==Formation==
The formation of a disaccharide molecule from two monosaccharide molecules proceeds by displacing a hydroxy group from one molecule and a hydrogen nucleus (a proton) from the other, so that the new vacant bonds on the monosaccharides join the two monomers together. Because of the removal of the water molecule from the product, the term of convenience for such a process is &quot;dehydration reaction&quot; (also &quot;condensation reaction&quot; or &quot;dehydration synthesis&quot;). For example, milk sugar (lactose) is a disaccharide made by condensation of one molecule of each of the monosaccharides glucose and galactose, whereas the disaccharide sucrose in sugar cane and sugar beet, is a condensation product of glucose and fructose. Maltose, another common disaccharide, is condensed from two glucose molecules.

The dehydration reaction that bonds monosaccharides into disaccharides (and also bonds monosaccharides into more complex polysaccharides) forms what are called glycosidic bonds.

==Properties==
The glycosidic bond can be formed between any hydroxy group on the component monosaccharide. So, even if both component sugars are the same (e.g., glucose), different bond combinations (regiochemistry) and stereochemistry (&quot;alpha-&quot; or &quot;beta-&quot;) result in disaccharides that are diastereoisomers with different chemical and physical properties. Depending on the monosaccharide constituents, disaccharides are sometimes crystalline, sometimes water-soluble, and sometimes sweet-tasting and sticky-feeling. Disaccharides can serve as functional groups by forming glycosidic bonds with other organic compounds, forming glycosides.

==Assimilation==

Digestion of disaccharides involves breakdown into monosaccharides.

==Common disaccharides==

Maltose, cellobiose, and chitobiose are hydrolysis products of the polysaccharides starch, cellulose, and chitin, respectively.

Less common disaccharides include:

<doc id="8465" wikidata="Q5254470" url="?curid=8465" title="Dactylic hexameter">
<text>Dactylic hexameter (also known as heroic hexameter and the meter of epic) is a form of meter or rhythmic scheme frequently used in Ancient Greek and Latin poetry. The scheme of the hexameter is usually as follows (writing – for a long syllable, u for a short, and u u for a position that may be a long or two shorts):

:| – u u | – u u | – u u | – u u | – u u | – –
Here, &quot;|&quot; (pipe symbol) marks the beginning of a foot in the line.
Thus there are six feet, each of which is either a dactyl (– u u) or a spondee (– –). The first four feet can either be dactyls, spondees, or a mix. The fifth foot can also sometimes be a spondee, but this is rare, as it most often is a dactyl. The last foot is a spondee.

The hexameter is traditionally associated with classical epic poetry in both Greek and Latin and was consequently considered to be &quot;the&quot; grand style of Western classical poetry. Some well known examples of its use are Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot;, Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot; (an epic on Caesar&#x27;s civil war), Valerius Flaccus&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot;, and Statius&#x27;s &quot;Thebaid&quot;.

However, hexameters had a wide use outside of epic. Greek works in hexameters include Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot; and &quot;Theogony&quot;, Theocritus&#x27;s &quot;Idylls&quot;, and Callimachus&#x27;s hymns. In Latin famous works include Lucretius&#x27;s philosophical , Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot; and &quot;Georgics&quot;, book 10 of Columella&#x27;s manual on agriculture, as well as Latin satirical poems by the poets Lucilius, Horace, Persius, and Juvenal. The hexameter continued to be used in Christian times, for example in the of the 5th-century Irish poet Sedulius and Bernard of Cluny&#x27;s 12th-century satire among many others.

Hexameters also form part of elegiac poetry in both languages, the elegiac couplet being a dactylic hexameter line paired with a dactylic pentameter line. This form of verse was used for love poetry by Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid, for Ovid&#x27;s letters from exile, and for many of the epigrams of Martial.

== Structure ==
===Syllables===
Ancient Greek and Latin poetry is made up of long and short syllables arranged in various patterns. In Greek, a long syllable is () and a short syllable is (). In Latin the terms are and . The process of deciding which syllables are long and which are short is known as scansion.

A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong: , . It is also long (with certain exceptions) if it has a short vowel followed by two consonants, even if these are in different words: , , . In this case a syllable like &quot;et&quot; is said to be long by position.

There are some exceptions to the above rules, however. For example, &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;cr&quot;, &quot;pr&quot;, &quot;gr&quot;, and &quot;pl&quot; (and other combinations of a consonant with &quot;r&quot; or &quot;l&quot;) can count as a single consonant, so that the word could be pronounced either with the first syllable short or with the first syllable long. Also the letter &quot;h&quot; is ignored in scansion, so that in the phrase the syllable &quot;et&quot; remains short. &quot;qu&quot; counts as a single consonant, so that in the word &quot;water&quot; the first syllable is short, not like the Italian .

In certain words like , , , , and , &quot;i&quot; is a consonant, pronounced like the English &quot;y,&quot; so has three syllables and &quot;he threw&quot; has two. But in , the name of Aeneas&#x27;s son, &quot;I&quot; is a vowel and forms a separate syllable. &quot;Trojan&quot; has three syllables, but &quot;of Troy&quot; has two.

In some editions of Latin texts the consonant &quot;v&quot; is written as &quot;u&quot;, in which case &quot;u&quot; is also often consonantal. This can sometimes cause ambiguity; e.g., in the word (= ) &quot;he rolls&quot; the second &quot;u&quot; is a consonant, but in (= ) &quot;he wanted&quot; the second &quot;u&quot; is a vowel.

===Feet===
A hexameter line can be divided into six feet (Greek ἕξ &quot;hex&quot; = &quot;six&quot;). In strict dactylic hexameter, each foot would be a dactyl (a long and two short syllables, i.e. – u u), but classical meter allows for the substitution of a spondee (two long syllables, i.e. – –) in place of a dactyl in most positions. Specifically, the first four feet can either be dactyls or spondees more or less freely. The fifth foot is usually a dactyl (around 95% of the lines in Homer).

The sixth foot can be filled by either a trochee (a long then short syllable) or a spondee. Thus the dactylic line most normally is scanned as follows:
:| – u u | – u u | – u u | – u u | – u u | – x |

(Here &quot;–&quot; = a long syllable, &quot;u&quot; = a short syllable, &quot;u u&quot; = either one long or two shorts, and &quot;x&quot; = an &quot;anceps&quot; syllable, which can be long or short.)

An example of this in Latin is the first line of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;:
:
:&quot;I sing of arms, and of the man who first from the shores of Troy ...&quot;

The scansion is generally marked as follows, by placing long and short marks above the central vowel of each syllable:

 – u u | – u u | – – | – – | – u u | – –
 ar ma vi | rum que ca | nō Troj | jae quī | prī mu sa | bō rīs
 &quot;dactyl&quot; | &quot;dactyl&quot; | &quot;spondee&quot; | &quot;spondee&quot; | &quot;dactyl&quot; | &quot;spondee&quot;

(Spaces mark syllable breaks)

In dactylic verse, short syllables always come in pairs, so words such as &quot;soldiers&quot; or &quot;more easily&quot; cannot be used in a hexameter.

===Elision===
In Latin, when a word ends in a vowel or -m and is followed by a word starting with a vowel, the last vowel is usually elided (i.e. removed or pronounced quickly enough not to add to the length of the syllable), for example, . Again, &quot;h&quot; is ignored and does not prevent elision: .

In Greek, short vowels elide freely, and the elision is shown by an apostrophe, for example in line 2 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;: () &quot;which caused countless sufferings for the Achaeans&quot;. However, a long vowel is not elided: (). This feature is sometimes imitated in Latin for special effect, for example, &quot;with womanly wailing&quot; (&quot;Aen&quot;. 9.477).

When a vowel is elided, it does not count in the scansion; so for the purposes of scansion, has four syllables.

===Caesura===
Almost every hexameter has a word break, known as a caesura , in the middle of the 3rd foot, sometimes (but not always) coinciding with a break in sense. In most cases (85% of lines in Virgil) this comes after the first syllable of the 3rd foot, as in in the above example. This is known as a strong or masculine caesura.

When the 3rd foot is a dactyl, the caesura can come after the second syllable of the 3rd foot; this is known as a weak or feminine caesura. It is more common in Greek than in Latin. An example is the first line of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;:
:
:&quot;Tell me, Muse, of the man of many wiles, who very much ...&quot;

In Latin (but not in Greek, as the above example shows), whenever a feminine caesura is used in the 3rd foot, it is usually accompanied by masculine caesuras in the 2nd and 4th feet also:
:&quot;You are bidding me, o queen, to renew an unspeakable sorrow&quot;

Sometimes a line is found without a 3rd foot caesura, such as the following. In this case the 2nd and 4th foot caesuras are obligatory:
:&quot;then from his high couch Father Aeneas began as follows&quot;

==In Greek==

The hexameter was first used by early Greek poets of the oral tradition, and the most complete extant examples of their works are the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which influenced the authors of all later classical epics that survive today. Early epic poetry was also accompanied by music, and pitch changes associated with the accented Greek must have highlighted the melody, though the exact mechanism is still a topic of discussion.

The first line of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; provides an example:
:
:&quot;Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus’ son Achilles&quot;

Dividing the line into metrical units or feet it can be scanned as follows:
: (-&quot;deō&quot; is one syllable)
:dactyl, dactyl, spondee, dactyl, dactyl, spondee
: | – u u | – u u | –, – | – u u | – u u | – – |

This line also includes a masculine caesura after , a break that separates the line into two parts. Homer employs a feminine caesura more commonly than later writers. An example occurs in &quot;Iliad&quot; 1.5:
:&quot;... and every bird; and the plan of Zeus was fulfilled&quot;
:
:| – – | – u u | – u, u | – u u | – u u | – – |

Homer&#x27;s hexameters contain a higher proportion of dactyls than later hexameter poetry. They are also characterised by a laxer following of verse principles than later epicists almost invariably adhered to. For example, Homer allows spondaic fifth feet (albeit not often), whereas many later authors do not.

Homer also altered the forms of words to allow them to fit the hexameter, typically by using a dialectal form: &quot;ptolis&quot; is an epic form used instead of the Attic &quot;polis&quot; as necessary for the meter. Proper names sometimes take forms to fit the meter, for example &quot;Pouludamas&quot; instead of the metrically unviable &quot;Poludamas&quot;.

Some lines require a knowledge of the digamma for their scansion, e.g. &quot;Iliad&quot; 1.108:
:
:&quot;you have not yet spoken a good word nor brought one to pass&quot;
:
: | – – | – u u | – – | – u u | – u u | – – |

Here the word (&quot;epos&quot;) was originally (&quot;wepos&quot;) in Ionian; the digamma, later lost, lengthened the last syllable of the preceding (&quot;eipas&quot;) and removed the apparent defect in the meter. A digamma also saved the hiatus in the third foot. This example demonstrates the oral tradition of the Homeric epics that flourished before they were written down sometime in the 7th century BC.

Most of the later rules of hexameter composition have their origins in the methods and practices of Homer.

==In Latin==

The hexameter came into Latin as an adaptation from Greek long after the practice of singing the epics had faded. Consequentially, the properties of the meter were learned as specific rules rather than as a natural result of musical expression. Also, because the Latin language generally has a higher proportion of long syllables than Greek, it is by nature more spondaic. Thus the Latin hexameter took on characteristics of its own.

===Ennius===
The earliest example of hexameter in Latin poetry is the &quot;Annales&quot; of Ennius (now mostly lost except for about 600 lines), which established it as the standard for later Latin epics; it was written towards the end of Ennius&#x27;s life about 172 BC. Ennius experimented with different kinds of lines, for example, lines with five dactyls:
:&quot;Then the trumpet with terrifying sound went &#x27;taratantara!&#x27;&quot;

or lines consisting entirely of spondees:
:&quot;To him replied the king of Alba Longa&quot;

lines without a caesura:
:&quot;With scattered long spears the plain gleams and bristles&quot;

lines ending in a one-syllable word or in words of more than three syllables:
:&quot;A single man, by delaying, restored the situation for us.&quot;
:
:&quot;I do not demand gold for myself nor should you give me a price:
:not buying and selling war, but waging it&quot;

or even lines starting with two short syllables:
: | u u – | – – | –, u u | – – | – u u | – –
:&quot;the blacktail, the rainbow wrasse, the bird wrasse, and the maigre&quot; (kinds of fish)

However, most of these features were abandoned by later writers or used only occasionally for special effect.

===Later writers===
Later Republican writers, such as Lucretius, Catullus, and even Cicero, wrote hexameter compositions, and it was at this time that the principles of Latin hexameter were firmly established and followed by later writers such as Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Lucan, and Juvenal. Virgil&#x27;s opening line for the &quot;Aeneid&quot; is a classic example:
:&quot;I sing of arms and of the man who first from the shores of Troy ...&quot;

In Latin, lines were arranged so that the metrically long syllables—those occurring at the beginning of a foot—often avoided the natural stress of a word. In the earlier feet of a line, meter and stress were expected to clash, while in the last two feet they were expected to coincide, as in above. The coincidence of word accent and meter in the last two feet could be achieved by restricting the last word to one of two or three syllables.

Most lines (about 85% in Virgil) have a caesura or word division after the first syllable of the 3rd foot, as above . This is known as a strong or masculine caesura. Because of the penultimate accent in Latin, this ensures that the word accent and meter will not coincide in the 3rd foot. But in those lines with a feminine or weak caesura, such as the following, there is inevitably a coincidence of meter and accent in the 3rd foot:
:&quot;there follows shouting of men and rattling of ropes&quot;

To offset this, whenever there was a feminine caesura in the 3rd foot, there was usually also a masculine caesura in the 2nd and 4th feet, to ensure that in those feet at least, the word accent and meter did not coincide.

===Metrical effects===

By the age of Augustus, poets like Virgil closely followed the rules of the meter and approached it in a highly rhetorical way, looking for effects that can be exploited in skilled recitation. For example, the following line from the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (8.596) describes the movement and sound of galloping horses:
:&quot;with four-footed sound the hoof shakes the crumbling plain&quot;

This line is made up of five dactyls and a closing spondee, an unusual rhythmic arrangement that imitates the described action. A different effect is found in 8.452, where Virgil describes how the blacksmith sons of Vulcan forged Aeneas&#x27; shield. The five spondees and the word accents cutting across the verse rhythm give an impression of huge effort:
:&quot;They with much force raise their arms one after another&quot;

A slightly different effect is found in the following line (3.658), describing the terrifying one-eyed giant Polyphemus, blinded by Ulysses. Here again there are five spondees but there are also three elisions, which cause the word accent of all the words but to coincide with the beginning of each foot:
:&quot;A horrendous huge shapeless monster, whose eye (lit. light) had been removed&quot;

A succession of long syllables in some lines indicates slow movement, as in the following example where Aeneas and his companion the Sibyl (a priestess of Apollo) were entering the darkness of the world of the dead:
:&quot;they were going in the darkness beneath the lonely night through the shadow&quot;

The following example (&quot;Aeneid&quot; 2.9) describes how Aeneas is reluctant to begin his narrative, since it is already past midnight. The feminine caesura after without a following 4th-foot caesura ensures that all the last four feet have word accent at the beginning, which is unusual. The monotonous effect is reinforced by the assonance of &quot;dent ... dent&quot; and the alliteration of S ... S:
:
:&quot;And already the moist night is falling from the sky
:and the setting constellations are inviting sleep&quot;

Dactyls are associated with sleep again in the following unusual line, which describes the activity of a priestess who is feeding a magic serpent (&quot;Aen.&quot; 4.486). In this line, there are five dactyls, and every one is accented on the first syllable:
:&quot;sprinkling moist honey and sleep-inducing poppy&quot;

A different technique, at 1.105, is used when describing a ship at sea during a storm. Here Virgil places a single-syllable word at the end of the line. This produces a jarring rhythm that echoes the crash of a large wave against the side of the ship:
:
:&quot;(The boat) gives its side to the waves; there immediately follows in a heap a steep mountain of water.&quot;

The Roman poet Horace uses a similar trick to highlight the comedic irony in this famous line from his &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; (line 139):
:&quot;The mountains will be in labor, but all that will be born is a ridiculous ... mouse&quot;

Usually in Latin the 5th foot of a hexameter is a dactyl. However, in his poem 64, Catullus several times uses a 5th foot spondee, which gives a Greek flavour to his verse, as in this line describing the forested Vale of Tempe in northern Greece:
:&quot;Tempe, which woods surround, hanging over it&quot;

Virgil also occasionally imitates Greek practice, for example, in the first line of his 3rd Eclogue:
:&quot;Tell me, Damoetas, whose cattle are these? Are they Meliboeus&#x27;s?&quot;

Here there is a break in sense after a 4th-foot dactyl, a feature known as a bucolic diaeresis, because it is frequently used in Greek pastoral poetry. In fact it is common in Homer too (as in the first line of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; quoted above), but rare in Latin epic.

===Stylistic features of epic===
Certain stylistic features are characteristic of epic hexameter poetry, especially as written by Virgil.

====Enjambment====
Hexameters are frequently enjambed—the meaning runs over from one line to the next, without terminal punctuation—which helps to create the long, flowing narrative of epic. Sentences can also end in different places in the line, for example, after the first foot. In this, classical epic differs from medieval Latin, where the lines are often composed individually, with a break in sense at the end of each one.

====Poetic vocabulary====
Often in poetry ordinary words are replaced by poetic ones, for example or for water, for sea, for ship, for river, and so on. Some ordinary Latin words are avoided, e.g. etc., simply because they cannot be fitted into a hexameter verse.

====Hyperbaton====
It is common in poetry for adjectives to be widely separated from their nouns, and quite often one adjective–noun pair is interleaved with another. This feature is known as hyperbaton &quot;stepping over&quot;. An example is the opening line of Lucan&#x27;s epic on the Civil War:
:&quot;Wars through the Emathian – more than civil – plains&quot;

Another example is the opening of Ovid&#x27;s mythological poem Metamorphoses where the word &quot;new&quot; is in a different line from &quot;bodies&quot; which it describes:

: (Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.1)
:&quot;My spirit leads me to tell of forms transformed into new bodies.&quot;

One particular arrangement of words that seems to have been particularly admired is the golden line, a line which contains two adjectives, a verb, and two nouns, with the first adjective corresponding to the first noun such as:
:&quot;and the barbarian pipe was strident with horrible music&quot;

Catullus was the first to use this kind of line, as in the above example. Later authors used it rarely (1% of lines in Ovid), but in silver Latin it became increasingly popular.

====Alliteration and assonance====

Virgil in particular used alliteration and assonance frequently, although it is much less common in Ovid. Often more than one consonant was alliterated and not necessarily at the beginning of words, for example:
:
:&quot;But the queen, now long wounded by grave anxiety,
:feeds the wound in her veins and is tormented by an unseen fire&quot;

Also in Virgil:
: &quot;places silent with night everywhere&quot;
: &quot;those ones with oars sweep the dark shallows&quot;

Sometimes the same vowel is repeated:
:&quot;on me, me, I who did it am here, turn your swords on me!&quot;
:&quot;he does not let go of the reins, but he is not strong enough to hold them back, and he does not know the names of the horses&quot;

====Rhetorical techniques====
Rhetorical devices such as anaphora, antithesis, and rhetorical questions are frequently used in epic poetry. Tricolon is also common:
:
:&quot;All this crowd that you see, are the poor and unburied;
:that ferryman is Charon; these, that the wave is carrying, are the buried.&quot;

====Genre of subject matter====
The poems of Homer, Virgil, and Ovid often vary their narrative with speeches. Well known examples are the speech of Queen Dido cursing Aeneas in book 4 of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the lament of the nymph Juturna when she is unable to save her brother Turnus in book 12 of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, and the quarrel between Ajax and Ulysses over the arms of Achilles in book 13 of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Some speeches are themselves narratives, as when Aeneas tells Queen Dido about the fall of Troy and his voyage to Africa in books 2 and 3 of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Other styles of writing include vivid descriptions, such as Virgil&#x27;s description of the god Charon in &quot;Aeneid&quot; 6, or Ovid&#x27;s description of Daedalus&#x27;s labyrinth in book 8 of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;; similes, such as Virgil&#x27;s comparison of the souls of the dead to autumn leaves or clouds of migrating birds in &quot;Aeneid&quot; 6; and lists of names, such as when Ovid names 36 of the dogs who tore their master Actaeon to pieces in book 3 of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

===Conversational style===
Raven divides the various styles of the hexameter in classical Latin into three types: the early stage (Ennius), the fully developed type (Cicero, Catullus, Virgil, and Ovid, with Lucretius about midway between Ennius and Cicero), and the conversational type, especially Horace, but also to an extent Persius and Juvenal. One feature which marks these off is their often irregular line endings (for example, words of one syllable) and also the very conversational, un-epic style. Horace in fact called his satires (&quot;conversations&quot;). The word order and vocabulary is much as might be expected in prose. An example is the opening of the 9th satire of book 1:
:
:

:&quot;I was walking by chance along the Sacred Way, as is my custom,
:meditating on some trifle or other, completely absorbed in it,
:when suddenly up ran a certain person known to me by name only.
:He grabbed my hand and said &#x27;How are you, sweetest of things?&#x27;&quot;

===Silver Age and Late Empire===

The verse innovations of the Augustan writers were carefully imitated by their successors in the Silver Age of Latin literature. The verse form itself then was little changed as the quality of a poet&#x27;s hexameter was judged against the standard set by Virgil and the other Augustan poets, a respect for literary precedent encompassed by the Latin word &#x27;. Deviations were generally regarded as idiosyncrasies or hallmarks of personal style and were not imitated by later poets. Juvenal, for example, was fond of occasionally creating verses that placed a sense break between the fourth and fifth foot (instead of in the usual caesura positions), but this technique—known as the bucolic diaeresis—did not catch on with other poets.

In the late empire, writers experimented again by adding unusual restrictions to the standard hexameter. The rhopalic verse of Ausonius is a good example; besides following the standard hexameter pattern, each word in the line is one syllable longer than the previous, e.g.:
:

:&quot;O God, Hope of Eternal Life, Conciliator,
:if, with chaste entreaties, hoping for pardon, we keep vigil,
:look kindly on us and grant these prayers.&quot;

Also notable is the tendency among late grammarians to thoroughly dissect the hexameters of Virgil and earlier poets. A treatise on poetry by Diomedes Grammaticus is a good example, as this work categorizes dactylic hexameter verses in ways that were later interpreted under the golden line rubric. Independently, these two trends show the form becoming highly artificial—more like a puzzle to solve than a medium for personal poetic expression.

===Middle Ages===
By the Middle Ages, some writers adopted more relaxed versions of the meter. Bernard of Cluny, in the 12th century, for example, employs it in his &quot;De Contemptu Mundi&quot;, but ignores classical conventions in favor of accentual effects and predictable rhyme both within and between verses, e.g.:
:
:

:&quot;These are the last days, the worst of times: let us keep watch.
:Behold the menacing arrival of the supreme Judge.
:He is coming, he is coming to end evil, to crown just actions,
:Reward what is right, free us from anxieties, and give the heavens.&quot;

Not all medieval writers are so at odds with the Virgilian standard, and with the rediscovery of classical literature, later Medieval and Renaissance writers are far more orthodox, but by then the form had become an academic exercise. Petrarch, for example, devoted much time to his &quot;Africa&quot;, a dactylic hexameter epic on Scipio Africanus, completed in 1341, but this work was unappreciated in his time and remains little read today. It begins as follows:
:

:&quot;To me also, o Muse, tell of the man, 
:conspicuous for his merits and fearsome in war,
:to whom noble Africa, broken beneath Italian arms,
:first gave its eternal name.&quot;

In contrast, Dante decided to write his epic, the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; in Italian—a choice that defied the traditional epic choice of Latin dactylic hexameters—and produced a masterpiece beloved both then and now.

With the Neo-Latin period, the language itself came to be regarded as a medium only for serious and learned expression, a view that left little room for Latin poetry. The emergence of Recent Latin in the 20th century restored classical orthodoxy among Latinists and sparked a general (if still academic) interest in the beauty of Latin poetry. Today, the modern Latin poets who use the dactylic hexameter are generally as faithful to Virgil as Rome&#x27;s Silver Age poets.

==In modern languages==
===In English===
Many poets have attempted to write dactylic hexameters in English, though few works composed in the meter have stood the test of time. Most such works are accentual rather than quantitative. Perhaps the most famous is Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Evangeline&quot;, whose first lines are as follows:

:&quot;This is the / forest pri/meval. The / murmuring / pines and the / hemlocks
:Bearded with / moss, and in / garments / green, indis/tinct in the / twilight,
:Stand like / Druids of / eld, with / voices / sad and pro/phetic...&quot;

Contemporary poet Annie Finch wrote her epic libretto &quot;Among the Goddesses&quot; in dactylic tetrameter, which she claims is the most accurate English accentual equivalent of dactylic hexameter. Poets who have written quantitative hexameters in English include Robert Bridges and Rodney Merrill, whose translation of part of the &quot;Iliad&quot; begins as follows (see External links below):

:&quot;Sing now, / goddess, the / wrath of A/chilles the / scion of / Peleus,
:Ruinous / rage, which / brought the A/chaeans un/counted af/flictions;
:Many the / powerful / souls it / sent to the / dwelling of / Hades...&quot;

Although the rules seem simple, it is hard to use classical hexameter in English because English is a stress-timed language that condenses vowels and consonants between stressed syllables, while hexameter relies on the regular timing of the phonetic sounds. Languages having the latter properties (i.e., languages that are not stress-timed) include Ancient Greek, Latin, Lithuanian and Hungarian.

===In German===
Dactylic hexameter has proved more successful in German than in most modern languages. Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock&#x27;s epic &quot;Der Messias&quot; popularized accentual dactylic hexameter in German. Subsequent German poets to employ the form include Goethe (notably in his &quot;Reineke Fuchs&quot;) and Schiller.

The opening lines of Goethe&#x27;s (&quot;Reynard the Fox&quot;), written in 1793–1794, are:
:
:

:&quot;Pentecost, the lovely festival, had come; field and forest
:grew green and bloomed; on hills and ridges, in bushes and hedges
:The newly encouraged birds practised a merry song;
:Every meadow sprouted with flowers in fragrant grounds,
:The sky shone festively cheerfully and the earth was colourful.&quot;

===In French===
Jean-Antoine de Baïf (1532–1589) wrote poems regulated by quantity on the Greco–Roman model, a system which came to be known as &quot;vers mesurés&quot;, or &quot;vers mesurés à l&#x27;antique&quot;, which the French language of the Renaissance permitted. To do this, he invented a special phonetic alphabet. In works like his &quot;Étrénes de poézie Franzoęze an vęrs mezurés&quot; (1574) or &quot;Chansonnettes&quot; he used the dactylic hexameter, and other meters, in a quantitative way.

An example of one of his elegiac couplets is as follows. The final -e of , , and is sounded, and the word is pronounced /i/:
:
:| – u u | – – | – u u | – – | – u u | – –
:| – u u | – u u | – || – u u | – u u | –
:&quot;Let the handsome Narcissus come, who never loved another except himself,
:and let him look at your eyes, and let him try not to love you.&quot;

A modern attempt at reproducing the dactylic hexameter in French is this one, by André Markowicz (1985), translating Catullus&#x27;s poem 63. Again the final -e and -es of , , and are sounded:
:
:| – – | – u u | – u u | – u u | – u u | – – |
:| – u u | – – | – u u | – u u | – u u | – – |
:&quot;Is it for this that you have snatched me from the altars of my ancestors,
:to abandon me, traitorous Theseus, on these deserted shores?&quot;

===In Hungarian===
Hungarian is extremely suitable to hexameter (and other forms of poetry based on quantitative meter). It has been applied to Hungarian since 1541, introduced by the grammarian János Sylvester.

A hexameter can even occur spontaneously. For example, a student may extricate themselves from failing to remember a poem by saying the following, which is a hexameter in Hungarian:

:Itt ela/kadtam, / sajnos / nem jut e/szembe a / többi.
:&quot;I&#x27;m stuck here, unfortunately the rest won&#x27;t come into my mind.&quot;

Sándor Weöres included an ordinary nameplate text in one of his poems (this time, a pentameter):

:Tóth Gyula / bádogos / és // vízveze/ték-szere/lő.
:&quot;Gyula Tóth tinsmith and plumber&quot;

A label on a bar of chocolate went as follows, another hexameter, noticed by the poet Dániel Varró:

:Tejcsoko/ládé / sárgaba/rack- és / kekszdara/bokkal
:&quot;Milk chocolate with apricot and biscuit bits&quot;

Due to this feature, the hexameter has been widely used both in translated (Greek and Roman) and in original Hungarian poetry up to the twentieth century (e.g. by Miklós Radnóti).

===In Lithuanian===
&quot;The Seasons&quot; (&quot;Metai&quot;) by Kristijonas Donelaitis is a famous Lithuanian poem in quantitative dactylic hexameters. Because of the nature of Lithuanian, more than half of the lines of the poem are entirely spondaic save for the mandatory dactyl in the fifth foot.

<doc id="8466" wikidata="Q8837" url="?curid=8466" title="Dorado">
<text>Dorado (, ) is a constellation in the Southern Sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the mahi-mahi (&quot;Coryphaena hippurus&quot;), which is known as &quot;dorado&quot; (&quot;golden&quot;) in Spanish, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish. Dorado contains most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa. The South Ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation.

Even though the name Dorado is not Latin but Spanish, astronomers give it the Latin genitive form &quot;Doradus&quot; when naming its stars; it is treated (like the adjacent asterism Argo Navis) as a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -ō (like &quot;Io&quot; or &quot;Callisto&quot; or &quot;Argo&quot;), which have a genitive ending &quot;-ūs&quot;.

==History==
Dorado was one of twelve constellations named by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. It appeared:
* On a celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius.
* First depiction in a celestial atlas, in Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603.
* In Johannes Kepler&#x27;s edition of Tycho Brahe&#x27;s star list in the &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot; of 1627; this was the first time that it was given the alternative name Xiphias, the swordfish. The name Dorado ultimately became dominant and was adopted by the IAU.
Dorado represents a dolphinfish; it has also been called the goldfish because Dorado are gold-colored.

==Features==
===Stars===
Alpha Doradus is a blue-white star of magnitude 3.3, 176 light-years from Earth. It is the brightest star in Dorado. Beta Doradus is a notably bright Cepheid variable star. It is a yellow-tinged supergiant star that has a minimum magnitude of 4.1 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5. One thousand and forty light-years from Earth, Beta Doradus has a period of 9 days and 20 hours.

R Doradus is one of the many variable stars in Dorado. S Dor, 9.721 hypergiant in the Large Magellanic Cloud, is the prototype of S Doradus variable stars. The variable star R Doradus 5.73 has the largest-known apparent size of any star other than the Sun. Gamma Doradus is the prototype of the Gamma Doradus variable stars.

Supernova 1987A was the closest supernova to occur since the invention of the telescope. SNR 0509-67.5 is the remnant of an unusually energetic Type 1a supernova from about 400 years ago.

HE 0437-5439 is a hypervelocity star escaping from the Milky Way/Magellanic Cloud system.

Dorado is also the location of the South Ecliptic pole, which lies near the fish&#x27;s head. The pole was called &quot;Polus Doradinalis&quot; by Philipp von Zesen, aka Caesius.

In early 2020, the exoplanet TOI-700 d was discovered orbiting the star TOI-700 in Dorado. This is the first potentially Earth-like exoplanet to be discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.

===Deep-sky objects===
Because Dorado contains part of the Large Magellanic Cloud, it is rich in deep sky objects. The Large Magellanic Cloud, 25,000 light-years in diameter, is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way Galaxy, located at a distance of 179,000 light-years. It has been deformed by its gravitational interactions with the larger Milky Way. In 1987, it became host to SN 1987A, the first supernova of 1987 and the closest since 1604. This 25,000-light-year-wide galaxy contains over 10,000 million stars. All coordinates given are for Epoch J2000.0.
* N 180B is an emission nebula located in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
* NGC 1566 (RA 04h 20m 00s Dec -56° 56.3′) is a face-on spiral galaxy. It gives its name to the NGC 1566 Group of galaxies.
* NGC 1755 (RA 04h 55m 13s Dec -68° 12.2′) is a globular cluster.
* NGC 1763 (RA 04h 56m 49s Dec -68° 24.5′) is a bright nebula associated with three type B stars.

* NGC 1936 (RA 05h 22m 14s Dec -67° 58.7′) is a bright nebula and is one of four NGC objects in close proximity, the others being NGC 1929, NGC 1934 and NGC 1935.
* NGC 1978 (RA 05h 28m 36s Dec -66° 14.0′) is an open cluster.
* NGC 2002 (RA 05h 30m 17s Dec -66° 53.1′) is an open cluster.
* NGC 2014 (RA 05h 44m 12.7s Dec −67° 42′ 57″) is a red emission nebula.
* NGC 2020 (RA 05h 44m 12.7s Dec −67° 42′ 57″) is an HII region surrounding a Wolf–Rayet star.
* NGC 2027 (RA 05h 35m 00s Dec -66° 55.0′) is an open cluster.
* NGC 2032 (RA 05h 35m 21s Dec -67° 34.1′; also known as &quot;Seagull Nebula&quot;) is a nebula complex that contains four NGC designations: NGC 2029, NGC 2032, NGC 2035 and NGC 2040. 

* NGC 2074 (RA 05h 39m 03.0s Dec −69° 29′ 54″) is an emission nebula.
* NGC 2078 (RA 05h 39m 54s Dec −69° 44′ 54″) is an emission nebula.
* NGC 2080, also called the &quot;Ghost Head Nebula&quot;, is an emission nebula that is 50 light-years wide in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It is named for the two distinct white patches that it possesses, which are regions of recent star formation. The western portion is colored green from doubly ionized oxygen, the southern portion is red from hydrogen alpha emissions, and the center region is colored yellow from both oxygen and hydrogen emissions. The western white patch, A1, has one massive, recently formed star inside. The eastern patch, A2, has several stars hidden in its dust.
* Tarantula Nebula is in the Large Magellanic Cloud, named for its spiderlike shape. It is also designated 30 Doradus, as it is visible to the naked eye as a slightly out-of-focus star. Larger than any nebula in the Milky Way at 1,000 light-years in diameter, it is also brighter, because it is illuminated by the open star cluster NGC 2070, which has at its center the star cluster R136. The illuminating stars are supergiants.

* NGC 2164 (RA 05h 58m 53s Dec -68° 30.9′) is a globular cluster.
* N44 is a superbubble in the Large Magellanic Cloud that is 1,000 light-years wide. Its overall structure is shaped by the 40 hot stars towards its center. Within the superbubble of N44 is a smaller bubble catalogued as N44F. It is approximately 35 light-years in diameter and is shaped by an incredibly hot star at its center, which has a stellar wind speed of 7 million kilometers per hour. N44F also features dust columns with probable star formation hidden inside.

==Equivalents==
In Chinese astronomy, the stars of Dorado are in two of Xu Guangqi&#x27;s Southern Asterisms (近南極星區, &quot;Jìnnánjíxīngōu&quot;): the White Patches Attached (夾白, &quot;Jiābái&quot;) and the Goldfish (金魚, &quot;Jīnyú&quot;).

==Namesakes==
* &quot;Dorado &quot;(SS-248) and &quot;Dorado&quot; (SS-526), two United States Navy submarines, were named after the same sea creature as the constellation.

<doc id="8467" wikidata="Q28626" url="?curid=8467" title="Draco (lawgiver)">
<text>Draco (; , ), also called Drako or Drakon, according to Athenian tradition, was the first legislator of Athens in Ancient Greece. He replaced the system of oral law and blood feud by the Draconian constitution, a written code to be enforced only by a court of law. His laws were supposed to have been very harsh, establishing the death penalty for most offenses. Tradition held that all of his laws were repealed by Solon, save for those on homicide. An inscription from 409/8 BC contains part of the current law and refers to it as &quot;the law of Draco about homicide&quot;. Nothing is known about the specifics of other laws established by Draco.

According to some scholars, Draco may have been a fictional figure, entirely or in part. Biographical information about him is almost entirely lacking; he was held to have established his legal code in the year 621/620 BC. Since the 19th century, the adjective &quot;draconian&quot; (Greek: , ) refers to similarly unforgiving rules or laws in Greek, English, and other European languages.

== Historicity ==
Nothing is known about Draco&#x27;s life except that he established his legal code during the reign of the archon Aristaechmus in the year 621/620 BC. The &quot;Suda&quot;, the 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, records a folkloric story about Draco&#x27;s death: he went to Aegina to establish laws and was suffocated in the theater when his supporters honored him by throwing many hats, shirts and cloaks on him. Some scholars question whether Draco was a real historical figure or consider that he may have been partially fictional. Karl Julius Beloch hypothesized that Draco was not a person; &quot;drakon&quot; means &#x27;serpent&#x27; in Greek, and a sacred serpent on the acropolis was worshipped in the Athenian religion. Therefore, the &quot;laws of Draco&quot; may have been laws issued in the name of the sacred serpent by its priests; later, this origin was forgotten and Draco was reinterpreted as a lawgiver. Raphael Sealey notes that this hypothesis helps explain how the seemingly protracted development of Athenian homicide law could be attributed to a single source. However, most scholars believe that Draco really did establish laws on homicide and other offenses, and some accept the attribution to him of the inscription partially recording the homicide law.

==Draconian constitution==

The laws ( – ) that he laid were the first written constitution of Athens. So that no one would be unaware of them, they were posted on wooden tablets ( – ), where they were preserved for almost two centuries on steles of the shape of four-sided pyramids ( – ). The tablets were called , perhaps because they could be pivoted along the pyramid&#x27;s axis to read any side.

The constitution featured several major innovations:
*Instead of oral laws known to a special class, arbitrarily applied and interpreted, all laws were written, thus being made known to all literate citizens (who could appeal to the Areopagus for injustices): &quot;the constitution formed under Draco, when the first code of laws was drawn up&quot;. (Aristotle: Athenian Constitution, Part 5, Section 41)
*The laws distinguish between murder and involuntary homicide, a novel concept at that time.

The laws were particularly harsh. For example, any debtor whose status was lower than that of his creditor was forced into slavery. The punishment was more lenient for those owing a debt to a member of a lower class. The death penalty was the punishment for even minor offences, such as stealing a cabbage. Concerning the liberal use of the death penalty in the Draconic code, Plutarch states:

All Draco&#x27;s laws were repealed by Solon in the early 6th century BC, with the exception of the homicide law.

==Homicide law==
After much debate, the Athenians decided to revise the laws, including the homicide law, in 409 BC. The text of the homicide law is partially preserved in a fragmentary inscription. It states that it is up to the victim&#x27;s relatives to prosecute a killer.

According to the preserved part of the inscription, unintentional homicides received a sentence of exile. It is not clear whether Draco&#x27;s law specified the punishment for intentional homicide. In 409 BC, intentional homicide was punished by death, but Draco&#x27;s law begins: &quot;.&quot; Although ambiguous and difficult to translate, one suggested translation is: &quot;Even if a man not intentionally kills another, he is exiled.&quot;

==Council of Four Hundred==
Draco introduced the lot-chosen Council of Four Hundred, distinct from the Areopagus, which evolved in later constitutions to play a large role in Athenian democracy. Aristotle notes that Draco, while having the laws written, merely legislated for an existing unwritten Athenian constitution such as setting exact qualifications for eligibility for office.

According to Aristotle, Draco extended the franchise to all free men who could furnish themselves with a set of military equipment. However, this claim is not based on the authentic tradition, thus untrue as claimed by Welwei in 1998. They elected the Council of Four Hundred from among their number; nine archons and the treasurers were drawn from persons possessing an unencumbered property of not less than ten &quot;minas&quot;, the generals (&quot;strategoi&quot;) and commanders of cavalry (&quot;hipparchoi&quot;) from those who could show an unencumbered property of not less than a hundred &quot;minas&quot; and had children born in lawful wedlock over ten years of age. Thus, in the event of their death, their estate could pass to a competent heir. These officers were required to hold to account the &quot;prytanes&quot; (councillors), &quot;strategoi&quot; (generals) and &quot;hipparchoi&quot; (cavalry officers) of the preceding year until their accounts had been audited. &quot;The Council of Areopagus was guardian of the laws, and kept watch over the magistrates to see that they executed their offices in accordance with the laws. Any person who felt himself wronged might lay an information before the Council of Areopagus, on declaring what law was broken by the wrong done to him. But, as has been said before, loans were secured upon the persons of the debtors, and the land was in the hands of a few.&quot;

<doc id="8468" wikidata="Q178546" url="?curid=8468" title="Determinant">
<text>In mathematics, the determinant is a scalar-valued function of the entries of a square matrix. The determinant of a matrix is commonly denoted , , or . Its value characterizes some properties of the matrix and the linear map represented, on a given basis, by the matrix. In particular, the determinant is nonzero if and only if the matrix is invertible and the corresponding linear map is an isomorphism. 

The determinant is completely determined by the two following properties: the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants, and the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries.

The determinant of a matrix is
:formula_1
and the determinant of a matrix is
:formula_2

The determinant of an matrix can be defined in several equivalent ways, the most common being Leibniz formula, which expresses the determinant as a sum of formula_3 (the factorial of ) signed products of matrix entries. It can be computed by the Laplace expansion, which expresses the determinant as a linear combination of determinants of submatrices, or with Gaussian elimination, which allows computing a row echelon form with the same determinant, equal to the product of the diagonal entries of the row echelon form.

Determinants can also be defined by some of their properties. Namely, the determinant is the unique function defined on the matrices that has the four following properties: 
# The determinant of the identity matrix is .
# The exchange of two rows multiplies the determinant by .
# Multiplying a row by a number multiplies the determinant by this number. 
# Adding a multiple of one row to another row does not change the determinant. 

The above properties relating to rows (properties 2–4) may be replaced by the corresponding statements with respect to columns.

The determinant is invariant under matrix similarity. This implies that, given a linear endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space, the determinant of the matrix that represents it on a basis does not depend on the chosen basis. This allows defining the &quot;determinant&quot; of a linear endomorphism, which does not depend on the choice of a coordinate system.

Determinants occur throughout mathematics. For example, a matrix is often used to represent the coefficients in a system of linear equations, and determinants can be used to solve these equations (Cramer&#x27;s rule), although other methods of solution are computationally much more efficient. Determinants are used for defining the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix, whose roots are the eigenvalues. In geometry, the signed -dimensional volume of a -dimensional parallelepiped is expressed by a determinant, and the determinant of a linear endomorphism determines how the orientation and the -dimensional volume are transformed under the endomorphism. This is used in calculus with exterior differential forms and the Jacobian determinant, in particular for changes of variables in multiple integrals.

== Two by two matrices ==
The determinant of a matrix formula_4 is denoted either by &quot;&quot; or by vertical bars around the matrix, and is defined as
:formula_5
For example,
:formula_6

=== First properties ===
The determinant has several key properties that can be proved by direct evaluation of the definition for formula_7-matrices, and that continue to hold for determinants of larger matrices. They are as follows: first, the determinant of the identity matrix formula_8 is 1.
Second, the determinant is zero if two rows are the same:
:formula_9
This holds similarly if the two columns are the same. Moreover,
:formula_10
Finally, if any column is multiplied by some number formula_11 (i.e., all entries in that column are multiplied by that number), the determinant is also multiplied by that number:
:formula_12

==Geometric meaning==
If the matrix entries are real numbers, the matrix represents the linear map that maps the basis vectors to the columns of . The images of the basis vectors form a parallelogram that represents the image of the unit square under the mapping. The parallelogram defined by the columns of the above matrix is the one with vertices at , , , and , as shown in the accompanying diagram.

The absolute value of is the area of the parallelogram, and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by .

The absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the signed area of the parallelogram. The signed area is the same as the usual area, except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction (which is opposite to the direction one would get for the identity matrix).

To show that is the signed area, one may consider a matrix containing two vectors and representing the parallelogram&#x27;s sides. The signed area can be expressed as for the angle &quot;θ&quot; between the vectors, which is simply base times height, the length of one vector times the perpendicular component of the other. Due to the sine this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the cosine of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g. , so that becomes the signed area in question, which can be determined by the pattern of the scalar product to be equal to according to the following equations:

: formula_13
Thus the determinant gives the scaling factor and the orientation induced by the mapping represented by &quot;A&quot;. When the determinant is equal to one, the linear mapping defined by the matrix is equi-areal and orientation-preserving.

The object known as the &quot;bivector&quot; is related to these ideas. In 2D, it can be interpreted as an &quot;oriented plane segment&quot; formed by imagining two vectors each with origin , and coordinates and . The bivector magnitude (denoted by ) is the &quot;signed area&quot;, which is also the determinant .

If an real matrix &quot;A&quot; is written in terms of its column vectors formula_14, then
:formula_15

This means that formula_16 maps the unit &quot;n&quot;-cube to the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional parallelotope defined by the vectors formula_17 the region formula_18

The determinant gives the signed &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume of this parallelotope, formula_19 and hence describes more generally the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume scaling factor of the linear transformation produced by &quot;A&quot;. (The sign shows whether the transformation preserves or reverses orientation.) In particular, if the determinant is zero, then this parallelotope has volume zero and is not fully &quot;n&quot;-dimensional, which indicates that the dimension of the image of &quot;A&quot; is less than &quot;n&quot;. This means that &quot;A&quot; produces a linear transformation which is neither onto nor one-to-one, and so is not invertible.

== Definition ==

Let &quot;A&quot; be a square matrix with &quot;n&quot; rows and &quot;n&quot; columns, so that it can be written as
:formula_20

The entries formula_21 etc. are, for many purposes, real or complex numbers. As discussed below, the determinant is also defined for matrices whose entries are in a commutative ring.

The determinant of &quot;A&quot; is denoted by det(&quot;A&quot;), or it can be denoted directly in terms of the matrix entries by writing enclosing bars instead of brackets:
:formula_22

There are various equivalent ways to define the determinant of a square matrix &quot;A&quot;, i.e. one with the same number of rows and columns: the determinant can be defined via the Leibniz formula, an explicit formula involving sums of products of certain entries of the matrix. The determinant can also be characterized as the unique function depending on the entries of the matrix satisfying certain properties. This approach can also be used to compute determinants by simplifying the matrices in question.

===Leibniz formula===
==== 3 × 3 matrices ====
The &quot;Leibniz formula&quot; for the determinant of a matrix is the following:
:formula_23
In this expression, each term has one factor from each row, all in different columns, arranged in increasing row order. For example, &quot;bdi&quot; has &quot;b&quot; from the first row second column, &quot;d&quot; from the second row first column, and &quot;i&quot; from the third row third column. The signs are determined by how many transpositions of factors are necessary to arrange the factors in increasing order of their columns (given that the terms are arranged left-to-right in increasing row order): positive for an even number of transpositions and negative for an odd number. For the example of &quot;bdi&quot;, the single transposition of &quot;bd&quot; to &quot;db&quot; gives &quot;dbi,&quot; whose three factors are from the first, second and third columns respectively; this is an odd number of transpositions, so the term appears with negative sign.

The rule of Sarrus is a mnemonic for the expanded form of this determinant: the sum of the products of three diagonal north-west to south-east lines of matrix elements, minus the sum of the products of three diagonal south-west to north-east lines of elements, when the copies of the first two columns of the matrix are written beside it as in the illustration. This scheme for calculating the determinant of a matrix does not carry over into higher dimensions.

==== &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices ====

Generalizing the above to higher dimensions, the determinant of an formula_24 matrix is an expression involving permutations and their signatures. A permutation of the set formula_25 is a bijective function formula_26 from this set to itself, with values formula_27 exhausting the entire set. The set of all such permutations, called the symmetric group, is commonly denoted formula_28. The signature formula_29 of a permutation formula_26 is formula_31 if the permutation can be obtained with an even number of transpositions (exchanges of two entries); otherwise, it is formula_32

Given a matrix
:formula_33
the Leibniz formula for its determinant is, using sigma notation for the sum,
:formula_34

Using pi notation for the product, this can be shortened into
:formula_35.

The Levi-Civita symbol formula_36 is defined on the -tuples of integers in formula_37 as if two of the integers are equal, and otherwise as the signature of the permutation defined by the &quot;n-&quot;tuple of integers. With the Levi-Civita symbol, the Leibniz formula becomes 
:formula_38
where the sum is taken over all -tuples of integers in formula_39
== Properties==

===Characterization of the determinant===
The determinant can be characterized by the following three key properties. To state these, it is convenient to regard an formula_24-matrix &quot;A&quot; as being composed of its formula_41 columns, so denoted as
:formula_42
where the column vector formula_43 (for each &quot;i&quot;) is composed of the entries of the matrix in the &quot;i&quot;-th column.

# &lt;li value=&quot;A&quot;&gt; formula_44, where formula_45 is an identity matrix.
# &lt;li value=&quot;B&quot;&gt; The determinant is &quot;multilinear&quot;: if the &quot;j&quot;th column of a matrix formula_16 is written as a linear combination formula_47 of two column vectors &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; and a number &quot;r&quot;, then the determinant of &quot;A&quot; is expressible as a similar linear combination:
#: formula_48
# &lt;li value=&quot;C&quot;&gt;The determinant is &quot;alternating&quot;: whenever two columns of a matrix are identical, its determinant is 0:
#: formula_49

If the determinant is defined using the Leibniz formula as above, these three properties can be proved by direct inspection of that formula. Some authors also approach the determinant directly using these three properties: it can be shown that there is exactly one function that assigns to any formula_24-matrix &quot;A&quot; a number that satisfies these three properties. This also shows that this more abstract approach to the determinant yields the same definition as the one using the Leibniz formula.

To see this it suffices to expand the determinant by multi-linearity in the columns into a (huge) linear combination of determinants of matrices in which each column is a standard basis vector. These determinants are either 0 (by property 9) or else ±1 (by properties 1 and 12 below), so the linear combination gives the expression above in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol. While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear.

===Immediate consequences===
These rules have several further consequences:
* The determinant is a homogeneous function, i.e., formula_51 (for an formula_24 matrix formula_16).
* Interchanging any pair of columns of a matrix multiplies its determinant by −1. This follows from the determinant being multilinear and alternating (properties 2 and 3 above): formula_54 This formula can be applied iteratively when several columns are swapped. For example formula_55 Yet more generally, any permutation of the columns multiplies the determinant by the sign of the permutation.
* If some column can be expressed as a linear combination of the &quot;other&quot; columns (i.e. the columns of the matrix form a linearly dependent set), the determinant is 0. As a special case, this includes: if some column is such that all its entries are zero, then the determinant of that matrix is 0.
* Adding a scalar multiple of one column to &quot;another&quot; column does not change the value of the determinant. This is a consequence of multilinearity and being alternative: by multilinearity the determinant changes by a multiple of the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0, since the determinant is alternating.
* If formula_16 is a triangular matrix, i.e. formula_57, whenever formula_58 or, alternatively, whenever formula_59, then its determinant equals the product of the diagonal entries: formula_60 Indeed, such a matrix can be reduced, by appropriately adding multiples of the columns with fewer nonzero entries to those with more entries, to a diagonal matrix (without changing the determinant). For such a matrix, using the linearity in each column reduces to the identity matrix, in which case the stated formula holds by the very first characterizing property of determinants. Alternatively, this formula can also be deduced from the Leibniz formula, since the only permutation formula_26 which gives a non-zero contribution is the identity permutation.

====Example====
These characterizing properties and their consequences listed above are both theoretically significant, but can also be used to compute determinants for concrete matrices. In fact, Gaussian elimination can be applied to bring any matrix into upper triangular form, and the steps in this algorithm affect the determinant in a controlled way. The following concrete example illustrates the computation of the determinant of the matrix formula_16 using that method:

:formula_63

Combining these equalities gives formula_64

===Transpose===
The determinant of the transpose of formula_16 equals the determinant of &quot;A&quot;:
:formula_66.
This can be proven by inspecting the Leibniz formula. This implies that in all the properties mentioned above, the word &quot;column&quot; can be replaced by &quot;row&quot; throughout. For example, viewing an matrix as being composed of &quot;n&quot; rows, the determinant is an &quot;n&quot;-linear function.

=== Multiplicativity and matrix groups ===
The determinant is a &quot;multiplicative map&quot;, i.e., for square matrices formula_16 and formula_68 of equal size, the determinant of a matrix product equals the product of their determinants:
:formula_69

This key fact can be proven by observing that, for a fixed matrix formula_68, both sides of the equation are alternating and multilinear as a function depending on the columns of formula_16. Moreover, they both take the value formula_72 when formula_16 is the identity matrix. The above-mentioned unique characterization of alternating multilinear maps therefore shows this claim.

A matrix formula_16 with entries in a field is invertible precisely if its determinant is nonzero. This follows from the multiplicativity of the determinant and the formula for the inverse involving the adjugate matrix mentioned below. In this event, the determinant of the inverse matrix is given by
:formula_75.

In particular, products and inverses of matrices with non-zero determinant (respectively, determinant one) still have this property. Thus, the set of such matrices (of fixed size formula_41 over a field formula_77) forms a group known as the general linear group formula_78 (respectively, a subgroup called the special linear group formula_79. More generally, the word &quot;special&quot; indicates the subgroup of another matrix group of matrices of determinant one. Examples include the special orthogonal group (which if &quot;n&quot; is 2 or 3 consists of all rotation matrices), and the special unitary group.

Because the determinant respects multiplication and inverses, it is in fact a group homomorphism from formula_78 into the multiplicative group formula_81 of nonzero elements of formula_77. This homomorphism is surjective and its kernel is formula_83 (the matrices with determinant one). Hence, by the first isomorphism theorem, this shows that formula_83 is a normal subgroup of formula_78, and that the quotient group formula_86 is isomorphic to formula_81.

The Cauchy–Binet formula is a generalization of that product formula for &quot;rectangular&quot; matrices. This formula can also be recast as a multiplicative formula for compound matrices whose entries are the determinants of all quadratic submatrices of a given matrix.

=== Laplace expansion ===
Laplace expansion expresses the determinant of a matrix formula_16 recursively in terms of determinants of smaller matrices, known as its minors. The minor formula_89 is defined to be the determinant of the formula_90-matrix that results from formula_16 by removing the formula_92-th row and the formula_93-th column. The expression formula_94 is known as a cofactor. For every formula_92, one has the equality
:formula_96
which is called the &quot;Laplace expansion along the th row&quot;. For example, the Laplace expansion along the first row (formula_97) gives the following formula:
:formula_98
Unwinding the determinants of these formula_7-matrices gives back the Leibniz formula mentioned above. Similarly, the &quot;Laplace expansion along the formula_93-th column&quot; is the equality
:formula_101
Laplace expansion can be used iteratively for computing determinants, but this approach is inefficient for large matrices. However, it is useful for computing the determinants of highly symmetric matrix such as the Vandermonde matrix
formula_102The &quot;n&quot;-term Laplace expansion along a row or column can be generalized to write an &quot;n&quot; x &quot;n&quot; determinant as a sum of formula_103 terms, each the product of the determinant of a &quot;k&quot; x &quot;k&quot; submatrix and the determinant of the complementary (&quot;n−k&quot;) x (&quot;n−k&quot;) submatrix.
===Adjugate matrix===
The adjugate matrix formula_104 is the transpose of the matrix of the cofactors, that is,
: formula_105

For every matrix, one has
: formula_106

Thus the adjugate matrix can be used for expressing the inverse of a nonsingular matrix:
: formula_107

=== Block matrices ===
The formula for the determinant of a formula_7-matrix above continues to hold, under appropriate further assumptions, for a block matrix, i.e., a matrix composed of four submatrices formula_109 of dimension formula_110, formula_111, formula_112 and formula_24, respectively. The easiest such formula, which can be proven using either the Leibniz formula or a factorization involving the Schur complement, is
:formula_114
If formula_16 is invertible, then it follows with results from the section on multiplicativity that
:formula_116
which simplifies to formula_117 when formula_118 is a formula_119-matrix.

A similar result holds when formula_118 is invertible, namely
:formula_121
Both results can be combined to derive Sylvester&#x27;s determinant theorem, which is also stated below.

If the blocks are square matrices of the &quot;same&quot; size further formulas hold. For example, if formula_122 and formula_118 commute (i.e., formula_124), then

:formula_125
This formula has been generalized to matrices composed of more than formula_7 blocks, again under appropriate commutativity conditions among the individual blocks.

For formula_127 and formula_128, the following formula holds (even if formula_16 and formula_68 do not commute)
:formula_131

=== Sylvester&#x27;s determinant theorem ===
Sylvester&#x27;s determinant theorem states that for &quot;A&quot;, an matrix, and &quot;B&quot;, an matrix (so that &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; have dimensions allowing them to be multiplied in either order forming a square matrix):

:formula_132

where &quot;I&quot;&quot;m&quot; and &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot; are the and identity matrices, respectively.

From this general result several consequences follow.
A generalization is formula_133(see Matrix_determinant_lemma), where &quot;Z&quot; is an invertible matrix and &quot;W&quot; is an invertible matrix.

===Sum===

The determinant of the sum formula_134 of two square matrices of the same size is not in general expressible in terms of the determinants of &quot;A&quot; and of &quot;B&quot;. 

However, for positive semidefinite matrices formula_16, formula_68 and formula_122 of equal size,
formula_138
with the corollary
formula_139 

Brunn–Minkowski theorem implies that the th root of determinant is a concave function, when restricted to Hermitian positive-definite formula_140 matrices. Therefore, if and are Hermitian positive-definite formula_140 matrices, one has
formula_142 since the th root of the determinant is a homogeneous function.

==== Sum identity for 2×2 matrices ====

For the special case of formula_143 matrices with complex entries, the determinant of the sum can be written in terms of determinants and traces in the following identity:
:formula_144

== Properties of the determinant in relation to other notions ==

=== Eigenvalues and characteristic polynomial ===

The determinant is closely related to two other central concepts in linear algebra, the eigenvalues and the characteristic polynomial of a matrix. Let formula_16 be an formula_24-matrix with complex entries. Then, by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, formula_16 must have exactly &quot;n&quot; eigenvalues formula_148. (Here it is understood that an eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity occurs times in this list.) Then, it turns out the determinant of is equal to the &quot;product&quot; of these eigenvalues,
:formula_149
The product of all non-zero eigenvalues is referred to as pseudo-determinant.

From this, one immediately sees that the determinant of a matrix formula_16 is zero if and only if formula_151 is an eigenvalue of formula_16. In other words, formula_16 is invertible if and only if formula_151 is not an eigenvalue of formula_16.

The characteristic polynomial is defined as
:formula_156
Here, formula_157 is the indeterminate of the polynomial and formula_45 is the identity matrix of the same size as formula_16. By means of this polynomial, determinants can be used to find the eigenvalues of the matrix formula_16: they are precisely the roots of this polynomial, i.e., those complex numbers formula_161 such that
:formula_162

A Hermitian matrix is positive definite if all its eigenvalues are positive. Sylvester&#x27;s criterion asserts that this is equivalent to the determinants of the submatrices
:formula_163

being positive, for all formula_164 between formula_165 and formula_41.

=== Trace ===
The trace tr(&quot;A&quot;) is by definition the sum of the diagonal entries of and also equals the sum of the eigenvalues. Thus, for complex matrices ,
:formula_167

or, for real matrices ,
:formula_168

Here exp() denotes the matrix exponential of , because every eigenvalue of corresponds to the eigenvalue exp() of exp(). In particular, given any logarithm of , that is, any matrix satisfying
:formula_169

the determinant of is given by
:formula_170

For example, for , , and , respectively,
:formula_171

cf. Cayley-Hamilton theorem. Such expressions are deducible from combinatorial arguments, Newton&#x27;s identities, or the Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm. That is, for generic , the signed constant term of the characteristic polynomial, determined recursively from
:formula_172

In the general case, this may also be obtained from
:formula_173

where the sum is taken over the set of all integers satisfying the equation
:formula_174

The formula can be expressed in terms of the complete exponential Bell polynomial of &quot;n&quot; arguments &quot;s&quot;&quot;l&quot; = −(&quot;l&quot; – 1)! tr(&quot;A&quot;&quot;l&quot;) as
:formula_175

This formula can also be used to find the determinant of a matrix with multidimensional indices and . The product and trace of such matrices are defined in a natural way as
:formula_176

An important arbitrary dimension identity can be obtained from the Mercator series expansion of the logarithm when the expansion converges. If every eigenvalue of &quot;A&quot; is less than 1 in absolute value,
:formula_177

where is the identity matrix. More generally, if
:formula_178

is expanded as a formal power series in then all coefficients of for are zero and the remaining polynomial is .

=== Upper and lower bounds ===
For a positive definite matrix , the trace operator gives the following tight lower and upper bounds on the log determinant
:formula_179

with equality if and only if . This relationship can be derived via the formula for the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two multivariate normal distributions.

Also,
:formula_180

These inequalities can be proved by expressing the traces and the determinant in terms of the eigenvalues. As such, they represent the well-known fact that the harmonic mean is less than the geometric mean, which is less than the arithmetic mean, which is, in turn, less than the root mean square.

=== Derivative ===
The Leibniz formula shows that the determinant of real (or analogously for complex) square matrices is a polynomial function from formula_181 to formula_182. In particular, it is everywhere differentiable. Its derivative can be expressed using Jacobi&#x27;s formula:

:formula_183

where formula_104 denotes the adjugate of formula_16. In particular, if formula_16 is invertible, we have

:formula_187

Expressed in terms of the entries of formula_16, these are

: formula_189

Yet another equivalent formulation is

:formula_190,

using big O notation. The special case where formula_191, the identity matrix, yields

:formula_192

This identity is used in describing Lie algebras associated to certain matrix Lie groups. For example, the special linear group formula_193 is defined by the equation formula_194. The above formula shows that its Lie algebra is the special linear Lie algebra formula_195 consisting of those matrices having trace zero.

Writing a formula_196-matrix as formula_197 where formula_198 are column vectors of length 3, then the gradient over one of the three vectors may be written as the cross product of the other two:

: formula_199

== History ==
Historically, determinants were used long before matrices: A determinant was originally defined as a property of a system of linear equations.
The determinant &quot;determines&quot; whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero).
In this sense, determinants were first used in the Chinese mathematics textbook &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; (九章算術, Chinese scholars, around the 3rd century BCE). In Europe, solutions of linear systems of two equations were expressed by Cardano in 1545 by a determinant-like entity.

Determinants proper originated separately from the work of Seki Takakazu in 1683 in Japan and parallelly of Leibniz in 1693. stated, without proof, Cramer&#x27;s rule. Both Cramer and also were led to determinants by the question of plane curves passing through a given set of points.

Vandermonde (1771) first recognized determinants as independent functions. gave the general method of expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors: Vandermonde had already given a special case. Immediately following, Lagrange (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of elimination theory; he proved many special cases of general identities.

Gauss (1801) made the next advance. Like Lagrange, he made much use of determinants in the theory of numbers. He introduced the word &quot;determinant&quot; (Laplace had used &quot;resultant&quot;), though not in the present signification, but rather as applied to the discriminant of a quantic. Gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal (inverse) determinants, and came very near the multiplication theorem.

The next contributor of importance is Binet (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of &quot;m&quot; columns and &quot;n&quot; rows, which for the special case of reduces to the multiplication theorem. On the same day (November 30, 1812) that Binet presented his paper to the Academy, Cauchy also presented one on the subject. (See Cauchy–Binet formula.) In this he used the word &quot;determinant&quot; in its present sense, summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet&#x27;s. With him begins the theory in its generality.

 used the functional determinant which Sylvester later called the Jacobian. In his memoirs in &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot; for 1841 he specially treats this subject, as well as the class of alternating functions which Sylvester has called &quot;alternants&quot;. About the time of Jacobi&#x27;s last memoirs, Sylvester (1839) and Cayley began their work. introduced the modern notation for the determinant using vertical bars.

The study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory. Axisymmetric determinants have been studied by Lebesgue, Hesse, and Sylvester; persymmetric determinants by Sylvester and Hankel; circulants by Catalan, Spottiswoode, Glaisher, and Scott; skew determinants and Pfaffians, in connection with the theory of orthogonal transformation, by Cayley; continuants by Sylvester; Wronskians (so called by Muir) by Christoffel and Frobenius; compound determinants by Sylvester, Reiss, and Picquet; Jacobians and Hessians by Sylvester; and symmetric gauche determinants by Trudi. Of the textbooks on the subject Spottiswoode&#x27;s was the first. In America, Hanus (1886), Weld (1893), and Muir/Metzler (1933) published treatises.

== Applications ==

=== Cramer&#x27;s rule ===

Determinants can be used to describe the solutions of a linear system of equations, written in matrix form as formula_200. This equation has a unique solution formula_201 if and only if formula_202 is nonzero. In this case, the solution is given by Cramer&#x27;s rule:
:formula_203

where formula_204 is the matrix formed by replacing the formula_92-th column of formula_16 by the column vector formula_207. This follows immediately by column expansion of the determinant, i.e.
:formula_208
formula_209

where the vectors formula_210 are the columns of &quot;A&quot;. The rule is also implied by the identity

:formula_211

Cramer&#x27;s rule can be implemented in formula_212 time, which is comparable to more common methods of solving systems of linear equations, such as LU, QR, or singular value decomposition.

=== Linear independence ===
Determinants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors: formula_213 is zero if and only if the column vectors of the matrix formula_16 are linearly dependent. For example, given two linearly independent vectors formula_215, a third vector formula_216 lies in the plane spanned by the former two vectors exactly if the determinant of the formula_196-matrix consisting of the three vectors is zero. The same idea is also used in the theory of differential equations: given functions formula_218 (supposed to be formula_219 times differentiable), the Wronskian is defined to be
:formula_220

It is non-zero (for some formula_201) in a specified interval if and only if the given functions and all their derivatives up to order formula_219 are linearly independent. If it can be shown that the Wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then, in the case of analytic functions, this implies the given functions are linearly dependent. See the Wronskian and linear independence. Another such use of the determinant is the resultant, which gives a criterion when two polynomials have a common root.

=== Orientation of a basis ===

The determinant can be thought of as assigning a number to every sequence of &quot;n&quot; vectors in R&quot;n&quot;, by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors. The determinant will be nonzero if and only if the sequence of vectors is a &quot;basis&quot; for R&quot;n&quot;. In that case, the sign of the determinant determines whether the orientation of the basis is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the standard basis. In the case of an orthogonal basis, the magnitude of the determinant is equal to the &quot;product&quot; of the lengths of the basis vectors. For instance, an orthogonal matrix with entries in R&quot;n&quot; represents an orthonormal basis in Euclidean space, and hence has determinant of ±1 (since all the vectors have length 1). The determinant is +1 if and only if the basis has the same orientation. It is −1 if and only if the basis has the opposite orientation.

More generally, if the determinant of &quot;A&quot; is positive, &quot;A&quot; represents an orientation-preserving linear transformation (if &quot;A&quot; is an orthogonal or matrix, this is a rotation), while if it is negative, &quot;A&quot; switches the orientation of the basis.

=== Volume and Jacobian determinant ===
As pointed out above, the absolute value of the determinant of real vectors is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by those vectors. As a consequence, if formula_223 is the linear map given by multiplication with a matrix formula_16, and formula_225 is any measurable subset, then the volume of formula_226 is given by formula_227 times the volume of formula_228. More generally, if the linear map formula_229 is represented by the formula_111-matrix formula_16, then the formula_41-dimensional volume of formula_226 is given by:
:formula_234

By calculating the volume of the tetrahedron bounded by four points, they can be used to identify skew lines. The volume of any tetrahedron, given its vertices formula_235, formula_236, or any other combination of pairs of vertices that form a spanning tree over the vertices.
For a general differentiable function, much of the above carries over by considering the Jacobian matrix of &quot;f&quot;. For
:formula_237

the Jacobian matrix is the matrix whose entries are given by the partial derivatives
:formula_238

Its determinant, the Jacobian determinant, appears in the higher-dimensional version of integration by substitution: for suitable functions &quot;f&quot; and an open subset &quot;U&quot; of R&quot;n&quot; (the domain of &quot;f&quot;), the integral over &quot;f&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) of some other function is given by
:formula_239

The Jacobian also occurs in the inverse function theorem.

When applied to the field of Cartography, the determinant can be used to measure the rate of expansion of a map near the poles.

== Abstract algebraic aspects ==

=== Determinant of an endomorphism ===
The above identities concerning the determinant of products and inverses of matrices imply that similar matrices have the same determinant: two matrices &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are similar, if there exists an invertible matrix &quot;X&quot; such that . Indeed, repeatedly applying the above identities yields

:formula_240

The determinant is therefore also called a similarity invariant. The determinant of a linear transformation
:formula_241
for some finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; is defined to be the determinant of the matrix describing it, with respect to an arbitrary choice of basis in &quot;V&quot;. By the similarity invariance, this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis for &quot;V&quot; and therefore only depends on the endomorphism &quot;T&quot;.

=== Square matrices over commutative rings ===

The above definition of the determinant using the Leibniz rule holds works more generally when the entries of the matrix are elements of a commutative ring formula_242, such as the integers formula_243, as opposed to the field of real or complex numbers. Moreover, the characterization of the determinant as the unique alternating multilinear map that satisfies formula_244 still holds, as do all the properties that result from that characterization.

A matrix formula_245 is invertible (in the sense that there is an inverse matrix whose entries are in formula_242) if and only if its determinant is an invertible element in formula_242. For formula_248, this means that the determinant is +1 or −1. Such a matrix is called unimodular.

The determinant being multiplicative, it defines a group homomorphism
:formula_249
between the general linear group (the group of invertible formula_24-matrices with entries in formula_242) and the multiplicative group of units in formula_242. Since it respects the multiplication in both groups, this map is a group homomorphism.
Given a ring homomorphism formula_253, there is a map formula_254 given by replacing all entries in formula_242 by their images under formula_256. The determinant respects these maps, i.e., the identity
:formula_257
holds. In other words, the displayed commutative diagram commutes.

For example, the determinant of the complex conjugate of a complex matrix (which is also the determinant of its conjugate transpose) is the complex conjugate of its determinant, and for integer matrices: the reduction modulo formula_258 of the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix reduced modulo formula_258 (the latter determinant being computed using modular arithmetic). In the language of category theory, the determinant is a natural transformation between the two functors formula_260 and formula_261. Adding yet another layer of abstraction, this is captured by saying that the determinant is a morphism of algebraic groups, from the general linear group to the multiplicative group,
:formula_262

=== Exterior algebra ===
The determinant of a linear transformation formula_241 of an formula_41-dimensional vector space formula_265 or, more generally a free module of (finite) rank formula_41 over a commutative ring formula_242 can be formulated in a coordinate-free manner by considering the formula_41-th exterior power formula_269 of formula_265. The map formula_271 induces a linear map
:formula_272

As formula_269 is one-dimensional, the map formula_274 is given by multiplying with some scalar, i.e., an element in formula_242. Some authors such as use this fact to &quot;define&quot; the determinant to be the element in formula_242 satisfying the following identity (for all formula_277):
:formula_278

This definition agrees with the more concrete coordinate-dependent definition. This can be shown using the uniqueness of a multilinear alternating form on formula_41-tuples of vectors in formula_280.
For this reason, the highest non-zero exterior power formula_269 (as opposed to the determinant associated to an endomorphism) is sometimes also called the determinant of formula_265 and similarly for more involved objects such as vector bundles or chain complexes of vector spaces. Minors of a matrix can also be cast in this setting, by considering lower alternating forms formula_283 with formula_284.

== Generalizations and related notions ==

Determinants as treated above admit several variants: the permanent of a matrix is defined as the determinant, except that the factors formula_29 occurring in Leibniz&#x27;s rule are omitted. The immanant generalizes both by introducing a character of the symmetric group formula_28 in Leibniz&#x27;s rule.

=== Determinants for finite-dimensional algebras===
For any associative algebra formula_16 that is finite-dimensional as a vector space over a field formula_288, there is a determinant map

:formula_289
This definition proceeds by establishing the characteristic polynomial independently of the determinant, and defining the determinant as the lowest order term of this polynomial. This general definition recovers the determinant for the matrix algebra formula_290, but also includes several further cases including the determinant of a quaternion,
:formula_291,
the norm formula_292 of a field extension, as well as the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix and the reduced norm of a central simple algebra, also arise as special cases of this construction.

=== Infinite matrices ===
For matrices with an infinite number of rows and columns, the above definitions of the determinant do not carry over directly. For example, in the Leibniz formula, an infinite sum (all of whose terms are infinite products) would have to be calculated. Functional analysis provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations, which however only work for particular kinds of operators.

The Fredholm determinant defines the determinant for operators known as trace class operators by an appropriate generalization of the formula
:formula_293

Another infinite-dimensional notion of determinant is the functional determinant.

===Operators in von Neumann algebras===
For operators in a finite factor, one may define a positive real-valued determinant called the Fuglede−Kadison determinant using the canonical trace. In fact, corresponding to every tracial state on a von Neumann algebra there is a notion of Fuglede−Kadison determinant.

=== Related notions for non-commutative rings ===

For matrices over non-commutative rings, multilinearity and alternating properties are incompatible for , so there is no good definition of the determinant in this setting.

For square matrices with entries in a non-commutative ring, there are various difficulties in defining determinants analogously to that for commutative rings. A meaning can be given to the Leibniz formula provided that the order for the product is specified, and similarly for other definitions of the determinant, but non-commutativity then leads to the loss of many fundamental properties of the determinant, such as the multiplicative property or that the determinant is unchanged under transposition of the matrix. Over non-commutative rings, there is no reasonable notion of a multilinear form (existence of a nonzero with a regular element of &quot;R&quot; as value on some pair of arguments implies that &quot;R&quot; is commutative). Nevertheless, various notions of non-commutative determinant have been formulated that preserve some of the properties of determinants, notably quasideterminants and the Dieudonné determinant. For some classes of matrices with non-commutative elements, one can define the determinant and prove linear algebra theorems that are very similar to their commutative analogs. Examples include the &quot;q&quot;-determinant on quantum groups, the Capelli determinant on Capelli matrices, and the Berezinian on supermatrices (i.e., matrices whose entries are elements of formula_294-graded rings). Manin matrices form the class closest to matrices with commutative elements.

== Calculation ==
Determinants are mainly used as a theoretical tool. They are rarely calculated explicitly in numerical linear algebra, where for applications such as checking invertibility and finding eigenvalues the determinant has largely been supplanted by other techniques. Computational geometry, however, does frequently use calculations related to determinants.

While the determinant can be computed directly using the Leibniz rule this approach is extremely inefficient for large matrices, since that formula requires calculating formula_3 (formula_41 factorial) products for an formula_24-matrix. Thus, the number of required operations grows very quickly: it is of order formula_3. The Laplace expansion is similarly inefficient. Therefore, more involved techniques have been developed for calculating determinants.

===Gaussian elimination===
Gaussian elimination consists of left multiplying a matrix by elementary matrices for getting a matrix in a row echelon form. One can restrict the computation to elementary matrices of determinant . In this case, the determinant of the resulting row echelon form equals the determinant of the initial matrix. As a row echelon form is a triangular matrix, its determinant is the product of the entries of its diagonal.

So, the determinant can be computed for almost free from the result of a Gaussian elimination.

=== Decomposition methods ===
Some methods compute formula_299 by writing the matrix as a product of matrices whose determinants can be more easily computed. Such techniques are referred to as decomposition methods. Examples include the LU decomposition, the QR decomposition or the Cholesky decomposition (for positive definite matrices). These methods are of order formula_212, which is a significant improvement over formula_301.

For example, LU decomposition expresses formula_16 as a product
:formula_303
of a permutation matrix formula_304 (which has exactly a single formula_165 in each column, and otherwise zeros), a lower triangular matrix formula_306 and an upper triangular matrix formula_307.
The determinants of the two triangular matrices formula_306 and formula_307 can be quickly calculated, since they are the products of the respective diagonal entries. The determinant of formula_304 is just the sign formula_311 of the corresponding permutation (which is formula_312 for an even number of permutations and is formula_313 for an odd number of permutations). Once such a LU decomposition is known for formula_16, its determinant is readily computed as

:formula_315

=== Further methods ===
The order formula_212 reached by decomposition methods has been improved by different methods. If two matrices of order formula_41 can be multiplied in time formula_318, where formula_319 for some formula_320, then there is an algorithm computing the determinant in time formula_321. This means, for example, that an formula_322 algorithm for computing the determinant exists based on the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm. This exponent has been further lowered, as of 2016, to 2.373.

In addition to the complexity of the algorithm, further criteria can be used to compare algorithms.
Especially for applications concerning matrices over rings, algorithms that compute the determinant without any divisions exist. (By contrast, Gauss elimination requires divisions.) One such algorithm, having complexity formula_323 is based on the following idea: one replaces permutations (as in the Leibniz rule) by so-called closed ordered walks, in which several items can be repeated. The resulting sum has more terms than in the Leibniz rule, but in the process several of these products can be reused, making it more efficient than naively computing with the Leibniz rule. Algorithms can also be assessed according to their bit complexity, i.e., how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation. For example, the Gaussian elimination (or LU decomposition) method is of order formula_212, but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long. By comparison, the Bareiss Algorithm, is an exact-division method (so it does use division, but only in cases where these divisions can be performed without remainder) is of the same order, but the bit complexity is roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times formula_41.

If the determinant of &quot;A&quot; and the inverse of &quot;A&quot; have already been computed, the matrix determinant lemma allows rapid calculation of the determinant of , where &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are column vectors.

Charles Dodgson (i.e. Lewis Carroll of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; fame) invented a method for computing determinants called Dodgson condensation. Unfortunately this interesting method does not always work in its original form.

<doc id="8470" wikidata="Q160270" url="?curid=8470" title="David Ricardo">
<text>David Ricardo (18 April 1772 – 11 September 1823) was a British political economist, politician, and member of Parliament. He is recognized as one of the most influential classical economists, alongside figures such as Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith and James Mill.

Ricardo was born in London as the third surviving child of a successful stockbroker and his wife. He came from a Sephardic Jewish family of Portuguese origin. At 21, he eloped with a Quaker and converted to Unitarianism, causing estrangement from his family. He made his fortune financing government borrowing and later retired to an estate in Gloucestershire. Ricardo served as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire and bought a seat in Parliament as an earnest reformer. He was friends with prominent figures like James Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Thomas Malthus, engaging in debates over various topics. Ricardo was also a member of The Geological Society, and his youngest sister was an author.

As MP for Portarlington, Ricardo advocated for liberal political movements and reforms, including free trade, parliamentary reform, and criminal law reform. He believed free trade increased the well-being of people by making goods more affordable. Ricardo notably opposed the Corn Laws, which he saw as barriers to economic growth. His friend John Louis Mallett described Ricardo&#x27;s conviction in his beliefs, though he expressed doubts about Ricardo&#x27;s disregard for experience and practice. Ricardo died at 51 from an ear infection that led to septicaemia (sepsis). He left behind a considerable fortune and a lasting legacy, with his free trade views eventually becoming public policy in Britain.

Ricardo wrote his first economics article at age 37, advocating for a reduction in the note-issuing of the Bank of England. He was also an abolitionist and believed in the autonomy of a central bank as the issuer of money. Ricardo worked on fixing issues in Adam Smith&#x27;s Labour Theory of Value, stating that the value of a commodity depends on the labour necessary for its production. He contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits, defining rent as the difference between the produce obtained by employing equal quantities of capital and labour. Ricardo&#x27;s Theory of Profit posited that as real wages increase, real profits decrease due to the revenue split between profits and wages.

Ricardian theory of international trade challenges the mercantilism concept of accumulating gold or silver by promoting industry specialization and free trade. Ricardo introduced the concept of &quot;comparative advantage,&quot; suggesting that nations should concentrate resources only in industries where they have the greatest efficiency of production relative to their own alternative uses of resources. He argued that international trade is always beneficial, even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart. Ricardo opposed protectionism for national economies and was concerned about the short-term impact of technological change on labour.

==Personal life==
Born in London, England, Ricardo was the third surviving of the 17 children of successful stockbroker Abraham Israel Ricardo (1733?–1812) and Abigail (1753–1801), daughter of Abraham Delvalle (also &quot;del Valle&quot;), of a respectable Sephardic Jewish family that had been settled in England for three generations as &quot;small but prosperous&quot; tobacco and snuff merchants, and had obtained British citizenship. Abigail&#x27;s sister, Rebecca, was wife of the engraver Wilson Lowry, and mother of the engraver Joseph Wilson Lowry and the geologist, mineralogist, and author Delvalle Lowry. The Ricardo family were Sephardic Jews of Portuguese origin who had recently relocated from the Dutch Republic. Ricardo began working with his father at the age of 14. At the age of 21, Ricardo eloped with a Quaker, Priscilla Anne Wilkinson, and against his father&#x27;s wishes, converted to Unitarianism. This religious difference resulted in estrangement from his family, and he was led to adopt a position of independence. His father disowned him and his mother apparently never spoke to him again.

Following this estrangement he went into business for himself with the support of Lubbocks and Forster, an eminent banking house. He made the bulk of his fortune by profitably financing Government borrowing. A popular story states that he made his fortune as a result of speculation on the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo: in Ricardo&#x27;s obituary, published on 14 September 1823,&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that during the battle Ricardo &quot;netted upwards of a million sterling&quot;, a huge sum at the time, and this was later popularised by the economist Paul Samuelson. In reality, Ricardo was already very rich, and in June 1815, sold his latest government stock before the result of the battle was known in London, missing half of the rise.

He subsequently purchased Gatcombe Park, an estate in Gloucestershire, and retired to the country. He was appointed High Sheriff of Gloucestershire for 1818–19. In August 1818 he bought Lord Portarlington&#x27;s seat in Parliament for £4,000, as part of the terms of a loan of £25,000. His record in Parliament was that of an earnest reformer. He held the seat until his death five years later.

Ricardo was a close friend of James Mill. Other notable friends included Jeremy Bentham and Thomas Malthus, with whom Ricardo had a considerable debate (in correspondence) over such things as the role of landowners in a society. He also was a member of Malthus&#x27; Political Economy Club, and a member of the King of Clubs. He was one of the original members of The Geological Society. His youngest sister was author Sarah Ricardo-Porter (e.g., &quot;Conversations in Arithmetic&quot;).

==Parliamentary record==

As MP for Portarlington, Ricardo voted with the opposition in support of liberal political movements in Naples and Sicily, and for inquiry into the administration of justice in Tobago. He divided for (voted for) repeal of the Blasphemous and Seditious Libels Act; then for inquiry into the Peterloo massacre; and, in 1821, for abolition of the death penalty for forgery.

He adamantly supported free trade. In 1821 he voted against renewal of the sugar duties, and objected to the higher duty on &quot;East&quot; Indian as opposed to &quot;West&quot; Indian produce. He opposed the timber duties. He voted silently for parliamentary reform and in 1822 spoke in its favour at the Westminster anniversary reform dinner; and again voted for criminal law reform.

Ricardo believed that increasing imports and free trade boosted the well-being of mankind by increasing the amount of goods cheaply available for subsistence and consumption. He was said to have &quot;possessed an extraordinary quickness in perceiving in the turns of the market any accidental difference which might arise between the relative price of different stocks&quot;. He grew his wealth dealing in securities during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.

As the Napoleonic Wars waged on, Ricardo developed a disdain for the Corn Laws imposed by the British to encourage exports. Notably, government intervention in the grain trade can be traced as far back as the 1400s; and thereafter trade was controlled, regulated, and taxed. Meanwhile, England developed a capitalist economy involving workers and landlords generating and consuming incomes and capital accumulations that depended entirely on capitalists’ profits, and these key economic elements were under perpetual pressure during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

Political reform was needed as agricultural output was struggling to keep pace with population growth. The Corn Laws imposed barriers to imports that increased subsistence/consumption costs and triggered demand for higher wages. Higher wages reduced profits for agricultural producers, and had the immediate effects of reducing capital investments and slowing the growth of a nation&#x27;s economy. Rising rents, attributed by Ricardo to the Corn Laws, came at the expense of the economic profits of nations. For David Ricardo, free trade was ever the answer; he envisioned Britain as importing agriculture products in exchange for exporting manufactured goods. Eventually, after his death, the interventionist laws were repealed, and his free trade views became public policy in Britain.

Of David Ricardo, his friend John Louis Mallett commented: &quot; … he meets you upon every subject that he has studied with a mind made up, and opinions in the nature of mathematical truths. He spoke of parliamentary reform and ballot as a man who would bring such things about, and destroy the existing system tomorrow, if it were in his power, and without the slightest doubt on the result … It is this very quality of the man’s mind, his entire disregard of experience and practice, which makes me doubtful of his opinions on political economy.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Ten years after retiring and four years after entering Parliament, Ricardo died at 51 from an infection of the middle ear that spread into his brain and induced septicaemia.

He and his wife Priscilla had eight children together including Osman Ricardo (1795–1881, MP for Worcester 1847–1865), David Ricardo (1803–1864, MP for Stroud 1832–1833) and Mortimer Ricardo, who served as an officer in the Life Guards and was a deputy lieutenant for Oxfordshire.

Ricardo is buried in an ornate grave in the churchyard of Saint Nicholas in Hardenhuish, now a suburb of Chippenham, Wiltshire. At the time of his death, his assets were estimated at £675,000–£775,000.

==Ideas==
Ricardo wrote his first economics article at 37, firstly in &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot; advocating reduction in the note-issuing of the Bank of England and then publishing &quot;The High Price of Bullion, a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes&quot; in 1810.

He was also an abolitionist, speaking at a meeting of the Court of the East India Company in March 1823, where he said he regarded slavery as a stain on the character of the nation.

===Banking===

Adam Smith argued that free commercial banking, such as the banking system in Scotland which had no central bank when &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; was written in 1776, was favourable to economic growth. Writing just a few decades later, Ricardo argued for a central bank, a cause that was taken up by his students, including John Stuart Mill, who was known to favour the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policies in every place but banking.

Ricardo wrote the &quot;Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank&quot; (published posthumously in 1824), which argued for the autonomy of the central bank as the issuer of money.

Ricardo proposed that a ratio of gold and Treasury bills, and a fixed claim (asset) against the government, would secure the central bank&#x27;s liquidity:

The public, or the Government on behalf of the public, is indebted to the Bank in a sum of money larger than the whole amount of Bank notes in circulation; for the Government not only owes the Bank fifteen million, its original capital, which is lent at 3 per cent. interest, but also many more millions which are advanced on Exchequer bills, on half-pay and pension annuities, and on other securities. It is evident, therefore, that if the Government itself were to be the sole issuer of paper money instead of borrowing it of the Bank, the only difference would be with respect to the interest: the Bank would no longer receive interest and the Government would no longer pay it; but all other classes in the community would be exactly in the same position in which they now stand.

Ricardo was a man of many trades, economically and financially speaking. Ricardo was able to recognize and identify the problem presented through banking within regulations and debauched standards of approval at certain times. Ricardo knew that banks in rural areas as well as the Bank of England had increased note lending and overall lending in 1810. Through this, Ricardo proved subsequent changes in price level through the market was also affected and thus new regulations needed to be made available. Furthermore, Ricardo was able to understand and distinguish the socioeconomic makeup that created and established parameters around different classes within the economy. Ricardo advocated for the productive powers of labour to be held in high concern as the most influential of devices that played a role in the progression of the American Economy along with others. In addition, Ricardo made notable advancements in the concept build involving reactions in the open market when considering banking altercations, stock investments, or other considerable impacting events. Ricardo wanted to establish a firm ground between the bank and the control over monetary policy because there was power within the banking system that Ricardo believed needed to be considered carefully. In 1816, Ricardo said “In the present state of the law, they have the power, without any control whatever, of increasing or reducing the circulation in any degree they may think proper: a power which should neither be entrusted to the State itself, nor to anybody in it; as there can be no security for the uniformity in the value of the currency, when its augmentation or diminution depends solely on the will of the issuers.” Ricardo felt the circulation of money and the decision behind how much is available at any time should not be entrusted to either the State, or any individual. Ricardo argued for the most even distribution possible with the highest control readily available.

===Value theory===
David Ricardo worked to fix the issues he felt were most concerning with Adam Smith’s Labour Theory of Value. Both men worked with the assumption that land, labour, and capital were the three basic factors of production. However, Smith narrowed in on labour as the determinant of value. Ricardo believes that with production having three factors it is impossible for only one of them to determine value on its own. Ricardo illustrates his point by adapting Smith&#x27;s deer-beaver analogy to show that even when labour is the only factor of production the hardship and tools of the labour will drive a wedge in the relative value of the good. Due to his criticisms of the Labour Theory of Value George Stigler called his theory a &quot;93% labor theory of value&quot;.

Ricardo&#x27;s most famous work is his &quot;Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot; (1817). He advanced a labour theory of value:

The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not on the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour.

Ricardo&#x27;s note to Section VI:

Mr. Malthus appears to think that it is a part of my doctrine, that the cost and value of a thing be the same;—it is, if he means by cost, &quot;cost of production&quot; including profit.

===Rent===

Ricardo contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits. He defined rent as &quot;the difference between the produce obtained by the employment of two equal quantities of capital and labour.&quot; Ricardo believed that the process of economic development, which increased land use and eventually led to the cultivation of poorer land, principally benefited landowners. According to Ricardo, such premium over &quot;real social value&quot; that is reaped due to ownership constitutes value to an individual but is at best a paper monetary return to &quot;society&quot;. The portion of such purely individual benefit that accrues to scarce resources Ricardo labels &quot;rent&quot;.

In particular, Ricardo postulates that rent is a result of increased populations which results in assets growing scarce and in some cases diminished returns of which were once abundant. Ricardo breaks down this premise by first supposing there are three fields of land - No. 1, 2, 3, - to yield corn, with an equal employment of capital and labour. Initially land No.1 is cultivated and is very productive as measured through the abundant surplus. Over time this abundant surplus becomes diminished as the result of an increase in population, which subsequently creates an increased demand for food. The less desired land, No.2, must now be cultivated and eventually so must land No.3 and so on and so forth. For Ricardo each new cultivated results in diminished surplus as the quality of land fails to yield the equal of that before it. In light of such diminishing surplus landowners see opportunities to charge rent as a means to compensate for the loss of returns on output.

=== Model-making===
According to sociologist of quantification Mary S. Morgan David Ricardo can be considered &quot;one of the pioneers in economic modelling&quot;. In studying rents, for example, Ricardo experiments numerically to determine the relative share of profit accruing to land owner, capital holder and laborers through what Morgan calls &#x27;numerical model farming&#x27;. In his numerical and verbal accounts Ricardo tests different improvements in capital, technology or labour to increase the yield of a farm, paralleling actual experiments run by his contemporaries such as &quot;Turnip&quot; Townshend.

===Ricardo&#x27;s theories of wages and profits===
In his &quot;Theory of Profit&quot;, Ricardo stated that as real wages increase, real profits decrease because the revenue from the sale of manufactured goods is split between profits and wages. He said in his &quot;Essay on Profits&quot;, &quot;Profits depend on high or low wages, wages on the price of necessaries, and the price of necessaries chiefly on the price of food.&quot;

==Ricardian theory of international trade==
Between 1500 and 1750 most economists advocated mercantilism, which promoted the idea of international trade for the purpose of earning bullion by running a trade surplus with other countries. Ricardo challenged the idea that the purpose of trade was merely to accumulate gold or silver. With &quot;comparative advantage&quot; Ricardo argued in favour of industry specialisation and free trade. He suggested that industry specialization combined with free international trade always produces positive results. This theory expanded on the concept of absolute advantage.

Ricardo suggested that there is mutual national benefit from trade even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart and that a nation should concentrate resources only in industries where it has a comparative advantage, that is in those industries in which it has the greatest efficiency of production relative to its own alternative uses of resources, rather than industries where it holds a competitive edge compared to rival nations. Ricardo suggested that national industries which were, in fact, mildly profitable and marginally internationally competitive should be jettisoned in favour of the industries that made the best use of limited resources—the assumption being that subsequent economic growth due to better resource use would more than offset any short-run economic dislocation which would result from closing mildly profitable and marginally competitive national industries.

Ricardo attempted to prove theoretically that international trade is always beneficial. Paul Samuelson called the numbers used in Ricardo&#x27;s example dealing with trade between England and Portugal the &quot;four magic numbers&quot;. &quot;In spite of the fact that the Portuguese could produce both cloth and wine with less amount of labour, Ricardo suggested that both countries would benefit from trade with each other&quot;.

As for recent extensions of Ricardian models, see Ricardian trade theory extensions.

=== Comparative advantage ===
Ricardo&#x27;s theory of international trade was reformulated by John Stuart Mill in 1844. The term &quot;comparative advantage&quot; was introduced by J. S. Mill and his contemporaries.

John Stuart Mill started a neoclassical turn of international trade theory, i.e. his formulation was inherited by Alfred Marshall and others, and has both contributed to the resurrection of the anti-Ricardian concept of law of supply and demand, and induced the arrival of neoclassical theory of value.

===New interpretation===
Ricardo&#x27;s four magic numbers have long been interpreted as comparison of two ratios of labour (or other input in fixed supply) coefficients. This interpretation is now considered as overly simplistic by modern economists. The point was rediscovered by Roy J. Ruffin in 2002 and re-examined and explained in detail in Andrea Maneschi in 2004. The more flexible approach is now known as the &quot;new interpretation&quot;, despite having been previously mentioned by Piero Sraffa in 1930 and by Kenzo Yukizawa in 1974. The new interpretation affords a totally new reading of Ricardo&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot; with regards to trade theory, although it does not change the mathematics of optimal resource allocation.

=== Protectionism ===
Like Adam Smith, Ricardo was an opponent of protectionism for national economies, especially for agriculture. He believed that the British &quot;Corn Laws&quot;—imposing tariffs on agricultural products—ensured that less-productive domestic land would be cultivated and rents would be driven up . Thus, profits would be directed toward landlords and away from the emerging industrial capitalists. Ricardo believed landlords tended to squander their wealth on luxuries, rather than invest. He believed the Corn Laws were leading to the stagnation of the British economy. In 1846, his nephew John Lewis Ricardo, MP for Stoke-upon-Trent, advocated free trade and the repeal of the Corn Laws.

Modern empirical analysis of the Corn Laws yields mixed results. Parliament repealed the Corn Laws in 1846.

=== Technological change ===
Ricardo was concerned about the impact of technological change on labour in the short-term. In 1821, he wrote that he had become &quot;convinced that the substitution of machinery for human labour, is often very injurious to the interests of the class of labourers,&quot; and that &quot;the opinion entertained by the labouring class, that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct principles of political economy.&quot; Ricardo&#x27;s idea of technological change is now formulated in a modern form.

=== Criticism of the Ricardian theory of trade ===
Ricardo himself was the first to recognize that comparative advantage is a domain-specific theory, meaning that it applies only when certain conditions are met. Ricardo noted that the theory applies only in situations where capital is immobile. Regarding his famous example, he wrote:
it would undoubtedly be advantageous to the capitalists [and consumers] of England... [that] the wine and cloth should both be made in Portugal [and that] the capital and labour of England employed in making cloth should be removed to Portugal for that purpose.
Ricardo recognized that applying his theory in situations where capital was mobile would result in offshoring, and thereby economic decline and job loss. To correct for this, he argued that (i) &quot;most men of property [will be] satisfied with a low rate of profits in their own country, rather than seek[ing] a more advantageous employment for their wealth in foreign nations&quot;, and (ii) capital was functionally immobile.

Ricardo&#x27;s argument in favour of free trade has also been attacked by those who believe trade restriction can be necessary for the economic development of a nation. Utsa Patnaik claims that Ricardian theory of international trade contains a logical fallacy. Ricardo assumed that in both countries two goods are producible and actually are produced, but developed and underdeveloped countries often trade those goods which are not producible in their own country. In these cases, one cannot define which country has comparative advantage.

Critics also argue that Ricardo&#x27;s theory of comparative advantage is flawed in that it assumes production is continuous and absolute. In the real world, events outside the realm of human control (e.g. natural disasters) can disrupt production. In this case, specialisation could cripple a country that depends on imports from foreign, naturally disrupted countries. For example, if an industrially based country trades its manufactured goods with an agrarian country in exchange for agricultural products, a natural disaster in the agricultural country (e.g. drought) may cause the industrially based country to starve.

As Joan Robinson pointed out, following the opening of free trade with England, Portugal endured centuries of economic underdevelopment: &quot;the imposition of free trade on Portugal killed off a promising textile industry and left her with a slow-growing export market for wine, while for England, exports of cotton cloth led to accumulation, mechanisation and the whole spiralling growth of the industrial revolution&quot;. Robinson argued that Ricardo&#x27;s example required that economies be in static equilibrium positions with full employment and that there could not be a trade deficit or a trade surplus. These conditions, she wrote, were not relevant to the real world. She also argued that Ricardo&#x27;s math did not take into account that some countries may be at different levels of development and that this raised the prospect of &#x27;unequal exchange&#x27; which might hamper a country&#x27;s development, as we saw in the case of Portugal.

The development economist Ha-Joon Chang challenges the argument that free trade benefits every country:

Ricardo’s theory is absolutely right—within its narrow confines. His theory correctly says that, &quot;accepting their current levels of technology as given&quot;, it is better for countries to specialize in things that they are relatively better at. One cannot argue with that. His theory fails when a country wants to acquire more advanced technologies—that is, when it wants to develop its economy. It takes time and experience to absorb new technologies, so technologically backward producers need a period of protection from international competition during this period of learning. Such protection is costly, because the country is giving up the chance to import better and cheaper products. However, it is a price that has to be paid if it wants to develop advanced industries. Ricardo’s theory is, thus seen, for those who accept the &quot;status quo&quot; but not for those who want to change it.
==Ricardian equivalence==
Another idea associated with Ricardo is Ricardian equivalence, an argument suggesting that in some circumstances a government&#x27;s choice of how to pay for its spending (&quot;i.e.,&quot; whether to use tax revenue or issue debt and run a deficit) might have no effect on the economy. This is due to the fact the public saves its excess money to pay for expected future tax increases that will be used to pay off the debt. Ricardo notes that the proposition is theoretically implied in the presence of intertemporal optimisation by rational taxpayers: but that since taxpayers do not act so rationally, the proposition fails to be true in practice. Thus, while the proposition bears his name, he does not seem to have believed it. Economist Robert Barro is responsible for its modern prominence.

==Influence and intellectual legacy==
David Ricardo&#x27;s ideas had a tremendous influence on later developments in economics. US economists rank Ricardo as the second most influential economic thinker, behind Adam Smith, prior to the twentieth century.

===Ricardian socialists===
Despite his laissez-faire capitalist views, Ricardo&#x27;s writings fascinated a number of early socialists in the 1820s, who thought his value theory had radical implications. They argued that, in view of labour theory of value, labour produces the entire product, and the profits capitalists get are a result of exploitations of workers. These include Thomas Hodgskin, William Thompson, John Francis Bray, and Percy Ravenstone.

===Georgists===
Georgists believe that rent, in the sense that Ricardo used, belongs to the community as a whole. Henry George was greatly influenced by Ricardo, and often cited him, including in his most famous work, &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; from 1879. In the preface to the fourth edition he wrote: &quot;What I have done in this book, if I have correctly solved the great problem I have sought to investigate, is, to unite the truth perceived by the school of Smith and Ricardo to the truth perceived by the school of Proudhon and Lasalle; to show that laissez faire (in its full true meaning) opens the way to a realization of the noble dreams of socialism; to identify social law with moral law, and to disprove ideas which in the minds of many cloud grand and elevating perceptions.&quot;

===Neo-Ricardians===
After the rise of the &#x27;neoclassical&#x27; school, Ricardo&#x27;s influence declined temporarily. It was Piero Sraffa, the editor of the Collected Works of David Ricardo and the author of seminal &quot;Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities&quot;, who resurrected Ricardo as the originator of another strand of economic thought, which was effaced with the arrival of the neoclassical school. The new interpretation of Ricardo and Sraffa&#x27;s criticism against the marginal theory of value gave rise to a new school, now named neo-Ricardian or Sraffian school. Major contributors to this school include Luigi Pasinetti (1930–2023), Pierangelo Garegnani (1930–2011), Ian Steedman (1941–), Geoffrey Harcourt (1931–2021), Heinz Kurz (1946–), Neri Salvadori (1951–), Pier Paolo Saviotti (–) among others. See also Neo-Ricardianism. The Neo-Ricardian school is sometimes seen to be a component of Post-Keynesian economics.

====Neo-Ricardian trade theory====
Inspired by Piero Sraffa, a new strand of trade theory emerged and was named neo-Ricardian trade theory. The main contributors include Ian Steedman and Stanley Metcalfe. They have criticised neoclassical international trade theory, namely the Heckscher–Ohlin model on the basis that the notion of capital as primary factor has no method of measuring it before the determination of profit rate (thus trapped in a logical vicious circle). This was a second round of the Cambridge capital controversy, this time in the field of international trade. Depoortère and Ravix judge that neo-Ricardian contribution failed without giving effective impact on neoclassical trade theory, because it could not offer &quot;a genuine alternative approach from a classical point of view.&quot;

====Evolutionary growth theory====
Several distinctive groups have sprung out of the neo-Ricardian school. One is the evolutionary growth theory, developed notably by Luigi Pasinetti, J.S. Metcalfe, Pier Paolo Saviotti, and Koen Frenken and others.

Pasinetti argued that the demand for any commodity came to stagnate and frequently decline, demand saturation occurs. Introduction of new commodities (goods and services) is necessary to avoid economic stagnation.

====Contemporary theories====

Ricardo&#x27;s idea was even expanded to the case of continuum of goods by Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson This formulation is employed for example by Matsuyama and others.

Ricardian trade theory ordinarily assumes that the labour is the unique input. This is a deficiency as intermediate goods occupies now a great part of international trade. The situation changed after the appearance of Yoshinori Shiozawa&#x27;s work of 2007. He has succeeded to incorporate traded input goods in his model. His theory became more useful by the discovery of new definition of regular international values (a couple of wage rates for countries and prices for products), because it is not defined as the normal vector at a facet of world production possibility set, which is the set where all countries enjoy full employment. The new definition is given in Shiozawa and Fujimoto (2018) and in Shiozawa (2020). Shiozawa&#x27;s theory of international values is now the unique theory of international trade that can treat unemployment and input trade in a general form.

Yeats found that 30% of world trade in manufacturing is intermediate inputs. Bardhan and Jafee found that intermediate inputs occupy 37 to 38% in the imports to the US for the years from 1992 to 1997, whereas the percentage of intrafirm trade grew from 43% in 1992 to 52% in 1997.

====Unequal exchange====
Chris Edward includes Emmanuel&#x27;s unequal exchange theory among variations of neo-Ricardian trade theory. Arghiri Emmanuel argued that the Third World is poor because of the international exploitation of labour.

The unequal exchange theory of trade has been influential to the (new) dependency theory.

==Publications==

Ricardo&#x27;s publications included:
* &quot;The High Price of Bullion, a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes&quot; (1810), which advocated the adoption of a metallic currency.
* &quot;Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock&quot; (1815), which argued that repealing the Corn Laws would distribute more wealth to the productive members of society.
* &quot;On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot; (1817), an analysis that concluded that land rent grows as population increases. It also clearly laid out the theory of comparative advantage, which argued that all nations could benefit from free trade, even if a nation was less efficient at producing all kinds of goods than its trading partners.

His works and writings were collected in (11 volumes)
