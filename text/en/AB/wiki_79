<text>Ethics is the philosophical study of moral phenomena. Also called moral philosophy, it investigates normative questions about what people ought to do or which behavior is morally right. Its main branches include normative ethics, applied ethics, and metaethics.

Normative ethics aims to find general principles that govern how people should act. Applied ethics examines concrete ethical problems in real-life situations, such as abortion, treatment of animals, and business practices. Metaethics explores the underlying assumptions and concepts of ethics. It asks whether there are objective moral facts, how moral knowledge is possible, and how moral judgments motivate people. Influential normative theories are consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics. According to consequentialists, an act is right if it leads to the best consequences. Deontologists focus on acts themselves, saying that they must adhere to duties, like telling the truth and keeping promises. Virtue ethics sees the manifestation of virtues, like courage and compassion, as the fundamental principle of morality.

Ethics is closely connected to value theory, which studies the nature and types of value, like the contrast between intrinsic and instrumental value. Moral psychology is a related empirical field and investigates psychological processes involved in morality, such as reasoning and the formation of character. Descriptive ethics describes the dominant moral codes and beliefs in different societies and considers their historical dimension.

The history of ethics started in the ancient period with the development of ethical principles and theories in ancient Egypt, India, China, and Greece. This period saw the emergence of ethical teachings associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and contributions of philosophers like Socrates and Aristotle. During the medieval period, ethical thought was strongly influenced by religious teachings. In the modern period, this focus shifted to a more secular approach concerned with moral experience, reasons for acting, and the consequences of actions. An influential development in the 20th century was the emergence of metaethics.

== Definition ==
Ethics, also called moral philosophy, is the study of moral phenomena. It is one of the main branches of philosophy and investigates the nature of morality and the principles that govern the moral evaluation of conduct, character traits, and institutions. It examines what obligations people have, what behavior is right and wrong, and how to lead a good life. Some of its key questions are &quot;How should one live?&quot; and &quot;What gives meaning to life?&quot;. In contemporary philosophy, ethics is usually divided into normative ethics, applied ethics, and metaethics.

Morality is about what people ought to do rather than what they actually do, what they want to do, or what social conventions require. As a rational and systematic field of inquiry, ethics studies practical reasons why people should act one way rather than another. Most ethical theories seek universal principles that express a general standpoint of what is objectively right and wrong. In a slightly different sense, the term &quot;ethics&quot; can also refer to individual ethical theories in the form of a rational system of moral principles, such as Aristotelian ethics, and to a moral code that certain societies, social groups, or professions follow, as in Protestant work ethic and medical ethics.

The English word &quot;ethics&quot; has its roots in the Ancient Greek word (), meaning and . This word gave rise to the Ancient Greek word (), which was translated into Latin as and entered the English language in the 15th century through the Old French term . The term &quot;morality&quot; originates in the Latin word , meaning and . It was introduced into the English language during the Middle English period through the Old French term .

The terms &quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;morality&quot; are usually used interchangeably but some philosophers distinguish between the two. According to one view, morality focuses on what moral obligations people have while ethics is broader and includes ideas about what is good and how to lead a meaningful life. Another difference is that codes of conduct in specific areas, such as business and environment, are usually termed &quot;ethics&quot; rather than morality, as in business ethics and environmental ethics.

== Normative ethics ==

Normative ethics is the philosophical study of ethical conduct and investigates the fundamental principles of morality. It aims to discover and justify general answers to questions like &quot;How should one live?&quot; and &quot;How should people act?&quot;, usually in the form of universal or domain-independent principles that determine whether an act is right or wrong. For example, given the particular impression that it is wrong to set a child on fire for fun, normative ethics aims to find more general principles that explain why this is the case, like the principle that one should not cause extreme suffering to the innocent, which may itself be explained in terms of a more general principle. Many theories of normative ethics also aim to guide behavior by helping people make moral decisions.

Theories in normative ethics state how people should act or what kind of behavior is correct. They do not aim to describe how people normally act, what moral beliefs ordinary people have, how these beliefs change over time, or what ethical codes are upheld in certain social groups. These topics belong to descriptive ethics and are studied in fields like anthropology, sociology, and history rather than normative ethics.

Some systems of normative ethics arrive at a single principle covering all possible cases. Others encompass a small set of basic rules that address all or at least the most important moral considerations. One difficulty for systems with several basic principles is that these principles may conflict with each other in some cases and lead to ethical dilemmas.

Distinct theories in normative ethics suggest different principles as the foundation of morality. The three most influential schools of thought are consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics. These schools are usually presented as exclusive alternatives, but depending on how they are defined, they can overlap and do not necessarily exclude one another. In some cases, they differ in which acts they see as right or wrong. In other cases, they recommend the same course of action but provide different justifications for why it is right.

=== Consequentialism ===
Consequentialism, also called teleological ethics, says that morality depends on consequences. According to the most common view, an act is right if it brings the best future. This means that there is no alternative course of action that has better consequences. A key aspect of consequentialist theories is that they provide a characterization of what is good and then define what is right in terms of what is good. For example, classical utilitarianism says that pleasure is good and that the action leading to the most overall pleasure is right. Consequentialism has been discussed indirectly since the formulation of classical utilitarianism in the late 18th century. A more explicit analysis of this view happened in the 20th century, when the term was coined by G. E. M. Anscombe.

Consequentialists usually understand the consequences of an action in a very wide sense that includes the totality of its effects. This is based on the idea that actions make a difference in the world by bringing about a causal chain of events that would not have existed otherwise. A core intuition behind consequentialism is that the future should be shaped to achieve the best possible outcome.

The act itself is usually not seen as part of the consequences. This means that if an act has intrinsic value or disvalue, it is not included as a factor. Some consequentialists see this as a flaw, saying that all value-relevant factors need to be considered. They try to avoid this complication by including the act itself as part of the consequences. A related approach is to characterize consequentialism not in terms of consequences but in terms of outcome, with the outcome being defined as the act together with its consequences.

Most forms of consequentialism are agent-neutral. This means that the value of consequences is assessed from a neutral perspective, that is, acts should have consequences that are good in general and not just good for the agent. It is controversial whether agent-relative moral theories, like ethical egoism, should be considered as types of consequentialism.

==== Types ====
There are many different types of consequentialism. They differ based on what type of entity they evaluate, what consequences they take into consideration, and how they determine the value of consequences. Most theories assess the moral value of acts. However, consequentialism can also be used to evaluate motives, character traits, rules, and policies.

Many types assess the value of consequences based on whether they promote happiness or suffering. But there are also alternative evaluative principles, such as desire satisfaction, autonomy, freedom, knowledge, friendship, beauty, and self-perfection. Some forms of consequentialism hold that there is only a single source of value. The most prominent among them is classical utilitarianism, which states that the moral value of acts only depends on the pleasure and suffering they cause. An alternative approach says that there are many different sources of value, which all contribute to one overall value. Before the 20th century, consequentialists were only concerned with the total of value or the aggregate good. In the 20th century, alternative views were developed that additionally consider the distribution of value. One of them states that an equal distribution of goods is better than an unequal distribution even if the aggregate good is the same.

There are disagreements about which consequences should be assessed. An important distinction is between act consequentialism and rule consequentialism. According to act consequentialism, the consequences of an act determine its moral value. This means that there is a direct relation between the consequences of an act and its moral value. Rule consequentialism, by contrast, holds that an act is right if it follows a certain set of rules. Rule consequentialism determines the best rules by considering their outcomes at a community level. People should follow the rules that lead to the best consequences when everyone in the community follows them. This implies that the relation between an act and its consequences is indirect. For example, if telling the truth is one of the best rules, then according to rule consequentialism, a person should tell the truth even in specific cases where lying would lead to better consequences.

Another disagreement is between actual and expected consequentialism. According to the traditional view, only the actual consequences of an act affect its moral value. One difficulty of this view is that many consequences cannot be known in advance. This means that in some cases, even well-planned and intentioned acts are morally wrong if they inadvertently lead to negative outcomes. An alternative perspective states that what matters are not the actual consequences but the expected consequences. This view takes into account that when deciding what to do, people have to rely on their limited knowledge of the total consequences of their actions. According to this view, a course of action has positive moral value despite leading to an overall negative outcome if it had the highest expected value, for example, because the negative outcome could not be anticipated or was unlikely.

A further difference is between maximizing and satisficing consequentialism. According to maximizing consequentialism, only the best possible act is morally permitted. This means that acts with positive consequences are wrong if there are alternatives with even better consequences. One criticism of maximizing consequentialism is that it demands too much by requiring that people do significantly more than they are socially expected to. For example, if the best action for someone with a good salary would be to donate 70% of their income to charity, it would be morally wrong for them to only donate 65%. Satisficing consequentialism, by contrast, only requires that an act is &quot;good enough&quot; even if it is not the best possible alternative. According to this view, it is possible to do more than one is morally required to do.

Mohism in ancient Chinese philosophy is one of the earliest forms of consequentialism. It arose in the 5th century BCE and argued that political action should promote justice as a means to increase the welfare of the people.

==== Utilitarianism ====

The most well-known form of consequentialism is utilitarianism. In its classical form, it is an act consequentialism that sees happiness as the only source of intrinsic value. This means that an act is morally right if it produces &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number&quot; by increasing happiness and reducing suffering. Utilitarians do not deny that other things also have value, like health, friendship, and knowledge. However, they deny that these things have intrinsic value. Instead, they say that they have extrinsic value because they affect happiness and suffering. In this regard, they are desirable as a means but, unlike happiness, not as an end. The view that pleasure is the only thing with intrinsic value is called ethical or evaluative hedonism.

Classical utilitarianism was initially formulated by Jeremy Bentham at the end of the 18th century and further developed by John Stuart Mill. Bentham introduced the hedonic calculus to assess the value of consequences. Two key aspects of the hedonic calculus are the intensity and the duration of pleasure. According to this view, a pleasurable experience has a high value if it has a high intensity and lasts for a long time. A common criticism of Bentham&#x27;s utilitarianism argued that its focus on the intensity of pleasure promotes an immoral lifestyle centered around indulgence in sensory gratification. Mill responded to this criticism by distinguishing between higher and lower pleasures. He stated that higher pleasures, like the intellectual satisfaction of reading a book, are more valuable than lower pleasures, like the sensory enjoyment of food and drink, even if their intensity and duration are the same. Since its original formulation, many variations of utilitarianism have developed, including the difference between act and rule utilitarianism and between maximizing and satisficing utilitarianism.

=== Deontology ===

Deontology assesses the moral rightness of actions based on a set of norms or principles. These norms describe the requirements that all actions need to follow. They may include principles like telling the truth, keeping promises, and not intentionally harming others. Unlike consequentialists, deontologists hold that the validity of general moral principles does not directly depend on their consequences. They state that these principles should be followed in every case since they express how actions are inherently right or wrong. According to moral philosopher David Ross, it is wrong to break a promise even if no harm comes from it. Deontologists are interested in which actions are right and often allow that there is a gap between what is right and what is good. Many focus on prohibitions and describe which acts are forbidden under any circumstances.

==== Agent-centered and patient-centered ====
Agent-centered deontological theories focus on the person who acts and the duties they have. Agent-centered theories often focus on the motives and intentions behind people&#x27;s actions, highlighting the importance of acting for the right reasons. They tend to be agent-relative, meaning that the reasons for which people should act depend on personal circumstances. For example, a parent has a special obligation to their child, while a stranger does not have this kind of obligation toward a child they do not know. Patient-centered theories, by contrast, focus on the people affected by actions and the rights they have. An example is the requirement to treat other people as ends and not merely as a means to an end. This requirement can be used to argue, for example, that it is wrong to kill a person against their will even if this act would save the lives of several others. Patient-centered deontological theories are usually agent-neutral, meaning that they apply equally to everyone in a situation, regardless of their specific role or position.

==== Kantianism ====

Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) is one of the most well-known deontologists. He states that reaching outcomes that people desire, such as being happy, is not the main purpose of moral actions. Instead, he argues that there are universal principles that apply to everyone independent of their desires. He uses the term &quot;categorical imperative&quot; for these principles, saying that they have their source in the structure of practical reason and are true for all rational agents. According to Kant, to act morally is to act in agreement with reason as expressed by these principles while violating them is both immoral and irrational.

Kant provided several formulations of the categorical imperative. One formulation says that a person should only follow maxims that can be universalized. This means that the person would want everyone to follow the same maxim as a universal law applicable to everyone. Another formulation states that one should treat other people always as ends in themselves and never as mere means to an end. This formulation focuses on respecting and valuing other people for their own sake rather than using them in the pursuit of personal goals.

In either case, Kant says that what matters is to have a good will. A person has a good will if they respect the moral law and form their intentions and motives in agreement with it. Kant states that actions motivated in such a way are unconditionally good, meaning that they are good even in cases where they result in undesirable consequences.

==== Others ====

Divine command theory says that God is the source of morality. It states that moral laws are divine commands and that to act morally is to obey and follow God&#x27;s will. While all divine command theorists agree that morality depends on God, there are disagreements about the precise content of the divine commands, and theorists belonging to different religions tend to propose different moral laws. For example, Christian and Jewish divine command theorists may argue that the Ten Commandments express God&#x27;s will while Muslims may reserve this role for the teachings of the Quran. 

Contractualists reject the reference to God as the source of morality and argue instead that morality is based on an explicit or implicit social contract between humans. They state that actual or hypothetical consent to this contract is the source of moral norms and duties. To determine which duties people have, contractualists often rely on a thought experiment about what rational people under ideal circumstances would agree on. For example, if they would agree that people should not lie then there is a moral obligation to refrain from lying. Because it relies on consent, contractualism is often understood as a patient-centered form of deontology. Famous social contract theorists include Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and John Rawls.

Discourse ethics also focuses on social agreement on moral norms but says that this agreement is based on communicative rationality. It aims to arrive at moral norms for pluralistic modern societies that encompass a diversity of viewpoints. A universal moral norm is seen as valid if all rational discourse participants do or would approve. This way, morality is not imposed by a single moral authority but arises from the moral discourse within society. This discourse should aim to establish an ideal speech situation to ensure fairness and inclusivity. In particular, this means that discourse participants are free to voice their different opinions without coercion but are at the same time required to justify them using rational argumentation.

=== Virtue ethics ===

The main concern of virtue ethics is how virtues are expressed in actions. As such, it is neither directly interested in the consequences of actions nor in universal moral duties. Virtues are positive character traits like honesty, courage, kindness, and compassion. They are usually understood as dispositions to feel, decide, and act in a certain manner by being wholeheartedly committed to this manner. Virtues contrast with vices, which are their harmful counterparts.

Virtue theorists usually say that the mere possession of virtues by itself is not sufficient. Instead, people should manifest virtues in their actions. An important factor is the practical wisdom, also called &quot;phronesis&quot;, of knowing when, how, and which virtue to express. For example, a lack of practical wisdom may lead courageous people to perform morally wrong actions by taking unnecessary risks that should better be avoided.

Different types of virtue ethics differ on how they understand virtues and their role in practical life. Eudaimonism is the original form of virtue theory developed in Ancient Greek philosophy and draws a close relation between virtuous behavior and happiness. It states that people flourish by living a virtuous life. Eudaimonist theories often hold that virtues are positive potentials residing in human nature and that actualizing these potentials results in leading a good and happy life. Agent-based theories, by contrast, see happiness only as a side effect and focus instead on the admirable traits and motivational characteristics expressed while acting. This is often combined with the idea that one can learn from exceptional individuals what those characteristics are. Feminist ethics of care are another form of virtue ethics. They emphasize the importance of interpersonal relationships and say that benevolence by caring for the well-being of others is one of the key virtues.

Influential schools of virtue ethics in ancient philosophy were Aristotelianism and Stoicism. According to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), each virtue is a golden mean between two types of vices: excess and deficiency. For example, courage is a virtue that lies between the deficient state of cowardice and the excessive state of recklessness. Aristotle held that virtuous action leads to happiness and makes people flourish in life. Stoicism emerged about 300 BCE and taught that, through virtue alone, people can achieve happiness characterized by a peaceful state of mind free from emotional disturbances. The Stoics advocated rationality and self-mastery to achieve this state. In the 20th century, virtue ethics experienced a resurgence thanks to philosophers such as Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Martha Nussbaum.

=== Other traditions ===
There are many other schools of normative ethics in addition to the three main traditions. Pragmatist ethics focuses on the role of practice and holds that one of the key tasks of ethics is to solve practical problems in concrete situations. It has certain similarities to utilitarianism and its focus on consequences but concentrates more on how morality is embedded in and relative to social and cultural contexts. Pragmatists tend to give more importance to habits than to conscious deliberation and understand morality as a habit that should be shaped in the right way.

Postmodern ethics agrees with pragmatist ethics about the cultural relativity of morality. It rejects the idea that there are objective moral principles that apply universally to all cultures and traditions. It asserts that there is no one coherent ethical code since morality itself is irrational and humans are morally ambivalent beings. Postmodern ethics instead focuses on how moral demands arise in specific situations as one encounters other people.

Ethical egoism is the view that people should act in their self-interest or that an action is morally right if the person acts for their own benefit. It differs from psychological egoism, which states that people actually follow their self-interest without claiming that they should do so. Ethical egoists may act in agreement with commonly accepted moral expectations and benefit other people, for example, by keeping promises, helping friends, and cooperating with others. However, they do so only as a means to promote their self-interest. Ethical egoism is often criticized as an immoral and contradictory position.

Normative ethics has a central place in most religions. Key aspects of Jewish ethics are to follow the 613 commandments of God according to the &quot;Mitzvah&quot; duty found in the Torah and to take responsibility for societal welfare. Christian ethics puts less emphasis on following precise laws and teaches instead the practice of selfless love, such as the Great Commandment to &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself&quot;. The Five Pillars of Islam constitute a basic framework of Muslim ethics and focus on the practice of faith, prayer, charity, fasting during Ramadan, and pilgrimage to Mecca.

Buddhists emphasize the importance of compassion and loving-kindness towards all sentient entities. A similar outlook is found in Jainism, which has non-violence as its principal virtue. Duty is a central aspect of Hindu ethics and is about fulfilling social obligations, which may vary depending on a person&#x27;s social class and stage of life. Confucianism places great emphasis on harmony in society and sees benevolence as a key virtue. Taoism extends the importance of living in harmony to the whole world and teaches that people should practice effortless action by following the natural flow of the universe. Indigenous belief systems, like Native American philosophy and the African Ubuntu philosophy, often emphasize the interconnectedness of all living beings and the environment while stressing the importance of living in harmony with nature.

== Metaethics ==
Metaethics is the branch of ethics that examines the nature, foundations, and scope of moral judgments, concepts, and values. It is not interested in which actions are right but in what it means for an action to be right and whether moral judgments are objective and can be true at all. It further examines the meaning of &quot;morality&quot; and other moral terms. Metaethics is a metatheory that operates on a higher level of abstraction than normative ethics by investigating its underlying assumptions. Metaethical theories typically do not directly judge which normative ethical theories are correct. However, metaethical theories can still influence normative theories by examining their foundational principles.

Metaethics overlaps with various branches of philosophy. On the level of ontology, it examines whether there are objective moral facts. Concerning semantics, it asks what the meaning of moral terms are and whether moral statements have a truth value. The epistemological side of metaethics discusses whether and how people can acquire moral knowledge. Metaethics overlaps with psychology because of its interest in how moral judgments motivate people to act. It also overlaps with anthropology since it aims to explain how cross-cultural differences affect moral assessments.

=== Basic concepts ===
Metaethics examines basic ethical concepts and their relations. Ethics is primarily concerned with normative statements about what ought to be the case, in contrast to descriptive statements, which are about what is the case. Duties and obligations express requirements of what people ought to do. Duties are sometimes defined as counterparts of the rights that always accompany them. According to this view, someone has a duty to benefit another person if this other person has the right to receive that benefit.

&quot;Obligation&quot; and &quot;permission&quot; are contrasting terms that can be defined through each other: to be obligated to do something means that one is not permitted not to do it and to be permitted to do something means that one is not obligated not to do it. Some theorists define obligations in terms of values or what is good. When used in a general sense, &quot;good&quot; contrasts with &quot;bad&quot;. When describing people and their intentions, the term &quot;evil&quot; rather than &quot;bad&quot; is often employed.

Obligations are used to assess the moral status of actions, motives, and character traits. An action is morally right if it is in tune with a person&#x27;s obligations and morally wrong if it violates them. Supererogation is a special moral status that applies to cases in which the agent does more than is morally required of them. To be morally responsible for an action usually means that the person possesses and exercises certain capacities or some form of control. If a person is morally responsible then it is appropriate to respond to them in certain ways, for example, by praising or blaming them.

=== Realism, relativism, and nihilism ===
A major debate in metaethics is about the ontological status of morality, questioning whether ethical values and principles are real. It examines whether moral properties exist as objective features independent of the human mind and culture rather than as subjective constructs or expressions of personal preferences and cultural norms.

Moral realists accept the claim that there are objective moral facts. This view implies that moral values are mind-independent aspects of reality and that there is an absolute fact about whether a given action is right or wrong. A consequence of this view is that moral requirements have the same ontological status as non-moral facts: it is an objective fact whether there is an obligation to keep a promise just as it is an objective fact whether a thing is rectangular. Moral realism is often associated with the claim that there are universal ethical principles that apply equally to everyone. It implies that if two people disagree about a moral evaluation then at least one of them is wrong. This observation is sometimes taken as an argument against moral realism since moral disagreement is widespread in most fields.

Moral relativists reject the idea that morality is an objective feature of reality. They argue instead that moral principles are human inventions. This means that a behavior is not objectively right or wrong but only subjectively right or wrong relative to a certain standpoint. Moral standpoints may differ between persons, cultures, and historical periods. For example, moral statements like &quot;Slavery is wrong&quot; or &quot;Suicide is permissible&quot; may be true in one culture and false in another. Some moral relativists say that moral systems are constructed to serve certain goals such as social coordination. According to this view, different societies and different social groups within a society construct different moral systems based on their diverging purposes. Emotivism provides a different explanation, stating that morality arises from moral emotions, which are not the same for everyone.

Moral nihilists deny the existence of moral facts. They reject the existence of both objective moral facts defended by moral realism and subjective moral facts defended by moral relativism. They believe that the basic assumptions underlying moral claims are misguided. Some moral nihilists conclude from this that anything is allowed. A slightly different view emphasizes that moral nihilism is not itself a moral position about what is allowed and prohibited but the rejection of any moral position. Moral nihilism, like moral relativism, recognizes that people judge actions as right or wrong from different perspectives. However, it disagrees that this practice involves morality and sees it as just one type of human behavior.

==== Naturalism and non-naturalism ====
A central disagreement among moral realists is between naturalism and non-naturalism. Naturalism states that moral properties are natural properties accessible to empirical observation. They are similar to the natural properties investigated by the natural sciences, like color and shape. Some moral naturalists hold that moral properties are a unique and basic type of natural property. Another view states that moral properties are real but not a fundamental part of reality and can be reduced to other natural properties, such as properties describing the causes of pleasure and pain.

Non-naturalism argues that moral properties form part of reality and that moral features are not identical or reducible to natural properties. This view is usually motivated by the idea that moral properties are unique because they express what should be the case. Proponents of this position often emphasize this uniqueness by claiming that it is a fallacy to define ethics in terms of natural entities or to infer prescriptive from descriptive statements.

=== Cognitivism and non-cognitivism ===
The metaethical debate between cognitivism and non-cognitivism is about the meaning of moral statements and is a part of the study of semantics. According to cognitivism, moral statements like &quot;Abortion is morally wrong&quot; and &quot;Going to war is never morally justified&quot; are truth-apt, meaning that they all have a truth value: they are either true or false. Cognitivism claims that moral statements have a truth value but is not interested in which truth value they have. It is often seen as the default position since moral statements resemble other statements, like &quot;Abortion is a medical procedure&quot; or &quot;Going to war is a political decision&quot;, which have a truth value.

There is a close relation between the semantic theory of cognitivism and the ontological theory of moral realism. Moral realists assert that moral facts exist. This can be used to explain why moral statements are true or false: a statement is true if it is consistent with the facts and false otherwise. As a result, philosophers who accept one theory often accept the other as well. An exception is error theory, which combines cognitivism with moral nihilism by claiming that all moral statements are false because there are no moral facts.

Non-cognitivism is the view that moral statements lack a truth value. According to this view, the statement &quot;Murder is wrong&quot; is neither true nor false. Some non-cognitivists claim that moral statements have no meaning at all. A different interpretation is that they have another type of meaning. Emotivism says that they articulate emotional attitudes. According to this view, the statement &quot;Murder is wrong&quot; expresses that the speaker has a negative moral attitude towards murder or disapproves of it. Prescriptivism, by contrast, understands moral statements as commands. According to this view, stating that &quot;Murder is wrong&quot; expresses a command like &quot;Do not commit murder&quot;.

=== Moral knowledge ===
The epistemology of ethics studies whether or how one can know moral truths. Foundationalist views state that some moral beliefs are basic and do not require further justification. Ethical intuitionism is one such view that says that humans have a special cognitive faculty through which they can know right from wrong. Intuitionists often argue that general moral truths, like &quot;Lying is wrong&quot;, are self-evident and that it is possible to know them without relying on empirical experience. A different foundationalist position focuses on particular observations rather than general intuitions. It says that if people are confronted with a concrete moral situation, they can perceive whether right or wrong conduct was involved.

In contrast to foundationalists, coherentists say that there are no basic moral beliefs. They argue that beliefs form a complex network and mutually support and justify one another. According to this view, a moral belief can only amount to knowledge if it coheres with the rest of the beliefs in the network. Moral skeptics say that people are unable to distinguish between right and wrong behavior, thereby rejecting the idea that moral knowledge is possible. A common objection by critics of moral skepticism asserts that it leads to immoral behavior.

Thought experiments are used as a method in ethics to decide between competing theories. They usually present an imagined situation involving an ethical dilemma and explore how people&#x27;s intuitions of right and wrong change based on specific details in that situation. For example, in Philippa Foot&#x27;s trolley problem, a person can flip a switch to redirect a trolley from one track to another, thereby sacrificing the life of one person to save five. This scenario explores how the difference between doing and allowing harm affects moral obligations. Another thought experiment, proposed by Judith Jarvis Thomson, examines the moral implications of abortion by imagining a situation in which a person gets connected without their consent to an ill violinist. In this scenario, the violinist dies if the connection is severed, similar to how a fetus dies in the case of abortion. The thought experiment explores whether it would be morally permissible to sever the connection within the next nine months.

=== Moral motivation ===
On the level of psychology, metaethics is interested in how moral beliefs and experiences affect behavior. According to motivational internalists, there is a direct link between moral judgments and action. This means that every judgment about what is right motivates the person to act accordingly. For example, Socrates defends a strong form of motivational internalism by holding that a person can only perform an evil deed if they are unaware that it is evil. Weaker forms of motivational internalism say that people can act against their own moral judgments, for example, because of the weakness of the will. Motivational externalists accept that people can judge an act to be morally required without feeling a reason to engage in it. This means that moral judgments do not always provide motivational force. A closely related question is whether moral judgments can provide motivation on their own or need to be accompanied by other mental states, such as a desire to act morally.

== Applied ethics ==
Applied ethics, also known as practical ethics, is the branch of ethics and applied philosophy that examines concrete moral problems encountered in real-life situations. Unlike normative ethics, it is not concerned with discovering or justifying universal ethical principles. Instead, it studies how those principles can be applied to specific domains of practical life, what consequences they have in these fields, and whether additional domain-specific factors need to be considered.

One of the main challenges of applied ethics is to breach the gap between abstract universal theories and their application to concrete situations. For example, an in-depth understanding of Kantianism or utilitarianism is usually not sufficient to decide how to analyze the moral implications of a medical procedure like abortion. One reason is that it may not be clear how the Kantian requirement of respecting everyone&#x27;s personhood applies to a fetus or, from a utilitarian perspective, what the long-term consequences are in terms of the greatest good for the greatest number. This difficulty is particularly relevant to applied ethicists who employ a top-down methodology by starting from universal ethical principles and applying them to particular cases within a specific domain. A different approach is to use a bottom-up methodology, known as casuistry. This method does not start from universal principles but from moral intuitions about particular cases. It seeks to arrive at moral principles relevant to a specific domain, which may not be applicable to other domains. In either case, inquiry into applied ethics is often triggered by ethical dilemmas in which a person is subject to conflicting moral requirements.

Applied ethics covers issues belonging to both the private sphere, like right conduct in the family and close relationships, and the public sphere, like moral problems posed by new technologies and duties toward future generations. Major branches include bioethics, business ethics, and professional ethics. There are many other branches, and their domains of inquiry often overlap.

=== Bioethics ===

Bioethics covers moral problems associated with living organisms and biological disciplines. A key problem in bioethics is how features such as consciousness, being able to feel pleasure and pain, rationality, and personhood affect the moral status of entities. These differences concern, for example, how to treat non-living entities like rocks and non-sentient entities like plants in contrast to animals, and whether humans have a different moral status than other animals. According to anthropocentrism, only humans have a basic moral status. This suggests that all other entities possess a derivative moral status only insofar as they impact human life. Sentientism, by contrast, extends an inherent moral status to all sentient beings. Further positions include biocentrism, which also covers non-sentient lifeforms, and ecocentrism, which states that all of nature has a basic moral status.

Bioethics is relevant to various aspects of life and many professions. It covers a wide range of moral problems associated with topics like abortion, cloning, stem cell research, euthanasia, suicide, animal testing, intensive animal farming, nuclear waste, and air pollution.

Bioethics can be divided into medical ethics, animal ethics, and environmental ethics based on whether the ethical problems relate to humans, other animals, or nature in general. Medical ethics is the oldest branch of bioethics. The Hippocratic Oath is one of the earliest texts to engage in medical ethics by establishing ethical guidelines for medical practitioners like a prohibition to harm the patient. Medical ethics often addresses issues related to the start and end of life. It examines the moral status of fetuses, for example, whether they are full-fledged persons and whether abortion is a form of murder. Ethical issues also arise about whether a person has the right to end their life in cases of terminal illness or chronic suffering and if doctors may help them do so. Other topics in medical ethics include medical confidentiality, informed consent, research on human beings, organ transplantation, and access to healthcare.

Animal ethics examines how humans should treat other animals. This field often emphasizes the importance of animal welfare while arguing that humans should avoid or minimize the harm done to animals. There is wide agreement that it is wrong to torture animals for fun. The situation is more complicated in cases where harm is inflicted on animals as a side effect of the pursuit of human interests. This happens, for example, during factory farming, when using animals as food, and for research experiments on animals. A key topic in animal ethics is the formulation of animal rights. Animal rights theorists assert that animals have a certain moral status and that humans should respect this status when interacting with them. Examples of suggested animal rights include the right to life, the right to be free from unnecessary suffering, and the right to natural behavior in a suitable environment.

Environmental ethics deals with moral problems relating to the natural environment including animals, plants, natural resources, and ecosystems. In its widest sense, it covers the whole cosmos. In the domain of agriculture, this concerns the circumstances under which the vegetation of an area may be cleared to use it for farming and the implications of planting genetically modified crops. On a wider scale, environmental ethics addresses the problem of global warming and people&#x27;s responsibility on the individual and collective levels, including topics like climate justice and duties towards future generations. Environmental ethicists often promote sustainable practices and policies directed at protecting and conserving ecosystems and biodiversity.

=== Business and professional ethics ===

Business ethics examines the moral implications of business conduct and how ethical principles apply to corporations and organizations. A key topic is corporate social responsibility, which is the responsibility of corporations to act in a manner that benefits society at large. Corporate social responsibility is a complex issue since many stakeholders are directly and indirectly involved in corporate decisions, such as the CEO, the board of directors, and the shareholders. A closely related topic is the question of whether corporations themselves, and not just their stakeholders, have moral agency. Business ethics further examines the role of honesty and fairness in business practices as well as the moral implications of bribery, conflict of interest, protection of investors and consumers, worker&#x27;s rights, ethical leadership, and corporate philanthropy.

Professional ethics is a closely related field that studies ethical principles applying to members of a specific profession, like engineers, medical doctors, lawyers, and teachers. It is a diverse field since different professions often have different responsibilities. Principles applying to many professions include that the professional has the required expertise for the intended work and that they have personal integrity and are trustworthy. Further principles are to serve the interest of their target group, follow client confidentiality, and respect and uphold the client&#x27;s rights, such as informed consent. More precise requirements often vary between professions. A cornerstone of engineering ethics is to protect public safety, health, and well-being. Legal ethics emphasizes the importance of respect for justice, personal integrity, and confidentiality. Key factors in journalism ethics include accuracy, truthfulness, independence, and impartiality as well as proper attribution to avoid plagiarism.

=== Other subfields ===
Many other fields of applied ethics are discussed in the academic literature. Communication ethics covers moral principles of communicative conduct. Two key issues in it are freedom of speech and speech responsibility. Freedom of speech concerns the ability to articulate one&#x27;s opinions and ideas without the threats of punishment and censorship. Speech responsibility is about being accountable for the consequences of communicative action and inaction. A closely related field is information ethics, which focuses on the moral implications of creating, controlling, disseminating, and using information.

The ethics of technology examines the moral issues associated with the creation and use of any artifact, from simple spears to high-tech computers and nanotechnology. Central topics in the ethics of technology include the risks associated with creating new technologies, their responsible use, and questions about human enhancement through technological means, such as performance-enhancing drugs and genetic enhancement. Important subfields include computer ethics, ethics of artificial intelligence, machine ethics, ethics of nanotechnology, and nuclear ethics.
The ethics of war investigates moral problems of war and violent conflicts. According to just war theory, waging war is morally justified if it fulfills certain conditions. These conditions are commonly divided into requirements concerning the cause to initiate violent activities, such as self-defense, and the way those violent activities are conducted, such as avoiding excessive harm to civilians in the pursuit of legitimate military targets. Military ethics is a closely related field that is interested in the conduct of military personnel. It governs questions of the circumstances under which they are permitted to kill enemies, destroy infrastructure, and put the lives of their own troops at risk. Additional topics are the recruitment, training, and discharge of military personnel.

Other fields of applied ethics include political ethics, which examines the moral dimensions of political decisions, educational ethics, which covers ethical issues related to proper teaching practices, and sexual ethics, which addresses the moral implications of sexual behavior.

=== Value theory ===

Value theory, also called axiology, is the philosophical study of value. It examines the nature and types of value. A central distinction is between intrinsic and instrumental value. An entity has intrinsic value if it is good in itself or good for its own sake. An entity has instrumental value if it is valuable as a means to something else, for example, by causing something that has intrinsic value. Other topics include what kinds of things have value and how valuable they are. For instance, axiological hedonists say that pleasure is the only source of intrinsic value and that the magnitude of value corresponds to the degree of pleasure. Axiological pluralists, by contrast, hold that there are different sources of intrinsic value, such as happiness, knowledge, and beauty.

There are disagreements about the exact relation between value theory and ethics. Some philosophers characterize value theory as a subdiscipline of ethics while others see value theory as the broader term that encompasses other fields besides ethics, such as aesthetics and political philosophy. A different characterization sees the two disciplines as overlapping but distinct fields. The term axiological ethics is sometimes used for the discipline studying this overlap, that is, the part of ethics that studies values. The two disciplines are sometimes distinguished based on their focus: ethics is about moral behavior or what is right while value theory is about value or what is good. Some ethical theories, like consequentialism, stand very close to value theory by defining what is right in terms of what is good. But this is not true for ethics in general and deontological theories tend to reject the idea that what is good can be used to define what is right.

=== Moral psychology ===

Moral psychology explores the psychological foundations and processes involved in moral behavior. It is an empirical science that studies how humans think and act in moral contexts. It is interested in how moral reasoning and judgments take place, how moral character forms, what sensitivity people have to moral evaluations, and how people attribute and react to moral responsibility.

One of its key topics is moral development or the question of how morality develops on a psychological level from infancy to adulthood. According to Lawrence Kohlberg, children go through different stages of moral development as they understand moral principles first as fixed rules governing reward and punishment, then as conventional social norms, and later as abstract principles of what is objectively right across societies. A closely related question is whether and how people can be taught to act morally.

Evolutionary ethics, a closely related field, explores how evolutionary processes have shaped ethics. One of its key ideas is that natural selection is responsible for moral behavior and moral sensitivity. It interprets morality as an adaptation to evolutionary pressure that augments fitness by offering a selective advantage. Altruism, for example, can provide benefits to group survival by improving cooperation. Some theorists, like Mark Rowlands, argue that morality is not limited to humans, meaning that some non-human animals act based on moral emotions. Others explore evolutionary precursors to morality in non-human animals.

=== Descriptive ethics ===

Descriptive ethics, also called comparative ethics, studies existing moral codes, practices, and beliefs. It investigates and compares moral phenomena in different societies and different groups within a society. It aims to provide a value-neutral and empirical description without judging or justifying which practices are objectively right. For instance, the question of how nurses think about the ethical implications of abortion belongs to descriptive ethics. Another example is descriptive business ethics, which describes ethical standards in the context of business, including common practices, official policies, and employee opinions. Descriptive ethics also has a historical dimension by exploring how moral practices and beliefs have changed over time.

Descriptive ethics is a multidisciplinary field that is covered by disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, psychology, and history. Its empirical outlook contrasts with the philosophical inquiry into normative questions, such as which ethical principles are correct and how to justify them.

== History ==
The history of ethics studies how moral philosophy has developed and evolved in the course of history. It has its origin in ancient civilizations. In ancient Egypt, the concept of Maat was used as an ethical principle to guide behavior and maintain order by emphasizing the importance of truth, balance, and harmony. In ancient India starting in the 2nd millennium BCE, the Vedas and later Upanishads were composed as the foundational texts of Hindu philosophy and discussed the role of duty and the consequences of one&#x27;s actions. Buddhist ethics originated in ancient India between the 6th and 5th centuries BCE and advocated compassion, non-violence, and the pursuit of enlightenment. Ancient China in the 6th century BCE saw the emergence of Confucianism, which focuses on moral conduct and self-cultivation by acting in agreement with virtues, and Daoism, which teaches that human behavior should be in harmony with the natural order of the universe.

In ancient Greece, Socrates () emphasized the importance of inquiry into what a good life is by critically questioning established ideas and exploring concepts like virtue, justice, courage, and wisdom. According to Plato (), to lead a good life means that the different parts of the soul are in harmony with each other. For Aristotle (384–322 BCE), a good life is associated with being happy by cultivating virtues and flourishing. Starting in the 4th century BCE, the close relation between right action and happiness was also explored by the Hellenistic schools of Epicureanism, which recommended a simple lifestyle without indulging in sensory pleasures, and Stoicism, which advocated living in tune with reason and virtue while practicing self-mastery and becoming immune to disturbing emotions.

Ethical thought in the medieval period was strongly influenced by religious teachings. Christian philosophers interpreted moral principles as divine commands originating from God. Thomas Aquinas (1224–1274 CE) developed natural law ethics by claiming that ethical behavior consists in following the laws and order of nature, which he believed were created by God. In the Islamic world, philosophers like Al-Farabi () and Avicenna (980–1037 CE) synthesized ancient Greek philosophy with the ethical teachings of Islam while emphasizing the harmony between reason and faith. In medieval India, Hindu philosophers like Adi Shankara () and Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE) saw the practice of spirituality to attain liberation as the highest goal of human behavior.

Moral philosophy in the modern period was characterized by a shift toward a secular approach to ethics. Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) identified self-interest as the primary drive of humans. He concluded that it would lead to &quot;a war of every man against every man&quot; unless a social contract is established to avoid this outcome. David Hume (1711–1776) thought that only moral sentiments, like empathy, can motivate ethical actions while he saw reason not as a motivating factor but only as what anticipates the consequences of possible actions. Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), by contrast, saw reason as the source of morality. He formulated a deontological theory, according to which the ethical value of actions depends on their conformity with moral laws independent of their outcome. These laws take the form of categorical imperatives, which are universal requirements that apply to every situation.

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) saw Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative on its own as an empty formalism and emphasized the role of social institutions in providing concrete content to moral duties. According to the Christian philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), the demands of ethical duties are sometimes suspended when doing God&#x27;s will. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) formulated criticisms of both Christian and Kantian morality. Another influential development in this period was the formulation of utilitarianism by Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). According to the utilitarian doctrine, actions should promote happiness while reducing suffering and the right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

An important development in 20th-century ethics in analytic philosophy was the emergence of metaethics. Significant early contributions to this field were made by G. E. Moore (1873–1958), who argued that moral values are essentially different from other properties found in the natural world. R. M. Hare (1919–2002) followed this idea in formulating his prescriptivism, which states that moral statements are commands that, unlike regular judgments, are neither true nor false. J. L. Mackie (1917–1981) suggested that every moral statement is false since there are no moral facts. An influential argument for moral realism was made by Derek Parfit (1942–2017), who argued that morality concerns objective features of reality that give people reasons to act in one way or another. Bernard Williams (1929–2003) agreed with the close relation between reasons and ethics but defended a subjective view instead that sees reasons as internal mental states that may or may not reflect external reality.

Another development in this period was the revival of ancient virtue ethics by philosophers like Philippa Foot (1920–2010). In the field of political philosophy, John Rawls (1921–2002) relied on Kantian ethics to analyze social justice as a form of fairness. In continental philosophy, phenomenologists such as Max Scheler (1874–1928) and Nicolai Hartmann (1882–1950) built ethical systems based on the claim that values have objective reality that can be investigated using the phenomenological method. Existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) and Simone de Beauvoir (1908–1986), by contrast, held that values are created by humans and explored the consequences of this view in relation to individual freedom, responsibility, and authenticity. This period also saw the emergence of feminist ethics, which questions traditional ethical assumptions associated with a male perspective and puts alternative concepts, like care, at the center.

<doc id="9259" wikidata="Q130998" url="?curid=9259" title="Equivalence relation">
<text>In mathematics, an equivalence relation is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. The equipollence relation between line segments in geometry is a common example of an equivalence relation. A simpler example is equality. Any number formula_1 is equal to itself (reflexive). If formula_2, then formula_3 (symmetric). If formula_2 and formula_5, then formula_6 (transitive).

Each equivalence relation provides a partition of the underlying set into disjoint equivalence classes. Two elements of the given set are equivalent to each other if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class.

== Notation ==

Various notations are used in the literature to denote that two elements formula_1 and formula_8 of a set are equivalent with respect to an equivalence relation formula_9 the most common are &quot;formula_10&quot; and &quot;&quot;, which are used when formula_11 is implicit, and variations of &quot;formula_12&quot;, &quot;&quot;, or &quot;formula_13&quot; to specify formula_11 explicitly. Non-equivalence may be written &quot;&quot; or &quot;formula_15&quot;.

== Definition ==

A binary relation formula_16 on a set formula_17 is said to be an equivalence relation, if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. That is, for all formula_18 and formula_19 in formula_20
* formula_21 (reflexivity).
* formula_10 if and only if formula_23 (symmetry).
* If formula_10 and formula_25 then formula_26 (transitivity).

formula_17 together with the relation formula_16 is called a setoid. The equivalence class of formula_1 under formula_30 denoted formula_31 is defined as formula_32

=== Alternative definition using relational algebra ===

In relational algebra, if formula_33 and formula_34 are relations, then the composite relation formula_35 is defined so that formula_36 if and only if there is a formula_37 such that formula_38 and formula_39. This definition is a generalisation of the definition of functional composition. The defining properties of an equivalence relation formula_11 on a set formula_17 can then be reformulated as follows:
* formula_42. (reflexivity). (Here, formula_43 denotes the identity function on formula_17.)
* formula_45 (symmetry).
* formula_46 (transitivity).

== Examples ==

=== Simple example ===

On the set formula_47, the relation formula_48 is an equivalence relation. The following sets are equivalence classes of this relation:
formula_49

The set of all equivalence classes for formula_11 is formula_51 This set is a partition of the set formula_17. It is also called the quotient set of formula_17 by formula_11.

=== Equivalence relations ===

The following relations are all equivalence relations:
* &quot;Is equal to&quot; on the set of numbers. For example, formula_55 is equal to formula_56
* &quot;Is similar to&quot; on the set of all triangles.
* &quot;Is congruent to&quot; on the set of all triangles.
* Given a function formula_57, &quot;has the same image under formula_58 as&quot; on the elements of formula_58&#x27;s domain formula_17. For example, formula_61 and formula_62 have the same image under formula_63, viz. formula_61. In particular:
** &quot;Has the same absolute value as&quot; on the set of real numbers
** &quot;Has the same cosine as&quot; on the set of all angles.
** Given a natural number formula_65, &quot;is congruent to, modulo formula_65&quot; on the integers.
** &quot;Have the same length and direction&quot; (equipollence) on the set of directed line segments.
** &quot;Has the same birthday as&quot; on the set of all people.

=== Relations that are not equivalences ===

* The relation &quot;≥&quot; between real numbers is reflexive and transitive, but not symmetric. For example, 7 ≥ 5 but not 5 ≥ 7.
* The relation &quot;has a common factor greater than 1 with&quot; between natural numbers greater than 1, is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive. For example, the natural numbers 2 and 6 have a common factor greater than 1, and 6 and 3 have a common factor greater than 1, but 2 and 3 do not have a common factor greater than 1.
* The empty relation &quot;R&quot; (defined so that &quot;aRb&quot; is never true) on a set &quot;X&quot; is vacuously symmetric and transitive; however, it is not reflexive (unless &quot;X&quot; itself is empty).
* The relation &quot;is approximately equal to&quot; between real numbers, even if more precisely defined, is not an equivalence relation, because although reflexive and symmetric, it is not transitive, since multiple small changes can accumulate to become a big change. However, if the approximation is defined asymptotically, for example by saying that two functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are approximately equal near some point if the limit of &quot;f − g&quot; is 0 at that point, then this defines an equivalence relation.

== Connections to other relations ==

* A partial order is a relation that is reflexive, , and transitive.
* Equality is both an equivalence relation and a partial order. Equality is also the only relation on a set that is reflexive, symmetric and antisymmetric. In algebraic expressions, equal variables may be substituted for one another, a facility that is not available for equivalence related variables. The equivalence classes of an equivalence relation can substitute for one another, but not individuals within a class.
* A strict partial order is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetric.
* A partial equivalence relation is transitive and symmetric. Such a relation is reflexive if and only if it is total, that is, if for all formula_67 there exists some formula_68 Therefore, an equivalence relation may be alternatively defined as a symmetric, transitive, and total relation.
* A ternary equivalence relation is a ternary analogue to the usual (binary) equivalence relation.
* A reflexive and symmetric relation is a dependency relation (if finite), and a tolerance relation if infinite.
* A preorder is reflexive and transitive.
* A congruence relation is an equivalence relation whose domain formula_17 is also the underlying set for an algebraic structure, and which respects the additional structure. In general, congruence relations play the role of kernels of homomorphisms, and the quotient of a structure by a congruence relation can be formed. In many important cases, congruence relations have an alternative representation as substructures of the structure on which they are defined (e.g., the congruence relations on groups correspond to the normal subgroups).
* Any equivalence relation is the negation of an apartness relation, though the converse statement only holds in classical mathematics (as opposed to constructive mathematics), since it is equivalent to the law of excluded middle.
* Each relation that is both reflexive and left (or right) Euclidean is also an equivalence relation.

== Well-definedness under an equivalence relation ==

If formula_16 is an equivalence relation on formula_71 and formula_72 is a property of elements of formula_71 such that whenever formula_74 formula_72 is true if formula_76 is true, then the property formula_77 is said to be well-defined or a under the relation formula_78 

A frequent particular case occurs when formula_58 is a function from formula_17 to another set formula_81 if formula_82 implies formula_83 then formula_58 is said to be a for formula_30 a formula_30 or simply formula_78 This occurs, e.g. in the character theory of finite groups. The latter case with the function formula_58 can be expressed by a commutative triangle. See also invariant. Some authors use &quot;compatible with formula_89&quot; or just &quot;respects formula_89&quot; instead of &quot;invariant under formula_89&quot;.

More generally, a function may map equivalent arguments (under an equivalence relation formula_92) to equivalent values (under an equivalence relation formula_93). Such a function is known as a morphism from formula_92 to formula_95

== Related important definitions ==

Let formula_96, and formula_97 be an equivalence relation. Some key definitions and terminology follow:

=== Equivalence class ===
A subset formula_98 of formula_17 such that formula_10 holds for all formula_1 and formula_8 in formula_98, and never for formula_1 in formula_98 and formula_8 outside formula_98, is called an &quot;equivalence class&quot; of formula_17 by formula_97. Let formula_110 denote the equivalence class to which formula_1 belongs. All elements of formula_17 equivalent to each other are also elements of the same equivalence class.

=== Quotient set ===
The set of all equivalence classes of formula_17 by formula_114 denoted formula_115 is the &quot;quotient set&quot; of formula_17 by formula_117 If formula_17 is a topological space, there is a natural way of transforming formula_119 into a topological space; see &quot;Quotient space&quot; for the details.

=== Projection ===
The &quot;projection&quot; of formula_16 is the function formula_121 defined by formula_122 which maps elements of formula_17 into their respective equivalence classes by formula_78
: Theorem on projections: Let the function formula_125 be such that if formula_10 then formula_127 Then there is a unique function formula_128 such that formula_129 If formula_58 is a surjection and formula_131 then formula_132 is a bijection.

=== Equivalence kernel ===
The equivalence kernel of a function formula_58 is the equivalence relation ~ defined by formula_134 The equivalence kernel of an injection is the identity relation.

=== Partition ===

A &quot;partition&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is a set &quot;P&quot; of nonempty subsets of &quot;X&quot;, such that every element of &quot;X&quot; is an element of a single element of &quot;P&quot;. Each element of &quot;P&quot; is a &quot;cell&quot; of the partition. Moreover, the elements of &quot;P&quot; are pairwise disjoint and their union is &quot;X&quot;.

==== Counting partitions ====

Let &quot;X&quot; be a finite set with &quot;n&quot; elements. Since every equivalence relation over &quot;X&quot; corresponds to a partition of &quot;X&quot;, and vice versa, the number of equivalence relations on &quot;X&quot; equals the number of distinct partitions of &quot;X&quot;, which is the &quot;n&quot;th Bell number &quot;Bn&quot;:
:formula_135 (Dobinski&#x27;s formula).

== Fundamental theorem of equivalence relations ==

A key result links equivalence relations and partitions:
* An equivalence relation ~ on a set &quot;X&quot; partitions &quot;X&quot;.
* Conversely, corresponding to any partition of &quot;X&quot;, there exists an equivalence relation ~ on &quot;X&quot;.
In both cases, the cells of the partition of &quot;X&quot; are the equivalence classes of &quot;X&quot; by ~. Since each element of &quot;X&quot; belongs to a unique cell of any partition of &quot;X&quot;, and since each cell of the partition is identical to an equivalence class of &quot;X&quot; by ~, each element of &quot;X&quot; belongs to a unique equivalence class of &quot;X&quot; by ~. Thus there is a natural bijection between the set of all equivalence relations on &quot;X&quot; and the set of all partitions of &quot;X&quot;.

== Comparing equivalence relations ==

If formula_97 and formula_137 are two equivalence relations on the same set formula_138, and formula_10 implies formula_140 for all formula_141 then formula_137 is said to be a coarser relation than formula_97, and formula_97 is a finer relation than formula_137. Equivalently,
* formula_97 is finer than formula_137 if every equivalence class of formula_97 is a subset of an equivalence class of formula_137, and thus every equivalence class of formula_137 is a union of equivalence classes of formula_97.
* formula_97 is finer than formula_137 if the partition created by formula_97 is a refinement of the partition created by formula_137.

The equality equivalence relation is the finest equivalence relation on any set, while the universal relation, which relates all pairs of elements, is the coarsest.

The relation &quot;formula_97 is finer than formula_137&quot; on the collection of all equivalence relations on a fixed set is itself a partial order relation, which makes the collection a geometric lattice.

== Generating equivalence relations ==

* Given any set formula_71 an equivalence relation over the set formula_159 of all functions formula_160 can be obtained as follows. Two functions are deemed equivalent when their respective sets of fixpoints have the same cardinality, corresponding to cycles of length one in a permutation.
* An equivalence relation formula_16 on formula_17 is the equivalence kernel of its surjective projection formula_163 Conversely, any surjection between sets determines a partition on its domain, the set of preimages of singletons in the codomain. Thus an equivalence relation over formula_71 a partition of formula_71 and a projection whose domain is formula_71 are three equivalent ways of specifying the same thing.
* The intersection of any collection of equivalence relations over &quot;X&quot; (binary relations viewed as a subset of formula_167) is also an equivalence relation. This yields a convenient way of generating an equivalence relation: given any binary relation &quot;R&quot; on &quot;X&quot;, the equivalence relation is the intersection of all equivalence relations containing &quot;R&quot; (also known as the smallest equivalence relation containing &quot;R&quot;). Concretely, &quot;R&quot; generates the equivalence relation 
::formula_10 if there exists a natural number formula_65 and elements formula_170 such that formula_171, formula_172, and formula_173 or formula_174, for formula_175
:The equivalence relation generated in this manner can be trivial. For instance, the equivalence relation generated by any total order on &quot;X&quot; has exactly one equivalence class, &quot;X&quot; itself.
* Equivalence relations can construct new spaces by &quot;gluing things together.&quot; Let &quot;X&quot; be the unit Cartesian square formula_176 and let ~ be the equivalence relation on &quot;X&quot; defined by formula_177 for all formula_178 and formula_179 for all formula_180 Then the quotient space formula_119 can be naturally identified (homeomorphism) with a torus: take a square piece of paper, bend and glue together the upper and lower edge to form a cylinder, then bend the resulting cylinder so as to glue together its two open ends, resulting in a torus.

== Algebraic structure ==

Much of mathematics is grounded in the study of equivalences, and order relations. Lattice theory captures the mathematical structure of order relations. Even though equivalence relations are as ubiquitous in mathematics as order relations, the algebraic structure of equivalences is not as well known as that of orders. The former structure draws primarily on group theory and, to a lesser extent, on the theory of lattices, categories, and groupoids.

=== Group theory ===

Just as order relations are grounded in ordered sets, sets closed under pairwise supremum and infimum, equivalence relations are grounded in partitioned sets, which are sets closed under bijections that preserve partition structure. Since all such bijections map an equivalence class onto itself, such bijections are also known as permutations. Hence permutation groups (also known as transformation groups) and the related notion of orbit shed light on the mathematical structure of equivalence relations.

Let &#x27;~&#x27; denote an equivalence relation over some nonempty set &quot;A&quot;, called the universe or underlying set. Let &quot;G&quot; denote the set of bijective functions over &quot;A&quot; that preserve the partition structure of &quot;A&quot;, meaning that for all formula_182 and formula_183 Then the following three connected theorems hold:
* ~ partitions &quot;A&quot; into equivalence classes. (This is the , mentioned above);
* Given a partition of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;G&quot; is a transformation group under composition, whose orbits are the cells of the partition;
* Given a transformation group &quot;G&quot; over &quot;A&quot;, there exists an equivalence relation ~ over &quot;A&quot;, whose equivalence classes are the orbits of &quot;G&quot;.

In sum, given an equivalence relation ~ over &quot;A&quot;, there exists a transformation group &quot;G&quot; over &quot;A&quot; whose orbits are the equivalence classes of &quot;A&quot; under ~.

This transformation group characterisation of equivalence relations differs fundamentally from the way lattices characterize order relations. The arguments of the lattice theory operations meet and join are elements of some universe &quot;A&quot;. Meanwhile, the arguments of the transformation group operations composition and inverse are elements of a set of bijections, &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot;.

Moving to groups in general, let &quot;H&quot; be a subgroup of some group &quot;G&quot;. Let ~ be an equivalence relation on &quot;G&quot;, such that formula_184 The equivalence classes of ~—also called the orbits of the action of &quot;H&quot; on &quot;G&quot;—are the right cosets of &quot;H&quot; in &quot;G&quot;. Interchanging &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; yields the left cosets.

Related thinking can be found in Rosen (2008: chpt. 10).

=== Categories and groupoids ===

Let &quot;G&quot; be a set and let &quot;~&quot; denote an equivalence relation over &quot;G&quot;. Then we can form a groupoid representing this equivalence relation as follows. The objects are the elements of &quot;G&quot;, and for any two elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, there exists a unique morphism from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; if and only if formula_185

The advantages of regarding an equivalence relation as a special case of a groupoid include:
*Whereas the notion of &quot;free equivalence relation&quot; does not exist, that of a free groupoid on a directed graph does. Thus it is meaningful to speak of a &quot;presentation of an equivalence relation,&quot; i.e., a presentation of the corresponding groupoid;
* Bundles of groups, group actions, sets, and equivalence relations can be regarded as special cases of the notion of groupoid, a point of view that suggests a number of analogies;
*In many contexts &quot;quotienting,&quot; and hence the appropriate equivalence relations often called congruences, are important. This leads to the notion of an internal groupoid in a category.

=== Lattices ===

The equivalence relations on any set &quot;X&quot;, when ordered by set inclusion, form a complete lattice, called Con &quot;X&quot; by convention. The canonical map ker : &quot;X&quot;^&quot;X&quot; → Con &quot;X&quot;, relates the monoid &quot;X&quot;^&quot;X&quot; of all functions on &quot;X&quot; and Con &quot;X&quot;. ker is surjective but not injective. Less formally, the equivalence relation ker on &quot;X&quot;, takes each function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; to its kernel ker &quot;f&quot;. Likewise, ker(ker) is an equivalence relation on &quot;X&quot;^&quot;X&quot;.

== Equivalence relations and mathematical logic ==
Equivalence relations are a ready source of examples or counterexamples. For example, an equivalence relation with exactly two infinite equivalence classes is an easy example of a theory which is ω-categorical, but not categorical for any larger cardinal number.

An implication of model theory is that the properties defining a relation can be proved independent of each other (and hence necessary parts of the definition) if and only if, for each property, examples can be found of relations not satisfying the given property while satisfying all the other properties. Hence the three defining properties of equivalence relations can be proved mutually independent by the following three examples:
* &quot;Reflexive and transitive&quot;: The relation ≤ on N. Or any preorder;
* &quot;Symmetric and transitive&quot;: The relation &quot;R&quot; on N, defined as &quot;aRb&quot; ↔ &quot;ab&quot; ≠ 0. Or any partial equivalence relation;
* &quot;Reflexive and symmetric&quot;: The relation &quot;R&quot; on Z, defined as &quot;aRb&quot; ↔ &quot;&quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot; is divisible by at least one of 2 or 3.&quot; Or any dependency relation.

Properties definable in first-order logic that an equivalence relation may or may not possess include:
* The number of equivalence classes is finite or infinite;
* The number of equivalence classes equals the (finite) natural number &quot;n&quot;;
* All equivalence classes have infinite cardinality;
* The number of elements in each equivalence class is the natural number &quot;n&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, when the elements of some set formula_1 have a notion of equivalence (formalized as an equivalence relation), then one may naturally split the set formula_1 into equivalence classes. These equivalence classes are constructed so that elements formula_3 and formula_4 belong to the same equivalence class if, and only if, they are equivalent.

Formally, given a set formula_1 and an equivalence relation formula_6 on formula_7 the of an element formula_3 in formula_1 is denoted formula_10 or, equivalently, formula_11 to emphasize its equivalence relation formula_12 The definition of equivalence relations implies that the equivalence classes form a partition of formula_13 meaning, that every element of the set belongs to exactly one equivalence class.
The set of the equivalence classes is sometimes called the quotient set or the quotient space of formula_1 by formula_15 and is denoted by formula_16

When the set formula_1 has some structure (such as a group operation or a topology) and the equivalence relation formula_6 is compatible with this structure, the quotient set often inherits a similar structure from its parent set. Examples include quotient spaces in linear algebra, quotient spaces in topology, quotient groups, homogeneous spaces, quotient rings, quotient monoids, and quotient categories.

==Definition and notation==

An equivalence relation on a set formula_19 is a binary relation formula_6 on formula_19 satisfying the three properties:
* formula_22 for all formula_23 (reflexivity),
* formula_24 implies formula_25 for all formula_26 (symmetry),
* if formula_24 and formula_28 then formula_29 for all formula_30 (transitivity).

The equivalence class of an element formula_3 is defined as
:formula_32
The word &quot;class&quot; in the term &quot;equivalence class&quot; may generally be considered as a synonym of &quot;set&quot;, although some equivalence classes are not sets but proper classes. For example, &quot;being isomorphic&quot; is an equivalence relation on groups, and the equivalence classes, called isomorphism classes, are not sets.

The set of all equivalence classes in formula_19 with respect to an equivalence relation formula_34 is denoted as formula_35 and is called formula_19 modulo formula_34 (or the &#x27; of formula_19 by formula_34). The surjective map formula_40 from formula_19 onto formula_35 which maps each element to its equivalence class, is called the &#x27;, or the canonical projection.

Every element of an equivalence class characterizes the class, and may be used to &quot;represent&quot; it. When such an element is chosen, it is called a representative of the class. The choice of a representative in each class defines an injection from formula_43 to . Since its composition with the canonical surjection is the identity of formula_35 such an injection is called a section, when using the terminology of category theory. 

Sometimes, there is a section that is more &quot;natural&quot; than the other ones. In this case, the representatives are called . For example, in modular arithmetic, for every integer greater than , the congruence modulo is an equivalence relation on the integers, for which two integers and are equivalent—in this case, one says &quot;congruent&quot;—if divides formula_45 this is denoted formula_46 Each class contains a unique non-negative integer smaller than formula_47 and these integers are the canonical representatives. 

The use of representatives for representing classes allows avoiding to consider explicitly classes as sets. In this case, the canonical surjection that maps an element to its class is replaced by the function that maps an element to the representative of its class. In the preceding example, this function is denoted formula_48 and produces the remainder of the Euclidean division of by .

==Properties==

Every element formula_49 of formula_19 is a member of the equivalence class formula_51 Every two equivalence classes formula_52 and formula_53 are either equal or disjoint. Therefore, the set of all equivalence classes of formula_19 forms a partition of formula_19: every element of formula_19 belongs to one and only one equivalence class. Conversely, every partition of formula_19 comes from an equivalence relation in this way, according to which formula_58 if and only if formula_49 and formula_60 belong to the same set of the partition.

It follows from the properties in the previous section that if formula_6 is an equivalence relation on a set formula_62 and formula_49 and formula_60 are two elements of formula_62 the following statements are equivalent:

* formula_58
* formula_67 
* formula_68

==Examples==
* Let formula_19 be the set of all rectangles in a plane, and formula_6 the equivalence relation &quot;has the same area as&quot;, then for each positive real number formula_71 there will be an equivalence class of all the rectangles that have area formula_72
* Consider the modulo 2 equivalence relation on the set of integers, formula_73 such that formula_58 if and only if their difference formula_75 is an even number. This relation gives rise to exactly two equivalence classes: one class consists of all even numbers, and the other class consists of all odd numbers. Using square brackets around one member of the class to denote an equivalence class under this relation, formula_76 and formula_77 all represent the same element of formula_78
* Let formula_19 be the set of ordered pairs of integers formula_80 with non-zero formula_81 and define an equivalence relation formula_6 on formula_19 such that formula_84 if and only if formula_85 then the equivalence class of the pair formula_80 can be identified with the rational number formula_87 and this equivalence relation and its equivalence classes can be used to give a formal definition of the set of rational numbers. The same construction can be generalized to the field of fractions of any integral domain.
* If formula_19 consists of all the lines in, say, the Euclidean plane, and formula_89 means that formula_90 and formula_91 are parallel lines, then the set of lines that are parallel to each other form an equivalence class, as long as a line is considered parallel to itself. In this situation, each equivalence class determines a point at infinity.

==Graphical representation==
An undirected graph may be associated to any symmetric relation on a set formula_62 where the vertices are the elements of formula_62 and two vertices formula_94 and formula_95 are joined if and only if formula_96 Among these graphs are the graphs of equivalence relations. These graphs, called cluster graphs, are characterized as the graphs such that the connected components are cliques.

==Invariants==

If formula_6 is an equivalence relation on formula_62 and formula_99 is a property of elements of formula_19 such that whenever formula_101 formula_99 is true if formula_103 is true, then the property formula_104 is said to be an invariant of formula_15 or well-defined under the relation formula_106

A frequent particular case occurs when formula_107 is a function from formula_19 to another set formula_109; if formula_110 whenever formula_111 then formula_107 is said to be formula_15 or simply formula_106 This occurs, for example, in the character theory of finite groups. Some authors use &quot;compatible with formula_6&quot; or just &quot;respects formula_6&quot; instead of &quot;invariant under formula_6&quot;.

Any function formula_118 is &quot;class invariant under&quot; formula_15 according to which formula_120 if and only if formula_121 The equivalence class of formula_49 is the set of all elements in formula_19 which get mapped to formula_124 that is, the class formula_52 is the inverse image of formula_126 This equivalence relation is known as the kernel of formula_127

More generally, a function may map equivalent arguments (under an equivalence relation formula_128 on formula_19) to equivalent values (under an equivalence relation formula_130 on formula_109). Such a function is a morphism of sets equipped with an equivalence relation.

==Quotient space in topology==

In topology, a quotient space is a topological space formed on the set of equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a topological space, using the original space&#x27;s topology to create the topology on the set of equivalence classes.

In abstract algebra, congruence relations on the underlying set of an algebra allow the algebra to induce an algebra on the equivalence classes of the relation, called a quotient algebra. In linear algebra, a quotient space is a vector space formed by taking a quotient group, where the quotient homomorphism is a linear map. By extension, in abstract algebra, the term quotient space may be used for quotient modules, quotient rings, quotient groups, or any quotient algebra. However, the use of the term for the more general cases can as often be by analogy with the orbits of a group action.

The orbits of a group action on a set may be called the quotient space of the action on the set, particularly when the orbits of the group action are the right cosets of a subgroup of a group, which arise from the action of the subgroup on the group by left translations, or respectively the left cosets as orbits under right translation.

A normal subgroup of a topological group, acting on the group by translation action, is a quotient space in the senses of topology, abstract algebra, and group actions simultaneously.

Although the term can be used for any equivalence relation&#x27;s set of equivalence classes, possibly with further structure, the intent of using the term is generally to compare that type of equivalence relation on a set formula_62 either to an equivalence relation that induces some structure on the set of equivalence classes from a structure of the same kind on formula_62 or to the orbits of a group action. Both the sense of a structure preserved by an equivalence relation, and the study of invariants under group actions, lead to the definition of invariants of equivalence relations given above.

<doc id="9262" wikidata="Q173799" url="?curid=9262" title="Entertainment">
<text>Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but it is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience&#x27;s attention.

Although people&#x27;s attention is held by different things because individuals have different preferences, most forms of entertainment are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, and developed into sophisticated forms over time, becoming available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products, to a banquet adapted for two, to any size or type of party with appropriate music and dance, to performances intended for thousands, and even for a global audience.

The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire, for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears to be entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.

An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of people watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant and audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performances, as in the case of theatre or concerts, or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children&#x27;s games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion, as with stage magic. Films and video games, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.

Some entertainment, such as public executions, is now illegal in most countries. Activities such as fencing or archery, once used in hunting or war, have become spectator sports. In the same way, other activities, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions, and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work or an act of cruelty by another.

The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over into different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

== Etymology ==

The Oxford English Dictionary gives Latin and French origins for the word &quot;entertain&quot;, including &quot;inter&quot; (among) + &quot;tenir&quot; (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of &quot;to hold mutually&quot; or &quot;to hold intertwined&quot; and &quot;to engage, keep occupied, the attention, thoughts, or time (of a person)&quot;. It also provides words like &quot;merry-making&quot;, &quot;pleasure&quot;, and &quot;delight&quot;, as well as &quot;to receive as a guest and show hospitality to&quot;. It cites a 1490 usage by William Caxton.

== Psychology and philosophy ==

Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as education and marketing even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. Sometimes entertainment can be a mixture for both. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as museology.

Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is &quot;the attainment of gratification&quot;. No other results or measurable benefits are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more &quot;entertaining&quot; and entertainment or marketing seek to be more &quot;educational&quot;. Such mixtures are often known by the neologisms &quot;edutainment&quot; or &quot;infotainment&quot;. The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields. Some education-entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two. Some people are entertained by others&#x27; pain or the idea of their unhappiness (schadenfreude).

An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience. Entertainment may skilfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: &quot;What does it mean to be human?&quot;; &quot;What is the right thing to do?&quot;; or &quot;How do I know what I know?&quot;. &quot;The meaning of life&quot;, for example, is the subject in a wide range of entertainment forms, including film, music and literature. Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include Shakespeare&#x27;s influential play &quot;Hamlet&quot;, whose hero articulates these concerns in poetry; and films, such as &quot;The Matrix&quot;, which explores the nature of knowledge and was released worldwide. Novels give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers. An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Originally a radio comedy, this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, audiobook, LP record, adventure game and online game, its ideas became popular references (see Phrases from The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy) and has been translated into many languages. Its themes encompass the meaning of life, as well as &quot;the ethics of entertainment, artificial intelligence, multiple worlds, God, and philosophical method&quot;.

== History ==


The &quot;ancient craft of communicating events and experiences, using words, images, sounds and gestures&quot; by telling a story is not only the means by which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while camping, or when listening to the stories of another culture as a tourist. &quot;The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels.&quot; Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed &quot;toward variety&quot;. Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and games are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as running and jumping) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that pole vaulting &quot;may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle.&quot; The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as ash, hickory or hazel; in the 19th century bamboo was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of carbon fibre. Other activities, such as walking on stilts, are still seen in circus performances in the 21st century. Gladiatorial combats, also known as &quot;gladiatorial games&quot;, popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.

Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for example, was introduced into the Roman Empire from Carthage and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals.

Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of social upheavals such as wars and revolutions. During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, for example, Revolutionary opera was sanctioned by the Communist party and World War I, the Great Depression and the Russian Revolution all affected entertainment.

Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to come and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a music hall, a cinema, a multiplex, or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a tablet computer. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a theatre, auditorium, or stadium. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the Colosseum, &quot;dedicated AD 80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators,&quot; and in it audiences &quot;enjoyed blood sport with the trappings of stage shows&quot;. Spectacles, competitions, races, and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.

=== Court entertainment ===
Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for professional entertainers, with different cultures using palaces, castles and forts in different ways. In the Maya city states, for example, &quot;spectacles often took place in large plazas in front of palaces; the crowds gathered either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a distance.&quot; Court entertainments also crossed cultures. For example, the durbar was introduced to India by the Mughals, and passed onto the British Empire, which then followed Indian tradition: &quot;institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies by which a Maharaja or Nawab were installed ... the exchange of official presents ... the order of precedence&quot;, for example, were &quot;all inherited from ... the Emperors of Delhi&quot;. In Korea, the &quot;court entertainment dance&quot; was &quot;originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets.&quot;

Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among commoners. This was the case with &quot;masked dance-dramas&quot; in Korea, which &quot;originated in conjunction with village shaman rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners&quot;. Nautch dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened during the Goryeo dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally &quot;solely religious or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion&quot;. Former courtly entertainments, such as jousting, often also survived in children&#x27;s games.

In some courts, such as those during the Byzantine Empire, the genders were segregated among the upper classes, so that &quot;at least before the period of the Komnenoi&quot; (1081–1185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets.

Court ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with power and those without, serving to &quot;dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler&quot;. This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the Hong Kong handover ceremony in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as &quot;for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries&quot;. Royal courts, such as the Korean one, also supported traditional dances. In Sudan, musical instruments such as the so-called &quot;slit&quot; or &quot;talking&quot; drums, once &quot;part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief&quot;, had multiple purposes: they were used to make music; &quot;speak&quot; at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance messages; and call men to hunt or war.

Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment. In the court at the Palace of Versailles, &quot;thousands of courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy&quot;.

Like court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the aristocracy and the people. For example, the splendid 1595 Accession Day celebrations of Queen Elizabeth I offered tournaments and jousting and other events performed &quot;not only before the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of Londoners eager for a good day&#x27;s entertainment. Entry for the day&#x27;s events at the Tiltyard in Whitehall was set at 12d&quot;.

=== Public punishment ===

Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time, some once-popular forms are no longer as acceptable. For example, during earlier centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many forms of public humiliation also offered local entertainment in the past. Even capital punishment such as hanging and beheading, offered to the public as a warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that lasted longer, such as stoning and drawing and quartering, afforded a greater public spectacle. &quot;A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable. Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room.&quot; Public punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time &quot;the awesome event of a public hanging aroused the[ir] loathing of writers and philosophers&quot;. Both Dickens and Thackeray wrote about a hanging in Newgate Prison in 1840, and &quot;taught an even wider public that executions are obscene entertainments&quot;.

== Children ==

Children&#x27;s entertainment is centred on play and is significant for their growth. It often mimics adult activities, such as watching performances (on television); prepares them for adult responsibilities, such as child rearing or social interaction (through dolls, pets and group games); or develops skills such as motor skills (such as a game of marbles), needed for sports and music. In the modern day, it often involves sedentary engagement with television or tablet computer.

Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults. A children&#x27;s entertainer or performer is a professional whose job it is to entertain children. The term can be used to describe a children&#x27;s musician or television presenter, but encompasses a wide range of specializations, including magicians, costumed performers, puppeteers and party princesses. Many activities that appeal to children such as puppets, clowns, pantomimes and cartoons are also enjoyed by adults.

Children have always played games. It is accepted that as well as being entertaining, playing games helps children&#x27;s development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children&#x27;s games is a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder called &quot;Children&#x27;s Games&quot;, painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as marbles, hide-and-seek, blowing soap bubbles and piggyback riding continue to be played.
Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children&#x27;s needs and interests. During the 20th century, starting with the often criticised but nonetheless important work of G. Stanley Hall, who &quot;promoted the link between the study of development and the &#x27;new&#x27; laboratory psychology&quot;, and especially with the work of Jean Piaget, who &quot;saw cognitive development as being analogous to biological development&quot;, it became understood that the psychological development of children occurs in stages and that their capacities differ from adults. Hence, stories and activities, whether in books, film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as television content rating systems, to guide the public and the entertainment industry.

In the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant change from earlier times. The amount of time expended by children indoors on screen-based entertainment and the &quot;remarkable collapse of children&#x27;s engagement with nature&quot; has drawn criticism for its negative effects on imagination, adult cognition and psychological well-being.
== Forms ==

=== Banquets ===
Banquets have been a venue for amusement, entertainment or pleasure since ancient times, continuing into the modern era. until the 21st century when they are still being used for many of their original purposesto impress visitors, especially important ones; to show hospitality; as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both. They were an integral part of court entertainments and helped entertainers develop their skills. They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations, weddings, birthdays civic or political achievements, military engagements or victories as well as religious obligations, one of the most famous being the Banqueting House, Whitehall in London. In modern times, banquets are available privately, or commercially in restaurants, sometimes combined with a dramatic performance in dinner theatres. Cooking by professional chefs has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the Bocuse d&#x27;Or.

=== Music ===

Music is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds of performance. For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is indispensable in dance and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.

Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own, constituting an entire performance such as when concerts are given. Depending on the rhythm, instrument, performance and style, music is divided into many genres, such as classical, jazz, folk, rock, pop music or traditional. Since the 20th century, performed music, once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry, which broadcasts it or pre-records it for sale.

The wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially amplified, all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from soloists, choral or orchestral groups, or ensemble. Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation. Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate. Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately.

The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the human voice or solely instrumental or some combination of the two. Whether the performance is given by vocalists or instrumentalists, the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual, passing by, small or large. Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably a cappella and overtone singing, are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing.

=== Games ===

Games are played for entertainmentsometimes purely for recreation, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.

Equipment varies with the game. Board games, such as Go, &quot;Monopoly&quot; or backgammon need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is Senet, a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the pharaoh Tutankhamun. Card games, such as whist, poker and Bridge have long been played as evening entertainment among friends. For these games, all that is needed is a deck of playing cards. Other games, such as bingo, played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via gambling. Many are geared for children, and can be played outdoors, including hopscotch, hide and seek, or Blind man&#x27;s bluff. The list of ball games is quite extensive. It includes, for example, croquet, lawn bowling and paintball as well as many sports using various forms of balls. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in motor skills. Number games such as Sudoku and puzzle games like the Rubik&#x27;s cube can develop mental prowess.

Video games are played using a controller to create results on a screen. They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely. In the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world. Video games are popular across the world.
=== Literature ===


Reading has been a source of entertainment for a very long time, especially when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of orality and oral traditions survive in the form of performance poetry for example. However, they have drastically declined. &quot;Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative.&quot; The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as fonts were standardised and texts became clearer, &quot;reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure&quot;. By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.

Among literature&#x27;s many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely for entertainment. Limericks, for example, use verse in a strict, predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers. Interactive books such as &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; can make literary entertainment more participatory.
Comics and editorial cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative. Many contemporary comics have elements of fantasy and are produced by companies that are part of the entertainment industry. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about superheroes such as Superman are of the first type. Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years of Charles M. Schulz who produced a popular comic called &quot;Peanuts&quot; about the relationships among a cast of child characters; and Michael Leunig who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate social criticism. The Japanese Manga style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. Caricature uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer&#x27;s face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.

=== Comedy ===
Comedy is both a genre of entertainment and a component of it, providing laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and games. In royal courts, such as in the Byzantine court, and presumably, also in its wealthy households, &quot;mimes were the focus of orchestrated humour, expected or obliged to make fun of all at court, not even excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family. This highly structured role of jester consisted of verbal humour, including teasing, jests, insult, ridicule, and obscenity and non-verbal humour such as slapstick and horseplay in the presence of an audience.&quot; In medieval times, all comic types the buffoon, jester, hunchback, dwarf, jokester, were all &quot;considered to be essentially of one comic type: the fool&quot;, who while not necessarily funny, represented &quot;the shortcomings of the individual&quot;.

Shakespeare wrote seventeen comedies that incorporate many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedysuch as jokes, puns, parody, wit, observational humour, or the unexpected effect of irony. One-liner jokes and satire are also used to comedic effect in literature. In farce, the comedy is a primary purpose.

The meaning of the word &quot;comedy&quot; and the audience&#x27;s expectations of it have changed over time and vary according to culture. Simple physical comedy such as slapstick is entertaining to a broad range of people of all ages. However, as cultures become more sophisticated, national nuances appear in the style and references so that what is amusing in one culture may be unintelligible in another.

=== Performance ===

Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented masques that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.
Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience&#x27;s attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.

==== Storytelling ====
Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms. It is &quot;not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions&quot;. Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on illuminated manuscripts and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones. Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, Chaucer used pilgrims in his literary work &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng&#x27;en in the 16th century in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.

The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous onesScheherazadea story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories. The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director Pasolini made a film adaptation; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang, in which the performance is accompanied by a gamelan orchestra or the similarly traditional Punch and Judy show.

Epic narratives, poems, sagas and allegories from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;; Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Iliad&quot;; the first Arabic novel &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot;; the Persian epic &quot;Shahnameh&quot;; the Sagas of Icelanders and the celebrated &quot;Tale of the Genji&quot;. Collections of stories, such as &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; or those by Hans Christian Andersen, have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.

Some of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called origin or creation myths such as the Dreamtime myths of the Aboriginal Australians, the Mesopotamian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world. These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.

==== Theatre ====
Theatre performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to Hellenistic times when &quot;leading musicians and actors&quot; performed widely at &quot;poetical competitions&quot;, for example at &quot;Delphi, Delos, Ephesus&quot;. Aristotle and his teacher Plato both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as &quot;What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite?&quot; The &quot;Ptolemys in Egypt, the Seleucids in Pergamum&quot; also had a strong theatrical tradition and later, wealthy patrons in Rome staged &quot;far more lavish productions&quot;.

Expectations about the performance and their engagement with it have changed over time. For example, in England during the 18th century, &quot;the prejudice against actresses had faded&quot; and in Europe generally, going to the theatre, once a socially dubious activity, became &quot;a more respectable middle-class pastime&quot; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the variety of popular entertainments increased. Operetta and music halls became available, and new drama theatres such as the Moscow Art Theatre and the Suvorin Theatre in Russia opened. At the same time, commercial newspapers &quot;began to carry theatre columns and reviews&quot; that helped make theatre &quot;a legitimate subject of intellectual debate&quot; in general discussions about art and culture. Audiences began to gather to &quot;appreciate creative achievement, to marvel at, and be entertained by, the prominent &#x27;stars&#x27;.&quot; Vaudeville and music halls, popular at this time in the United States, England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, were themselves eventually superseded.

Plays, musicals, monologues, pantomimes, and performance poetry are part of the very long history of theatre, which is also the venue for the type of performance known as comedy. In the 20th century, radio and television, often broadcast live, extended the theatrical tradition that continued to exist alongside the new forms.

The stage and the spaces set out in front of it for an audience create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, including the impromptu or improvised; the temporary; the elaborate; or the traditional and permanent. They are erected indoors or outdoors. The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as stagecraft. The audience&#x27;s experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.

==== Cinema and film ====
Films are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: documentary film, for example, aims to create a record or inform, although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: &quot;The Lumière brothers were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public.&quot; In 1908, Pathé launched and distributed newsreels and by World War I, films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. &quot;In the first decade of the [20th] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms.&quot; The Americans first &quot;contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images,&quot; but &quot;the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle&quot;. Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. Animation, for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences. The advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the 21st century made it &quot;possible to do spectacle&quot; more cheaply and &quot;on a scale never dreamed of&quot; by Cecil B. DeMille. From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the &quot;only mass entertainment&quot; but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced. Sophisticated visual effects and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and fantastic) but also to animate non-living items such as Lego normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form. Creators of &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; &quot;wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer.&quot; The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a home theatre, recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.

Films also re-imagine entertainment from other forms, turning stories, books and plays, for example, into new entertainments. &quot;The Story of Film&quot;, a documentary about the history of film, gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in the medium, as well as changes in the conception of film-making. It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the Hollywood tradition that combines &quot;realism and melodramatic romanticism&quot;, are intended as a form of escapism, others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award-winning Senegalese film &quot;Xala&quot; takes government corruption as its theme. Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s film &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. Stories that are thousands of years old, such as &quot;Noah&quot;, have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar literary devices such as allegory and personification with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as &quot;human folly&quot;, good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.

As in other media, excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards, including ones from the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the Cannes International Film Festival in France and the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.

==== Dance ====
The many forms of dance provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when it is used to express a culture&#x27;s history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines many forms of entertainment music, movement, storytelling, theatre it provides a good example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.

Dance is &quot;a form of cultural representation&quot; that involves not just dancers, but &quot;choreographers, audience members, patrons and impresarios ... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods.&quot; Whether from Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political, social, spiritual and artistic influence.&quot; Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example, in Africa, there are &quot;Dahomean dances, Hausa dances, Masai dances and so forth.&quot; Ballet is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of Louis XIV, the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers. Some dances, such as the quadrille, a square dance that &quot;emerged during the Napoleonic years in France&quot; and other country dances were once popular at social gatherings like balls, but are now rarely performed. On the other hand, many folk dances (such as Scottish Highland dancing and Irish dancing), have evolved into competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their entertainment value. &quot;Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation.&quot;

Since dance is often &quot;associated with the female body and women&#x27;s experiences&quot;, female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been regarded as distinct from &quot;decent&quot; women because they &quot;use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible&quot;. Society&#x27;s attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as &quot;the most shameful form of entertainment&quot;, other cultures have established venues such as strip clubs where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as striptease are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences.

Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing, sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes associated with it. Nationalism, authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing. For example, during the Nazi regime, American dances such as swing, regarded as &quot;completely un-German&quot;, had &quot;become a public offense and needed to be banned&quot;. Similarly, in Shanghai, China, in the 1930s, &quot;dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued Chinese society&quot; and officials wondered if &quot;other forms of entertainment such as brothels&quot; should also be banned. Banning had the effect of making &quot;the dance craze&quot; even greater. In Ireland, the Public Dance Hall Act of 1935 &quot;banned but did not stop dancing at the crossroads and other popular dance forms such as house and barn dances.&quot; In the US, various dances were once banned, either because like burlesque, they were suggestive, or because, like the Twist, they were associated with African Americans. &quot;African American dancers were typically banned from performing in minstrel shows until after the American Civil War.&quot;

Dances can be performed solo, in pairs, in groups, or by massed performers. They might be improvised or highly choreographed; spontaneous for personal entertainment (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, a paying audience, a world audience, or an audience interested in a particular dance genre. They might be a part of a celebration, such as a wedding or New Year, or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka. Some dances, such as traditional dance and ballet, need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the can-can, require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves.

==== Animals ====
Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia. They have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans, for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals. They watched as &quot;lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and cymbals; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and prance ... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards.&quot; There were &quot;violent confrontations with wild beasts&quot; and &quot;performances over time became more brutal and bloodier&quot;.

Animals that perform trained routines or &quot;acts&quot; for human entertainment include fleas in flea circuses, dolphins in dolphinaria, and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a street organ. Animals kept in zoos in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica.

Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports for example, horse racing is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on Melbourne Cup Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, camel racing requires human riders, while greyhound racing does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like cockroaches.

The use of animals for entertainment is sometimes controversial, especially the hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty involved. Among these are blood sports such as bear-baiting, dog fighting and cockfighting. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as &quot;a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship, and proponents, who view it as entertainment&quot; has been tested in a court of law. Fox hunting, which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and bullfighting, which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history. They both involve animals and are variously regarded as sport, entertainment or cultural tradition. Among the organisations set up to advocate for the rights of animals are some whose concerns include the use of animals for entertainment. However, &quot;in many cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse, both sides have cultural claims.&quot;

==== Circus ====

A circus, described as &quot;one of the most brazen of entertainment forms&quot;, is a special type of theatrical performance, involving a variety of physical skills such as acrobatics and juggling and sometimes performing animals. Usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a , circus was first performed in permanent venues. Philip Astley is regarded as the founder of the modern circus in the second half of the 18th century and Jules Léotard is the French performer credited with developing the art of the trapeze, considered synonymous with circuses. Astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional British fairs &quot;at least since the beginning of the 17th century&quot;: &quot;tumbling, rope-dancing, juggling, animal tricks and so on&quot;. It has been claimed that &quot;there is no direct link between the Roman circus and the circus of modern times. ... Between the demise of the Roman &#x27;circus&#x27; and the foundation of Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years later, the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a village green.&quot;

==== Magic ====

The form of entertainment known as stage magic or conjuring and recognisable as performance, is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (References to magic, for example, can be found in the Bible, in Hermeticism, in Zoroastrianism, in the Kabbalistic tradition, in mysticism and in the sources of Freemasonry.)

Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.

Fantasy magicians have held an important place in literature for centuries, offering entertainment to millions of readers. Famous wizards such as Merlin in the Arthurian legends have been written about since the 5th and 6th centuries, while in the 21st century, the young wizard Harry Potter became a global entertainment phenomenon when the book series about him sold about 450 million copies (as at June 2011), making it the best-selling book series in history.

==== Street performance ====
Street entertainment, street performance, or &quot;busking&quot; are forms of performance that have been meeting the public&#x27;s need for entertainment for centuries. It was &quot;an integral aspect of London&#x27;s life&quot;, for example, when the city in the early 19th century was &quot;filled with spectacle and diversion&quot;. Minstrels or troubadours are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.

There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form is the &quot;circle show&quot;. It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with street theatre, puppeteering, magicians, comedians, acrobats, jugglers and sometimes musicians. This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the &quot;walk-by act&quot;, has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, &quot;café busking&quot;, is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses public transport as a venue.

==== Parades ====

Parades are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in ) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.

One of the earliest forms of parade were &quot;triumphs&quot; grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor. &quot;In the summer of 46 BCE Julius Caesar chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month.&quot; In Europe from the Middle Ages to the Baroque the Royal Entry celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times.

Many religious festivals (especially those that incorporate processions, such as Holy Week processions or the Indian festival of Holi) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the Festa del Redentore in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, pilgrimages, such as the Roman Catholic pilgrimage of the Way of St. James, the Muslim Hajj and the Hindu Kumbh Mela, which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an individual&#x27;s spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which the Kumbh Mela, for example, &quot;is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption renders the presence of voyeurs deeply problematic.&quot;

Parades generally impress and delight often by including unusual, colourful costumes. Sometimes they also commemorate or celebrate. Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the context is military, when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play. Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away, it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.
==== Fireworks ====

Fireworks are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a &quot;crowning feature of elaborate celebrations&quot; in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for pyrotechnists, especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays. Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays &quot;inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might. Birthdays, name-days, weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration.&quot; One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the War of the Austrian Succession and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire, the accompanying Music for the Royal Fireworks written by Handel has been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian Dashavatara Kala of Gomantaka &quot;the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks&quot;.

The &quot;fire, sudden noise and smoke&quot; of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the millennium around the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the New Year as the time zones changed over to the next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world&#x27;s most famous buildings, including the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Acropolis in Athens, Red Square in Moscow, Vatican City in Rome, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and Elizabeth Tower in London.

=== Sport ===


Sporting competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, as well as in recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the FIFA World Cup and the Cricket World Cup, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.

Aside from sports that have worldwide appeal and competitions, such as the Olympic Games, the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country where people play it. For example, in the United States, baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is rugby union; in Iran, it is freestyle wrestling. Japan&#x27;s unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history. In some cases, such as the international running group Hash House Harriers, participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than the competitive.

The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of surfing is associated with Hawaii and that of snow skiing probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of ice hockeyan important entertainment in Canada.

=== Fairs, expositions, shopping ===

Fairs and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves. Whether in a medieval market or a small shop, &quot;shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday&quot;. However, in the modern world, &quot;merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs, thumping music ... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care .. cafés&quot;.

By the 19th century, &quot;expos&quot; that encouraged arts, manufactures and commerce had become international. They were not only hugely popular but affected international ideas. For example, the 1878 Paris Exposition facilitated international cooperation about ideas, innovations and standards. From London 1851 to Paris 1900, &quot;in excess of 200 million visitors had entered the turnstiles in London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around the world.&quot; Since World War II &quot;well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles&quot;. As a form of spectacle and entertainment, expositions influenced &quot;everything from architecture, to patterns of globalisation, to fundamental matters of human identity&quot; and in the process established the close relationship between &quot;fairs, the rise of department stores and art museums&quot;, the modern world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry.

== Safety ==
Some entertainments, such as at large festivals (whether religious or secular), concerts, clubs, parties and celebrations, involve big crowds. From earliest times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers, especially when combined with the recreational consumption of intoxicants such as alcohol. The Ancient Greeks had Dionysian Mysteries, for example, and the Romans had Saturnalia. The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of social norms of behaviour, sometimes causing injury or even death, such as for example, at the Altamont Free Concert, an outdoor rock festival. The list of serious incidents at nightclubs includes those caused by crowd crush; terrorism, such as the 2002 Bali bombings that targeted a nightclub; and especially fire. Investigations, such as that carried out in the US after The Station nightclub fire often demonstrate that lessons learned &quot;regarding fire safety in nightclubs&quot; from earlier events such as the Cocoanut Grove fire do &quot;not necessarily result in lasting effective change&quot;. Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers, such as the medieval Lord of Misrule or, in modern times, security officers who control access; and also ongoing improvement of relevant standards such as those for building safety. The tourism industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task.

== Industry ==
Entertainment is big business, especially in the United States, but ubiquitous in all cultures.
Although kings, rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century, especially in the area of mass media, meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.

The film industry is a part of the entertainment industry. Components of it include the Hollywood and Bollywood film industries, as well as the cinema of the United Kingdom and all the cinemas of Europe, including France, Germany, Spain, Italy and others. The sex industry is another component of the entertainment industry, applying the same forms and media (for example, film, books, dance and other performances) to the development, marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis.

Amusement parks entertain paying guests with rides, such as roller coasters, ridable miniature railways, water rides, and dark rides, as well as other events and associated attractions. The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named &quot;lands&quot;. Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme, such as the various SeaWorld parks that focus on the theme of sea life.

One of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.

Prestigious awards are given by the industry for excellence in the various types of entertainment. For example, there are awards for music, games (including video games), comics, theatre, television, film, dance and magical arts. Sporting awards are made for the results and skill, rather than for the entertainment value.

== Architecture ==

=== Architecture for entertainment ===
Purpose-built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings, among the most recognisable of which are theatre structures. For the ancient Greeks, &quot;the architectural importance of the theatre is a reflection of their importance to the community, made apparent in their monumentality, in the effort put into their design, and in the care put into their detail.&quot; The Romans subsequently developed the stadium in an oval form known as a circus. In modern times, some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers. The Sydney Opera House, for example, is a World Heritage Site and The O₂ in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor arena, a music club, a cinema and exhibition space. The Bayreuth Festspielhaus in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition.

Two of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue empty is important both for amenity and safety, because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue, which creates a safety risk. The Hillsborough disaster is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. Sightlines and acoustics are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.

In the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially stadia, are &quot;likely to figure among the leading architectural genres&quot;. However, they require &quot;a whole new approach&quot; to design, because they need to be &quot;sophisticated entertainment centres, multi-experience venues, capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways&quot;. Hence, architects now have to design &quot;with two distinct functions in mind, as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences, and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience&quot;.

=== Architecture as entertainment ===

Architects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really follies, deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.

On the other hand, sometimes architecture is entertainment, while pretending to be functional. The tourism industry, for example, creates or renovates buildings as &quot;attractions&quot; that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose. They are instead re-purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences. Buildings, history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase. Such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from the past so that &quot;the difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues/theme parks becomes hard to define&quot;. Examples include &quot;the preservation of the Alcázar of Toledo, with its grim Civil War History, the conversion of slave dungeons into tourist attractions in Ghana, [such as, for example, Cape Coast Castle] and the presentation of indigenous culture in Libya&quot;. The specially constructed buildings in amusement parks represent the park&#x27;s theme and are usually neither authentic nor completely functional.

== Effects of developments in electronic media ==

=== Globalisation ===
By the second half of the 20th century, developments in electronic media made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms stories, theatre, music, dance wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in data storage devices such as cassette tapes or compact discs, along with increasing miniaturisation. Computerisation and the development of barcodes also made ticketing easier, faster and global.

=== Obsolescence ===

In the 1940s, radio was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information. In the 1950s, it was television that was the new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world. By the 1970s, games could be played electronically, then hand-held devices provided mobile entertainment, and by the last decade of the 20th century, via networked play. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The &quot;proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption&quot; together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films. One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid obsolescence of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded. One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 per cent of households in the US would own a Wii console, &quot;about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953&quot;. Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced televisionwhich did not happen. The so-called &quot;digital revolution&quot; has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up. Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing &quot;...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available.&quot; Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as &quot;professional engagers&quot; shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.

=== Convergence ===
By the second decade of the 21st century, analogue recording was being replaced by digital recording and all forms of electronic entertainment began to converge. For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas &quot;success or failure used to be determined by the first weekend of its run. Today, ... a series of exhibition &#x27;windows&#x27;, such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits.&quot; Part of the industry&#x27;s adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well. It is also &quot;the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups&quot;. Globalisation and cultural imperialism are two of the cultural consequences of convergence. Others include fandom and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods. The &quot;greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet&quot; also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways for example, audiences can &quot;watch highlights, call up statistics&quot;, &quot;order tickets and merchandise&quot; and generally &quot;tap into the stadium&#x27;s resources at any time of the day or night&quot;.

The introduction of television altered the availability, cost, variety and quality of entertainment products for the public and the convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect. For example, the possibility and popularity of user-generated content, as distinct from commercial product, creates a &quot;networked audience model [that] makes programming obsolete&quot;. Individuals and corporations use video hosting services to broadcast content that is equally accepted by the public as legitimate entertainment.

While technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms that make up the content are in themselves, relatively stable. Storytelling, music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.

<text>In organic chemistry, ethers are a class of compounds that contain an ether group—a single oxygen atom bonded to two separate carbon atoms, each part of an organyl group (e.g., alkyl or aryl). They have the general formula , where R and R′ represent the organyl groups. Ethers can again be classified into two varieties: if the organyl groups are the same on both sides of the oxygen atom, then it is a simple or symmetrical ether, whereas if they are different, the ethers are called mixed or unsymmetrical ethers. A typical example of the first group is the solvent and anaesthetic diethyl ether, commonly referred to simply as &quot;ether&quot; (). Ethers are common in organic chemistry and even more prevalent in biochemistry, as they are common linkages in carbohydrates and lignin.

==Structure and bonding==
Ethers feature bent linkages. In dimethyl ether, the bond angle is 111° and C–O distances are 141 pm. The barrier to rotation about the C–O bonds is low. The bonding of oxygen in ethers, alcohols, and water is similar. In the language of valence bond theory, the hybridization at oxygen is sp3.

Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, thus the alpha hydrogens of ethers are more acidic than those of simple hydrocarbons. They are far less acidic than alpha hydrogens of carbonyl groups (such as in ketones or aldehydes), however.

Ethers can be symmetrical of the type ROR or unsymmetrical of the type ROR&#x27;. Examples of the former are dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, dipropyl ether etc. Illustrative unsymmetrical ethers are anisole (methoxybenzene) and dimethoxyethane.

===Vinyl- and acetylenic ethers===
Vinyl- and acetylenic ethers are far less common than alkyl or aryl ethers. Vinylethers, often called enol ethers, are important intermediates in organic synthesis. Acetylenic ethers are especially rare. Di-tert-butoxyacetylene is the most common example of this rare class of compounds.

==Nomenclature==
In the IUPAC Nomenclature system, ethers are named using the general formula &quot;alkoxyalkane&quot;, for example CH3–CH2–O–CH3 is methoxyethane. If the ether is part of a more-complex molecule, it is described as an alkoxy substituent, so –OCH3 would be considered a &quot;methoxy-&quot; group. The simpler alkyl radical is written in front, so CH3–O–CH2CH3 would be given as &quot;methoxy&quot;(CH3O)&quot;ethane&quot;(CH2CH3).

===Trivial name===
IUPAC rules are often not followed for simple ethers. The trivial names for simple ethers (i.e., those with none or few other functional groups) are a composite of the two substituents followed by &quot;ether&quot;. For example, ethyl methyl ether (CH3OC2H5), diphenylether (C6H5OC6H5). As for other organic compounds, very common ethers acquired names before rules for nomenclature were formalized. Diethyl ether is simply called ether, but was once called &quot;sweet oil of vitriol&quot;. Methyl phenyl ether is anisole, because it was originally found in aniseed. The aromatic ethers include furans. Acetals (α-alkoxy ethers R–CH(–OR)–O–R) are another class of ethers with characteristic properties.

===Polyethers===

Polyethers are generally polymers containing ether linkages in their main chain. The term polyol generally refers to polyether polyols with one or more functional end-groups such as a hydroxyl group. The term &quot;oxide&quot; or other terms are used for high molar mass polymer when end-groups no longer affect polymer properties.

Crown ethers are cyclic polyethers. Some toxins produced by dinoflagellates such as brevetoxin and ciguatoxin are extremely large and are known as &quot;cyclic&quot; or &quot;ladder&quot; polyethers.

The phenyl ether polymers are a class of aromatic polyethers containing aromatic cycles in their main chain: polyphenyl ether (PPE) and poly(&quot;p&quot;-phenylene oxide) (PPO).

===Related compounds===
Many classes of compounds with C–O–C linkages are not considered ethers: Esters (R–C(=O)–O–R′), hemiacetals (R–CH(–OH)–O–R′), carboxylic acid anhydrides (RC(=O)–O–C(=O)R′).

There are compounds which, instead of C in the linkage, contain heavier group 14 chemical elements (e.g., Si, Ge, Sn, Pb). Such compounds are considered ethers as well. Examples of such ethers are silyl enol ethers (containing the linkage), disiloxane (the other name of this compound is disilyl ether, containing the linkage) and stannoxanes (containing the linkage).

==Physical properties==
Ethers have boiling points similar to those of the analogous alkanes. Simple ethers are generally colorless.

==Reactions== 

The C-O bonds that comprise simple ethers are strong. They are unreactive toward all but the strongest bases. Although generally of low chemical reactivity, they are more reactive than alkanes.

Specialized ethers such as epoxides, ketals, and acetals are unrepresentative classes of ethers and are discussed in separate articles. Important reactions are listed below.

===Cleavage===

Although ethers resist hydrolysis, they are cleaved by hydrobromic acid and hydroiodic acid. Hydrogen chloride cleaves ethers only slowly. Methyl ethers typically afford methyl halides:
:ROCH3 + HBr → CH3Br + ROH
These reactions proceed via onium intermediates, i.e. [RO(H)CH3]+Br−.

Some ethers undergo rapid cleavage with boron tribromide (even aluminium chloride is used in some cases) to give the alkyl bromide. Depending on the substituents, some ethers can be cleaved with a variety of reagents, e.g. strong base.

Despite these difficulties the chemical paper pulping processes are based on cleavage of ether bonds in the lignin.

===Peroxide formation===
When stored in the presence of air or oxygen, ethers tend to form explosive peroxides, such as diethyl ether hydroperoxide. The reaction is accelerated by light, metal catalysts, and aldehydes. In addition to avoiding storage conditions likely to form peroxides, it is recommended, when an ether is used as a solvent, not to distill it to dryness, as any peroxides that may have formed, being less volatile than the original ether, will become concentrated in the last few drops of liquid. The presence of peroxide in old samples of ethers may be detected by shaking them with freshly prepared solution of a ferrous sulfate followed by addition of KSCN. Appearance of blood red color indicates presence of peroxides. The dangerous properties of ether peroxides are the reason that diethyl ether and other peroxide forming ethers like tetrahydrofuran (THF) or ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (1,2-dimethoxyethane) are avoided in industrial processes.

=== Lewis bases ===
Ethers serve as Lewis bases. For instance, diethyl ether forms a complex with boron trifluoride, i.e. borane diethyl etherate (). Ethers also coordinate to the Mg center in Grignard reagents. Tetrahydrofuran is more basic than acyclic ethers. It forms with many complexes.

===Alpha-halogenation===
This reactivity is similar to the tendency of ethers with alpha hydrogen atoms to form peroxides. Reaction with chlorine produces alpha-chloroethers.

==Synthesis==

===Dehydration of alcohols===
The dehydration of alcohols affords ethers:
: 2 R–OH → R–O–R + H2O at high temperature

This direct nucleophilic substitution reaction requires elevated temperatures (about 125 °C). The reaction is catalyzed by acids, usually sulfuric acid. The method is effective for generating symmetrical ethers, but not unsymmetrical ethers, since either OH can be protonated, which would give a mixture of products. Diethyl ether is produced from ethanol by this method. Cyclic ethers are readily generated by this approach. Elimination reactions compete with dehydration of the alcohol:
: R–CH2–CH2(OH) → R–CH=CH2 + H2O

The dehydration route often requires conditions incompatible with delicate molecules. Several milder methods exist to produce ethers.

===Electrophilic addition of alcohols to alkenes===
Alcohols add to electrophilically activated alkenes. The method is atom-economical:
: R2C=CR2 + R–OH → R2CH–C(–O–R)–R2
Acid catalysis is required for this reaction. Commercially important ethers prepared in this way are derived from isobutene or isoamylene, which protonate to give relatively stable carbocations. Using ethanol and methanol with these two alkenes, four fuel-grade ethers are produced: methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), methyl tert-amyl ether (TAME), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and ethyl tert-amyl ether (TAEE).

Solid acid catalysts are typically used to promote this reaction.

===Epoxides===

Epoxides are typically prepared by oxidation of alkenes. The most important epoxide in terms of industrial scale is ethylene oxide, which is produced by oxidation of ethylene with oxygen. Other epoxides are produced by one of two routes:
* By the oxidation of alkenes with a peroxyacid such as &quot;m&quot;-CPBA.
* By the base intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of a halohydrin.

Many ethers, ethoxylates and crown ethers, are produced from epoxides.

===Williamson and Ullmann ether syntheses===
Nucleophilic displacement of alkyl halides by alkoxides
: R–ONa + R′–X → R–O–R′ + NaX
This reaction, the Williamson ether synthesis, involves treatment of a parent alcohol with a strong base to form the alkoxide, followed by addition of an appropriate aliphatic compound bearing a suitable leaving group (R–X). Although popular in textbooks, the method is usually impractical on scale because it cogenerates significant waste.

Suitable leaving groups (X) include iodide, bromide, or sulfonates. This method usually does not work well for aryl halides (e.g. bromobenzene, see Ullmann condensation below). Likewise, this method only gives the best yields for primary halides. Secondary and tertiary halides are prone to undergo E2 elimination on exposure to the basic alkoxide anion used in the reaction due to steric hindrance from the large alkyl groups.

In a related reaction, alkyl halides undergo nucleophilic displacement by phenoxides. The R–X cannot be used to react with the alcohol. However phenols can be used to replace the alcohol while maintaining the alkyl halide. Since phenols are acidic, they readily react with a strong base like sodium hydroxide to form phenoxide ions. The phenoxide ion will then substitute the –X group in the alkyl halide, forming an ether with an aryl group attached to it in a reaction with an SN2 mechanism.

: C6H5OH + OH− → C6H5–O− + H2O
: C6H5–O− + R–X → C6H5OR

The Ullmann condensation is similar to the Williamson method except that the substrate is an aryl halide. Such reactions generally require a catalyst, such as copper.

<doc id="9264" wikidata="Q79852" url="?curid=9264" title="Ecliptic">
<text>The ecliptic or ecliptic plane is the orbital plane of Earth around the Sun. It was a central concept in a number of ancient sciences, providing the framework for key measurements in astronomy, astrology and calendar-making.

From the perspective of an observer on Earth, the Sun&#x27;s movement around the celestial sphere over the course of a year traces out a path along the ecliptic against the background of stars – specifically the Zodiac constellations. The planets of the solar system can also be seen along the ecliptic, because their orbital planes are very close to Earth&#x27;s. The moon&#x27;s orbital plane is also similar to Earth&#x27;s; the ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occur when the Moon is crossing it.

The ecliptic is an important reference plane and is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system. Ancient scientists were able to calculate Earth&#x27;s axial tilt by comparing the ecliptic plane to that of the equator.

==Sun&#x27;s apparent motion==
The ecliptic is the apparent path of the Sun throughout the course of a year.

Because Earth takes one year to orbit the Sun, the apparent position of the Sun takes one year to make a complete circuit of the ecliptic. With slightly more than 365 days in one year, the Sun moves a little less than 1° eastward every day. This small difference in the Sun&#x27;s position against the stars causes any particular spot on Earth&#x27;s surface to catch up with (and stand directly north or south of) the Sun about four minutes later each day than it would if Earth did not orbit; a day on Earth is therefore 24 hours long rather than the approximately 23-hour 56-minute sidereal day. Again, this is a simplification, based on a hypothetical Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so the speed with which the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.
Because of the movement of Earth around the Earth–Moon center of mass, the apparent path of the Sun wobbles slightly, with a period of about one month. Because of further perturbations by the other planets of the Solar System, the Earth–Moon barycenter wobbles slightly around a mean position in a complex fashion.

== Relationship to the celestial equator ==

Because Earth&#x27;s rotational axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but is inclined to it by an angle of about 23.4°, which is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the March equinox, also known as the &quot;first point of Aries&quot; and the &quot;ascending node of the ecliptic&quot; on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the September equinox or descending node.

The orientation of Earth&#x27;s axis and equator are not fixed in space, but rotate about the poles of the ecliptic with a period of about 26,000 years, a process known as &quot;lunisolar precession&quot;, as it is due mostly to the gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun on Earth&#x27;s equatorial bulge. Likewise, the ecliptic itself is not fixed. The gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the Solar System cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit, and hence of the ecliptic, known as &quot;planetary precession&quot;. The combined action of these two motions is called &quot;general precession&quot;, and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 arc seconds (about 0.014°) per year.

Once again, this is a simplification. Periodic motions of the Moon and apparent periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth&#x27;s axis, and hence the celestial equator, known as nutation.
This adds a periodic component to the position of the equinoxes; the positions of the celestial equator and (March) equinox with fully updated precession and nutation are called the &quot;true equator and equinox&quot;; the positions without nutation are the &quot;mean equator and equinox&quot;.

== Obliquity of the ecliptic ==
&quot;Obliquity of the ecliptic&quot; is the term used by astronomers for the inclination of Earth&#x27;s equator with respect to the ecliptic, or of Earth&#x27;s rotation axis to a perpendicular to the ecliptic. It is about 23.4° and is currently decreasing 0.013 degrees (47 arcseconds) per hundred years because of planetary perturbations.

The angular value of the obliquity is found by observation of the motions of Earth and other planets over many years. Astronomers produce new fundamental ephemerides as the accuracy of observation improves and as the understanding of the dynamics increases, and from these ephemerides various astronomical values, including the obliquity, are derived.

Until 1983 the obliquity for any date was calculated from work of Newcomb, who analyzed positions of the planets until about 1895:

where is the obliquity and is tropical centuries from B1900.0 to the date in question.

From 1984, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory&#x27;s DE series of computer-generated ephemerides took over as the fundamental ephemeris of the &quot;Astronomical Almanac&quot;. Obliquity based on DE200, which analyzed observations from 1911 to 1979, was calculated:

where hereafter is Julian centuries from J2000.0.

JPL&#x27;s fundamental ephemerides have been continually updated. The &quot;Astronomical Almanac&quot; for 2010 specifies:

These expressions for the obliquity are intended for high precision over a relatively short time span, perhaps several centuries. J. Laskar computed an expression to order good to /1000 years over 10,000 years.

All of these expressions are for the &quot;mean&quot; obliquity, that is, without the nutation of the equator included. The &quot;true&quot; or instantaneous obliquity includes the nutation.

==Plane of the Solar System==


Most of the major bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due to the way in which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current representation of the disk is known as the &quot;invariable plane of the Solar System&quot;. Earth&#x27;s orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, Jupiter&#x27;s orbit is within a little more than ½° of it, and the other major planets are all within about 6°. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky.

The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the vector sum of all of the orbital and rotational angular momenta of all the bodies of the system; more than 60% of the total comes from the orbit of Jupiter. That sum requires precise knowledge of every object in the system, making it a somewhat uncertain value. Because of the uncertainty regarding the exact location of the invariable plane, and because the ecliptic is well defined by the apparent motion of the Sun, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane of the Solar System both for precision and convenience. The only drawback of using the ecliptic instead of the invariable plane is that over geologic time scales, it will move against fixed reference points in the sky&#x27;s distant background.

==Celestial reference plane==


The ecliptic forms one of the two fundamental planes used as reference for positions on the celestial sphere, the other being the celestial equator. Perpendicular to the ecliptic are the ecliptic poles, the north ecliptic pole being the pole north of the equator. Of the two fundamental planes, the ecliptic is closer to unmoving against the background stars, its motion due to planetary precession being roughly 1/100 that of the celestial equator.

Spherical coordinates, known as ecliptic longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, are used to specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere with respect to the ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the March equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or −90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the &quot;x&quot;-axis is directed toward the March equinox, the &quot;y&quot;-axis 90° to the east, and the &quot;z&quot;-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.
Ecliptic coordinates are convenient for specifying positions of Solar System objects, as most of the planets&#x27; orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky. Because Earth&#x27;s orbit, and hence the ecliptic, moves very little, it is a relatively fixed reference with respect to the stars.

Because of the precessional motion of the equinox, the ecliptic coordinates of objects on the celestial sphere are continuously changing. Specifying a position in ecliptic coordinates requires specifying a particular equinox, that is, the equinox of a particular date, known as an epoch; the coordinates are referred to the direction of the equinox at that date. For instance, the &quot;Astronomical Almanac&quot; lists the heliocentric position of Mars at 0h Terrestrial Time, 4 January 2010 as: longitude 118°09′15.8″, latitude +1°43′16.7″, true heliocentric distance 1.6302454 AU, mean equinox and ecliptic of date. This specifies the mean equinox of 4 January 2010 0h TT as above, without the addition of nutation.

==Eclipses==

Because the orbit of the Moon is inclined only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon&#x27;s orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node at the same time it is at conjunction (new) or opposition (full). The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occur when the Moon is crossing it.

==Equinoxes and solstices==

The exact instants of equinoxes and solstices are the times when the apparent ecliptic longitude (including the effects of aberration and nutation) of the Sun is 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. Because of perturbations of Earth&#x27;s orbit and anomalies of the calendar, the dates of these are not fixed.

==In the constellations==

The ecliptic currently passes through the following thirteen constellations:
There are twelve constellations that are not on the ecliptic, but are close enough that the Moon and planets can occasionally appear in them.

*Cetus
*Pegasus
*Aquila
*Scutum
*Serpens
*Hydra
*Corvus
*Crater
*Sextans
*Canis Minor
*Auriga
*Orion

==Astrology==
The ecliptic forms the center of the zodiac, a celestial belt about 20° wide in latitude through which the Sun, Moon, and planets always appear to move.
Traditionally, this region is divided into 12 signs of 30° longitude, each of which approximates the Sun&#x27;s motion in one month. In ancient times, the signs corresponded roughly to 12 of the constellations that straddle the ecliptic.
These signs are sometimes still used in modern terminology. The &quot;First Point of Aries&quot; was named when the March equinox Sun was actually in the constellation Aries; it has since moved into Pisces because of precession of the equinoxes.

<text>A historical sovereign state is a state that once existed, but has since been dissolved due to conflict, war, rebellion, annexation, or uprising. This page lists sovereign states, countries, nations, or empires that ceased to exist as political entities sometime after 1453, grouped geographically and by constitutional nature.

==Criteria for inclusion==
The criteria for inclusion in this list are similar to that of the list of states with limited recognition. To be included here, a polity must have claimed statehood and either:
* had de facto control over a territory, a population, a government, a capacity to enter into relations with other states, or
* have been recognised as a state by at least one other state.

This is not a list for all variant governments of a state, nor is it a list of variations of countries&#x27; official long form name.
For purposes of this list, the cutoff between medieval and early modern states is the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

==Ancient and medieval states==
* List of Copper Age states
* List of Bronze Age states
* List of Iron Age states
* List of Classical Age states
* List of states during Late Antiquity
* List of states during the Middle Ages

<doc id="9277" wikidata="Q40112" url="?curid=9277" title="Ellipse">
<text>In mathematics, an ellipse is a plane curve surrounding two focal points, such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant. It generalizes a circle, which is the special type of ellipse in which the two focal points are the same. The elongation of an ellipse is measured by its eccentricity formula_1, a number ranging from formula_2 (the limiting case of a circle) to formula_3 (the limiting case of infinite elongation, no longer an ellipse but a parabola).

An ellipse has a simple algebraic solution for its area, but for its perimeter (also known as circumference), integration is required to obtain an exact solution.

Analytically, the equation of a standard ellipse centered at the origin with width formula_4 and height formula_5 is:
formula_6

Assuming formula_7, the foci are formula_8 where formula_9, called &quot;linear eccentricity&quot;, is the distance from the center to a focus. The standard parametric equation is:
formula_10

Ellipses are the closed type of conic section: a plane curve tracing the intersection of a cone with a plane (see figure). Ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections, parabolas and hyperbolas, both of which are open and unbounded. An angled cross section of a right circular cylinder is also an ellipse.

An ellipse may also be defined in terms of one focal point and a line outside the ellipse called the &quot;directrix&quot;: for all points on the ellipse, the ratio between the distance to the focus and the distance to the directrix is a constant, called the &quot;eccentricity&quot;:
formula_11

Ellipses are common in physics, astronomy and engineering. For example, the orbit of each planet in the Solar System is approximately an ellipse with the Sun at one focus point (more precisely, the focus is the barycenter of the Sunplanet pair). The same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems of two astronomical bodies. The shapes of planets and stars are often well described by ellipsoids. A circle viewed from a side angle looks like an ellipse: that is, the ellipse is the image of a circle under parallel or perspective projection. The ellipse is also the simplest Lissajous figure formed when the horizontal and vertical motions are sinusoids with the same frequency: a similar effect leads to elliptical polarization of light in optics.

The name, (, &quot;omission&quot;), was given by Apollonius of Perga in his &quot;Conics&quot;.

== Definition as locus of points ==
An ellipse can be defined geometrically as a set or locus of points in the Euclidean plane:
The midpoint formula_12 of the line segment joining the foci is called the &quot;center&quot; of the ellipse. The line through the foci is called the &quot;major axis&quot;, and the line perpendicular to it through the center is the &quot;minor axis&quot;. The major axis intersects the ellipse at two &quot;vertices&quot; formula_13, which have distance formula_14 to the center. The distance formula_15 of the foci to the center is called the &quot;focal distance&quot; or linear eccentricity. The quotient formula_16 is defined as the &quot;eccentricity&quot;.

The case formula_17 yields a circle and is included as a special type of ellipse.

The equation formula_18 can be viewed in a different way (see figure):
formula_19 is called the &quot;circular directrix&quot; (related to focus of the ellipse. This property should not be confused with the definition of an ellipse using a directrix line below.

Using Dandelin spheres, one can prove that any section of a cone with a plane is an ellipse, assuming the plane does not contain the apex and has slope less than that of the lines on the cone.

== In Cartesian coordinates ==
=== Standard equation ===
The standard form of an ellipse in Cartesian coordinates assumes that the origin is the center of the ellipse, the &quot;x&quot;-axis is the major axis, and:

For an arbitrary point formula_20 the distance to the focus formula_21 is formula_22 and to the other focus formula_23. Hence the point formula_24 is on the ellipse whenever:
formula_25

Removing the radicals by suitable squarings and using formula_26 (see diagram) produces the standard equation of the ellipse:
formula_27
or, solved for &quot;y&quot;:
formula_28

The width and height parameters formula_29 are called the semi-major and semi-minor axes. The top and bottom points formula_30 are the &quot;co-vertices&quot;. The distances from a point formula_24 on the ellipse to the left and right foci are formula_32 and formula_33.

It follows from the equation that the ellipse is &quot;symmetric&quot; with respect to the coordinate axes and hence with respect to the origin.

=== Parameters ===

==== Principal axes ====
Throughout this article, the semi-major and semi-minor axes are denoted formula_14 and formula_35, respectively, i.e. formula_36

In principle, the canonical ellipse equation formula_37 may have formula_38 (and hence the ellipse would be taller than it is wide). This form can be converted to the standard form by transposing the variable names formula_39 and formula_40 and the parameter names formula_14 and formula_42

==== Linear eccentricity ====
This is the distance from the center to a focus: formula_43.

==== Eccentricity ====

The eccentricity can be expressed as:
formula_44

assuming formula_45 An ellipse with equal axes (formula_46) has zero eccentricity, and is a circle.

==== Semi-latus rectum ====
The length of the chord through one focus, perpendicular to the major axis, is called the &quot;latus rectum&quot;. One half of it is the &quot;semi-latus rectum&quot; formula_47. A calculation shows:
formula_48

The semi-latus rectum formula_47 is equal to the radius of curvature at the vertices (see section curvature).

=== Tangent ===
An arbitrary line formula_50 intersects an ellipse at 0, 1, or 2 points, respectively called an &quot;exterior line&quot;, &quot;tangent&quot; and &quot;secant&quot;. Through any point of an ellipse there is a unique tangent. The tangent at a point formula_51 of the ellipse formula_52 has the coordinate equation:
formula_53

A vector parametric equation of the tangent is:
formula_54

Proof:
Let formula_51 be a point on an ellipse and formula_56 be the equation of any line formula_50 containing formula_51. Inserting the line&#x27;s equation into the ellipse equation and respecting formula_59 yields:
formula_60
There are then cases:
# formula_61 Then line formula_50 and the ellipse have only point formula_51 in common, and formula_50 is a tangent. The tangent direction has perpendicular vector formula_65, so the tangent line has equation formula_66 for some formula_67. Because formula_51 is on the tangent and the ellipse, one obtains formula_69.
# formula_70 Then line formula_50 has a second point in common with the ellipse, and is a secant.

Using (1) one finds that formula_72 is a tangent vector at point formula_51, which proves the vector equation.

If formula_74 and formula_75 are two points of the ellipse such that formula_76, then the points lie on two &quot;conjugate diameters&quot; (see below). (If formula_46, the ellipse is a circle and &quot;conjugate&quot; means &quot;orthogonal&quot;.)

=== Shifted ellipse ===
If the standard ellipse is shifted to have center formula_78, its equation is
formula_79

The axes are still parallel to the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-axes.

=== General ellipse ===

In analytic geometry, the ellipse is defined as a quadric: the set of points formula_24 of the Cartesian plane that, in non-degenerate cases, satisfy the implicit equation
formula_81
provided formula_82

To distinguish the degenerate cases from the non-degenerate case, let &quot;∆&quot; be the determinant
formula_83

Then the ellipse is a non-degenerate real ellipse if and only if &quot;C∆&quot; &lt; 0. If &quot;C∆&quot; &gt; 0, we have an imaginary ellipse, and if &quot;∆&quot; = 0, we have a point ellipse.

The general equation&#x27;s coefficients can be obtained from known semi-major axis formula_14, semi-minor axis formula_35, center coordinates formula_78, and rotation angle formula_87 (the angle from the positive horizontal axis to the ellipse&#x27;s major axis) using the formulae:
formula_88

These expressions can be derived from the canonical equation
formula_89
by a Euclidean transformation of the coordinates formula_90:
formula_91

Conversely, the canonical form parameters can be obtained from the general-form coefficients by the equations:

formula_92

where is the 2-argument arctangent function.

== Parametric representation ==

===Standard parametric representation===
Using trigonometric functions, a parametric representation of the standard ellipse formula_93 is:
formula_94

The parameter &quot;t&quot; (called the &quot;eccentric anomaly&quot; in astronomy) is not the angle of formula_95 with the &quot;x&quot;-axis, but has a geometric meaning due to Philippe de La Hire (see &quot;&quot; below).

===Rational representation===
With the substitution formula_96 and trigonometric formulae one obtains
formula_97

and the &quot;rational&quot; parametric equation of an ellipse
formula_98

which covers any point of the ellipse formula_52 except the left vertex formula_100.

For formula_101 this formula represents the right upper quarter of the ellipse moving counter-clockwise with increasing formula_102 The left vertex is the limit formula_103

Alternately, if the parameter formula_104 is considered to be a point on the real projective line formula_105, then the corresponding rational parametrization is
formula_106

Then formula_107

Rational representations of conic sections are commonly used in computer-aided design (see Bézier curve).

===Tangent slope as parameter===
A parametric representation, which uses the slope formula_108 of the tangent at a point of the ellipse
can be obtained from the derivative of the standard representation formula_109:
formula_110

With help of trigonometric formulae one obtains:
formula_111

Replacing formula_112 and formula_113 of the standard representation yields:
formula_114

Here formula_108 is the slope of the tangent at the corresponding ellipse point, formula_116 is the upper and formula_117 the lower half of the ellipse. The verticesformula_118, having vertical tangents, are not covered by the representation.

The equation of the tangent at point formula_119 has the form formula_120. The still unknown formula_121 can be determined by inserting the coordinates of the corresponding ellipse point formula_119:
formula_123

This description of the tangents of an ellipse is an essential tool for the determination of the orthoptic of an ellipse. The orthoptic article contains another proof, without differential calculus and trigonometric formulae.

===General ellipse===

Another definition of an ellipse uses affine transformations:
: Any &quot;ellipse&quot; is an affine image of the unit circle with equation formula_124.

;Parametric representation
An affine transformation of the Euclidean plane has the form formula_125, where formula_126 is a regular matrix (with non-zero determinant) and formula_127 is an arbitrary vector. If formula_128 are the column vectors of the matrix formula_126, the unit circle formula_130, formula_131, is mapped onto the ellipse:
formula_132

Here formula_127 is the center and formula_134 are the directions of two conjugate diameters, in general not perpendicular.

;Vertices
The four vertices of the ellipse are formula_135, for a parameter formula_136 defined by:
formula_137

(If formula_138, then formula_139.) This is derived as follows. The tangent vector at point formula_140 is:
formula_141

At a vertex parameter formula_136, the tangent is perpendicular to the major/minor axes, so:
formula_143

Expanding and applying the identities formula_144 gives the equation for formula_145

;Area
From Apollonios theorem (see below) one obtains:&lt;br&gt;
The area of an ellipse formula_146 is
formula_147

;Semiaxes
With the abbreviations
formula_148 the statements of Apollonios&#x27;s theorem can be written as:
formula_149
Solving this nonlinear system for formula_150 yields the semiaxes:
formula_151

;Implicit representation
Solving the parametric representation for formula_152 by Cramer&#x27;s rule and using formula_153, one obtains the implicit representation
formula_154

Conversely: If the equation
:formula_155 with formula_156 
of an ellipse centered at the origin is given, then the two vectors 
formula_157
point to two conjugate points and the tools developed above are applicable.

&quot;Example&quot;: For the ellipse with equation formula_158 the vectors are 
formula_159
;Rotated standard ellipse
For formula_160 one obtains a parametric representation of the standard ellipse rotated by angle formula_87:
formula_162

;Ellipse in space
The definition of an ellipse in this section gives a parametric representation of an arbitrary ellipse, even in space, if one allows formula_163 to be vectors in space.

== Polar forms ==
=== Polar form relative to center ===

In polar coordinates, with the origin at the center of the ellipse and with the angular coordinate formula_87 measured from the major axis, the ellipse&#x27;s equation is
formula_165
where formula_1 is the eccentricity (not Euler&#x27;s number).

=== Polar form relative to focus ===

If instead we use polar coordinates with the origin at one focus, with the angular coordinate formula_167 still measured from the major axis, the ellipse&#x27;s equation is
formula_168

where the sign in the denominator is negative if the reference direction formula_167 points towards the center (as illustrated on the right), and positive if that direction points away from the center.

The angle formula_87 is called the true anomaly of the point. The numerator formula_171 is the semi-latus rectum.

==Eccentricity and the directrix property==

Each of the two lines parallel to the minor axis, and at a distance of formula_172 from it, is called a &quot;directrix&quot; of the ellipse (see diagram).
: For an arbitrary point formula_173 of the ellipse, the quotient of the distance to one focus and to the corresponding directrix (see diagram) is equal to the eccentricity: formula_174

The proof for the pair formula_175 follows from the fact that formula_176 and formula_177 satisfy the equation
formula_178

The second case is proven analogously.

The converse is also true and can be used to define an ellipse (in a manner similar to the definition of a parabola):
: For any point formula_179 (focus), any line formula_180 (directrix) not through formula_179, and any real number formula_1 with formula_183 the ellipse is the locus of points for which the quotient of the distances to the point and to the line is formula_184 that is: formula_185

The extension to formula_2, which is the eccentricity of a circle, is not allowed in this context in the Euclidean plane. However, one may consider the directrix of a circle to be the line at infinity in the projective plane.

(The choice formula_3 yields a parabola, and if formula_188, a hyperbola.)
;Proof

Let formula_189, and assume formula_190 is a point on the curve. The directrix formula_180 has equation formula_192. With formula_193, the relation formula_194 produces the equations
:formula_195 and formula_196

The substitution formula_197 yields
formula_198

This is the equation of an &quot;ellipse&quot; (formula_199), or a &quot;parabola&quot; (formula_3), or a &quot;hyperbola&quot; (formula_188). All of these non-degenerate conics have, in common, the origin as a vertex (see diagram).

If formula_199, introduce new parameters formula_203 so that formula_204, and then the equation above becomes
formula_205

which is the equation of an ellipse with center formula_206, the &quot;x&quot;-axis as major axis, and
the major/minor semi axis formula_203.
;Construction of a directrix

Because of formula_208 point formula_209 of directrix formula_210 (see diagram) and focus formula_211 are inverse with respect to the circle inversion at circle formula_212 (in diagram green). Hence formula_209 can be constructed as shown in the diagram. Directrix formula_210 is the perpendicular to the main axis at point formula_209.

;General ellipse

If the focus is formula_216 and the directrix formula_217, one obtains the equation
formula_218

(The right side of the equation uses the Hesse normal form of a line to calculate the distance formula_219.)

== Focus-to-focus reflection property ==
An ellipse possesses the following property:
: The normal at a point formula_173 bisects the angle between the lines formula_221.

;Proof
Because the tangent line is perpendicular to the normal, an equivalent statement is that the tangent is the external angle bisector of the lines to the foci (see diagram).
Let formula_222 be the point on the line formula_223 with distance formula_4 to the focus formula_225, where formula_14 is the semi-major axis of the ellipse. Let line formula_227 be the external angle bisector of the lines formula_228 and formula_229 Take any other point formula_230 on formula_231 By the triangle inequality and the angle bisector theorem, formula_232formula_233formula_234 so formula_230 must be outside the ellipse. As this is true for every choice of formula_236 formula_227 only intersects the ellipse at the single point formula_173 so must be the tangent line.

; Application
The rays from one focus are reflected by the ellipse to the second focus. This property has optical and acoustic applications similar to the reflective property of a parabola (see whispering gallery).

Additionally, because of the focus-to-focus reflection property of ellipses, if the rays are allowed to continue propagating, reflected rays will eventually align closely with the major axis.

== Conjugate diameters ==
=== Definition of conjugate diameters ===

A circle has the following property:
: The midpoints of parallel chords lie on a diameter.

An affine transformation preserves parallelism and midpoints of line segments, so this property is true for any ellipse. (Note that the parallel chords and the diameter are no longer orthogonal.)

; Definition:
Two diameters formula_239 of an ellipse are &quot;conjugate&quot; if the midpoints of chords parallel to formula_240 lie on formula_241

From the diagram one finds:
: Two diameters formula_242 of an ellipse are conjugate whenever the tangents at formula_243 and formula_244 are parallel to formula_245.

Conjugate diameters in an ellipse generalize orthogonal diameters in a circle.

In the parametric equation for a general ellipse given above,
formula_246

any pair of points formula_247 belong to a diameter, and the pair formula_248 belong to its conjugate diameter.

For the common parametric representation formula_249 of the ellipse with equation formula_250 one gets: The points 
:formula_251 (signs: (+,+) or (−,−) )
:formula_252 (signs: (−,+) or (+,−) )
:are conjugate and 
:formula_253
In case of a circle the last equation collapses to formula_254

=== Theorem of Apollonios on conjugate diameters ===
For an ellipse with semi-axes formula_203 the following is true:

: Let formula_256 and formula_257 be halves of two conjugate diameters (see diagram) then
:# formula_258.
:# The &quot;triangle&quot; formula_259 with sides formula_260 (see diagram) has the constant area formula_261, which can be expressed by formula_262, too. formula_240 is the altitude of point formula_243 and formula_265 the angle between the half diameters. Hence the area of the ellipse (see section metric properties) can be written as formula_266.
:# The parallelogram of tangents adjacent to the given conjugate diameters has the formula_267

; Proof:
Let the ellipse be in the canonical form with parametric equation
formula_268

The two points formula_269 are on conjugate diameters (see previous section). From trigonometric formulae one obtains formula_270 and
formula_271

The area of the triangle generated by formula_272 is
formula_273

and from the diagram it can be seen that the area of the parallelogram is 8 times that of formula_274. Hence
formula_275

== Orthogonal tangents ==
For the ellipse formula_52 the intersection points of &quot;orthogonal&quot; tangents lie on the circle formula_277.

This circle is called &quot;orthoptic&quot; or director circle of the ellipse (not to be confused with the circular directrix defined above).

== Drawing ellipses ==

Ellipses appear in descriptive geometry as images (parallel or central projection) of circles. There exist various tools to draw an ellipse. Computers provide the fastest and most accurate method for drawing an ellipse. However, technical tools (&quot;ellipsographs&quot;) to draw an ellipse without a computer exist. The principle was known to the 5th century mathematician Proclus, and the tool now known as an elliptical trammel was invented by Leonardo da Vinci.

If there is no ellipsograph available, one can draw an ellipse using an approximation by the four osculating circles at the vertices.

For any method described below, knowledge of the axes and the semi-axes is necessary (or equivalently: the foci and the semi-major axis). If this presumption is not fulfilled one has to know at least two conjugate diameters. With help of Rytz&#x27;s construction the axes and semi-axes can be retrieved.

=== de La Hire&#x27;s point construction ===
The following construction of single points of an ellipse is due to de La Hire. It is based on the standard parametric representation formula_278 of an ellipse:
# Draw the two &quot;circles&quot; centered at the center of the ellipse with radii formula_150 and the axes of the ellipse.
# Draw a &quot;line through the center&quot;, which intersects the two circles at point formula_126 and formula_281, respectively.
# Draw a &quot;line&quot; through formula_126 that is parallel to the minor axis and a &quot;line&quot; through formula_281 that is parallel to the major axis. These lines meet at an ellipse point formula_173 (see diagram).
# Repeat steps (2) and (3) with different lines through the center.


===Pins-and-string method===
The characterization of an ellipse as the locus of points so that sum of the distances to the foci is constant leads to a method of drawing one using two drawing pins, a length of string, and a pencil. In this method, pins are pushed into the paper at two points, which become the ellipse&#x27;s foci. A string is tied at each end to the two pins; its length after tying is formula_4. The tip of the pencil then traces an ellipse if it is moved while keeping the string taut. Using two pegs and a rope, gardeners use this procedure to outline an elliptical flower bed—thus it is called the &quot;gardener&#x27;s ellipse&quot;. The Byzantine architect Anthemius of Tralles () described how this method could be used to construct an elliptical reflector, and it was elaborated in a now-lost 9th-century treatise by Al-Ḥasan ibn Mūsā.

A similar method for drawing confocal ellipses with a &quot;closed&quot; string is due to the Irish bishop Charles Graves.

=== Paper strip methods ===
The two following methods rely on the parametric representation (see &quot;&quot;, above):
formula_286

This representation can be modeled technically by two simple methods. In both cases center, the axes and semi axes formula_287 have to be known.

;Method 1
The first method starts with
: a strip of paper of length formula_288.

The point, where the semi axes meet is marked by formula_173. If the strip slides with both ends on the axes of the desired ellipse, then point formula_173 traces the ellipse. For the proof one shows that point formula_173 has the parametric representation formula_278, where parameter formula_293 is the angle of the slope of the paper strip.

A technical realization of the motion of the paper strip can be achieved by a Tusi couple (see animation). The device is able to draw any ellipse with a &quot;fixed&quot; sum formula_288, which is the radius of the large circle. This restriction may be a disadvantage in real life. More flexible is the second paper strip method.

A variation of the paper strip method 1 uses the observation that the midpoint formula_295 of the paper strip is moving on the circle with center formula_296 (of the ellipse) and radius formula_297. Hence, the paperstrip can be cut at point formula_295 into halves, connected again by a joint at formula_295 and the sliding end formula_300 fixed at the center formula_296 (see diagram). After this operation the movement of the unchanged half of the paperstrip is unchanged. This variation requires only one sliding shoe.

; Method 2:
The second method starts with
: a strip of paper of length formula_14.

One marks the point, which divides the strip into two substrips of length formula_35 and formula_304. The strip is positioned onto the axes as described in the diagram. Then the free end of the strip traces an ellipse, while the strip is moved. For the proof, one recognizes that the tracing point can be described parametrically by formula_278, where parameter formula_293 is the angle of slope of the paper strip.

This method is the base for several &quot;ellipsographs&quot; (see section below).

Similar to the variation of the paper strip method 1 a &quot;variation of the paper strip method 2&quot; can be established (see diagram) by cutting the part between the axes into halves.
Most ellipsograph drafting instruments are based on the second paperstrip method.

=== Approximation by osculating circles ===
From &quot;Metric properties&quot; below, one obtains:
* The radius of curvature at the vertices formula_307 is: formula_308
* The radius of curvature at the co-vertices formula_309 is: formula_310

The diagram shows an easy way to find the centers of curvature formula_311 at vertex formula_312 and co-vertex formula_313, respectively:
# mark the auxiliary point formula_314 and draw the line segment formula_315
# draw the line through formula_316, which is perpendicular to the line formula_315
# the intersection points of this line with the axes are the centers of the osculating circles.
(proof: simple calculation.)

The centers for the remaining vertices are found by symmetry.

With help of a French curve one draws a curve, which has smooth contact to the osculating circles.

=== Steiner generation ===
The following method to construct single points of an ellipse relies on the Steiner generation of a conic section:
: Given two pencils formula_318 of lines at two points formula_319 (all lines containing formula_320 and formula_321, respectively) and a projective but not perspective mapping formula_322 of formula_323 onto formula_324, then the intersection points of corresponding lines form a non-degenerate projective conic section.

For the generation of points of the ellipse formula_52 one uses the pencils at the vertices formula_307. Let formula_327 be an upper co-vertex of the ellipse and formula_328.

formula_173 is the center of the rectangle formula_330. The side formula_331 of the rectangle is divided into n equal spaced line segments and this division is projected parallel with the diagonal formula_332 as direction onto the line segment formula_333 and assign the division as shown in the diagram. The parallel projection together with the reverse of the orientation is part of the projective mapping between the pencils at formula_312 and formula_335 needed. The intersection points of any two related lines formula_336 and formula_337 are points of the uniquely defined ellipse. With help of the points formula_338 the points of the second quarter of the ellipse can be determined. Analogously one obtains the points of the lower half of the ellipse.

Steiner generation can also be defined for hyperbolas and parabolas. It is sometimes called a &quot;parallelogram method&quot; because one can use other points rather than the vertices, which starts with a parallelogram instead of a rectangle.

=== As hypotrochoid ===

The ellipse is a special case of the hypotrochoid when formula_339, as shown in the adjacent image. The special case of a moving circle with radius formula_340 inside a circle with radius formula_339 is called a Tusi couple.

== Inscribed angles and three-point form ==
=== Circles ===

A circle with equation formula_342 is uniquely determined by three points formula_343 not on a line. A simple way to determine the parameters formula_344 uses the &quot;inscribed angle theorem&quot; for circles:
: For four points formula_345 (see diagram) the following statement is true:
: The four points are on a circle if and only if the angles at formula_346 and formula_347 are equal.

Usually one measures inscribed angles by a degree or radian &quot;θ&quot;, but here the following measurement is more convenient:
: In order to measure the angle between two lines with equations formula_348 one uses the quotient: formula_349

====Inscribed angle theorem for circles====
For four points formula_345 no three of them on a line, we have the following (see diagram):

: The four points are on a circle, if and only if the angles at formula_346 and formula_347 are equal. In terms of the angle measurement above, this means: formula_353

At first the measure is available only for chords not parallel to the y-axis, but the final formula works for any chord.

====Three-point form of circle equation====

: As a consequence, one obtains an equation for the circle determined by three non-collinear points formula_354: formula_355

For example, for formula_356 the three-point equation is:
: formula_357, which can be rearranged to formula_358

Using vectors, dot products and determinants this formula can be arranged more clearly, letting formula_359:
formula_360

The center of the circle formula_78 satisfies:
formula_362

The radius is the distance between any of the three points and the center.
formula_363

=== Ellipses ===
This section considers the family of ellipses defined by equations formula_364 with a &quot;fixed&quot; eccentricity formula_1. It is convenient to use the parameter:
formula_366

and to write the ellipse equation as:
formula_367

where &quot;q&quot; is fixed and formula_368 vary over the real numbers. (Such ellipses have their axes parallel to the coordinate axes: if formula_369, the major axis is parallel to the &quot;x&quot;-axis; if formula_370, it is parallel to the &quot;y&quot;-axis.)
Like a circle, such an ellipse is determined by three points not on a line.

For this family of ellipses, one introduces the following q-analog angle measure, which is &quot;not&quot; a function of the usual angle measure &quot;θ&quot;:
: In order to measure an angle between two lines with equations formula_371 one uses the quotient: formula_372

====Inscribed angle theorem for ellipses====

: Given four points formula_373, no three of them on a line (see diagram).
: The four points are on an ellipse with equation formula_374 if and only if the angles at formula_346 and formula_347 are equal in the sense of the measurement above—that is, if formula_377

At first the measure is available only for chords which are not parallel to the y-axis. But the final formula works for any chord. The proof follows from a straightforward calculation. For the direction of proof given that the points are on an ellipse, one can assume that the center of the ellipse is the origin.

====Three-point form of ellipse equation====

: A consequence, one obtains an equation for the ellipse determined by three non-collinear points formula_354: formula_379

For example, for formula_380 and formula_381 one obtains the three-point form
: formula_382 and after conversion formula_383

Analogously to the circle case, the equation can be written more clearly using vectors:
formula_384

where formula_385 is the modified dot product formula_386

== Pole-polar relation ==

Any ellipse can be described in a suitable coordinate system by an equation formula_52. The equation of the tangent at a point formula_388 of the ellipse is formula_389 If one allows point formula_388 to be an arbitrary point different from the origin, then
: point formula_391 is mapped onto the line formula_392, not through the center of the ellipse.

This relation between points and lines is a bijection.

The inverse function maps
* line formula_393 onto the point formula_394 and
* line formula_395 onto the point formula_396

Such a relation between points and lines generated by a conic is called &quot;pole-polar relation&quot; or &quot;polarity&quot;. The pole is the point; the polar the line.

By calculation one can confirm the following properties of the pole-polar relation of the ellipse:
* For a point (pole) &quot;on&quot; the ellipse, the polar is the tangent at this point (see diagram: 
* For a pole formula_173 &quot;outside&quot; the ellipse, the intersection points of its polar with the ellipse are the tangency points of the two tangents passing formula_173 (see diagram: 
* For a point &quot;within&quot; the ellipse, the polar has no point with the ellipse in common (see diagram: 

# The intersection point of two polars is the pole of the line through their poles.
# The foci formula_399 and formula_400, respectively, and the directrices formula_401 and formula_402, respectively, belong to pairs of pole and polar. Because they are even polar pairs with respect to the circle formula_212, the directrices can be constructed by compass and straightedge (see Inversive geometry).

Pole-polar relations exist for hyperbolas and parabolas as well.

== Metric properties ==
All metric properties given below refer to an ellipse with equation

except for the section on the area enclosed by a tilted ellipse, where the generalized form of Eq.() will be given.

=== Area ===
The area formula_404 enclosed by an ellipse is:
where formula_14 and formula_35 are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. The area formula formula_407 is intuitive: start with a circle of radius formula_35 (so its area is formula_409) and stretch it by a factor formula_410 to make an ellipse. This scales the area by the same factor: formula_411 However, using the same approach for the circumference would be fallacious – compare the integrals formula_412 and formula_413. It is also easy to rigorously prove the area formula using integration as follows. Equation () can be rewritten as formula_414 For formula_415 this curve is the top half of the ellipse. So twice the integral of formula_416 over the interval formula_417 will be the area of the ellipse:
formula_418

The second integral is the area of a circle of radius formula_419 that is, formula_420 So
formula_421

An ellipse defined implicitly by formula_422 has area formula_423

The area can also be expressed in terms of eccentricity and the length of the semi-major axis as formula_424 (obtained by solving for flattening, then computing the semi-minor axis).

So far we have dealt with &quot;erect&quot; ellipses, whose major and minor axes are parallel to the formula_39 and formula_426 axes. However, some applications require &quot;tilted&quot; ellipses. In charged-particle beam optics, for instance, the enclosed area of an erect or tilted ellipse is an important property of the beam, its &quot;emittance&quot;. In this case a simple formula still applies, namely
where formula_427, formula_428 are intercepts and formula_429, formula_430 are maximum values. It follows directly from Apollonios&#x27;s theorem.

===Circumference===


The circumference formula_12 of an ellipse is:
formula_432

where again formula_14 is the length of the semi-major axis, formula_434 is the eccentricity, and the function formula_435 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind,
formula_436
which is in general not an elementary function.

The circumference of the ellipse may be evaluated in terms of formula_437 using Gauss&#x27;s arithmetic-geometric mean; this is a quadratically converging iterative method (see here for details).

The exact infinite series is:
formula_438
where formula_439 is the double factorial (extended to negative odd integers in the usual way, giving formula_440 and formula_441).

This series converges, but by expanding in terms of formula_442 James Ivory, Bessel and Kummer derived a series that converges much more rapidly. It is most concisely written in terms of the binomial coefficient with formula_443:
formula_444
The coefficients are slightly smaller (by a factor of formula_445), but also formula_446 is numerically much smaller than formula_1 except at formula_448 and formula_449. For eccentricities less than 0.5 the error is at the limits of double-precision floating-point after the formula_450 term.

Srinivasa Ramanujan gave two close approximations for the circumference in §16 of &quot;Modular Equations and Approximations to formula_322&quot;; they are
formula_452
and
formula_453
where formula_454 takes on the same meaning as above. The errors in these approximations, which were obtained empirically, are of order formula_455 and formula_456 respectively. This is because the second formula&#x27;s infinite series expansion matches Ivory&#x27;s formula up to the formula_450 term.

===Arc length===
More generally, the arc length of a portion of the circumference, as a function of the angle subtended (or of any two points on the upper half of the ellipse), is given by an incomplete elliptic integral. The upper half of an ellipse is parameterized by
formula_458

Then the arc length formula_459 from formula_460 to formula_461 is:
formula_462

This is equivalent to
formula_463

where formula_464 is the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind with parameter formula_465

Some lower and upper bounds on the circumference of the canonical ellipse formula_466 with formula_467 are
formula_468

Here the upper bound formula_469 is the circumference of a circumscribed concentric circle passing through the endpoints of the ellipse&#x27;s major axis, and the lower bound formula_470 is the perimeter of an inscribed rhombus with vertices at the endpoints of the major and the minor axes.

Given an ellipse whose axes are drawn, we can construct the endpoints of a particular elliptic arc whose length is one eighth of the ellipse&#x27;s circumference using only straightedge and compass in a finite number of steps; for some specific shapes of ellipses, such as when the axes have a length ratio of , it is additionally possible to construct the endpoints of a particular arc whose length is one twelfth of the circumference. (The vertices and co-vertices are already endpoints of arcs whose length is one half or one quarter of the ellipse&#x27;s circumference.) However, the general theory of straightedge-and-compass elliptic division appears to be unknown, unlike in the case of the circle and the lemniscate. The division in special cases has been investigated by Legendre in his classical treatise.

=== Curvature ===
The curvature is given by:

formula_471

and the radius of curvature, ρ = 1/κ, at point formula_20:
formula_473The radius of curvature of an ellipse, as a function of angle &quot;&quot; from the center, is:
formula_474where e is the eccentricity.

Radius of curvature at the two &quot;vertices&quot; formula_475 and the centers of curvature:
formula_476

Radius of curvature at the two &quot;co-vertices&quot; formula_477 and the centers of curvature:
formula_478The locus of all the centers of curvature is called an evolute. In the case of an ellipse, the evolute is an astroid.

== In triangle geometry ==
Ellipses appear in triangle geometry as
# Steiner ellipse: ellipse through the vertices of the triangle with center at the centroid,
# inellipses: ellipses which touch the sides of a triangle. Special cases are the Steiner inellipse and the Mandart inellipse.

== As plane sections of quadrics ==
Ellipses appear as plane sections of the following quadrics:
* Ellipsoid
* Elliptic cone
* Elliptic cylinder
* Hyperboloid of one sheet
* Hyperboloid of two sheets
== Applications ==
===Physics===
==== Elliptical reflectors and acoustics ====


If the water&#x27;s surface is disturbed at one focus of an elliptical water tank, the circular waves of that disturbance, after reflecting off the walls, converge simultaneously to a single point: the &quot;second focus&quot;. This is a consequence of the total travel length being the same along any wall-bouncing path between the two foci.

Similarly, if a light source is placed at one focus of an elliptic mirror, all light rays on the plane of the ellipse are reflected to the second focus. Since no other smooth curve has such a property, it can be used as an alternative definition of an ellipse. (In the special case of a circle with a source at its center all light would be reflected back to the center.) If the ellipse is rotated along its major axis to produce an ellipsoidal mirror (specifically, a prolate spheroid), this property holds for all rays out of the source. Alternatively, a cylindrical mirror with elliptical cross-section can be used to focus light from a linear fluorescent lamp along a line of the paper; such mirrors are used in some document scanners.

Sound waves are reflected in a similar way, so in a large elliptical room a person standing at one focus can hear a person standing at the other focus remarkably well. The effect is even more evident under a vaulted roof shaped as a section of a prolate spheroid. Such a room is called a &quot;whisper chamber&quot;. The same effect can be demonstrated with two reflectors shaped like the end caps of such a spheroid, placed facing each other at the proper distance. Examples are the National Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol (where John Quincy Adams is said to have used this property for eavesdropping on political matters); the Mormon Tabernacle at Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah; at an exhibit on sound at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago; in front of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign Foellinger Auditorium; and also at a side chamber of the Palace of Charles V, in the Alhambra.

==== Planetary orbits ====
In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun [approximately] at one focus, in his first law of planetary motion. Later, Isaac Newton explained this as a corollary of his law of universal gravitation.

More generally, in the gravitational two-body problem, if the two bodies are bound to each other (that is, the total energy is negative), their orbits are similar ellipses with the common barycenter being one of the foci of each ellipse. The other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance. The orbit of either body in the reference frame of the other is also an ellipse, with the other body at the same focus.

Keplerian elliptical orbits are the result of any radially directed attraction force whose strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Thus, in principle, the motion of two oppositely charged particles in empty space would also be an ellipse. (However, this conclusion ignores losses due to electromagnetic radiation and quantum effects, which become significant when the particles are moving at high speed.)

For elliptical orbits, useful relations involving the eccentricity formula_1 are:
formula_480

where
* formula_481 is the radius at apoapsis, i.e., the farthest distance of the orbit to the barycenter of the system, which is a focus of the ellipse
* formula_482 is the radius at periapsis, the closest distance
* formula_14 is the length of the semi-major axis

Also, in terms of formula_481 and formula_482, the semi-major axis formula_14 is their arithmetic mean, the semi-minor axis formula_35 is their geometric mean, and the semi-latus rectum formula_47 is their harmonic mean. In other words,
formula_489

==== Harmonic oscillators ====
The general solution for a harmonic oscillator in two or more dimensions is also an ellipse. Such is the case, for instance, of a long pendulum that is free to move in two dimensions; of a mass attached to a fixed point by a perfectly elastic spring; or of any object that moves under influence of an attractive force that is directly proportional to its distance from a fixed attractor. Unlike Keplerian orbits, however, these &quot;harmonic orbits&quot; have the center of attraction at the geometric center of the ellipse, and have fairly simple equations of motion.

==== Phase visualization ====
In electronics, the relative phase of two sinusoidal signals can be compared by feeding them to the vertical and horizontal inputs of an oscilloscope. If the Lissajous figure display is an ellipse, rather than a straight line, the two signals are out of phase.

==== Elliptical gears ====
Two non-circular gears with the same elliptical outline, each pivoting around one focus and positioned at the proper angle, turn smoothly while maintaining contact at all times. Alternatively, they can be connected by a link chain or timing belt, or in the case of a bicycle the main chainring may be elliptical, or an ovoid similar to an ellipse in form. Such elliptical gears may be used in mechanical equipment to produce variable angular speed or torque from a constant rotation of the driving axle, or in the case of a bicycle to allow a varying crank rotation speed with inversely varying mechanical advantage.

Elliptical bicycle gears make it easier for the chain to slide off the cog when changing gears.

An example gear application would be a device that winds thread onto a conical bobbin on a spinning machine. The bobbin would need to wind faster when the thread is near the apex than when it is near the base.

==== Optics ====
* In a material that is optically anisotropic (birefringent), the refractive index depends on the direction of the light. The dependency can be described by an index ellipsoid. (If the material is optically isotropic, this ellipsoid is a sphere.)
* In lamp-pumped solid-state lasers, elliptical cylinder-shaped reflectors have been used to direct light from the pump lamp (coaxial with one ellipse focal axis) to the active medium rod (coaxial with the second focal axis).
* In laser-plasma produced EUV light sources used in microchip lithography, EUV light is generated by plasma positioned in the primary focus of an ellipsoid mirror and is collected in the secondary focus at the input of the lithography machine.

===Statistics and finance===
In statistics, a bivariate random vector formula_490 is jointly elliptically distributed if its iso-density contours—loci of equal values of the density function—are ellipses. The concept extends to an arbitrary number of elements of the random vector, in which case in general the iso-density contours are ellipsoids. A special case is the multivariate normal distribution. The elliptical distributions are important in the financial field because if rates of return on assets are jointly elliptically distributed then all portfolios can be characterized completely by their mean and variance—that is, any two portfolios with identical mean and variance of portfolio return have identical distributions of portfolio return.

=== Computer graphics ===
Drawing an ellipse as a graphics primitive is common in standard display libraries, such as the MacIntosh QuickDraw API, and Direct2D on Windows. Jack Bresenham at IBM is most famous for the invention of 2D drawing primitives, including line and circle drawing, using only fast integer operations such as addition and branch on carry bit. M. L. V. Pitteway extended Bresenham&#x27;s algorithm for lines to conics in 1967. Another efficient generalization to draw ellipses was invented in 1984 by Jerry Van Aken.

In 1970 Danny Cohen presented at the &quot;Computer Graphics 1970&quot; conference in England a linear algorithm for drawing ellipses and circles. In 1971, L. B. Smith published similar algorithms for all conic sections and proved them to have good properties. These algorithms need only a few multiplications and additions to calculate each vector.

It is beneficial to use a parametric formulation in computer graphics because the density of points is greatest where there is the most curvature. Thus, the change in slope between each successive point is small, reducing the apparent &quot;jaggedness&quot; of the approximation.

;Drawing with Bézier paths:
Composite Bézier curves may also be used to draw an ellipse to sufficient accuracy, since any ellipse may be construed as an affine transformation of a circle. The spline methods used to draw a circle may be used to draw an ellipse, since the constituent Bézier curves behave appropriately under such transformations.

=== Optimization theory ===
It is sometimes useful to find the minimum bounding ellipse on a set of points. The ellipsoid method is quite useful for solving this problem.

<doc id="9279" wikidata="Q7378" url="?curid=9279" title="Elephant">
<text>Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;), the African forest elephant (&quot;L. cyclotis&quot;), and the Asian elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;). They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a fission–fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The leader of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as the matriarch.

Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness, and possibly show concern for dying and dead individuals of their kind.

African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered and African forest elephants as critically endangered on the IUCN Red Lists. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or employed for entertainment in circuses. Elephants have an iconic status in human culture and have been widely featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;elephant&quot; is derived from the Latin word (genitive ) , which is the Latinised form of the ancient Greek () (genitive (,)) probably from a non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician. It is attested in Mycenaean Greek as (genitive ) in Linear B syllabic script. As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek word to mean ivory, but after the time of Herodotus, it also referred to the animal. The word &quot;elephant&quot; appears in Middle English as in and was borrowed from Old French in the 12th century.

==Taxonomy==

Elephants belong to the family Elephantidae, the sole remaining family within the order Proboscidea. Their closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they share the clade Paenungulata within the superorder Afrotheria. Elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade Tethytheria.

Three species of living elephants are recognised; the African bush elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;), forest elephant (&quot;Loxodonta cyclotis&quot;), and Asian elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;). African elephants were traditionally considered a single species, &quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;, but molecular studies have affirmed their status as separate species. Mammoths (&quot;Mammuthus&quot;) are nested within living elephants as they are more closely related to Asian elephants than to African elephants. Another extinct genus of elephant, &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;, is also recognised, which appears to have close affinities with African elephants and to have hybridised with African forest elephants. Some species of the extinct &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; were even larger, all exceeding 4 metres in height and 10 tonnes in body mass, with &quot;P. namadicus&quot; being a contender for the largest land mammal to have ever existed.

===Evolution===
The earliest members of Proboscidea like &quot;Eritherium&quot; are known from the Paleocene of Africa, around 60 million years ago, the earliest proboscideans were much smaller than living elephants, with &quot;Eritherium&quot; having a body mass of around . By the late Eocene, some members of Proboscidea like &quot;Barytherium&quot; had reached considerable size, with an estimated mass of around 2 tonnes, while others like &quot;Moeritherium&quot; are suggested to have been semi-aquatic.
A major event in proboscidean evolution was the collision of Afro-Arabia with Eurasia, during the Early Miocene, around 18–19 million years ago, allowing proboscideans to disperse from their African homeland across Eurasia and later, around 16–15 million years ago into North America across the Bering Land Bridge. Proboscidean groups prominent during the Miocene include the deinotheres, along with the more advanced elephantimorphs, including mammutids (mastodons), gomphotheres, amebelodontids (which includes the &quot;shovel tuskers&quot; like &quot;Platybelodon&quot;), choerolophodontids and stegodontids. Around 10 million years ago, the earliest members of the family Elephantidae emerged in Africa, having originated from gomphotheres.

Elephantids are distinguished from earlier proboscideans by a major shift in the molar morphology to parallel lophs rather than the cusps of earlier proboscideans, allowing them to become higher-crowned (hypsodont) and more efficient in consuming grass. The Late Miocene saw major climactic changes, which resulted in the decline and extinction of many proboscidean groups. The earliest members of the modern genera of elephants (&quot;Elephas&quot;, &quot;Loxodonta&quot;) as well as mammoths, appeared in Africa during the latest Miocene–early Pliocene around 7-4 million years ago. The elephantid genera &quot;Elephas&quot; (which includes the living Asian elephant) and &quot;Mammuthus&quot; (mammoths) migrated out of Africa during the late Pliocene, around 3.6 to 3.2 million years ago.

Over the course of the Early Pleistocene, all non-elephantid probobscidean genera outside of the Americas became extinct with the exception of &quot;Stegodon&quot;, with gomphotheres dispersing into South America as part of the Great American interchange, and mammoths migrating into North America around 1.5 million years ago. At the end of the Early Pleistocene, around 800,000 years ago the elephantid genus &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; dispersed outside of Africa, becoming widely distributed in Eurasia. Proboscideans were represented by around 23 species at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene. Proboscideans underwent a dramatic decline during the Late Pleistocene as part of the Late Pleistocene extinctions of most large mammals globally, with all remaining non-elephantid proboscideans (including &quot;Stegodon&quot;, mastodons, and the American gomphotheres &quot;Cuvieronius&quot; and &quot;Notiomastodon&quot;) and &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; becoming extinct, with mammoths only surviving in relict populations on islands around the Bering Strait into the Holocene, with their latest survival being on Wrangel Island, where they persisted until around 4,000 years ago.

Over the course of their evolution, probobscideans grew in size. With that came longer limbs and wider feet with a more digitigrade stance, along with a larger head and shorter neck. The trunk evolved and grew longer to provide reach. The number of premolars, incisors, and canines decreased, and the cheek teeth (molars and premolars) became longer and more specialised. The incisors developed into tusks of different shapes and sizes. Several species of proboscideans became isolated on islands and experienced insular dwarfism, some dramatically reducing in body size, such as the tall dwarf elephant species &quot;Palaeoloxodon falconeri&quot;.

===Living species===
==Anatomy==

Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. The skeleton is made up of 326–351 bones. The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone&#x27;s flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. By contrast, the lower jaw is dense. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The skull is built to withstand great stress, particularly when fighting or using the tusks. The brain is surrounded by arches in the skull, which serve as protection. Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support.
Elephants are homeotherms and maintain their average body temperature at ~ 36 °C (97 °F), with a minimum of 35.2 °C (95.4 °F) during the cool season, and a maximum of 38.0 °C (100.4 °F) during the hot dry season.

===Ears and eyes===

Elephant ear flaps, or pinnae, are thick in the middle with a thinner tip and supported by a thicker base. They contain numerous blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood flows into the capillaries, releasing excess heat into the environment. This effect is increased by flapping the ears back and forth. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates and have the largest ear flaps. The ossicles are adapted for hearing low frequencies, being most sensitive at 1 kHz.

Lacking a lacrimal apparatus (tear duct), the eye relies on the harderian gland in the orbit to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane shields the globe. The animal&#x27;s field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light.

===Trunk===
The elongated and prehensile trunk, or proboscis, consists of both the nose and upper lip, which fuse in early fetal development. This versatile appendage contains up to 150,000 separate muscle fascicles, with no bone and little fat. These paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. The former are divided into dorsal, ventral, and lateral muscles, while the latter are divided into transverse and muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull. The nasal septum consists of small elastic muscles between the nostrils, which are divided by cartilage at the base. A unique proboscis nerve – a combination of the maxillary and facial nerves – lines each side of the appendage.

As a muscular hydrostat, the trunk moves through finely controlled muscle contractions, working both with and against each other. Using three basic movements: bending, twisting, and longitudinal stretching or retracting, the trunk has near unlimited flexibility. Objects grasped by the end of the trunk can be moved to the mouth by curving the appendage inward. The trunk can also bend at different points by creating stiffened &quot;pseudo-joints&quot;. The tip can be moved in a way similar to the human hand. The skin is more elastic on the dorsal side of the elephant trunk than underneath; allowing the animal to stretch and coil while maintaining a strong grasp. The flexibility of the trunk is aided by the numerous wrinkles in the skin. The African elephants have two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk that allow them to pluck small food. The Asian elephant has only one and relies more on wrapping around a food item. Asian elephant trunks have better motor coordination.

The trunk&#x27;s extreme flexibility allows it to forage and wrestle other elephants with it. It is powerful enough to lift up to , but it also has the precision to crack a peanut shell without breaking the seed. With its trunk, an elephant can reach items up to high and dig for water in the mud or sand below. It also uses it to clean itself. Individuals may show lateral preference when grasping with their trunks: some prefer to twist them to the left, others to the right. Elephant trunks are capable of powerful siphoning. They can expand their nostrils by 30%, leading to a 64% greater nasal volume, and can breathe in almost 30 times faster than a human sneeze, at over . They suck up water, which is squirted into the mouth or over the body. The trunk of an adult Asian elephant is capable of retaining of water. They will also sprinkle dust or grass on themselves. When underwater, the elephant uses its trunk as a snorkel.

The trunk also acts as a sense organ. Its sense of smell may be four times greater than a bloodhound&#x27;s nose. The infraorbital nerve, which makes the trunk sensitive to touch, is thicker than both the optic and auditory nerves. Whiskers grow all along the trunk, and are particularly packed at the tip, where they contribute to its tactile sensitivity. Unlike those of many mammals, such as cats and rats, elephant whiskers do not move independently (&quot;whisk&quot;) to sense the environment; the trunk itself must move to bring the whiskers into contact with nearby objects. Whiskers grow in rows along each side on the ventral surface of the trunk, which is thought to be essential in helping elephants balance objects there, whereas they are more evenly arranged on the dorsal surface. The number and patterns of whiskers are distinctly different between species.

Damaging the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant&#x27;s survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One trunkless elephant has been observed to graze using its lips with its hind legs in the air and balancing on its front knees. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis recorded in African bush elephants and involves the degeneration of the peripheral nerves and muscles. The disorder has been linked to lead poisoning.

===Teeth===

Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the incisors, known as the tusks; 12 deciduous premolars; and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically. Instead, new teeth start at the back of the mouth and push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. This is followed by four more tooth replacements at the ages of four to six, 9–15, 18–28, and finally in their early 40s. The final (usually sixth) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are more diamond-shaped in African elephants.

====Tusks====
The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous milk teeth at 6–12 months of age and keep growing at about a year. As the tusk develops, it is topped with smooth, cone-shaped enamel that eventually wanes. The dentine is known as ivory and has a cross-section of intersecting lines, known as &quot;engine turning&quot;, which create diamond-shaped patterns. Being living tissue, tusks are fairly soft and about as dense as the mineral calcite. The tusk protrudes from a socket in the skull, and most of it is external. At least one-third of the tusk contains the pulp, and some have nerves that stretch even further. Thus, it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When removed, ivory will dry up and crack if not kept cool and wet. Tusks function in digging, debarking, marking, moving objects, and fighting.

Elephants are usually right- or left-tusked, similar to humans, who are typically right- or left-handed. The dominant, or &quot;master&quot; tusk, is typically more worn down, as it is shorter and blunter. For African elephants, tusks are present in both males and females and are around the same length in both sexes, reaching up to , but those of males tend to be more massive. In the Asian species, only the males have large tusks. Female Asians have very small tusks, or none at all. Tuskless males exist and are particularly common among Sri Lankan elephants. Asian males can have tusks as long as Africans&#x27;, but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the largest recorded was long and weighed . Hunting for elephant ivory in Africa and Asia has resulted in an effective selection pressure for shorter tusks and tusklessness.

=== Skin ===

An elephant&#x27;s skin is generally very tough, at thick on the back and parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, anus, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants are typically grey, but African elephants look brown or reddish after rolling in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the head. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, with the head and back being particularly hairy. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the tip of the tail and parts of the head and genitals. Normally, the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart. Their hair is thought to help them lose heat in their hot environments.

Although tough, an elephant&#x27;s skin is very sensitive and requires mud baths to maintain moisture and protection from burning and insect bites. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body, which dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs to expose their soles to the air. Elephants only have sweat glands between the toes, but the skin allows water to disperse and evaporate, cooling the animal. In addition, cracks in the skin may reduce dehydration and allow for increased thermal regulation in the long term.

=== Legs, locomotion, and posture ===

To support the animal&#x27;s weight, an elephant&#x27;s limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have cancellous bones in place of medullary cavities. This strengthens the bones while still allowing haematopoiesis (blood cell creation). Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant&#x27;s weight, although 60% is borne by the front. The position of the limbs and leg bones allows an elephant to stand still for extended periods of time without tiring. Elephants are incapable of turning their manus as the ulna and radius of the front legs are secured in pronation. Elephants may also lack the pronator quadratus and pronator teres muscles or have very small ones. The circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues, or &quot;cushion pads&quot; beneath the manus or pes, which allow them to bear the animal&#x27;s great mass. They appear to have a sesamoid, an extra &quot;toe&quot; similar in placement to a giant panda&#x27;s extra &quot;thumb&quot;, that also helps in weight distribution. As many as five toenails can be found on both the front and hind feet.

Elephants can move both forward and backward, but are incapable of trotting, jumping, or galloping. They can move on land only by walking or ambling: a faster gait similar to running. In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders moving up and down while the foot is planted on the ground. The fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, since there is no point where all the feet are off the ground, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, and can move faster by quickening its stride. Fast-moving elephants appear to &#x27;run&#x27; with their front legs, but &#x27;walk&#x27; with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of . At this speed, most other quadrupeds are well into a gallop, even accounting for leg length. Spring-like kinetics could explain the difference between the motion of elephants and other animals. The cushion pads expand and contract, and reduce both the pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving. Elephants are capable swimmers: they can swim for up to six hours while completely waterborne, moving at and traversing up to continuously.

=== Internal systems ===
The brain of an elephant weighs compared to for a human brain. It is the largest of all terrestrial mammals. While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally smaller than the human brain. At birth, an elephant&#x27;s brain already weighs 30–40% of its adult weight. The cerebrum and cerebellum are well developed, and the temporal lobes are so large that they bulge out laterally. Their temporal lobes are proportionally larger than those of other animals, including humans. The throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use. The larynx of the elephant is the largest known among mammals. The vocal folds are anchored close to the epiglottis base. When comparing an elephant&#x27;s vocal folds to those of a human, an elephant&#x27;s are proportionally longer, thicker, with a greater cross-sectional area. In addition, they are located further up the vocal tract with an acute slope.

The heart of an elephant weighs . Its apex has two pointed ends, an unusual trait among mammals. In addition, the ventricles of the heart split towards the top, a trait also found in sirenians. When upright, the elephant&#x27;s heart beats around 28 beats per minute and actually speeds up to 35 beats when it lies down. The blood vessels are thick and wide and can hold up under high blood pressure. The lungs are attached to the diaphragm, and breathing relies less on the expanding of the ribcage. Connective tissue exists in place of the pleural cavity. This may allow the animal to deal with the pressure differences when its body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air. Elephants breathe mostly with the trunk but also with the mouth. They have a hindgut fermentation system, and their large and small intestines together reach in length. Less than half of an elephant&#x27;s food intake gets digested, despite the process lasting a day. An elephant&#x27;s bladder can store up to 18 litres of urine and its kidneys can produce more than 50 litres of urine per day.

===Sex characteristics===
A male elephant&#x27;s testes, like other Afrotheria, are internally located near the kidneys. The penis can be as long as with a wide base. It curves to an &#x27;S&#x27; when fully erect and has an orifice shaped like a Y. The female&#x27;s clitoris may be . The vulva is found lower than in other herbivores, between the hind legs instead of under the tail. Determining pregnancy status can be difficult due to the animal&#x27;s large belly. The female&#x27;s mammary glands occupy the space between the front legs, which puts the suckling calf within reach of the female&#x27;s trunk. Elephants have a unique organ, the temporal gland, located on both sides of the head. This organ is associated with sexual behaviour, and males secrete a fluid from it when in musth. Females have also been observed with these secretions.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass, and roots. African elephants mostly browse, while Asian elephants mainly graze. They can eat as much as of food and drink of water in a day. Elephants tend to stay near water sources. They have morning, afternoon, and nighttime feeding sessions. At midday, elephants rest under trees and may doze off while standing. Sleeping occurs at night while the animal is lying down. Elephants average 3–4 hours of sleep per day. Both males and family groups typically move no more than a day, but distances as far as have been recorded in the Etosha region of Namibia. Elephants go on seasonal migrations in response to changes in environmental conditions. In northern Botswana, they travel to the Chobe River after the local waterholes dry up in late August.

Because of their large size, elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are considered keystone species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; smaller herbivores can access trees mowed down by elephants. When they dig for water during droughts, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. When they use waterholes, they end up making them bigger. At Mount Elgon, elephants dig through caves and pave the way for ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds, and insects. Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants consume and deposit many seeds over great distances, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the smaller Malayan tapir. Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. Elephants can have a negative impact on ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, elephant numbers have threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight causes the soil to compress, leading to runoff and erosion.

Elephants typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores, which will usually stay out of their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting elephants, targeting calves, juveniles or even sub-adults. There are rare reports of adult Asian elephants falling prey to tigers. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to many other mammals. This may be due to elephants being less vulnerable to predation; in other mammal species, individuals weakened by significant parasite loads are easily killed off by predators, removing them from the population.

===Social organisation===

Elephants are generally gregarious animals. African bush elephants in particular have a complex, stratified social structure. Female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups. They are led by the matriarch, who is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants found that the death of the matriarch led to greater stress in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch&#x27;s eldest daughter takes her place instead of her sister (if present). One study found that younger matriarchs take potential threats less seriously. Large family groups may split if they cannot be supported by local resources.

At Amboseli National Park, Kenya, female groups may consist of around ten members, including four adults and their dependent offspring. Here, a cow&#x27;s life involves interaction with those outside her group. Two separate families may associate and bond with each other, forming what are known as bond groups. During the dry season, elephant families may aggregate into clans. These may number around nine groups, in which clans do not form strong bonds but defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the &quot;central&quot; and &quot;peripheral&quot; subpopulations.

Female Asian elephants tend to have more fluid social associations. In Sri Lanka, there appear to be stable family units or &quot;herds&quot; and larger, looser &quot;groups&quot;. They have been observed to have &quot;nursing units&quot; and &quot;juvenile-care units&quot;. In southern India, elephant populations may contain family groups, bond groups, and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, with only one or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two cows and their offspring is known as a &quot;joint family&quot;. Malay elephant populations have even smaller family units and do not reach levels above a bond group. Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one cow with one to three offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.
Adult males live separate lives. As he matures, a bull associates more with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli, young males may be away from their families 80% of the time by 14–15 years of age. When males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of bulls in dense forests. A dominance hierarchy exists among males, whether they are social or solitary. Dominance depends on age, size, and sexual condition. Male elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for mates and form vast and fluid social networks. Older bulls act as the leaders of these groups. The presence of older males appears to subdue the aggression and &quot;deviant&quot; behaviour of younger ones. The largest all-male groups can reach close to 150 individuals. Adult males and females come together to breed. Bulls will accompany family groups if a cow is in oestrous.

===Sexual behaviour===
====Musth====
Adult males enter a state of increased testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at 15 years old, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, no bulls under 24 were found to be in musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 were. In some areas, there may be seasonal influences on the timing of musths. The main characteristic of a bull&#x27;s musth is a fluid discharged from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with a high and swinging head, nonsynchronous ear flapping, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling, and urinating in the sheath. The length of this varies between males of different ages and conditions, lasting from days to months.

Males become extremely aggressive during musth. Size is the determining factor in agonistic encounters when the individuals have the same condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win the majority of the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring. Rarely do they full-on fight. 

There is at least one documented case of infanticide among Asian elephants at Dong Yai Wildlife Sanctuary, with the researchers describing it as most likely normal behaviour among aggressive musth elephants.

====Mating====

Elephants are polygynous breeders, and most copulations occur during rainfall. An oestrous cow uses pheromones in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires him to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and taste it with the vomeronasal organ at the roof of the mouth. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks, with the follicular phase lasting 4–6 weeks and the luteal phase lasting 8–10 weeks. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, appears to change the female&#x27;s scent, signaling to males that she is in heat, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Cows over 45–50 years of age are less fertile.

Bulls engage in a behaviour known as mate-guarding, where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males. Most mate-guarding is done by musth males, and females seek them out, particularly older ones. Musth appears to signal to females the condition of the male, as weak or injured males do not have normal musths. For young females, the approach of an older bull can be intimidating, so her relatives stay nearby for comfort. During copulation, the male rests his trunk on the female. The penis is mobile enough to move without the pelvis. Before mounting, it curves forward and upward. Copulation lasts about 45 seconds and does not involve pelvic thrusting or an ejaculatory pause.

Homosexual behaviour has been observed in both sexes. As in heterosexual interactions, this involves mounting. Male elephants sometimes stimulate each other by playfighting, and &quot;championships&quot; may form between old bulls and younger males. Female same-sex behaviours have been documented only in captivity, where they engage in mutual masturbation with their trunks.

===Birth and development===

Gestation in elephants typically lasts between one and a half and two years and the female will not give birth again for at least four years. The relatively long pregnancy is supported by several corpus luteums and gives the foetus more time to develop, particularly the brain and trunk. Births tend to take place during the wet season. Typically, only a single young is born, but twins sometimes occur. Calves are born roughly tall and with a weight of around . They are precocial and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and family herd. A newborn calf will attract the attention of all the herd members. Adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the first few days, the mother limits access to her young. Alloparenting – where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother – takes place in some family groups. Allomothers are typically aged two to twelve years.

For the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet and needs its mother&#x27;s help. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is less developed. With little coordination in its trunk, it can only flop it around which may cause it to trip. When it reaches its second week, the calf can walk with more balance and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, the trunk can grab and hold objects but still lacks sucking abilities, and the calf must bend down to drink. It continues to stay near its mother as it is still reliant on her. For its first three months, a calf relies entirely on its mother&#x27;s milk, after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, there is progress in lip and leg movements. By nine months, mouth, trunk, and foot coordination are mastered. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year. After a year, a calf is fully capable of grooming, drinking, and feeding itself. It still needs its mother&#x27;s milk and protection until it is at least two years old. Suckling after two years may improve growth, health, and fertility.

Play behaviour in calves differs between the sexes; females run or chase each other while males play-fight. The former are sexually mature by the age of nine years while the latter become mature around 14–15 years. Adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes. Elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60–70 years of age. Lin Wang, a captive male Asian elephant, lived for 86 years.

===Communication===

Elephants communicate in various ways. Individuals greet one another by touching each other on the mouth, temporal glands, and genitals. This allows them to pick up chemical cues. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to control younger ones. Touching is especially important for mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. A calf will press against its mother&#x27;s front legs to signal it wants to rest and will touch her breast or leg when it wants to suckle.

Visual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. Elephants will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as tossing around dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants also raise their heads and spread their ears but additionally may raise their trunks. Submissive elephants will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that are ready to fight will bend their ears in a V shape.

Elephants produce several vocalisations—some of which pass though the trunk—for both short and long range communication. This includes trumpeting, bellowing, roaring, growling, barking, snorting, and rumbling. Elephants can produce infrasonic rumbles. For Asian elephants, these calls have a frequency of 14–24 Hz, with sound pressure levels of 85–90 dB and last 10–15 seconds. For African elephants, calls range from 15 to 35 Hz with sound pressure levels as high as 117 dB, allowing communication for many kilometres, possibly over . Elephants are known to communicate with seismics, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth&#x27;s surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. An individual foot stomping or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at travel distances of up to . Seismic waveforms produced by rumbles travel .

===Intelligence and cognition===

Elephants are among the most intelligent animals. They exhibit mirror self-recognition, an indication of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed fine-tuning branches for use as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps which give them long lasting memories of their environment on a wide scale. Individuals may be able to remember where their family members are located.

Scientists debate the extent to which elephants feel emotion. They are attracted to the bones of their own kind, regardless of whether they are related. As with chimpanzees and dolphins, a dying or dead elephant may elicit attention and aid from others, including those from other groups. This has been interpreted as expressing &quot;concern&quot;; however, the &quot;Oxford Companion to Animal Behaviour&quot; (1987) said that &quot;one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion&quot;.

==Conservation==
===Status===
African bush elephants were listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2021, and African forest elephants were listed as Critically Endangered in the same year. In 1979, Africa had an estimated population of at least 1.3 million elephants, possibly as high as 3.0 million. A decade later, the population was estimated to be 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in Eastern Africa, 204,000 in Southern Africa, and 19,000 in Western Africa. The population of rainforest elephants was lower than anticipated, at around 214,000 individuals. Between 1977 and 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers hastened, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern Africa were various, with unconfirmed losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. The IUCN estimated that total population in Africa is estimated at to 415,000 individuals for both species combined as of 2016.

African elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found. Successful conservation efforts in certain areas have led to high population densities while failures have led to declines as high as 70% or more of the course of ten years. As of 2008, local numbers were controlled by contraception or translocation. Large-scale cullings stopped in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1989, the African elephant was listed under Appendix I by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), making trade illegal. Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000. In some countries, sport hunting of the animals is legal; Botswana, Cameroon, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have CITES export quotas for elephant trophies.

In 2020, the IUCN listed the Asian elephant as endangered due to the population declining by half over &quot;the last three generations&quot;. Asian elephants once ranged from Western to East Asia and south to Sumatra. and Java. It is now extinct in these areas, and the current range of Asian elephants is highly fragmented. The total population of Asian elephants is estimated to be around 40,000–50,000, although this may be a loose estimate. Around 60% of the population is in India. Although Asian elephants are declining in numbers overall, particularly in Southeast Asia, the population in the Western Ghats may have stabilised.

===Threats===
The poaching of elephants for their ivory, meat and hides has been one of the major threats to their existence. Historically, numerous cultures made ornaments and other works of art from elephant ivory, and its use was comparable to that of gold. The ivory trade contributed to the fall of the African elephant population in the late 20th century. This prompted international bans on ivory imports, starting with the United States in June 1989, and followed by bans in other North American countries, western European countries, and Japan. Around the same time, Kenya destroyed all its ivory stocks. Ivory was banned internationally by CITES in 1990. Following the bans, unemployment rose in India and China, where the ivory industry was important economically. By contrast, Japan and Hong Kong, which were also part of the industry, were able to adapt and were not as badly affected. Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Malawi wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to, since their local populations were healthy, but only if their supplies were from culled individuals or those that died of natural causes.

The ban allowed the elephant to recover in parts of Africa. In February 2012, 650 elephants in Bouba Njida National Park, Cameroon, were slaughtered by Chadian raiders. This has been called &quot;one of the worst concentrated killings&quot; since the ivory ban. Asian elephants are potentially less vulnerable to the ivory trade, as females usually lack tusks. Still, members of the species have been killed for their ivory in some areas, such as Periyar National Park in India. China was the biggest market for poached ivory but announced they would phase out the legal domestic manufacture and sale of ivory products in May 2015, and in September 2015, China and the United States said &quot;they would enact a nearly complete ban on the import and export of ivory&quot; due to causes of extinction.

Other threats to elephants include habitat destruction and fragmentation. The Asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations and may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the protection of wildlife corridors which give populations greater interconnectivity and space. Chili pepper products as well as guarding with defense tools have been found to be effective in preventing crop-raiding by elephants. Less effective tactics include beehive and electric fences.

==Human relations==
===Working animal===
Elephants have been working animals since at least the Indus Valley civilization over 4,000 years ago and continue to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old, the age range when they are both more trainable and can work for more years. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used. Individuals of the Asian species have been often trained as working animals. Asian elephants are used to carry and pull both objects and people in and out of areas as well as lead people in religious celebrations. They are valued over mechanised tools as they can perform the same tasks but in more difficult terrain, with strength, memory, and delicacy. Elephants can learn over 30 commands. Musth bulls are difficult and dangerous to work with and so are chained up until their condition passes.

In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960. In both Myanmar and Thailand, deforestation and other economic factors have resulted in sizable populations of unemployed elephants resulting in health problems for the elephants themselves as well as economic and safety problems for the people amongst whom they live.

The practice of working elephants has also been attempted in Africa. The taming of African elephants in the Belgian Congo began by decree of Leopold II of Belgium during the 19th century and continues to the present with the Api Elephant Domestication Centre.

===Warfare===


Historically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of war. They were described in Sanskrit texts as far back as 1500 BC. From South Asia, the use of elephants in warfare spread west to Persia and east to Southeast Asia. The Persians used them during the Achaemenid Empire (between the 6th and 4th centuries BC) while Southeast Asian states first used war elephants possibly as early as the 5th century BC and continued to the 20th century. War elephants were also employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period since the reign of Ptolemy II in Egypt. The Carthaginian general Hannibal famously took African elephants across the Alps during his war with the Romans and reached the Po Valley in 218 BC with all of them alive, but died of disease and combat a year later.

An elephant&#x27;s head and sides were equipped with armour, the trunk may have had a sword tied to it and tusks were sometimes covered with sharpened iron or brass. Trained elephants would attack both humans and horses with their tusks. They might have grasped an enemy soldier with the trunk and tossed him to their mahout, or pinned the soldier to the ground and speared him. Some shortcomings of war elephants included their great visibility, which made them easy to target, and limited maneuverability compared to horses. Alexander the Great achieved victory over armies with war elephants by having his soldiers injure the trunks and legs of the animals which caused them to panic and become uncontrollable.

===Zoos and circuses===
Elephants have traditionally been a major part of zoos and circuses around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably Jumbo (1861 – 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. These animals do not reproduce well in captivity due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, imports of the species almost stopped by the end of the 1980s. Subsequently, the US received many captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals.

Keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they allow easy access to the animals and provide fund and knowledge for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Opponents claim that animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of wobbling the body or head and pacing the same route both forwards and backwards. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live just as long.

The use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins, and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was rebuked for using an electric prod on an elephant. Despite this, he denied that any of these practices hurt the animals. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on positive reinforcement when training his animals. Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.

===Attacks===
Elephants can exhibit bouts of aggressive behaviour and engage in destructive actions against humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male elephants have entered villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. From 2000 to 2004, 300 people died in Jharkhand, and in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.
Throughout the country, 1,500 people were killed by elephants between 2019 and 2022, which led to 300 elephants being killed in kind. Local people have reported that some elephants were drunk during the attacks, though officials have disputed this. Purportedly drunk elephants attacked an Indian village in December 2002, killing six people, which led to the retaliatory slaughter of about 200 elephants by locals.

===Cultural significance===

Elephants have a universal presence in global culture. They have been represented in art since Paleolithic times. Africa, in particular, contains many examples of elephant rock art, especially in the Sahara and southern Africa. In Asia, the animals are depicted as motifs in Hindu and Buddhist shrines and temples. Elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no first-hand experience of them. The ancient Romans, who kept the animals in captivity, depicted elephants more accurately than medieval Europeans who portrayed them more like fantasy creatures, with horse, bovine, and boar-like traits, and trumpet-like trunks. As Europeans gained more access to captive elephants during the 15th century, depictions of them became more accurate, including one made by Leonardo da Vinci.

Elephants have been the subject of religious beliefs. The Mbuti people of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants. Similar ideas existed among other African societies, who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of Igbo-Ukwu, in modern-day Nigeria, placed elephant tusks underneath their dead leader&#x27;s feet in the grave. The animals&#x27; importance is only totemic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise, in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as Airavata, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows. One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed Ganesha, is ranked equal with the supreme gods Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma in some traditions. Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants, and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires, but could also take these things away. In Buddhism, Buddha is said to have taken the form of a white elephant when he entered his mother&#x27;s womb to be reincarnated as a human. 

In Western popular culture, elephants symbolise the exotic, especially since – as with the giraffe, hippopotamus, and rhinoceros – there are no similar animals familiar to Western audiences. As characters, elephants are most common in children&#x27;s stories, where they are portrayed positively. They are typically surrogates for humans with ideal human values. Many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to or finding a family, such as &quot;The Elephant&#x27;s Child&quot; from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot;, Disney&#x27;s &quot;Dumbo,&quot; and Kathryn and Byron Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Saggy Baggy Elephant&quot;. Other elephant heroes given human qualities include Jean de Brunhoff&#x27;s Babar, David McKee&#x27;s Elmer, and Dr. Seuss&#x27;s Horton.

Several cultural references emphasise the elephant&#x27;s size and strangeness. For instance, a &quot;white elephant&quot; is a byword for something that is weird, unwanted, and has no value. The expression &quot;elephant in the room&quot; refers to something that is being ignored but ultimately must be addressed. The story of the blind men and an elephant involves blind men touching different parts of an elephant and trying to figure out what it is.

<text>Evolutionary linguistics or Darwinian linguistics is a sociobiological approach to the study of language. Evolutionary linguists consider linguistics as a subfield of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. The approach is also closely linked with evolutionary anthropology, cognitive linguistics and biolinguistics. Studying languages as the products of nature, it is interested in the biological origin and development of language. Evolutionary linguistics is contrasted with humanistic approaches, especially structural linguistics.

A main challenge in this research is the lack of empirical data: there are no archaeological traces of early human language. Computational biological modelling and clinical research with artificial languages have been employed to fill in gaps of knowledge. Although biology is understood to shape the brain, which processes language, there is no clear link between biology and specific human language structures or linguistic universals.

For lack of a breakthrough in the field, there have been numerous debates about what kind of natural phenomenon language might be. Some researchers focus on the innate aspects of language. It is suggested that grammar has emerged adaptationally from the human genome, bringing about a language instinct; or that it depends on a single mutation which has caused a language organ to appear in the human brain. This is hypothesized to result in a crystalline grammatical structure underlying all human languages. Others suggest language is not crystallized, but fluid and ever-changing. Others, yet, liken languages to living organisms. Languages are considered analogous to a parasite or populations of mind-viruses. There is so far little scientific evidence for any of these claims, and some of them have been labelled as pseudoscience.

==History==

===1863–1945: social Darwinism===

Although pre-Darwinian theorists had compared languages to living organisms as a metaphor, the comparison was first taken literally in 1863 by the historical linguist August Schleicher who was inspired by Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. At the time there was not enough evidence to prove that Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection was correct. Schleicher proposed that linguistics could be used as a testing ground for the study of the evolution of species. A review of Schleicher&#x27;s book &quot;Darwinism as Tested by the Science of Language&quot; appeared in the first issue of &quot;Nature&quot; journal in 1870. Darwin reiterated Schleicher&#x27;s proposition in his 1871 book &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;, claiming that languages are comparable to species, and that language change occurs through natural selection as words &#x27;struggle for life&#x27;. Darwin believed that languages had evolved from animal mating calls. Darwinists considered the concept of language creation as unscientific.

August Schleicher and his friend Ernst Haeckel were keen gardeners and regarded the study of cultures as a type of botany, with different species competing for the same living space. Similar ideas became later advocated by politicians who wanted to appeal to working class voters, not least by the national socialists who subsequently included the concept of struggle for living space in their agenda. Highly influential until the end of World War II, social Darwinism was eventually banished from human sciences, leading to a strict separation of natural and sociocultural studies.

This gave rise to the dominance of structural linguistics in Europe. There had long been a dispute between the Darwinists and the French intellectuals with the topic of language evolution famously having been banned by the Paris Linguistic Society as early as in 1866. Ferdinand de Saussure proposed structuralism to replace evolutionary linguistics in his &quot;Course in General Linguistics&quot;, published posthumously in 1916. The structuralists rose to academic political power in human and social sciences in the aftermath of the student revolts of Spring 1968, establishing Sorbonne as an international centrepoint of humanistic thinking.

===From 1959 onwards: genetic determinism===
In the United States, structuralism was however fended off by the advocates of behavioural psychology; a linguistics framework nicknamed as &#x27;American structuralism&#x27;. It was eventually replaced by the approach of Noam Chomsky who published a modification of Louis Hjelmslev&#x27;s formal structuralist theory, claiming that syntactic structures are innate. An active figure in peace demonstrations in the 1950s and 1960s, Chomsky rose to academic political power following Spring 1968 at the MIT.

Chomsky became an influential opponent of the French intellectuals during the following decades, and his supporters successfully confronted the post-structuralists in the &quot;Science Wars&quot; of the late 1990s. The shift of the century saw a new academic funding policy where interdisciplinary research became favoured, effectively directing research funds to biological humanities. The decline of structuralism was evident by 2015 with Sorbonne having lost its former spirit.

Chomsky eventually claimed that syntactic structures are caused by a random mutation in the human genome, proposing a similar explanation for other human faculties such as ethics. But Steven Pinker argued in 1990 that they are the outcome of evolutionary adaptations.

===From 1976 onwards: Neo-Darwinism===
At the same time when the Chomskyan paradigm of biological determinism defeated humanism, it was losing its own clout within sociobiology. It was reported likewise in 2015 that generative grammar was under fire in applied linguistics and in the process of being replaced with &quot;usage-based linguistics&quot;; a derivative of Richard Dawkins&#x27;s memetics. It is a concept of linguistic units as replicators. Following the publication of memetics in Dawkins&#x27;s 1976 nonfiction bestseller &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, many biologically inclined linguists, frustrated with the lack of evidence for Chomsky&#x27;s Universal Grammar, grouped under different brands including a framework called Cognitive Linguistics (with capitalised initials), and &#x27;functional&#x27; (adaptational) linguistics (not to be confused with functional linguistics) to confront both Chomsky and the humanists. The replicator approach is today dominant in evolutionary linguistics, applied linguistics, cognitive linguistics and linguistic typology; while the generative approach has maintained its position in general linguistics, especially syntax; and in computational linguistics.

==View of linguistics==

Evolutionary linguistics is part of a wider framework of Universal Darwinism. In this view, linguistics is seen as an ecological environment for research traditions struggling for the same resources. According to David Hull, these traditions correspond to species in biology. Relationships between research traditions can be symbiotic, competitive or parasitic. An adaptation of Hull&#x27;s theory in linguistics is proposed by William Croft. He argues that the Darwinian method is more advantageous than linguistic models based on physics, structuralist sociology, or hermeneutics.

==Approaches==

Evolutionary linguistics is often divided into functionalism and formalism, concepts which are not to be confused with functionalism and formalism in the humanistic reference. Functional evolutionary linguistics considers languages as adaptations to human mind. The formalist view regards them as crystallised or non-adaptational.

===Functionalism (adaptationism) ===

The adaptational view of language is advocated by various frameworks of cognitive and evolutionary linguistics, with the terms &#x27;functionalism&#x27; and &#x27;Cognitive Linguistics&#x27; often being equated. It is hypothesised that the evolution of the animal brain provides humans with a mechanism of abstract reasoning which is a &#x27;metaphorical&#x27; version of image-based reasoning. Language is not considered as a separate area of cognition, but as coinciding with general cognitive capacities, such as perception, attention, motor skills, and spatial and visual processing. It is argued to function according to the same principles as these.

It is thought that the brain links action schemes to form–meaning pairs which are called constructions. Cognitive linguistic approaches to syntax are called cognitive and construction grammar. Also deriving from memetics and other cultural replicator theories, these can study the natural or social selection and adaptation of linguistic units. Adaptational models reject a formal systemic view of language and consider language as a population of linguistic units.

The bad reputation of social Darwinism and memetics has been discussed in the literature, and recommendations for new terminology have been given. What correspond to replicators or mind-viruses in memetics are called &quot;linguemes&quot; in Croft&#x27;s &quot;theory of Utterance Selection&quot; (TUS), and likewise linguemes or constructions in construction grammar and usage-based linguistics; and metaphors, frames or schemas in cognitive and construction grammar. The reference of memetics has been largely replaced with that of a Complex Adaptive System. In current linguistics, this term covers a wide range of evolutionary notions while maintaining the Neo-Darwinian concepts of replication and replicator population.

Functional evolutionary linguistics is not to be confused with functional humanistic linguistics.

===Formalism (structuralism)===

Advocates of formal evolutionary explanation in linguistics argue that linguistic structures are crystallised. Inspired by 19th century advances in crystallography, Schleicher argued that different types of languages are like plants, animals and crystals. The idea of linguistic structures as frozen drops was revived in tagmemics, an approach to linguistics with the goal to uncover divine symmetries underlying all languages, as if caused by the Creation.

In modern biolinguistics, the X-bar tree is argued to be like natural systems such as ferromagnetic droplets and botanic forms. Generative grammar considers syntactic structures similar to snowflakes. It is hypothesised that such patterns are caused by a mutation in humans.

The formal–structural evolutionary aspect of linguistics is not to be confused with structural linguistics.

==Evidence==
There was some hope of a breakthrough with the discovery of the &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene. There is little support, however, for the idea that &quot;FOXP2&quot; is &#x27;the grammar gene&#x27; or that it had much to do with the relatively recent emergence of syntactical speech. The idea that people have a language instinct is disputed.
Memetics is sometimes discredited as pseudoscience and neurological claims made by evolutionary cognitive linguists have been likened to pseudoscience. All in all, there does not appear to be any evidence for the basic tenets of evolutionary linguistics beyond the fact that language is processed by the brain, and brain structures are shaped by genes.

==Criticism==

Evolutionary linguistics has been criticised by advocates of (humanistic) structural and functional linguistics. Ferdinand de Saussure commented on 19th century evolutionary linguistics:
Mark Aronoff, however, argues that historical linguistics had its golden age during the time of Schleicher and his supporters, enjoying a place among the hard sciences, and considers the return of Darwinian linguistics as a positive development. Esa Itkonen nonetheless deems the revival of Darwinism as a hopeless enterprise:
Itkonen also points out that the principles of natural selection are not applicable because language innovation and acceptance have the same source which is the speech community. In biological evolution, mutation and selection have different sources. This makes it possible for people to change their languages, but not their genotype.

<doc id="9282" wikidata="Q217386" url="?curid=9282" title="ECHELON">
<text>ECHELON, originally a secret government code name, is a surveillance program (signals intelligence/SIGINT collection and analysis network) operated by the five signatory states to the UKUSA Security Agreement: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, also known as the Five Eyes.

Created in the late 1960s to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies during the Cold War, the ECHELON project became formally established in 1971. By the end of the 20th century, it had greatly expanded.

== Organization ==

The UKUSA intelligence community was assessed by the European Parliament (EP) in 2000 to include the signals intelligence agencies of each of the member states:
* the Government Communications Headquarters of the United Kingdom,
* the National Security Agency of the United States,
* the Communications Security Establishment of Canada,
* the Australian Signals Directorate of Australia, and
* the Government Communications Security Bureau of New Zealand.
== Reporting and disclosures ==

=== Public disclosures (1972–2000) ===
Former NSA analyst Perry Fellwock, under the pseudonym Winslow Peck, first blew the whistle on ECHELON to &quot;Ramparts&quot; in 1972, when he revealed the existence of a global network of listening posts and told of his experiences working there. He also revealed the existence of nuclear weapons in Israel in 1972, the widespread involvement of CIA and NSA personnel in drugs and human smuggling, and CIA operatives leading Nationalist Chinese (Taiwan) commandos in burning villages inside PRC borders.

In 1982, investigative journalist and author James Bamford wrote &quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot;, an in-depth history of the NSA and its practices, which notably leaked the existence of the eavesdropping operation Project SHAMROCK. Project SHAMROCK ran from 1945 to 1975, after which it evolved into ECHELON.

In 1988, Margaret Newsham, a Lockheed employee under NSA contract, disclosed the ECHELON surveillance system to members of Congress. Newsham told a member of the US Congress that the telephone calls of Strom Thurmond, a Republican US senator, were being collected by the NSA. Congressional investigators determined that &quot;targeting of US political figures would not occur by accident, but was designed into the system from the start.&quot;

Also in 1988, an article titled &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Listening&quot;, written by investigative journalist Duncan Campbell in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, described the signals intelligence gathering activities of a program code-named &quot;ECHELON&quot;. Bamford described the system as the software controlling the collection and distribution of civilian telecommunications traffic conveyed using communication satellites, with the collection being undertaken by ground stations located in the footprint of the downlink leg.

A detailed description of ECHELON was provided by the New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager in his 1996 book &quot;Secret Power: New Zealand&#x27;s Role in the International Spy Network&quot;. Two years later, Hager&#x27;s book was cited by the European Parliament in a report titled &quot;An Appraisal of the Technology of Political Control&quot; (PE 168.184).

In March 1999, for the first time in history, the Australian government admitted that news reports about the top secret UKUSA Agreement were true. Martin Brady, the director of Australia&#x27;s Defence Signals Directorate (DSD, now known as Australian Signals Directorate, or ASD) told the Australian broadcasting channel Nine Network that the DSD &quot;does co-operate with counterpart signals intelligence organisations overseas under the UKUSA relationship.&quot;

In 2000, James Woolsey, the former Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency, confirmed that US intelligence uses interception systems and keyword searches to monitor European businesses.

Lawmakers in the United States feared that the ECHELON system could be used to monitor US citizens. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the ECHELON system has been &quot;shrouded in such secrecy that its very existence has been difficult to prove.&quot; Critics said the ECHELON system emerged from the Cold War as a &quot;Big Brother without a cause&quot;.

===European Parliament investigation (2000–2001)===
The program&#x27;s capabilities and political implications were investigated by a committee of the European Parliament during 2000 and 2001 with a report published in 2001. In July 2000, the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System was established by the European parliament to investigate the surveillance network. It was chaired by the Portuguese politician Carlos Coelho, who was in charge of supervising investigations throughout 2000 and 2001.

In May 2001, as the committee finalised its report on the ECHELON system, a delegation travelled to Washington, D.C. to attend meetings with US officials from the following agencies and departments:
* US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
* US Department of Commerce (DOC)
* US National Security Agency (NSA)

All meetings were cancelled by the US government and the committee was forced to end its trip prematurely. According to a BBC correspondent in May 2001, &quot;The US Government still refuses to admit that Echelon even exists.&quot;

In July 2001, the Committee released its final report. The EP report concluded that it seemed likely that ECHELON is a method of sorting captured signal traffic, rather than a comprehensive analysis tool. On 5 September 2001, the European parliament voted to accept the report. 

The European Parliament stated in its report that the term ECHELON is used in a number of contexts, but that the evidence presented indicates that it was the name for a signals intelligence collection system. The report concludes that, on the basis of information presented, ECHELON was capable of interception and content inspection of telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data traffic globally through the interception of communication bearers including satellite transmission, public switched telephone networks (which once carried most Internet traffic), and microwave links. 

=== Confirmation of ECHELON (2015) ===
Two internal NSA newsletters from January 2011 and July 2012, published as part of Edward Snowden&#x27;s leaks by the website &quot;The Intercept&quot; on 3 August 2015, for the first time confirmed that NSA used the code word ECHELON and provided some details about the scope of the program: ECHELON was part of an umbrella program with the code name FROSTING, which was established by the NSA in 1966 to collect and process data from communications satellites. FROSTING had two sub-programs:
* TRANSIENT: for intercepting Soviet satellite transmissions
* ECHELON: for intercepting Intelsat satellite transmissions 
The European Parliament&#x27;s Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System stated, &quot;It seems likely, in view of the evidence and the consistent pattern of statements from a very wide range of individuals and organisations, including American sources, that its name is in fact ECHELON, although this is a relatively minor detail&quot;. The US intelligence community uses many code names (&quot;see&quot;, for example, CIA cryptonym).

Former NSA employee Margaret Newsham said that she worked on the configuration and installation of software that makes up the ECHELON system while employed at Lockheed Martin, from 1974 to 1984 in Sunnyvale, California, in the United States, and in Menwith Hill, England, in the UK. At that time, according to Newsham, the code name ECHELON was NSA&#x27;s term for the computer network itself. Lockheed called it &quot;P415&quot;. The software programs were called &quot;SILKWORTH&quot; and &quot;SIRE&quot;. A satellite named &quot;VORTEX&quot; intercepted communications. An image available on the internet of a fragment apparently torn from a job description shows Echelon listed along with several other code names.

Britain&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper summarized the capabilities of the ECHELON system as follows:

Documents leaked by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the ECHELON system&#x27;s collection of satellite data is also referred to as FORNSAT - an abbreviation for &quot;Foreign Satellite Collection&quot;.

== History and context ==

The ability to intercept communications depends on the medium used, be it radio, satellite, microwave, cellular or fiber-optic. During World War II and through the 1950s, high-frequency (&quot;short-wave&quot;) radio was widely used for military and diplomatic communication and could be intercepted at great distances. The rise of geostationary communications satellites in the 1960s presented new possibilities for intercepting international communications. In 1964, plans for the establishment of the ECHELON network took off after dozens of countries agreed to establish the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Intelsat), which would own and operate a global constellation of communications satellites.
In 1966, the first Intelsat satellite was launched into orbit. From 1970 to 1971, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) of Britain began to operate a secret signal station at Morwenstow, near Bude in Cornwall, England. The station intercepted satellite communications over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Soon afterwards, the US National Security Agency (NSA) built a second signal station at Yakima, near Seattle, for the interception of satellite communications over the Pacific Ocean. In 1981, GCHQ and the NSA started the construction of the first global wide area network (WAN). Soon after Australia, Canada, and New Zealand joined the ECHELON system. The report to the European Parliament of 2001 states: &quot;If UKUSA states operate listening stations in the relevant regions of the earth, in principle they can intercept all telephone, fax, and data traffic transmitted via such satellites.&quot;

Most reports on ECHELON focus on satellite interception. Testimony before the European Parliament indicated that separate but similar UKUSA systems are in place to monitor communication through undersea cables, microwave transmissions, and other lines. The report to the European Parliament points out that interception of private communications by foreign intelligence services is not necessarily limited to the US or British foreign intelligence services. The role of satellites in point-to-point voice and data communications has largely been supplanted by fiber optics. In 2006, 99% of the world&#x27;s long-distance voice and data traffic was carried over optical-fiber. The proportion of international communications accounted for by satellite links is said to have decreased substantially to an amount between 0.4% and 5% in Central Europe. Even in less-developed parts of the world, communications satellites are used largely for point-to-multipoint applications, such as video. Thus, the majority of communications can no longer be intercepted by earth stations; they can only be collected by tapping cables and intercepting line-of-sight microwave signals, which is possible only to a limited extent.

==Concerns==
British journalist Duncan Campbell and New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager said in the 1990s that the United States was exploiting ECHELON traffic for industrial espionage, rather than military and diplomatic purposes. Examples alleged by the journalists include the gear-less wind turbine technology designed by the German firm Enercon and the speech technology developed by the Belgian firm Lernout &amp; Hauspie.

In 2001, the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System recommended to the European Parliament that citizens of member states routinely use cryptography in their communications to protect their privacy, because economic espionage with ECHELON has been conducted by the US intelligence agencies.

American author James Bamford provides an alternative view, highlighting that legislation prohibits the use of intercepted communications for commercial purposes, although he does not elaborate on how intercepted communications are used as part of an all-source intelligence process.

In its report, the committee of the European Parliament stated categorically that the Echelon network was being used to intercept not only military communications, but also private and business ones. In its epigraph to the report, the parliamentary committee quoted Juvenal, &quot;&quot;Sed quis custodiet ipsos custodes&quot;. (&quot;But who will watch the watchers&quot;). James Bamford, in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in May 2001, warned that if Echelon were to continue unchecked, it could become a &quot;cyber secret police, without courts, juries, or the right to a defence&quot;.

Alleged examples of espionage conducted by the members of the &quot;Five Eyes&quot; include:

* On behalf of the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Communications Security Establishment allegedly spied on two British cabinet ministers in 1983.
* The US National Security Agency spied on and intercepted the phone calls of Diana, Princess of Wales right up until she died in a Paris car crash with Dodi Fayed in 1997. The NSA currently holds 1,056 pages of classified information about Princess Diana, which has been classified as top secret &quot;because their disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security ... the damage would be caused not by the information about Diana, but because the documents would disclose &#x27;sources and methods&#x27; of US intelligence gathering&quot;. An official said that &quot;the references to Diana in intercepted conversations were &#x27;incidental&#x27;,&quot; and she was never a &#x27;target&#x27; of the NSA eavesdropping.
* UK agents monitored the conversations of the 7th Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan.
* US agents gathered &quot;detailed biometric information&quot; on the 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon.
* In the early 1990s, the US National Security Agency intercepted the communications between the European aerospace company Airbus and the Saudi Arabian national airline. In 1994, Airbus lost a $6 billion contract with Saudi Arabia after the NSA, acting as a whistleblower, reported that Airbus officials had been bribing Saudi officials to secure the contract. As a result, the American aerospace company McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing) won the multibillion-dollar contract instead of Airbus.
* The United States defense contractor Raytheon won a US$1.3 billion contract with the Government of Brazil to monitor the Amazon rainforest after the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), acting as a whistleblower, reported that Raytheon&#x27;s French competitor Thomson-Alcatel had been paying bribes to get the contract.
* In order to boost the United States position in trade negotiations with the then Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in 1995 the CIA eavesdropped on the conversations between Japanese bureaucrats and executives of car manufacturers Toyota and Nissan.

== Workings ==

The first United States satellite ground station for the ECHELON collection program was built in 1971 at a military firing and training center near Yakima, Washington. The facility, which was codenamed JACKKNIFE, was an investment of ca. 21.3 million dollars and had around 90 people. Satellite traffic was intercepted by a 30-meter single-dish antenna. The station became fully operational on 4 October 1974. It was connected with NSA headquarters at Fort Meade by a 75-baud secure Teletype orderwire channel.

In 1999 the Australian Senate Joint Standing Committee on Treaties was told by Professor Desmond Ball that the Pine Gap facility was used as a ground station for a satellite-based interception network. The satellites were said to be large radio dishes between 20 and 100 meters in diameter in geostationary orbits. The original purpose of the network was to monitor the telemetry from 1970s Soviet weapons, air defence and other radars&#x27; capabilities, satellites&#x27; ground stations&#x27; transmissions and ground-based microwave communications.

=== Examples of industrial espionage ===
In 1999, Enercon, a German company and leading manufacturer of wind energy equipment, developed a breakthrough generator for wind turbines. After applying for a US patent, it had learned that Kenetech, an American rival, had submitted an almost identical patent application shortly before. By the statement of a former NSA employee, it was later claimed that the NSA had secretly intercepted and monitored Enercon&#x27;s data communications and conference calls and passed information regarding the new generator to Kenetech. However, later German media reports contradicted this story, as it was revealed that the American patent in question was actually filed three years before the alleged wiretapping was said to have taken place. As German intelligence services are forbidden from engaging in industrial or economic espionage, German companies have complained that this leaves them defenceless against industrial espionage from the United States or Russia. According to Wolfgang Hoffmann, a former manager at Bayer, German intelligence services know which companies are being targeted by US intelligence agencies, but refuse to inform the companies involved.

<text>In mathematics, an equation is a mathematical formula that expresses the equality of two expressions, by connecting them with the equals sign . The word &quot;equation&quot; and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in French an &quot;équation&quot; is defined as containing one or more variables, while in English, any well-formed formula consisting of two expressions related with an equals sign is an equation.

Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variables. A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.

The &quot;=&quot; symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.

== Description ==
An equation is written as two expressions, connected by an equals sign (&quot;=&quot;). The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the &quot;left-hand side&quot; and &quot;right-hand side&quot; of the equation. Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero. This does not reduce the generality, as this can be realized by subtracting the right-hand side from both sides.

The most common type of equation is a polynomial equation (commonly called also an &quot;algebraic equation&quot;) in which the two sides are polynomials.
The sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms. For example, the equation 

:formula_1

has left-hand side formula_2, which has four terms, and right-hand side formula_3, consisting of just one term. The names of the variables suggest that and are unknowns, and that , , and are parameters, but this is normally fixed by the context (in some contexts, may be a parameter, or , , and may be ordinary variables).

An equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (e.g., grain) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. More generally, an equation remains balanced if the same operation is performed on each side.

==Properties==

Two equations or two systems of equations are &quot;equivalent&quot;, if they have the same set of solutions. The following operations transform an equation or a system of equations into an equivalent one – provided that the operations are meaningful for the expressions they are applied to:
* Adding or subtracting the same quantity to both sides of an equation. This shows that every equation is equivalent to an equation in which the right-hand side is zero.
* Multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation by a non-zero quantity.
* Applying an identity to transform one side of the equation. For example, expanding a product or factoring a sum.
* For a system: adding to both sides of an equation the corresponding side of another equation, multiplied by the same quantity.

If some function is applied to both sides of an equation, the resulting equation has the solutions of the initial equation among its solutions, but may have further solutions called extraneous solutions. For example, the equation formula_4 has the solution formula_5 Raising both sides to the exponent of 2 (which means applying the function formula_6 to both sides of the equation) changes the equation to formula_7, which not only has the previous solution but also introduces the extraneous solution, formula_8 Moreover, if the function is not defined at some values (such as 1/&quot;x&quot;, which is not defined for &quot;x&quot; = 0), solutions existing at those values may be lost. Thus, caution must be exercised when applying such a transformation to an equation.

The above transformations are the basis of most elementary methods for equation solving, as well as some less elementary ones, like Gaussian elimination.

==Examples==
===Analogous illustration===

An equation is analogous to a weighing scale, balance, or seesaw.

Each side of the equation corresponds to one side of the balance. Different quantities can be placed on each side: if the weights on the two sides are equal, the scale balances, and in analogy, the equality that represents the balance is also balanced (if not, then the lack of balance corresponds to an inequality represented by an inequation).

In the illustration, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; are all different quantities (in this case real numbers) represented as circular weights, and each of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; has a different weight. Addition corresponds to adding weight, while subtraction corresponds to removing weight from what is already there. When equality holds, the total weight on each side is the same.

===Parameters and unknowns===

Equations often contain terms other than the unknowns. These other terms, which are assumed to be &quot;known&quot;, are usually called &quot;constants&quot;, &quot;coefficients&quot; or &quot;parameters&quot;.

An example of an equation involving &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; as unknowns and the parameter &quot;R&quot; is

:formula_9

When &quot;R &quot;is chosen to have the value of 2 (&quot;R &quot;= 2), this equation would be recognized in Cartesian coordinates as the equation for the circle of radius of 2 around the origin. Hence, the equation with &quot;R&quot; unspecified is the general equation for the circle.

Usually, the unknowns are denoted by letters at the end of the alphabet, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, ..., while coefficients (parameters) are denoted by letters at the beginning, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, ... . For example, the general quadratic equation is usually written &quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;bx&quot; + &quot;c&quot; = 0.

The process of finding the solutions, or, in case of parameters, expressing the unknowns in terms of the parameters, is called solving the equation. Such expressions of the solutions in terms of the parameters are also called &quot;solutions&quot;.

A system of equations is a set of &quot;simultaneous equations&quot;, usually in several unknowns for which the common solutions are sought. Thus, a &quot;solution to the system&quot; is a set of values for each of the unknowns, which together form a solution to each equation in the system. For example, the system
:formula_10
has the unique solution &quot;x&quot; = −1, &quot;y&quot; = 1.

===Identities===

An identity is an equation that is true for all possible values of the variable(s) it contains. Many identities are known in algebra and calculus. In the process of solving an equation, an identity is often used to simplify an equation, making it more easily solvable.

In algebra, an example of an identity is the difference of two squares:

:formula_11

which is true for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

Trigonometry is an area where many identities exist; these are useful in manipulating or solving trigonometric equations. Two of many that involve the sine and cosine functions are:

:formula_12

and

:formula_13

which are both true for all values of &quot;θ&quot;.

For example, to solve for the value of &quot;θ&quot; that satisfies the equation:

:formula_14

where &quot;θ&quot; is limited to between 0 and 45 degrees, one may use the above identity for the product to give:

:formula_15

yielding the following solution for &quot;θ:&quot;

:formula_16

Since the sine function is a periodic function, there are infinitely many solutions if there are no restrictions on &quot;θ&quot;. In this example, restricting &quot;θ&quot; to be between 0 and 45 degrees would restrict the solution to only one number.

==Algebra==
Algebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them, the special case of linear equations. When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0, where &quot;P&quot; is a polynomial, and linear equations have the form &quot;ax&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = 0, where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are parameters. To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis. Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers. The techniques used are different and come from number theory. These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.

===Polynomial equations===


In general, an &quot;algebraic equation&quot; or polynomial equation is an equation of the form

:formula_17, or

:formula_18 

where &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are polynomials with coefficients in some field (e.g., rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers). An algebraic equation is &quot;univariate&quot; if it involves only one variable. On the other hand, a polynomial equation may involve several variables, in which case it is called &quot;multivariate&quot; (multiple variables, x, y, z, etc.).

For example,
:formula_19
is a univariate algebraic (polynomial) equation with integer coefficients and
:formula_20
is a multivariate polynomial equation over the rational numbers.

Some polynomial equations with rational coefficients have a solution that is an algebraic expression, with a finite number of operations involving just those coefficients (i.e., can be solved algebraically). This can be done for all such equations of degree one, two, three, or four; but equations of degree five or more cannot always be solved in this way, as the Abel–Ruffini theorem demonstrates. 

A large amount of research has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the real or complex solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see Root finding of polynomials) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations (see System of polynomial equations).

===Systems of linear equations===
A system of linear equations (or &quot;linear system&quot;) is a collection of linear equations involving one or more variables. For example,
:formula_21
is a system of three equations in the three variables . A solution to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. A solution to the system above is given by
:formula_22
since it makes all three equations valid. The word &quot;system&quot; indicates that the equations are to be considered collectively, rather than individually.

In mathematics, the theory of linear systems is a fundamental part of linear algebra, a subject which is used in many parts of modern mathematics. Computational algorithms for finding the solutions are an important part of numerical linear algebra, and play a prominent role in physics, engineering, chemistry, computer science, and economics. A system of non-linear equations can often be approximated by a linear system (see linearization), a helpful technique when making a mathematical model or computer simulation of a relatively complex system.

==Geometry==

===Analytic geometry===

In Euclidean geometry, it is possible to associate a set of coordinates to each point in space, for example by an orthogonal grid. This method allows one to characterize geometric figures by equations. A plane in three-dimensional space can be expressed as the solution set of an equation of the form formula_23, where formula_24 and formula_25 are real numbers and formula_26 are the unknowns that correspond to the coordinates of a point in the system given by the orthogonal grid. The values formula_24 are the coordinates of a vector perpendicular to the plane defined by the equation. A line is expressed as the intersection of two planes, that is as the solution set of a single linear equation with values in formula_28 or as the solution set of two linear equations with values in formula_29

A conic section is the intersection of a cone with equation formula_30 and a plane. In other words, in space, all conics are defined as the solution set of an equation of a plane and of the equation of a cone just given. This formalism allows one to determine the positions and the properties of the focuses of a conic.

The use of equations allows one to call on a large area of mathematics to solve geometric questions. The Cartesian coordinate system transforms a geometric problem into an analysis problem, once the figures are transformed into equations; thus the name analytic geometry. This point of view, outlined by Descartes, enriches and modifies the type of geometry conceived of by the ancient Greek mathematicians.

Currently, analytic geometry designates an active branch of mathematics. Although it still uses equations to characterize figures, it also uses other sophisticated techniques such as functional analysis and linear algebra.

===Cartesian equations===
In Cartesian geometry, equations are used to describe geometric figures. As the equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics.

One can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in three-dimensional space by the use of three Cartesian coordinates, which are the signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines).

The invention of Cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by René Descartes revolutionized mathematics by providing the first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as curves) can be described by Cartesian equations: algebraic equations involving the coordinates of the points lying on the shape. For example, a circle of radius 2 in a plane, centered on a particular point called the origin, may be described as the set of all points whose coordinates &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; satisfy the equation .

===Parametric equations===

A parametric equation for a curve expresses the coordinates of the points of the curve as functions of a variable, called a parameter. For example,
:formula_31
are parametric equations for the unit circle, where &quot;t&quot; is the parameter. Together, these equations are called a parametric representation of the curve.

The notion of &quot;parametric equation&quot; has been generalized to surfaces, manifolds and algebraic varieties of higher dimension, with the number of parameters being equal to the dimension of the manifold or variety, and the number of equations being equal to the dimension of the space in which the manifold or variety is considered (for curves the dimension is &quot;one&quot; and &quot;one&quot; parameter is used, for surfaces dimension &quot;two&quot; and &quot;two&quot; parameters, etc.).

==Number theory==

===Diophantine equations===

A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation in two or more unknowns for which only the integer solutions are sought (an integer solution is a solution such that all the unknowns take integer values). A linear Diophantine equation is an equation between two sums of monomials of degree zero or one. An example of linear Diophantine equation is where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are constants. An exponential Diophantine equation is one for which exponents of the terms of the equation can be unknowns.

Diophantine problems have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for all equations. In more technical language, they define an algebraic curve, algebraic surface, or more general object, and ask about the lattice points on it.

The word &quot;Diophantine&quot; refers to the Hellenistic mathematician of the 3rd century, Diophantus of Alexandria, who made a study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce symbolism into algebra. The mathematical study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now called Diophantine analysis.

===Algebraic and transcendental numbers===

An algebraic number is a number that is a solution of a non-zero polynomial equation in one variable with rational coefficients (or equivalently — by clearing denominators — with integer coefficients). Numbers such as  that are not algebraic are said to be transcendental. Almost all real and complex numbers are transcendental.

===Algebraic geometry===

Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying solutions of polynomial equations. Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of abstract algebra, especially commutative algebra, with the language and the problems of geometry.

The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties, which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: plane algebraic curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates, and Cassini ovals. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points, the inflection points and the points at infinity. More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.

==Differential equations==
A differential equation is a mathematical equation that relates some function with its derivatives. In applications, the functions usually represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the equation defines a relationship between the two. They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.

In pure mathematics, differential equations are studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions — the set of functions that satisfy the equation. Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas; however, some properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form.

If a self-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.

===Ordinary differential equations===

An ordinary differential equation or ODE is an equation containing a function of one independent variable and its derivatives. The term &quot;ordinary&quot; is used in contrast with the term partial differential equation, which may be with respect to &quot;more than&quot; one independent variable.

Linear differential equations, which have solutions that can be added and multiplied by coefficients, are well-defined and understood, and exact closed-form solutions are obtained. By contrast, ODEs that lack additive solutions are nonlinear, and solving them is far more intricate, as one can rarely represent them by elementary functions in closed form: Instead, exact and analytic solutions of ODEs are in series or integral form. Graphical and numerical methods, applied by hand or by computer, may approximate solutions of ODEs and perhaps yield useful information, often sufficing in the absence of exact, analytic solutions.

===Partial differential equations===

A partial differential equation (PDE) is a differential equation that contains unknown multivariable functions and their partial derivatives. (This is in contrast to ordinary differential equations, which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives.) PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved by hand, or used to create a relevant computer model.

PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as sound, heat, electrostatics, electrodynamics, fluid flow, elasticity, or quantum mechanics. These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional dynamical systems, partial differential equations often model multidimensional systems. PDEs find their generalisation in stochastic partial differential equations.

== Types of equations ==
Equations can be classified according to the types of operations and quantities involved. Important types include:
* An algebraic equation or polynomial equation is an equation in which both sides are polynomials (see also system of polynomial equations). These are further classified by degree:
** linear equation for degree one
** quadratic equation for degree two
** cubic equation for degree three
** quartic equation for degree four
** quintic equation for degree five
** sextic equation for degree six
** septic equation for degree seven
** octic equation for degree eight
* A Diophantine equation is an equation where the unknowns are required to be integers
* A transcendental equation is an equation involving a transcendental function of its unknowns
* A parametric equation is an equation in which the solutions for the variables are expressed as functions of some other variables, called parameters appearing in the equations
* A functional equation is an equation in which the unknowns are functions rather than simple quantities
* Equations involving derivatives, integrals and finite differences:
** A differential equation is a functional equation involving derivatives of the unknown functions, where the function and its derivatives are evaluated at the same point, such as formula_32. Differential equations are subdivided into ordinary differential equations for functions of a single variable and partial differential equations for functions of multiple variables
** An integral equation is a functional equation involving the antiderivatives of the unknown functions. For functions of one variable, such an equation differs from a differential equation primarily through a change of variable substituting the function by its derivative, however this is not the case when the integral is taken over an open surface
** An integro-differential equation is a functional equation involving both the derivatives and the antiderivatives of the unknown functions. For functions of one variable, such an equation differs from integral and differential equations through a similar change of variable. 
** A functional differential equation of delay differential equation is a function equation involving derivatives of the unknown functions, evaluated at multiple points, such as formula_33
** A difference equation is an equation where the unknown is a function &quot;f&quot; that occurs in the equation through &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;−1), ..., &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;−&quot;k&quot;), for some whole integer &quot;k&quot; called the &quot;order&quot; of the equation. If &quot;x&quot; is restricted to be an integer, a difference equation is the same as a recurrence relation
** A stochastic differential equation is a differential equation in which one or more of the terms is a stochastic process

<text>Ethical naturalism (also called moral naturalism or naturalistic cognitivistic definism) is the meta-ethical view which claims that:

# Ethical sentences express propositions.
# Some such propositions are true.
# Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world.
# These moral features of the world &quot;are&quot; reducible to some set of non-moral features.

==Overview==
The versions of ethical naturalism which have received the most sustained philosophical interest, for example, Cornell realism, differ from the position that &quot;the way things are is always the way they ought to be&quot;, which few ethical naturalists hold. Ethical naturalism does, however, reject the fact-value distinction: it suggests that inquiry into the natural world can increase our moral knowledge in just the same way it increases our scientific knowledge. Indeed, proponents of ethical naturalism have argued that humanity needs to invest in the science of morality, a broad and loosely defined field that uses evidence from biology, primatology, anthropology, psychology, neuroscience, and other areas to classify and describe moral behavior.

Ethical naturalism encompasses any reduction of ethical properties, such as &#x27;goodness&#x27;, to non-ethical properties; there are many different examples of such reductions, and thus many different varieties of ethical naturalism. Hedonism, for example, is the view that goodness is ultimately just pleasure.

==Ethical theories that can be naturalistic==
*Altruism
*Consequentialism
*Consequentialist libertarianism
*Cornell realism
*Ethical egoism/ Objectivism
*Evolutionary ethics
*Hedonism
*Humanistic ethics
*Natural law
*Natural-rights libertarianism
*Utilitarianism
*Virtue ethics

==Criticisms==
Ethical naturalism has been criticized most prominently by ethical non-naturalist G. E. Moore, who formulated the open-question argument. Garner and Rosen say that a common definition of &quot;natural property&quot; is one &quot;which can be discovered by sense observation or experience, experiment, or through any of the available means of science.&quot; They also say that a good definition of &quot;natural property&quot; is problematic but that &quot;it is only in criticism of naturalism, or in an attempt to distinguish between naturalistic and nonnaturalistic definist theories, that such a concept is needed.&quot; R. M. Hare also criticised ethical naturalism because of what he considered its fallacious definition of the terms &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;right&#x27;, saying that value-terms being part of our prescriptive moral language are not reducible to descriptive terms: &quot;Value-terms have a special function in language, that of commending; and so they plainly cannot be defined in terms of other words which themselves do not perform this function&quot;.

===Moral nihilism===
Moral nihilists maintain that there are no such entities as objective values or objective moral facts. Proponents of moral science like Ronald A. Lindsay have counter-argued that their way of understanding &quot;morality&quot; as a practical enterprise is the way we ought to have understood it in the first place. He holds the position that the alternative seems to be the elaborate philosophical reduction of the word &quot;moral&quot; into a vacuous, useless term. Lindsay adds that it is important to reclaim the specific word &quot;morality&quot; because of the connotations it holds with many individuals.

==Morality as a science==
Author Sam Harris has argued that we overestimate the relevance of many arguments against the science of morality, arguments he believes scientists happily and rightly disregard in other domains of science like physics. For example, scientists may find themselves attempting to argue against philosophical skeptics, when Harris says they should be practically asking – as they would in any other domain – &quot;why would we listen to a solipsist in the first place?&quot; This, Harris contends, is part of what it means to practice a science of morality.

In modern times, many thinkers discussing the fact–value distinction and the is–ought problem have settled on the idea that one cannot derive &quot;ought&quot; from &quot;is&quot;. Conversely, Harris maintains that the fact-value distinction is a confusion, proposing that values are really a certain kind of fact. Specifically, Harris suggests that values amount to empirical statements about &quot;the flourishing of conscious creatures in a society&quot;. He argues that there are objective answers to moral questions, even if some are difficult or impossible to possess in practice. In this way, he says, science can tell us what to value. Harris adds that we do not demand absolute certainty from predictions in physics, so we should not demand that of a science studying morality (see &quot;The Moral Landscape&quot;).

Physicist Sean Carroll believes that conceiving of morality as a science could be a case of scientific imperialism and insists that what is &quot;good for conscious creatures&quot; is not an adequate working definition of &quot;moral&quot;. In opposition, John Shook, vice president of the Center for Inquiry, claims that this working definition is more than adequate for science at present and that disagreement should not immobilize the scientific study of ethics.

<text>Ethical non-naturalism (or moral non-naturalism) is the meta-ethical view which claims that:
# Ethical sentences express propositions.
# Some such propositions are true.
# Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world, independent of human opinion.
# These moral features of the world are &quot;not&quot; reducible to any set of non-moral features.

This makes ethical non-naturalism a non-definist form of moral realism, which is in turn a form of cognitivism. Ethical non-naturalism stands in opposition to ethical naturalism, which claims that moral terms and properties are reducible to non-moral terms and properties, as well as to all forms of moral anti-realism, including ethical subjectivism (which denies that moral propositions refer to objective facts), error theory (which denies that any moral propositions are true), and non-cognitivism (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all).

==Definitions and examples==
According to G. E. Moore, &quot;Goodness is a simple, undefinable, non-natural property.&quot; To call goodness &quot;non-natural&quot; does not mean that it is supernatural or divine. It does mean, however, that goodness cannot be reduced to natural properties such as needs, wants or pleasures. Moore also stated that a reduction of ethical properties to a divine command would be the same as stating their naturalness. This would be an example of what he referred to as &quot;the naturalistic fallacy.&quot;

Moore claimed that goodness is &quot;indefinable&quot;, i.e., it cannot be defined in any other terms. This is the central claim of non-naturalism. Thus, the meaning of sentences containing the word &quot;good&quot; cannot be explained entirely in terms of sentences not containing the word &quot;good.&quot; One cannot substitute words referring to pleasure, needs or anything else in place of &quot;good.&quot;

Some properties, such as hardness, roundness and dampness, are clearly natural properties. We encounter them in the real world and can perceive them. On the other hand, other properties, such as being good and being right, are not so obvious. A great novel is considered to be a good thing; goodness may be said to be a property of that novel. Paying one&#x27;s debts and telling the truth are generally held to be right things to do; rightness may be said to be a property of certain human actions.

However, these two types of property are quite different. Those natural properties, such as hardness and roundness, can be perceived and encountered in the real world. On the other hand, it is not immediately clear how to physically see, touch or measure the goodness of a novel or the rightness of an action.

==A difficult question==
Moore did not consider goodness and rightness to be natural properties, i.e., they cannot be defined in terms of any natural properties. How, then, can we know that anything is good and how can we distinguish good from bad? 

Moral epistemology, the part of epistemology (and/or ethics) that studies how we know moral facts and how moral beliefs are justified, has proposed an answer. British epistemologists, following Moore, suggested that humans have a special faculty, a faculty of moral intuition, which tells us what is good and bad, right and wrong. 

Ethical intuitionists assert that, if we see a good person or a right action, and our faculty of moral intuition is sufficiently developed and unimpaired, we simply intuit that the person is good or that the action is right. Moral intuition is supposed to be a mental process different from other, more familiar faculties like sense-perception, and that moral judgments are its outputs. When someone judges something to be good, or some action to be right, then the person is using the faculty of moral intuition. The faculty is attuned to those non-natural properties. Perhaps the best ordinary notion that approximates moral intuition would be the idea of a conscience.

==Another argument for non-naturalism==
Moore also introduced what is called the open-question argument, a position he later rejected. 

Suppose a definition of &quot;good&quot; is &quot;pleasure-causing.&quot; In other words, if something is good, it causes pleasure; if it causes pleasure, then it is, by definition, good. Moore asserted, however, that we could always ask, &quot;But are pleasure-causing things good?&quot; This would always be an open question. There is no foregone conclusion that, indeed, pleasure-causing things are good. 
In his initial argument, Moore concluded that any similar definition of goodness could be criticized in the same way.

<doc id="9288" wikidata="Q303" url="?curid=9288" title="Elvis Presley">
<text>Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Known as the &quot;King of Rock and Roll&quot;, he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Presley&#x27;s energized performances and interpretations of songs, and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great success and initial controversy.

Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi; his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was 13. His music career began there in 1954, at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley&#x27;s classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who managed him for the rest of his career. Presley&#x27;s first RCA Victor single, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the US. Within a year, RCA Victor sold ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; though his performing style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of white American youth.

In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. Drafted into military service in 1958, he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley&#x27;s most famous films included &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; (1957), &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; (1961), and &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special &quot;Elvis&quot;, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, &quot;Aloha from Hawaii&quot;. Years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.

Presley is one of the best-selling music artists in history, with estimated sales of over 500 million records worldwide. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rock and roll, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. He won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He holds several records, including the most RIAA-certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

== Life and career ==
=== 1935–1953: early years ===

Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys Love () and Vernon Presley. Elvis&#x27; twin Jesse Garon was delivered 35 minutes before, stillborn. Presley became close to both parents, especially his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, and the family often relied on neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check and was jailed for eight months.

In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as &quot;average&quot;. His first public performance was a singing contest at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, when he was 10; he sang &quot;Old Shep&quot; and recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he received guitar lessons from two uncles and a pastor at the family&#x27;s church. Presley recalled, &quot;I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it.&quot;

In September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade. The following year, he began singing and playing his guitar at school. He was often teased as a &quot;trashy&quot; kid who played hillbilly music. Presley was a devotee of Mississippi Slim&#x27;s radio show. He was described as &quot;crazy about music&quot; by Slim&#x27;s younger brother, one of Presley&#x27;s classmates. Slim showed Presley chord techniques. When his protégé was 12, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time but performed the following week.

In November 1948, the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee. Enrolled at L. C. Humes High School, Presley received a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher said he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar and sang a recent hit, &quot;Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me&quot;. He was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally bullied by classmates for being a &quot;mama&#x27;s boy&quot;. In 1950, Presley began practicing guitar under the tutelage of Lee Denson, a neighbor. They and three other boys, including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette—formed a loose musical collective.

During his junior year, Presley began to stand out among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew his sideburns and styled his hair. He would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis&#x27; thriving blues scene, and admire the wild, flashy clothes at Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes. He competed in Humes&#x27; Annual &quot;Minstrel&quot; Show in 1953, singing and playing &quot;Till I Waltz Again with You&quot;, a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: I wasn&#x27;t popular in school ... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage, I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, &#x27;cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.

Presley, who could not read music, played by ear and frequented record stores that provided jukeboxes and listening booths. He knew all of Hank Snow&#x27;s songs, and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Ted Daffan, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmie Davis, and Bob Wills. The Southern gospel singer Jake Hess, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style. Presley was a regular audience member at the monthly, all-night singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American spirituals. Presley listened to regional radio stations, such as WDIA, that played what were then called &quot;race records&quot;: spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy rhythm and blues. Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences. Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas. B.B. King recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street. By the time he graduated high school in June 1953, Presley had singled out music as his future.

=== 1953–1956: first recordings ===
==== Sam Phillips and Sun records ====
In August 1953, Presley checked into Memphis Recording Service, the company run by Sam Phillips before he started Sun Records. He aimed to pay for studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: &quot;My Happiness&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s When Your Heartaches Begin&quot;. He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he &quot;sounded like&quot;. Biographer Peter Guralnick argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun—&quot;I&#x27;ll Never Stand in Your Way&quot; and &quot;It Wouldn&#x27;t Be the Same Without You&quot;—but again nothing came of it. Not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows, and another for the band of Eddie Bond.

Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, &quot;Without You&quot;, that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield &quot;Scotty&quot; Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work with Presley for a recording session. The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;. Moore recalled, &quot;All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them.&quot; Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips played &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; on his &quot;Red, Hot, and Blue&quot; show. Listener interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass song, Bill Monroe&#x27;s &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;, again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed &quot;slapback&quot;. A single was pressed with &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; on the A-side and &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot; on the reverse.

==== Early live performances and RCA Victor contract ====
The trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954. Later that month, they appeared at the Overton Park Shell, with Slim Whitman headlining. Here Elvis pioneered &quot;Rubber legs&quot;, his signature dance movement. A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: His wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming. Moore recalled, &quot;During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mic and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild.&quot;

Soon after, Moore and Black left their old band to play with Presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter Bob Neal became the trio&#x27;s manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle&#x27;s Nest club, a dance venue in Memphis. When Presley played, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house western swing band resumed. Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, &quot;His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He&#x27;d do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick.&quot; Amid these live performances, Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions. Presley made what would be his only appearance on Nashville&#x27;s &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; on October 2; &quot;Opry&quot; manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was &quot;not bad&quot; but did not suit the program.

==== &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;, radio commercial, and first television performances ====
In November 1954, Presley performed on &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;—the &quot;Opry&quot;″s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. His nervous first set drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response. Soon after the show, the &quot;Hayride&quot; engaged Presley for a year&#x27;s worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8, he purchased a Martin instrument for $175 () and his trio began playing in new locales, including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas. Presley made his first television appearance on the KSLA-TV broadcast of &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;. Soon after, he failed an audition for &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; on the CBS television network. By early 1955, Presley&#x27;s regular &quot;Hayride&quot; appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star.

In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed the top country star Eddy Arnold, Parker was working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snow&#x27;s February tour.

By August, Sun had released 10 sides credited to &quot;Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill&quot;; the latest recordings included a drummer. Some of the songs, like &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;, were in what one Memphis journalist described as the &quot;R&amp;B idiom of negro field jazz&quot;; others, like &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;, were &quot;more in the country field&quot;, &quot;but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both&quot;. This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley&#x27;s music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&amp;B stations would touch him because &quot;he sounded too much like a hillbilly.&quot; The blend came to be known as &quot;rockabilly&quot;. At the time, Presley was billed as &quot;The King of Western Bop&quot;, &quot;The Hillbilly Cat&quot;, and &quot;The Memphis Flash&quot;.

Presley renewed Neal&#x27;s management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser. The group maintained an extensive touring schedule. Neal recalled, &quot;It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we&#x27;d have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody&#x27;d always try to take a crack at him.&quot; The trio became a quartet when &quot;Hayride&quot; drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.

At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year&#x27;s most promising male artist. After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire Presley&#x27;s Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000. Presley, aged 20, was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract. Parker arranged with the owners of Hill &amp; Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of their customary royalties in exchange for having Presley perform their compositions. By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month&#x27;s end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.

=== 1956–1958: commercial breakout and controversy ===
==== First national TV appearances and debut album ====

On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA Victor in Nashville. Extending his by-now customary backup of Moore, Black, Fontana, and &quot;Hayride&quot; pianist Floyd Cramer—who had been performing at live club dates with Presley—RCA Victor enlisted guitarist Chet Atkins and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet. The session produced the moody &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, released as a single on January 27. Parker brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Stage Show&quot; for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York City, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. After his first appearance on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victor&#x27;s New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins&#x27; rockabilly anthem &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;. In February, Presley&#x27;s &quot;I Forgot to Remember to Forget&quot;, a Sun recording released the previous August, reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Neal&#x27;s contract was terminated and Parker became Presley&#x27;s manager.

RCA Victor released Presley&#x27;s self-titled debut album on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks included two country songs, a bouncy pop tune, and what would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll: &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;—&quot;an improvement over Perkins&#x27; in almost every way&quot;, according to critic Robert Hilburn—and three R&amp;B numbers that had been part of Presley&#x27;s stage repertoire, covers of Little Richard, Ray Charles, and The Drifters. As described by Hilburn, these were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists ... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&amp;B versions of songs in the &#x27;50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases. It became the first rock and roll album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, a position it held for ten weeks. While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album&#x27;s cover image, &quot;of Elvis having the time of his life on stage &quot;with a guitar in his hands&quot; played a crucial role in positioning the guitar ... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.&quot;

==== &quot;Milton Berle Show&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; ====

On April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;. His performance, on the deck of the USS &quot;Hancock&quot; in San Diego, California, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates. A few days later, Presley and his band were flying to Nashville, Tennessee, for a recording session when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas. Twelve weeks after its original release, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; became Presley&#x27;s first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests, &quot;like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party&quot;, a &quot;Newsweek&quot; critic wrote. Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures. He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, covering 15 cities in as many days. He had attended several shows by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys in Vegas and was struck by their cover of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, a hit in 1953 for blues singer Big Mama Thornton by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It became his new closing number.

After a show in La Crosse, Wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese&#x27;s newspaper was sent to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. It warned that Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States. ... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth. ... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley&#x27;s room at the auditorium. ... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls ... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley&#x27;s autograph.

Presley&#x27;s second &quot;Milton Berle Show&quot; appearance came on June 5 at NBC&#x27;s Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. Milton Berle persuaded Presley to leave his guitar backstage. During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an up-tempo rendition of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with exaggerated body movements. His gyrations created a storm of controversy. Jack Gould of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability. ... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner&#x27;s aria in a bathtub. ... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body ... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway. Ben Gross of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; opined that popular music &quot;has reached its lowest depths in the &#x27;grunt and groin&#x27; antics of one Elvis Presley. ... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis ... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos&quot;. Ed Sullivan, whose variety show was the nation&#x27;s most popular, declared Presley &quot;unfit for family viewing&quot;. To Presley&#x27;s displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as &quot;Elvis the Pelvis&quot;, which he called &quot;childish&quot;.

==== &quot;Steve Allen Show&quot; and first Sullivan appearance ====

The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in New York. Allen, who was no fan of rock and roll, introduced a &quot;new Elvis&quot; in a white bowtie and black tails. Presley sang &quot;Hound Dog&quot; for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bowtie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, &quot;Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd ... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition&quot;. Allen later wrote that he found Presley&#x27;s &quot;strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing&quot; and worked him into the &quot;comedy fabric&quot; of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I&#x27;m going to go along, but I won&#x27;t be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance.&quot; Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. Later that night, he appeared on &quot;Hy Gardner Calling&quot;, a popular local television show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism of him, Presley responded, &quot;No, I haven&#x27;t ... I don&#x27;t see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it&#x27;s only music. ... how would rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?&quot;

The next day, Presley recorded &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, &quot;Any Way You Want Me&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;. The Jordanaires sang harmony, as they had on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, Presley made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis, at which he announced, &quot;You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I&#x27;m gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight.&quot; In August, a judge in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order. The single pairing &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; with &quot;Hound Dog&quot; ruled the top of the charts for eleven weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years. Recording sessions for Presley&#x27;s second album took place in Hollywood in early September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, contributed &quot;Love Me&quot;.

Allen&#x27;s show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in the ratings. Sullivan booked Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000. The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 82.6 percent of the television audience. Actor Charles Laughton hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan was recovering from a car accident. According to legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows, Sullivan had opined that Presley &quot;got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants—so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock. ... I think it&#x27;s a Coke bottle. ... We just can&#x27;t have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!&quot; Sullivan publicly told &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots.&quot; In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted with screams. Presley&#x27;s performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, prompted a record-shattering million advance orders. More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; that made Presley a national celebrity.

Accompanying Presley&#x27;s rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the &quot;biggest pop craze&quot; since Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed. ... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.

==== Crazed crowds and film debut ====
The audience response at Presley&#x27;s live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled, &quot;He&#x27;d start out, &#x27;You ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but a Hound Dog,&#x27; and they&#x27;d just go to pieces. They&#x27;d always react the same way. There&#x27;d be a riot every time.&quot; At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, fifty National Guardsmen were added to the police detail to prevent a ruckus. &quot;Elvis&quot;, Presley&#x27;s second RCA Victor album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one. The album includes &quot;Old Shep&quot;, which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA Victor session. According to Guralnick, &quot;the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm&quot; showed &quot;the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique.&quot; Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley&#x27;s recordings from &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; through &quot;Elvis&quot;, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that &quot;these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock &amp; roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become.&quot;
Presley returned to &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy. His first motion picture, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, was released on November 21. Though he was not top-billed, the film&#x27;s original title—&quot;The Reno Brothers&quot;—was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley&#x27;s popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office. Presley received top billing on every subsequent film he made.

On December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records, where Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis were recording, and had an impromptu jam session along with Johnny Cash. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for twenty-five years, became known as the &quot;Million Dollar Quartet&quot; recordings. The year ended with a front-page story in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales, and &quot;Billboard&quot;″s declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted. In his first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry&#x27;s largest company, Presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the label&#x27;s singles sales.

==== Leiber and Stoller collaboration and draft notice ====
Presley made his third and final &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; appearance on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity. In any event, as critic Greil Marcus describes, Presley &quot;did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in &quot;The Sheik&quot;, with all stops out.&quot; To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan&#x27;s wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot;. At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley &quot;a real decent, fine boy&quot;. Two days later, the Memphis draft board announced that Presley would be classified 1-A and would probably be drafted sometime that year.

Each of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: &quot;Too Much&quot;, &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, and &quot;(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear&quot;. Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released: &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that pressings of his music on discarded X-ray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad. Presley purchased his 18-room mansion, Graceland, on March 19, 1957. Before the purchase, Elvis recorded &quot;Loving You&quot;—the soundtrack to his second film, which was released in July. It was his third straight number-one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, Presley&#x27;s next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the &quot;Jailhouse&quot; sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his &quot;good-luck charm&quot;. &quot;He was fast,&quot; said Leiber. &quot;Any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes.&quot; The title track became another number-one hit, as was the &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; EP.
Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that &quot;the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you&#x27;re liable to get killed&quot;. Villanova students pelted the singer with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the show ended, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had inspired the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, decried rock and roll as &quot;brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.&quot; Asked for a response, Presley said: I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn&#x27;t have said it. ... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.

Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of &quot;Elvis&#x27; Christmas Album&quot;. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley&#x27;s request: &quot;Santa Claus Is Back in Town&quot;, an innuendo-laden blues. The holiday release stretched Presley&#x27;s string of number-one albums to four and became the best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States, with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide. After the session, Moore and Black—drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley&#x27;s massive financial success—resigned, though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later.

On December 20, Presley received his draft notice, though he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film &quot;King Creole&quot;. A couple of weeks into the new year, &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;, another Leiber and Stoller tune, became Presley&#x27;s tenth number-one seller. Recording sessions for the &quot;King Creole&quot; soundtrack were held in Hollywood in mid-January 1958. Leiber and Stoller provided three songs, but it would be the last time Presley and the duo worked closely together. As Stoller later recalled, Presley&#x27;s manager and entourage sought to wall him off. A brief soundtrack session on February 11 marked the final occasion on which Black was to perform with Presley.

=== 1958–1960: military service and mother&#x27;s death ===
On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the United States Army at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers accompanied him into the installation. Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military service, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else.

Between March 28 and September 17, 1958, Presley completed basic and advanced training at Fort Hood, Texas, where he was temporarily assigned to Company A, 2d Medium Tank Battalion, 37th Armor. During the two weeks&#x27; leave between his basic and advanced training in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, Presley&#x27;s mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley was granted emergency leave to visit her and arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure at age 46. Presley was devastated and never the same; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.
On October 1, 1958, Presley was assigned to the 1st Medium Tank Battalion, 32d Armor, 3d Armored Division, at Ray Barracks, West Germany, where he served as an armor intelligence specialist. On November 27, he was promoted to private first class and on June 1, 1959, to specialist fourth class. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines and became &quot;practically evangelical about their benefits&quot;, not only for energy but for &quot;strength&quot; and weight loss. Karate became a lifelong interest: he studied with Jürgen Seydel, and later included it in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley&#x27;s wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased television sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit. Presley was promoted to sergeant on February 11, 1960.

While in Bad Nauheim, Presley, aged 24, met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu. They married after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24 months in the military would ruin his career. In Special Services, he would have been able to perform and remain in touch with the public, but Parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect, he should serve as a regular soldier. Media reports echoed Presley&#x27;s concerns about his career, but RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared: armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases. Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top-40 hits, including &quot;Wear My Ring Around Your Neck&quot;, the bestselling &quot;Hard Headed Woman&quot;, and &quot;One Night&quot; in 1958, and &quot;(Now and Then There&#x27;s) A Fool Such as I&quot; and the number-one &quot;A Big Hunk o&#x27; Love&quot; in 1959. RCA Victor also generated four albums compiling previously issued material during this period, most successfully &quot;Elvis&#x27; Golden Records&quot; (1958), which hit number three on the LP chart.

=== 1960–1968: focus on films ===
==== &quot;Elvis Is Back&quot; ====

Presley returned to the U.S. on March 2, 1960, and was honorably discharged three days later. The train that carried him from New Jersey to Tennessee was mobbed all the way, and Presley was called upon to appear at scheduled stops to please his fans. On the night of March 20, he entered RCA&#x27;s Nashville studio to cut tracks for a new album along with a single, &quot;Stuck on You&quot;, which was rushed into release and swiftly became a number-one hit. Another Nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of bestselling singles, the ballads &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never&quot; and &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight?&quot;, along with the rest of &quot;Elvis Is Back!&quot; The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of Chicago blues &quot;menace, driven by Presley&#x27;s own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from Boots Randolph. Elvis&#x27; singing wasn&#x27;t sexy, it was pornographic.&quot; The record &quot;conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things&quot;, according to music historian John Robertson: &quot;a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [a] raucous rocker&quot;. Released only days after recording was complete, it reached number two on the album chart.
Presley returned to television on May 12 as a guest on &quot;The Frank Sinatra Timex Special&quot;. Also known as &quot;Welcome Home Elvis&quot;, the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.

&quot;G.I. Blues&quot;, the soundtrack to Presley&#x27;s first film since his return, was a number-one album in October. His first LP of sacred material, &quot;His Hand in Mine&quot;, followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for 24 local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records. A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Something for Everybody&quot;. According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the Nashville sound, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that defined country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley over the next half-decade, the album is largely &quot;a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis&#x27; birthright&quot;. It was his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, for a Pearl Harbor memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was Presley&#x27;s last public performance for seven years.

==== Lost in Hollywood ====
Parker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted musical comedies. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein—&quot;Flaming Star&quot; (1960) and &quot;Wild in the Country&quot; (1961)—were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions. His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a &quot;pantheon of bad taste&quot;. Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. Hal Wallis, who produced nine, declared, &quot;A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood.&quot;

Of Presley&#x27;s films in the 1960s, 15 were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films&#x27; rapid production and release schedules—Presley frequently starred in three a year—affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: &quot;three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie&quot;. As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew &quot;progressively worse&quot;. Julie Parrish, who appeared in &quot;Paradise, Hawaiian Style&quot; (1966), says that Presley disliked many of the songs. The Jordanaires&#x27; Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone: &quot;The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn&#x27;t sing it.&quot; Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. But by and large, according to biographer Jerry Hopkins, the numbers seemed to be &quot;written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll&quot;.

In the first half of the decade, three of Presley&#x27;s soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; (1961) and &quot;Return to Sender&quot; (1962). However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 to 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot; (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of &quot;Pot Luck&quot; and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot; (1967). It won him his first Grammy Award, for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was &quot;arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock &amp; roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs&quot;.

Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks continued. It was not until October 1967, when the &quot;Clambake&quot; soundtrack LP registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA Victor executives recognized a problem. &quot;By then, of course, the damage had been done&quot;, as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. &quot;Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans.&quot;

=== 1968–1973: Comeback ===
==== &quot;Elvis&quot;: the &#x27;68 Comeback Special ====
Presley&#x27;s only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, &quot;Speedway&quot;, would rank at number 82. Parker had already shifted his plans to television: he maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.

Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called &quot;Elvis&quot;, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the &quot;&#x27;68 Comeback Special&quot;, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley&#x27;s first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC&#x27;s highest-rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of &quot;Eye&quot; magazine remarked: There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy. Marsh calls the performance one of &quot;emotional grandeur and historical resonance&quot;.

By January 1969, the single &quot;If I Can Dream&quot;, written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, the special reminded Presley of what &quot;he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack. ... He was out of prison, man.&quot; Binder said of Presley&#x27;s reaction, &quot;I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, &#x27;Steve, it&#x27;s the greatest thing I&#x27;ve ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don&#x27;t believe in.

==== &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot; and the International ====

Buoyed by the experience of the &quot;Comeback Special&quot;, Presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at American Sound Studio, which led to the acclaimed &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot;. Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is &quot;a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement.&quot; The album featured the hit single &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;, issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart—Presley&#x27;s first non-gospel top ten hit since &quot;Bossa Nova Baby&quot; in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Daddy&quot;, and &quot;Kentucky Rain&quot;.

Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the &quot;Comeback Special&quot;, offers came in from around the world. The London Palladium offered Parker () for a one-week engagement. He responded, &quot;That&#x27;s fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?&quot; In May, the brand-new International Hotel in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, booked Presley for fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist James Burton and including two gospel groups, The Imperials and Sweet Inspirations. Costume designer Bill Belew, responsible for the intense leather styling of the &quot;Comeback Special&quot;, created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by his passion for karate. Nonetheless, Presley was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker oversaw a major promotional push, and International Hotel owner Kirk Kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.

Presley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; (which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life). At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as &quot;The King&quot;, Presley gestured toward Fats Domino, who was taking in the scene. &quot;No,&quot; Presley said, &quot;that&#x27;s the real king of rock and roll.&quot; The next day, Parker&#x27;s negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million. &quot;Newsweek&quot; commented, &quot;There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Presley &quot;supernatural, his own resurrection&quot;. In November, Presley&#x27;s final non-concert film, &quot;Change of Habit&quot;, opened. The double album &quot;From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis&quot; came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; reached the top of the charts—Presley&#x27;s first U.S. pop number-one in over seven years, and his last.

Cassandra Peterson, later television&#x27;s Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas. She recalled of their encounter, &quot;He was so anti-drug when I met him. I mentioned to him that I smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled.&quot; Presley also rarely drank—several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.

==== Back on tour and meeting Nixon ====
Presley returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the year&#x27;s two-month-long engagements, performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album &quot;On Stage&quot;. In late February, Presley performed six attendance-record–breaking shows at the Houston Astrodome. In April, the single &quot;The Wonder of You&quot; was issued—a number one hit in the UK, it topped the U.S. adult contemporary chart as well. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary &quot;&quot;. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless () was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge. The FBI took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows. Presley went onstage with a Derringer in his right boot and a .45 caliber pistol in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.

&quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot;, produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, The authority of Presley&#x27;s singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&amp;B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis. After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the South, his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the West Coast, followed in November.
On December 21, 1970, Presley engineered a meeting with U.S. President Richard Nixon at the White House, where he explained how he believed he could reach out to the hippies to help combat the drug culture he and the president abhorred. He asked Nixon for a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge, to signify official sanction of his efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was, therefore, important that he &quot;retain his credibility&quot;. Presley told Nixon that the Beatles, whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era, exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti-Americanism. Presley and his friends previously had a four-hour get-together with the Beatles at his home in Bel Air, California, in August 1965. Paul McCartney later said that he &quot;felt a bit betrayed. ... The great joke was that we were taking [illegal] drugs, and look what happened to him&quot;, a reference to Presley&#x27;s early death linked to prescription drug abuse.

The U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce named Presley one of its annual Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation on January 16, 1971. Not long after, the City of Memphis named the stretch of Highway 51 South on which Graceland is located &quot;Elvis Presley Boulevard&quot;. The same year, Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (then known as the Bing Crosby Award). Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were released in 1971. Best received by critics was &quot;Elvis Country&quot;, a concept record that focused on genre standards. The biggest seller was &quot;Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas&quot;. According to Greil Marcus, In the midst of ten painfully genteel Christmas songs, every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility, one could find Elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot;, a raunchy old Charles Brown blues.[...] If [Presley&#x27;s] sin was his lifelessness, it was his sinfulness that brought him to life.

==== Marriage breakdown and &quot;Aloha from Hawaii&quot; ====
MGM filmed Presley in April 1972 for &quot;Elvis on Tour&quot;, which went on to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary Film for that year&#x27;s Golden Globe Awards. His gospel album &quot;He Touched Me&quot;, released that month, would earn him his second Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance. A fourteen-date tour commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. The evening concert on July 10 was issued in LP form a week later. &quot;&quot; became one of Presley&#x27;s biggest-selling albums. After the tour, the single &quot;Burning Love&quot; was released—Presley&#x27;s last top ten hit on the U.S. pop chart. &quot;The most exciting single Elvis has made since &#x27;All Shook Up, wrote rock critic Robert Christgau.

Presley and his wife had become increasingly distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair he had with Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion. He often raised the possibility of Joyce moving into Graceland. The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with Mike Stone, a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her. Priscilla related that when she told him, Presley forcefully made love to her, declaring, &quot;This is how a real man makes love to his woman&quot;. She later stated in an interview that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident, and said it had been an overstatement. Five months later, Presley&#x27;s new girlfriend, Linda Thompson, a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty queen, moved in with him. Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18. According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials, the failure of Presley&#x27;s marriage &quot;was a blow from which he never recovered&quot;. At a rare press conference that June, a reporter had asked Presley whether he was satisfied with his image. Presley replied, &quot;Well, the image is one thing and the human being another ... it&#x27;s very hard to live up to an image.&quot;
In January 1973, Presley performed two benefit concerts for the Kui Lee Cancer Fund in connection with a groundbreaking television special, &quot;Aloha from Hawaii&quot;, which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally. The first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. On January 14, &quot;Aloha from Hawaii&quot; aired live via satellite to prime-time audiences in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as to U.S. servicemen based across Southeast Asia. In Japan, where it capped a nationwide Elvis Presley Week, it smashed viewing records. The next night, it was simulcast to twenty-eight European countries, and in April an extended version aired in the U.S., receiving a fifty-seven percent share of the TV audience. Over time, Parker&#x27;s claim that it was seen by one billion or more people would be broadly accepted, but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention. Presley&#x27;s stage costume became the most recognized example of the elaborate concert garb with which his latter-day persona became closely associated. As described by Bobbie Ann Mason, &quot;At the end of the show, when he spreads out his American Eagle cape, with the full stretched wings of the eagle studded on the back, he becomes a god figure.&quot; The accompanying double album, released in February, went to number one and eventually sold over 5 million copies in the U.S. It was Presley&#x27;s last U.S. number-one pop album during his lifetime.

At a midnight show that same month, four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack. Security personnel came to Presley&#x27;s defense, and he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, Presley became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, Presley raged, &quot;There&#x27;s too much pain in me ... Stone [must] die.&quot; His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, Red West, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, &quot;Aw hell, let&#x27;s just leave it for now. Maybe it&#x27;s a bit heavy.&quot;
=== 1973–1977: health deterioration and death ===
==== Medical crises and last studio sessions ====

Presley&#x27;s divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973. He and Priscilla would remain close friends until his death, even holding hands while leaving the courtroom where they finalized their divorce. Priscilla recalled that they lived life together &quot;like we were never divorced. Elvis and I still hugged each other, still had love. We would say, &#x27;Mommy said this&#x27; and &#x27;Daddy said that.&#x27; That helped Lisa to feel stable. There was never any arguing or bitterness.&quot; By this time, his health was in serious decline. Twice during the year he overdosed on barbiturates, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. In late 1973, he was hospitalized from the effects of a pethidine addiction. According to his primary care physician, George C. Nichopoulos, Presley &quot;felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn&#x27;t the common everyday junkie getting something off the street&quot;. Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever. Despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974.

Presley&#x27;s condition declined precipitously that September. Keyboardist Tony Brown remembered his arrival at a University of Maryland concert: &quot;He fell out of the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, &#x27;Don&#x27;t help me.&#x27; He walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody&#x27;s looking at each other like, &#x27;Is the tour gonna happen&#x27;?&quot; Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled: He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up. ... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible. ... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions.

On July 13, 1976, Vernon Presley—who had become deeply involved in his son&#x27;s financial affairs—had fired &quot;Memphis Mafia&quot; bodyguards Red West (Presley&#x27;s friend since the 1950s), Sonny West, and David Hebler, citing the need to &quot;cut back on expenses&quot;. Presley was in Palm Springs at the time, and some suggest the singer was too cowardly to face the three himself. Another associate of Presley&#x27;s, John O&#x27;Grady, argued that the bodyguards were dropped because their rough treatment of fans had prompted too many lawsuits. Presley&#x27;s stepbrother David Stanley has claimed that the bodyguards were fired because they were becoming more outspoken about Presley&#x27;s drug dependency.

RCA began to grow anxious as his interest in the recording studio waned. After a session in December 1973 that produced eighteen songs, enough for almost two albums, Presley made no official studio recordings in 1974. Parker delivered RCA another concert record, &quot;Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis&quot;. Recorded on March 20, it included a version of &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot; that won Presley his third and final Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance. All three of his competitive Grammy winsout of fourteen total nominationswere for gospel recordings. Presley returned to the recording studio in March 1975, but Parker&#x27;s attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful. In 1976, RCA sent a mobile recording unit to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions, but the recording process had become a struggle for him.

==== Final months and death ====
After Presley&#x27;s relationship with Linda Thompson ended, he began dating Ginger Alden in November 1976; he proposed marriage to Alden two months later.

Journalist Tony Scherman wrote that, by early 1977, &quot;Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Grossly overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopoeia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts.&quot; According to Andy Greene of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Presley&#x27;s final performances were mostly &quot;sad, sloppy affairs where a bloated, drugged Presley struggled to remember his lyrics and get through the night without collapsing ... Most everything from the final three years of his life is sad and hard to watch.&quot; In Alexandria, Louisiana, he was on stage for less than an hour and &quot;was impossible to understand&quot;. On March 31, he canceled a performance in Baton Rouge, unable to get out of his hotel bed; four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled.

Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, Presley fulfilled most of his touring commitments. According to Guralnick, fans &quot;were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books&quot;. Presley&#x27;s cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how he would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions.

&quot;Way Down&quot;, Presley&#x27;s last single issued during his lifetime, was released on June 6, 1977. That month, CBS taped two concerts for a television special, &quot;Elvis in Concert&quot;, to be broadcast in October. In the first, shot in Omaha on June 19, Presley&#x27;s voice, Guralnick writes, &quot;is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project&quot;. Two days later, in Rapid City, South Dakota, &quot;he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too&quot;, though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was &quot;framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks&quot;. Presley&#x27;s final concert was held in Indianapolis at Market Square Arena, on June 26, 1977.

The book &quot;&quot;, co-written by the three bodyguards fired a year prior, was published on August 1. It was the first exposé to detail Presley&#x27;s years of drug misuse. He was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers. By this point, he suffered from multiple ailments: glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon, each aggravated—and possibly caused—by drug abuse.
On August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of Memphis to Portland, Maine, to begin another tour. That afternoon his fiancée Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at Baptist Memorial Hospital at 3:30 pm; he was 42.

President Jimmy Carter issued a statement that credited Presley with having &quot;permanently changed the face of American popular culture&quot;. Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley&#x27;s cousins, Billy Mann, accepted () to secretly photograph the body; the picture appeared on the cover of the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;″s biggest-selling issue ever. Alden struck a $105,000 () deal with the &quot;Enquirer&quot; for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement. Presley left her nothing in his will.

Presley&#x27;s funeral was held at Graceland on August 18. Outside the gates, a car crashed into a group of fans, killing two young women and critically injuring a third. About 80,000 people lined the processional route to Forest Hill Cemetery, where Presley was buried next to his mother. Within a few weeks, &quot;Way Down&quot; topped the country and UK singles chart. Following an attempt to steal Presley&#x27;s body in late August, the remains of both Presley and his mother were exhumed and reburied in Graceland&#x27;s Meditation Garden on October 2.

==== Cause of death ====
While an autopsy undertaken the same day Presley died was still in progress, Memphis medical examiner Jerry Francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest and declared that &quot;drugs played no role in Presley&#x27;s death&quot;. In fact, &quot;drug use was heavily implicated&quot; in Presley&#x27;s death, writes Guralnick. The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered &quot;anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy&quot;. Lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that polypharmacy was the primary cause of death; one reported &quot;fourteen drugs in Elvis&#x27; system, ten in significant quantity&quot;. In 1979, forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of depressants had resulted in Presley&#x27;s accidental death. Forensic historian and pathologist Michael Baden viewed the situation as complicated: &quot;Elvis had an enlarged heart for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call.&quot;

The competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was cardiac arrhythmia, a condition that can be determined only in a living person; and denied drugs played any part in Presley&#x27;s death before the toxicology results were known. Allegations of a cover-up were widespread. While a 1981 trial of Presley&#x27;s main physician, George C. Nichopoulos, exonerated him of criminal liability, the facts were startling: &quot;In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of sedatives, amphetamines, and narcotics: all in Elvis&#x27; name.&quot; Nichopoulos&#x27; license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.

In 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as Miami-Dade County coroner, declared at its completion, &quot;There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack.&quot; More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff &quot;could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then.&quot; One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital&#x27;s team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached. ... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments.

=== 1977–present: posthumous developments ===
Between 1977 and 1981, six of Presley&#x27;s posthumously released singles were top-ten country hits. Graceland was opened to the public in 1982. Attracting over half a million visitors annually, it became the second-most-visited home in the United States, after the White House. The residence was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2006.

Presley has been inducted into five music halls of fame: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1986), the Country Music Hall of Fame (1998), the Gospel Music Hall of Fame (2001), the Rockabilly Hall of Fame (2007), and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame (2012). In 1984, he received the W. C. Handy Award from the Blues Foundation and the Academy of Country Music&#x27;s first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the American Music Awards&#x27; Award of Merit.

A Junkie XL remix of Presley&#x27;s &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; (credited as &quot;Elvis Vs JXL&quot;) was used in a Nike advertising campaign during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. It topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presley&#x27;s number-one hits, &quot;ELV1S&quot;, which was also an international success. The album returned Presley to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for the first time in almost three decades.

In 2003, a remix of &quot;Rubberneckin&#x27;&quot;, a 1969 recording, topped the U.S. sales chart, as did a 50th-anniversary re-release of &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; the following year. The latter was an outright hit in Britain, debuting at number three on the pop chart; it also made the top ten in Canada. In 2005, another three reissued singles, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, &quot;One Night&quot;/&quot;I Got Stung&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never&quot;, went to number one in the UK. They were part of a campaign that saw the re-release of all eighteen of Presley&#x27;s previous chart-topping UK singles. The first, &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, came with a collectors&#x27; box that made it ineligible to chart again; each of the other seventeen reissues hit the British top five.

In 2005, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine named Presley the top-earning deceased celebrity for the fifth straight year, with a gross income of $45 million. He was placed second in 2006, returned to the top spot the next two years, and ranked fourth in 2009. The following year, he was ranked second, with his highest annual income ever—$60 million—spurred by the celebration of his 75th birthday and the launch of Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s &quot;Viva Elvis&quot; show in Las Vegas. In November 2010, &quot;Viva Elvis: The Album&quot; was released, setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks. As of mid-2011, there were an estimated 15,000 licensed Presley products, and he was again the second-highest-earning deceased celebrity. Six years later, he ranked fourth with earnings of $35 million, up $8 million from 2016 due in part to the opening of a new entertainment complex, Elvis Presley&#x27;s Memphis, and hotel, The Guest House at Graceland.

In 2018, RCA/Legacy released &quot;Elvis Presley – Where No One Stands Alone&quot;, a new album focused on Presley&#x27;s love of gospel music. Produced by Joel Weinshanker, Lisa Marie Presley and Andy Childs, the album introduced newly recorded instrumentation along with vocals from singers who had performed in the past with Elvis. It included a reimagined duet with Lisa Marie, on the album&#x27;s title track.

In 2022, Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s film &quot;Elvis&quot;, a biographical film about Presley&#x27;s life, was released. Presley is portrayed by Austin Butler and Parker by Tom Hanks. As of August 2022, the film had grossed $261.8 million worldwide on a $85 million budget, becoming the second-highest-grossing music biopic of all-time behind &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (2018), and the fifth-highest-grossing Australian-produced film. For his portrayal of Presley, Butler won the Golden Globe and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor. In January 2023, Presley&#x27;s 1962 Lockheed 1329 JetStar sold at an auction for $260,000.

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===
Presley&#x27;s earliest musical influence came from gospel. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, &quot;he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.&quot; In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley&#x27;s future stage act:

As a teenager, Presley&#x27;s musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues, and, as Stoller put it, &quot;He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.&quot; At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, &quot;I know practically every religious song that&#x27;s ever been written.&quot;

=== Musicianship ===
Presley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear. Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA Victor albums. Presley played piano on songs such as &quot;Old Shep&quot; and &quot;First in Line&quot; from his 1956 album &quot;Elvis&quot;. He is credited with playing piano on later albums such as &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot; and &quot;Moody Blue&quot;, and on &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, which was one of the last songs that he recorded. Presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight&quot;. At one point during the &#x27;68 Comeback Special, Elvis took over on lead electric guitar, the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public, playing it on songs such as &quot;Baby What You Want Me to Do&quot; and &quot;One Night&quot;. The album &quot;Elvis is Back!&quot; features Presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as &quot;I Will Be Home Again&quot; and &quot;Like a Baby&quot;.

=== Musical styles and genres ===

Presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. &quot;Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley&#x27;s first release, on the Sun label,&quot; writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander described rockabilly as &quot;essentially ... an Elvis Presley construction&quot;, with the defining elements as &quot;the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country&quot;. In &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;, the Presley trio&#x27;s first record, Scotty Moore&#x27;s guitar solo, &quot;a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion&quot;. While Katherine Charlton calls Presley &quot;rockabilly&#x27;s originator&quot;, Carl Perkins, another pioneer of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, said that &quot;[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn&#x27;t create rockabilly&quot;. According to Michael Campbell, the first major rockabilly song was recorded by Bill Haley. In Moore&#x27;s view, &quot;It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.&quot;

At RCA Victor, Presley&#x27;s rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars, and a tougher, more intense manner. While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard &quot;Blue Moon&quot; at Sun Records to the country ballad &quot;How&#x27;s the World Treating You?&quot; on his second RCA Victor LP to the blues of &quot;Santa Claus Is Back in Town&quot;. In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot;. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history. 
After his return from military service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. His first post-Army single, the number-one hit &quot;Stuck on You&quot;, is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its &quot;mild rock beat&quot;; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it &quot;upbeat pop&quot;. The number five &quot;She&#x27;s Not You&quot; (1962) &quot;integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it&#x27;s practically doo-wop&quot;. The modern blues/R&amp;B sound captured with success on &quot;Elvis Is Back!&quot; was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as &quot;Down in the Alley&quot; and &quot;Hi-Heel Sneakers&quot;. Presley&#x27;s output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight?&quot;, a number-one in 1960. &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never&quot;, which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song &quot;&quot; and concluding with a &quot;full-voiced operatic cadence&quot;. These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.

While Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the &quot;&#x27;68 Comeback Special&quot;, the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become &quot;hard to find&quot;. A significant exception was &quot;Burning Love&quot;, his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley&#x27;s subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk. Much of &quot;Elvis in Memphis&quot;, as well as &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.

=== Vocal style and range ===
The developmental arc of Presley&#x27;s singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from &quot;high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months.&quot; Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the &quot;vocal stutter&quot; on 1955&#x27;s &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Play House&quot;. When on &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, Presley &quot;slides into a &#x27;mmmmm&#x27; that marks the transition between the first two verses,&quot; he shows &quot;how masterful his relaxed style really is.&quot; Marsh describes the vocal performance on &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; as one of &quot;gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing&quot;, with the line Shall I stay&#x27; pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal&quot;.

Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot; &quot;an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions&quot;, as Presley &quot;crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song&#x27;s operatic climax&quot;, becoming &quot;a kind of one-man quartet&quot;. Guralnick finds &quot;Stand by Me&quot; from the same gospel sessions &quot;a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance&quot;, but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on &quot;Where No One Stands Alone&quot;, resorting &quot;to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound&quot; that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley&#x27;s, &quot;he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime.&quot; Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: &quot;The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort.&quot;

Marsh praises his 1968 reading of &quot;U.S. Male&quot;, &quot;bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records.&quot; The performance on &quot;In the Ghetto&quot; is, according to Jorgensen, &quot;devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms&quot;, instead relying on the exceptional &quot;clarity and sensitivity of his voice&quot;. Guralnick describes the song&#x27;s delivery as of &quot;almost translucent eloquence ... so quietly confident in its simplicity&quot;. On &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, Guralnick hears essentially the same &quot;remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise&quot;, but supplemented with &quot;an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)&quot;.

Music critic Henry Pleasants observes that &quot;Presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor. An extraordinary compass ... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion.&quot; He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two octaves and a third, &quot;from the baritone low G to the tenor high B, with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a D-flat. Presley&#x27;s best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down.&quot; In Pleasants&#x27; view, his voice was &quot;variable and unpredictable&quot; at the bottom, &quot;often brilliant&quot; at the top, with the capacity for &quot;full-voiced high Gs and As that an opera baritone might envy&quot;. Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley&#x27;s range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that &quot;his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all.&quot; Presley was always &quot;able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers&quot;, writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.

=== Relationship with the African-American community ===

When Dewey Phillips first aired &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; on Memphis&#x27; WHBQ, many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black. From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;—&quot;bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I&#x27;d be a music man like nobody ever saw.&quot; &quot;The Memphis World&quot;, an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley &quot;cracked Memphis&#x27; segregation laws&quot; by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its &quot;colored night&quot;. Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom. In contrast, many white adults &quot;did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase &#x27;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&#x27;, Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.&quot;

Despite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had announced, &quot;The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes.&quot; A journalist with the national African American weekly &quot;Jet&quot;, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn&#x27;t have said it. ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let&#x27;s face it: I can&#x27;t sing like Fats Domino can. I know that. Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland, reported of Presley, &quot;He showed me every courtesy, and I think he&#x27;s one of the greatest.&quot; Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.

The persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers. Into the twenty-first century, the notion that Presley had &quot;stolen&quot; black music still found adherents. Notable among African-American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, &quot;A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man&#x27;s music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis.&quot; Moreover, Presley acknowledged his debt to African-American musicians throughout his career. Addressing his &#x27;68 Comeback Special audience, he said, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [that].&quot; Nine years earlier, he had said, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues.&quot;

=== Sex symbol ===

Presley&#x27;s physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. &quot;He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful&quot;, according to critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder reported, &quot;I&#x27;m straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you&#x27;re male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn&#x27;t make any difference; if he&#x27;d walked in the room, you&#x27;d know somebody special was in your presence.&quot; His performance style was equally responsible for Presley&#x27;s eroticized image. Critic George Melly described him as &quot;the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl&quot;. In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him with bringing &quot;overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America&quot;. Ed Sullivan&#x27;s declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley&#x27;s trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.

While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;″s Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as &quot;aggressively bisexual in appeal&quot;. Brett Farmer places the &quot;orgasmic gyrations&quot; of the title dance sequence in &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a &quot;spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image&quot;. In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, &quot;Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.&quot;

Reinforcing Presley&#x27;s image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley&#x27;s early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind. Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.

== Legacy ==

Presley&#x27;s rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll&#x27;s occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.

In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, &quot;He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn&#x27;t let black music through. He opened the door for black music.&quot; Al Green reaffirmed that by stating, &quot;He broke the ice for all of us.&quot;

President Jimmy Carter remarked on Presley&#x27;s legacy in 1977: &quot;His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture.&quot; Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was regarded as one of the most famous people in the world.
Presley&#x27;s name, image, and voice are recognized around the world. He has inspired a legion of impersonators. In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans. American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein said, &quot;Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century. He introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything—music, language, clothes.&quot; John Lennon said that &quot;Nothing really affected me until Elvis.&quot; Bob Dylan described the sensation of first hearing Presley as &quot;like busting out of jail&quot;.

For much of his adult life, Presley, with his rise from poverty to riches and fame, had seemed to epitomize the American Dream. In his final years, and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death, he became a symbol of excess and gluttony. Increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich, heavy Southern cooking of his upbringing, foods such as chicken-fried steak and biscuits and gravy. In particular, his love of fried peanut butter, banana, and (sometimes) bacon sandwiches, now known as &quot;Elvis sandwiches&quot;, came to symbolize this characteristic.

Since 1977, there have been numerous alleged sightings of Presley. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death. Adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin, and accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace. An unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to Presley and journey to sites with which he is connected, however faintly. On the anniversary of his death, thousands of people gather outside Graceland for a candlelight ritual. &quot;With Elvis, it is not just his music that has survived death&quot;, writes Ted Harrison. &quot;He himself has been raised, like a medieval saint, to a figure of cultic status. It is as if he has been canonized by acclamation.&quot;

On the 25th anniversary of Presley&#x27;s death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; asserted: All the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force. ... Elvis&#x27; breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.

He was ranked third on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of greatest artists. Bono wrote in appreciation: In Elvis, you have the blueprint for rock &amp; roll. The highness — the gospel highs. The mud — the Delta mud, the blues. Sexual liberation. Controversy. Changing the way people feel about the world. It&#x27;s all there with Elvis.

 Not only Presley&#x27;s achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons. ... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues. ... Elvis has emerged as a great &quot;artist&quot;, a great &quot;rocker&quot;, a great &quot;purveyor of schlock&quot;, a great &quot;heart throb&quot;, a great &quot;bore&quot;, a great &quot;symbol of potency&quot;, a great &quot;ham&quot;, a great &quot;nice person&quot;, and, yes, a great American.

== Achievements ==

Presley is one of the best-selling music artists in history, with estimated sales of over 500 million records worldwide. Presley&#x27;s rankings for top ten and number-one hits vary depending on how the double-sided &quot;Hound Dog/Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t/I Beg of You&quot; singles, which precede the inception of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s unified Hot 100 chart, are analyzed. According to Whitburn&#x27;s analysis, Presley holds the record with 38, tying with Madonna; per &quot;Billboard&quot;″s current assessment, he ranks second with 36. Whitburn and &quot;Billboard&quot; concur that the Beatles hold the record for most number-one hits with 20, and that Mariah Carey is second with 19. Whitburn has Presley with 18: &quot;Billboard&quot; has him third with 17. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;,  Presley has 79 cumulative weeks at number one: alone at 80, according to Whitburn and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with only Mariah Carey having more with 91 weeks. He holds the records for most number-one singles on the UK chart with 21 and singles reaching the top ten with 76.

As an album artist, Presley is credited by &quot;Billboard&quot; with the record for the most albums charting in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200: 129, far ahead of second-place Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 82. He also holds the record for most cumulative weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 for a male solo artists: 67 weeks In 2015 and 2016, two albums setting Presley&#x27;s vocals against music by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, &quot;If I Can Dream&quot; and &quot;The Wonder of You&quot;, both reached number one in the UK. This gave him a new record for number-one UK albums by a solo artist with 13, and extended his record for longest span between number-one albums by anybody—Presley had first topped the British chart in 1956 with his self-titled debut.

, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) credits Presley with 146.5 million certified album sales in the US, third all time behind the Beatles and Garth Brooks. He holds the records for most gold albums (101, nearly double second-place Barbra Streisand&#x27;s 51), and most platinum albums (57). His 25 multi-platinum albums is second behind the Beatles&#x27; 26. His total of 197 album certification awards (including one diamond award), far outpaces the Beatles&#x27; second-best 122. He has the 9th-most gold singles (54, tied with Justin Bieber), and the 16th-most platinum singles (27).

In 2012, the spider &quot;Paradonea presleyi&quot; was named in his honor. In 2018, President Donald Trump awarded Presley the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously. There is a street named after Presley in San Antonio, Texas.
