<text>The electron (&#x27;, or &#x27; in nuclear reactions) is a subatomic particle with a negative one elementary electric charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. The electron&#x27;s mass is approximately  that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, . Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, per the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves: They can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer de Broglie wavelength for a given energy.

Electrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry, and thermal conductivity; they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic, and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field; if that electron is moving relative to an observer, the observer will observe it to generate a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated.

Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications, such as tribology or frictional charging, electrolysis, electrochemistry, battery technologies, electronics, welding, cathode-ray tubes, photoelectricity, photovoltaic solar panels, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors, and particle accelerators.

Interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics. The Coulomb force interaction between the positive protons within atomic nuclei and the negative electrons without allows the composition of the two known as atoms. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the binding energy of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding.

In 1838, British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms. Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge &quot;electron&quot; in 1891, and J. J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897 during the cathode-ray tube experiment. 

Electrons participate in nuclear reactions, such as nucleosynthesis in stars, where they are known as beta particles. Electrons can be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-energy collisions, for instance, when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere. The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron, except that it carries electrical charge of the opposite sign. When an electron collides with a positron, both particles can be annihilated, producing gamma ray photons.

== History ==
=== Discovery of effect of electric force ===
The ancient Greeks noticed that amber attracted small objects when rubbed with fur. Along with lightning, this phenomenon is one of humanity&#x27;s earliest recorded experiences with electricity. In his 1600 treatise , the English scientist William Gilbert coined the Neo-Latin term , to refer to those substances with property similar to that of amber which attract small objects after being rubbed. Both &quot;electric&quot; and &quot;electricity&quot; are derived from the Latin &#x27; (also the root of the alloy of the same name), which came from the Greek word for amber, (&#x27;).

=== Discovery of two kinds of charges ===
In the early 1700s, French chemist Charles François du Fay found that if a charged gold-leaf is repulsed by glass rubbed with silk, then the same charged gold-leaf is attracted by amber rubbed with wool. From this and other results of similar types of experiments, du Fay concluded that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, &quot;vitreous&quot; fluid from glass rubbed with silk and &quot;resinous&quot; fluid from amber rubbed with wool. These two fluids can neutralize each other when combined. American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (−). He gave them the modern charge nomenclature of positive and negative respectively. Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.

Between 1838 and 1851, British natural philosopher Richard Laming developed the idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic particles that had unit electric charges. Beginning in 1846, German physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber theorized that electricity was composed of positively and negatively charged fluids, and their interaction was governed by the inverse square law. After studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in 1874, Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney suggested that there existed a &quot;single definite quantity of electricity&quot;, the charge of a monovalent ion. He was able to estimate the value of this elementary charge &quot;e&quot; by means of Faraday&#x27;s laws of electrolysis. However, Stoney believed these charges were permanently attached to atoms and could not be removed. In 1881, German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz argued that both positive and negative charges were divided into elementary parts, each of which &quot;behaves like atoms of electricity&quot;.

Stoney initially coined the term &quot;electrolion&quot; in 1881. Ten years later, he switched to &quot;electron&quot; to describe these elementary charges, writing in 1894: &quot;... an estimate was made of the actual amount of this most remarkable fundamental unit of electricity, for which I have since ventured to suggest the name &quot;electron&quot;&quot;. A 1906 proposal to change to &quot;electrion&quot; failed because Hendrik Lorentz preferred to keep &quot;electron&quot;. The word &quot;electron&quot; is a combination of the words &quot;electric&quot; and &quot;ion&quot;. The suffix which is now used to designate other subatomic particles, such as a proton or neutron, is in turn derived from electron.

=== Discovery of free electrons outside matter ===


While studying electrical conductivity in rarefied gases in 1859, the German physicist Julius Plücker observed the radiation emitted from the cathode caused phosphorescent light to appear on the tube wall near the cathode; and the region of the phosphorescent light could be moved by application of a magnetic field. In 1869, Plücker&#x27;s student Johann Wilhelm Hittorf found that a solid body placed in between the cathode and the phosphorescence would cast a shadow upon the phosphorescent region of the tube. Hittorf inferred that there are straight rays emitted from the cathode and that the phosphorescence was caused by the rays striking the tube walls. Furthermore, he also discovered that these rays are deflected by magnets just like lines of current.

In 1876, the German physicist Eugen Goldstein showed that the rays were emitted perpendicular to the cathode surface, which distinguished between the rays that were emitted from the cathode and the incandescent light. Goldstein dubbed the rays cathode rays. Decades of experimental and theoretical research involving cathode rays were important in J. J. Thomson&#x27;s eventual discovery of electrons. Goldstein also experimented with double cathodes and hypothesized that one ray may repulse another, although he didn&#x27;t believe that any particles might be involved.

During the 1870s, the English chemist and physicist Sir William Crookes developed the first cathode-ray tube to have a high vacuum inside. He then showed in 1874 that the cathode rays can turn a small paddle wheel when placed in their path. Therefore, he concluded that the rays carried momentum. Furthermore, by applying a magnetic field, he was able to deflect the rays, thereby demonstrating that the beam behaved as though it were negatively charged. In 1879, he proposed that these properties could be explained by regarding cathode rays as composed of negatively charged gaseous molecules in a fourth state of matter, in which the mean free path of the particles is so long that collisions may be ignored.

In 1883, not yet well-known German physicist Heinrich Hertz tried to prove that cathode rays are electrically neutral and got what he interpreted as a confident absence of deflection in electrostatic, as opposed to magnetic, field. However, as J. J. Thomson explained in 1897, Hertz placed the deflecting electrodes in a highly-conductive area of the tube, resulting in a strong screening effect close to their surface. 

The German-born British physicist Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes&#x27;s experiments by placing metal plates parallel to the cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given electric and magnetic field, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time. This is because it was assumed that the charge carriers were much heavier hydrogen or nitrogen atoms. Schuster&#x27;s estimates would subsequently turn out to be largely correct.

In 1892 Hendrik Lorentz suggested that the mass of these particles (electrons) could be a consequence of their electric charge.
While studying naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896, the French physicist Henri Becquerel discovered that they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source. These radioactive materials became the subject of much interest by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles. He designated these particles alpha and beta, on the basis of their ability to penetrate matter. In 1900, Becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field, and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the same as for cathode rays. This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.

In 1897, the British physicist J. J. Thomson, with his colleagues John S. Townsend and H. A. Wilson, performed experiments indicating that cathode rays really were unique particles, rather than waves, atoms or molecules as was believed earlier. By 1899 he showed that their charge-to-mass ratio, &quot;e&quot;/&quot;m&quot;, was independent of cathode material. He further showed that the negatively charged particles produced by radioactive materials, by heated materials and by illuminated materials were universal. Thomson measured &quot;m&quot;/&quot;e&quot; for cathode ray &quot;corpuscles&quot;, and made good estimates of the charge &quot;e&quot;, leading to value for the mass &quot;m&quot;, finding a value 1400 times less massive than the least massive ion known: hydrogen. In the same year Emil Wiechert and Walter Kaufmann also calculated the &quot;e&quot;/&quot;m&quot; ratio but did not take the step of interpreting their results as showing a new particle, while J. J. Thomson would subsequently in 1899 give estimates for the electron charge and mass as well: &quot;e&quot; ~  and &quot;m&quot; ~ 
The name &quot;electron&quot; was adopted for these particles by the scientific community, mainly due to the advocation by G. F. FitzGerald, J. Larmor, and H. A. Lorentz. The term was originally coined by George Johnstone Stoney in 1891 as a tentative name for the basic unit of electrical charge (which had then yet to be discovered).

The electron&#x27;s charge was more carefully measured by the American physicists Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in their oil-drop experiment of 1909, the results of which were published in 1911. This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity. This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%. Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson&#x27;s team, using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis, and in 1911 by Abram Ioffe, who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913. However, oil drops were more stable than water drops because of their slower evaporation rate, and thus more suited to precise experimentation over longer periods of time.

Around the beginning of the twentieth century, it was found that under certain conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of supersaturated water vapor along its path. In 1911, Charles Wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.

=== Atomic theory ===

By 1914, experiments by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz had largely established the structure of an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron&#x27;s orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom. However, Bohr&#x27;s model failed to account for the relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.

Chemical bonds between atoms were explained by Gilbert Newton Lewis, who in 1916 proposed that a covalent bond between two atoms is maintained by a pair of electrons shared between them. Later, in 1927, Walter Heitler and Fritz London gave the full explanation of the electron-pair formation and chemical bonding in terms of quantum mechanics. In 1919, the American chemist Irving Langmuir elaborated on the Lewis&#x27;s static model of the atom and suggested that all electrons were distributed in successive &quot;concentric (nearly) spherical shells, all of equal thickness&quot;. In turn, he divided the shells into a number of cells each of which contained one pair of electrons. With this model Langmuir was able to qualitatively explain the chemical properties of all elements in the periodic table, which were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law.

In 1924, Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli observed that the shell-like structure of the atom could be explained by a set of four parameters that defined every quantum energy state, as long as each state was occupied by no more than a single electron. This prohibition against more than one electron occupying the same quantum energy state became known as the Pauli exclusion principle. The physical mechanism to explain the fourth parameter, which had two distinct possible values, was provided by the Dutch physicists Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck. In 1925, they suggested that an electron, in addition to the angular momentum of its orbit, possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment. This is analogous to the rotation of the Earth on its axis as it orbits the Sun. The intrinsic angular momentum became known as spin, and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high-resolution spectrograph; this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
In his 1924 dissertation &quot;&quot; (Research on Quantum Theory), French physicist Louis de Broglie hypothesized that all matter can be represented as a de Broglie wave in the manner of light. That is, under the appropriate conditions, electrons and other matter would show properties of either particles or waves. The corpuscular properties of a particle are demonstrated when it is shown to have a localized position in space along its trajectory at any given moment. The wave-like nature of light is displayed, for example, when a beam of light is passed through parallel slits thereby creating interference patterns. In 1927, George Paget Thomson and Alexander Reid discovered the interference effect was produced when a beam of electrons was passed through thin celluloid foils and later metal films, and by American physicists Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer by the reflection of electrons from a crystal of nickel. Alexander Reid, who was Thomson&#x27;s graduate student, performed the first experiments but he died soon after in a motorcycle accident and is rarely mentioned.
De Broglie&#x27;s prediction of a wave nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving under the influence of the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how electron waves propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger&#x27;s equation, like Heisenberg&#x27;s, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum. Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.

In 1928, building on Wolfgang Pauli&#x27;s work, Paul Dirac produced a model of the electron – the Dirac equation, consistent with relativity theory, by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field. In order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, Dirac developed in 1930 a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy, later dubbed the Dirac sea. This led him to predict the existence of a positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron. This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who proposed calling standard electrons &quot;negatrons&quot; and using &quot;electron&quot; as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants.

In 1947, Willis Lamb, working in collaboration with graduate student Robert Retherford, found that certain quantum states of the hydrogen atom, which should have the same energy, were shifted in relation to each other; the difference came to be called the Lamb shift. About the same time, Polykarp Kusch, working with Henry M. Foley, discovered the magnetic moment of the electron is slightly larger than predicted by Dirac&#x27;s theory. This small difference was later called anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron. This difference was later explained by the theory of quantum electrodynamics, developed by Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger and
Richard Feynman in the late 1940s.

=== Particle accelerators ===
With the development of the particle accelerator during the first half of the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles. The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst. His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3 MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300 MeV. In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70 MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric. This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light.

With a beam energy of 1.5 GeV, the first high-energy
particle collider was ADONE, which began operations in 1968. This device accelerated electrons and positrons in opposite directions, effectively doubling the energy of their collision when compared to striking a static target with an electron. The Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP) at CERN, which was operational from 1989 to 2000, achieved collision energies of 209 GeV and made important measurements for the Standard Model of particle physics.

=== Confinement of individual electrons ===
Individual electrons can now be easily confined in ultra small (, ) CMOS transistors operated at cryogenic temperature over a range of −269 °C (4 K) to about −258 °C (15 K). The electron wavefunction spreads in a semiconductor lattice and negligibly interacts with the valence band electrons, so it can be treated in the single particle formalism, by replacing its mass with the effective-mass tensor.

== Characteristics ==

=== Classification ===

In the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons belong to the group of subatomic particles called leptons, which are believed to be fundamental or elementary particles. Electrons have the lowest mass of any charged lepton (or electrically charged particle of any type) and belong to the first generation of fundamental particles. The second and third generation contain charged leptons, the muon and the tau, which are identical to the electron in charge, spin and interactions, but are more massive. Leptons differ from the other basic constituent of matter, the quarks, by their lack of strong interaction. All members of the lepton group are fermions because they all have half-odd integer spin; the electron has spin .

=== Fundamental properties ===
The invariant mass of an electron is approximately , or . Due to mass–energy equivalence, this corresponds to a rest energy of . The ratio between the mass of a proton and that of an electron is about 1836. Astronomical measurements show that the proton-to-electron mass ratio has held the same value, as is predicted by the Standard Model, for at least half the age of the universe.

Electrons have an electric charge of coulombs, which is used as a standard unit of charge for subatomic particles, and is also called the elementary charge. Within the limits of experimental accuracy, the electron charge is identical to the charge of a proton, but with the opposite sign. The electron is commonly symbolized by , and the positron is symbolized by .

The electron has an intrinsic angular momentum or spin of . This property is usually stated by referring to the electron as a spin-1/2 particle. For such particles the spin magnitude is , while the result of the measurement of a projection of the spin on any axis can only be ±. In addition to spin, the electron has an intrinsic magnetic moment along its spin axis. It is approximately equal to one Bohr magneton,=\frac{e\hbar}{2m_{\mathrm{e}}}&lt;/math&gt;}} which is a physical constant that is equal to The orientation of the spin with respect to the momentum of the electron defines the property of elementary particles known as helicity.

The electron has no known substructure. Nevertheless, in condensed matter physics, spin–charge separation can occur in some materials. In such cases, electrons &#x27;split&#x27; into three independent particles, the spinon, the orbiton and the holon (or chargon). The electron can always be theoretically considered as a bound state of the three, with the spinon carrying the spin of the electron, the orbiton carrying the orbital degree of freedom and the chargon carrying the charge, but in certain conditions they can behave as independent quasiparticles.

The issue of the radius of the electron is a challenging problem of modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises of the theory of relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity. Observation of a single electron in a Penning trap suggests the upper limit of the particle&#x27;s radius to be 10−22 meters.
The upper bound of the electron radius of 10−18 meters can be derived using the uncertainty relation in energy. There &quot;is&quot; also a physical constant called the &quot;classical electron radius&quot;, with the much larger value of , greater than the radius of the proton. However, the terminology comes from a simplistic calculation that ignores the effects of quantum mechanics; in reality, the so-called classical electron radius has little to do with the true fundamental structure of the electron.

There are elementary particles that spontaneously decay into less massive particles. An example is the muon, with a mean lifetime of  seconds, which decays into an electron, a muon neutrino and an electron antineutrino. The electron, on the other hand, is thought to be stable on theoretical grounds: the electron is the least massive particle with non-zero electric charge, so its decay would violate charge conservation. The experimental lower bound for the electron&#x27;s mean lifetime is years, at a 90% confidence level.

=== Quantum properties ===
As with all particles, electrons can act as waves. This is called the wave–particle duality and can be demonstrated using the double-slit experiment.

The wave-like nature of the electron allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as would be the case for a classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (&quot;ψ&quot;). When the absolute value of this function is squared, it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.
Electrons are identical particles because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, , where the variables &quot;r&quot;1 and &quot;r&quot;2 correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. Bosons, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.

In the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This is responsible for the Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.

=== Virtual particles ===

In a simplified picture, which often tends to give the wrong idea but may serve to illustrate some aspects, every photon spends some time as a combination of a virtual electron plus its antiparticle, the virtual positron, which rapidly annihilate each other shortly thereafter. The combination of the energy variation needed to create these particles, and the time during which they exist, fall under the threshold of detectability expressed by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, Δ&quot;E&quot; · Δ&quot;t&quot; ≥ &quot;ħ&quot;. In effect, the energy needed to create these virtual particles, Δ&quot;E&quot;, can be &quot;borrowed&quot; from the vacuum for a period of time, Δ&quot;t&quot;, so that their product is no more than the reduced Planck constant, . Thus, for a virtual electron, Δ&quot;t&quot; is at most .
While an electron–positron virtual pair is in existence, the Coulomb force from the ambient electric field surrounding an electron causes a created positron to be attracted to the original electron, while a created electron experiences a repulsion. This causes what is called vacuum polarization. In effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric permittivity more than unity. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value, and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron. This polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using the Japanese TRISTAN particle accelerator. Virtual particles cause a comparable shielding effect for the mass of the electron.

The interaction with virtual particles also explains the small (about 0.1%) deviation of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron from the Bohr magneton (the anomalous magnetic moment). The extraordinarily precise agreement of this predicted difference with the experimentally determined value is viewed as one of the great achievements of quantum electrodynamics.

The apparent paradox in classical physics of a point particle electron having intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic moment can be explained by the formation of virtual photons in the electric field generated by the electron. These photons can heuristically be thought of as causing the electron to shift about in a jittery fashion (known as zitterbewegung), which results in a net circular motion with precession. This motion produces both the spin and the magnetic moment of the electron. In atoms, this creation of virtual photons explains the Lamb shift observed in spectral lines. The Compton Wavelength shows that near elementary particles such as the electron, the uncertainty of the energy allows for the creation of virtual particles near the electron. This wavelength explains the &quot;static&quot; of virtual particles around elementary particles at a close distance.

=== Interaction ===
An electron generates an electric field that exerts an attractive force on a particle with a positive charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb&#x27;s inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère–Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle&#x27;s speed is close to that of light (relativistic).
When an electron is moving through a magnetic field, it is subject to the Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity. This centripetal force causes the electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation. The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron, known as the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac Force, which creates a friction that slows the electron. This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron&#x27;s own field upon itself.
Photons mediate electromagnetic interactions between particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron at a constant velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The deceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.

An inelastic collision between a photon (light) and a solitary (free) electron is called Compton scattering. This collision results in a transfer of momentum and energy between the particles, which modifies the wavelength of the photon by an amount called the Compton shift.c} (1 - \cos \theta),&lt;/math&gt;
where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum and &quot;m&quot;e is the electron mass. See Zombeck (2007). }} The maximum magnitude of this wavelength shift is &quot;h&quot;/&quot;m&quot;e&quot;c&quot;, which is known as the Compton wavelength. For an electron, it has a value of . When the wavelength of the light is long (for instance, the wavelength of the visible light is 0.4–0.7 μm) the wavelength shift becomes negligible. Such interaction between the light and free electrons is called Thomson scattering or linear Thomson scattering.

The relative strength of the electromagnetic interaction between two charged particles, such as an electron and a proton, is given by the fine-structure constant. This value is a dimensionless quantity formed by the ratio of two energies: the electrostatic energy of attraction (or repulsion) at a separation of one Compton wavelength, and the rest energy of the charge. It is given by which is approximately equal to .

When electrons and positrons collide, they annihilate each other, giving rise to two or more gamma ray photons. If the electron and positron have negligible momentum, a positronium atom can form before annihilation results in two or three gamma ray photons totalling 1.022 MeV. On the other hand, a high-energy photon can transform into an electron and a positron by a process called pair production, but only in the presence of a nearby charged particle, such as a nucleus.

In the theory of electroweak interaction, the left-handed component of electron&#x27;s wavefunction forms a weak isospin doublet with the electron neutrino. This means that during weak interactions, electron neutrinos behave like electrons. Either member of this doublet can undergo a charged current interaction by emitting or absorbing a and be converted into the other member. Charge is conserved during this reaction because the W boson also carries a charge, canceling out any net change during the transmutation. Charged current interactions are responsible for the phenomenon of beta decay in a radioactive atom. Both the electron and electron neutrino can undergo a neutral current interaction via a exchange, and this is responsible for neutrino–electron elastic scattering.
=== Atoms and molecules ===
An electron can be &quot;bound&quot; to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system of one or more electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus&#x27;s electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.

Electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy that matches the difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, the energy of the electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom&#x27;s ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.

The orbital angular momentum of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that is proportional to the angular momentum. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital, called paired electrons, cancel each other out.

The chemical bond between atoms occurs as a result of electromagnetic interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.

=== Conductivity ===

If a body has more or fewer electrons than are required to balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object is said to be negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.

Independent electrons moving in vacuum are termed &quot;free&quot; electrons. Electrons in metals also behave as if they were free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

At a given temperature, each material has an electrical conductivity that determines the value of electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave as if they were free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.

Because of collisions between electrons and atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor is on the order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current at one point in the material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.

Metals make relatively good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.

When cooled below a point called the critical temperature, materials can undergo a phase transition in which they lose all resistivity to electric current, in a process known as superconductivity. In BCS theory, pairs of electrons called Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance. (Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100 nm, so they can overlap each other.) However, the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain.

Electrons inside conducting solids, which are quasi-particles themselves, when tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero, behave as though they had split into three other quasiparticles: spinons, orbitons and holons. The former carries spin and magnetic moment, the next carries its orbital location while the latter electrical charge.

=== Motion and energy ===
According to Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity, as an electron&#x27;s speed approaches the speed of light, from an observer&#x27;s point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observer&#x27;s frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in vacuum, &quot;c&quot;. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to &quot;c&quot;—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than &quot;c&quot;, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.
The effects of special relativity are based on a quantity known as the Lorentz factor, defined as formula_1 where &quot;v&quot; is the speed of the particle. The kinetic energy &quot;K&quot;e of an electron moving with velocity &quot;v&quot; is:
:formula_2
where &quot;m&quot;e is the mass of electron. For example, the Stanford linear accelerator can accelerate an electron to roughly 51 GeV.
Since an electron behaves as a wave, at a given velocity it has a characteristic de Broglie wavelength. This is given by &quot;λ&quot;e = &quot;h&quot;/&quot;p&quot; where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant and &quot;p&quot; is the momentum. For the 51 GeV electron above, the wavelength is about , small enough to explore structures well below the size of an atomic nucleus.

== Formation ==

The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted scientific theory to explain the early stages in the evolution of the Universe. For the first millisecond of the Big Bang, the temperatures were over 10 billion kelvins and photons had mean energies over a million electronvolts. These photons were sufficiently energetic that they could react with each other to form pairs of electrons and positrons. Likewise, positron–electron pairs annihilated each other and emitted energetic photons:
An equilibrium between electrons, positrons and photons was maintained during this phase of the evolution of the Universe. After 15 seconds had passed, however, the temperature of the universe dropped below the threshold where electron-positron formation could occur. Most of the surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other, releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated the universe.

For reasons that remain uncertain, during the annihilation process there was an excess in the number of particles over antiparticles. Hence, about one electron for every billion electron–positron pairs survived. This excess matched the excess of protons over antiprotons, in a condition known as baryon asymmetry, resulting in a net charge of zero for the universe. The surviving protons and neutrons began to participate in reactions with each other—in the process known as nucleosynthesis, forming isotopes of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of lithium. This process peaked after about five minutes. Any leftover neutrons underwent negative beta decay with a half-life of about a thousand seconds, releasing a proton and electron in the process,
For about the next –, the excess electrons remained too energetic to bind with atomic nuclei. What followed is a period known as recombination, when neutral atoms were formed and the expanding universe became transparent to radiation.
Roughly one million years after the big bang, the first generation of stars began to form. Within a star, stellar nucleosynthesis results in the production of positrons from the fusion of atomic nuclei. These antimatter particles immediately annihilate with electrons, releasing gamma rays. The net result is a steady reduction in the number of electrons, and a matching increase in the number of neutrons. However, the process of stellar evolution can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes. Selected isotopes can subsequently undergo negative beta decay, emitting an electron and antineutrino from the nucleus. An example is the cobalt-60 (60Co) isotope, which decays to form nickel-60 ().

At the end of its lifetime, a star with more than about 20 solar masses can undergo gravitational collapse to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.

When a pair of virtual particles (such as an electron and positron) is created in the vicinity of the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass–energy by the black hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.
Cosmic rays are particles traveling through space with high energies. Energy events as high as have been recorded. When these particles collide with nucleons in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, a shower of particles is generated, including pions. More than half of the cosmic radiation observed from the Earth&#x27;s surface consists of muons. The particle called a muon is a lepton produced in the upper atmosphere by the decay of a pion.
A muon, in turn, can decay to form an electron or positron.

== Observation ==

Remote observation of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy. For example, in high-energy environments such as the corona of a star, free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation. Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation, which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio telescopes.

The frequency of a photon is proportional to its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct dark lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation in places where the corresponding frequency is absorbed by the atom&#x27;s electrons. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. When detected, spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.

In laboratory conditions, the interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge. The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle properties. For example, in one instance a Penning trap was used to contain a single electron for a period of 10 months. The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.

The first video images of an electron&#x27;s energy distribution were captured by a team at Lund University in Sweden, February 2008. The scientists used extremely short flashes of light, called attosecond pulses, which allowed an electron&#x27;s motion to be observed for the first time.

The distribution of the electrons in solid materials can be visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique employs the photoelectric effect to measure the reciprocal space—a mathematical representation of periodic structures that is used to infer the original structure. ARPES can be used to determine the direction, speed and scattering of electrons within the material.

== Plasma applications ==

=== Particle beams ===
Electron beams are used in welding. They allow energy densities up to across a narrow focus diameter of and usually require no filler material. This welding technique must be performed in a vacuum to prevent the electrons from interacting with the gas before reaching their target, and it can be used to join conductive materials that would otherwise be considered unsuitable for welding.

Electron-beam lithography (EBL) is a method of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer. This technique is limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the resolution to about 10 nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used for the production of small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.

Electron beam processing is used to irradiate materials in order to change their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products. Electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy.

Linear particle accelerators generate electron beams for treatment of superficial tumors in radiation therapy. Electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5 cm for electron energies in the range 5–20 MeV. An electron beam can be used to supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by X-rays.

Particle accelerators use electric fields to propel electrons and their antiparticles to high energies. These particles emit synchrotron radiation as they pass through magnetic fields. The dependency of the intensity of this radiation upon spin polarizes the electron beam—a process known as the Sokolov–Ternov effect. Polarized electron beams can be useful for various experiments. Synchrotron radiation can also cool the electron beams to reduce the momentum spread of the particles. Electron and positron beams are collided upon the particles&#x27; accelerating to the required energies; particle detectors observe the resulting energy emissions, which particle physics studies.

=== Imaging ===
Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a method of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine the structure of the material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200 eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range 8–20 keV and the angle of incidence is 1–4°.

The electron microscope directs a focused beam of electrons at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200 nm. By comparison, electron microscopes are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037 nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05 nm resolution, which is more than enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.

Two main types of electron microscopes exist: transmission and scanning. Transmission electron microscopes function like overhead projectors, with a beam of electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge-coupled device. Scanning electron microscopes rasteri a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The scanning tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.

=== Other applications ===
In the free-electron laser (FEL), a relativistic electron beam passes through a pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation with a wide range of frequencies, from microwaves to soft X-rays. These devices are used in manufacturing, communication, and in medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.

Electrons are important in cathode-ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they played a critical role in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.

<doc id="9477" wikidata="Q1396" url="?curid=9477" title="Europium">
<text>Europium is a chemical element; it has symbol Eu and atomic number 63. It is a silvery-white metal of the lanthanide series that reacts readily with air to form a dark oxide coating. Europium is the most chemically reactive, least dense, and softest of the lanthanides. It is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Europium was discovered in 1896, provisionally designated as Σ; in 1901, it was named after the continent of Europe. Europium usually assumes the oxidation state +3, like other members of the lanthanide series, but compounds having oxidation state +2 are also common. All europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. Europium is one of the rarest of the rare-earth elements on Earth.

==Etymology==
Its discoverer, Eugène-Anatole Demarçay named the element after the continent of Europe.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Europium is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of lead. It crystallizes in a body-centered cubic lattice. Some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half-filled electron shell. Europium has the second lowest melting point and the lowest density of all lanthanides.

===Chemical properties===
Europium is the most reactive rare-earth element. It rapidly oxidizes in air, so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter-sized sample occurs within several days. Its reactivity with water is comparable to that of calcium, and the reaction is
:2 Eu + 6 H2O → 2 Eu(OH)3 + 3 H2

Because of the high reactivity, samples of solid europium rarely have the shiny appearance of the fresh metal, even when coated with a protective layer of mineral oil. Europium ignites in air at 150 to 180 °C to form europium(III) oxide:
:4 Eu + 3 O2 → 2 Eu2O3

Europium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form pale pink solutions of [Eu(H2O)9]3+:
:2 Eu + 3 H2SO4 + 18 H2O → 2 [Eu(H2O)9]3+ + 3 + 3 H2

====Eu(II) vs. Eu(III)====
Although usually trivalent, europium readily forms divalent compounds. This behavior is unusual for most lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 state has an electron configuration 4&quot;f&quot;7 because the half-filled &quot;f&quot;-shell provides more stability. In terms of size and coordination number, europium(II) and barium(II) are similar. The sulfates of both barium and europium(II) are also highly insoluble in water. Divalent europium is a mild reducing agent, oxidizing in air to form Eu(III) compounds. In anaerobic, and particularly geothermal conditions, the divalent form is sufficiently stable that it tends to be incorporated into minerals of calcium and the other alkaline earths. This ion-exchange process is the basis of the &quot;negative europium anomaly&quot;, the low europium content in many lanthanide minerals such as monazite, relative to the chondritic abundance. Bastnäsite tends to show less of a negative europium anomaly than does monazite, and hence is the major source of europium today. The development of easy methods to separate divalent europium from the other (trivalent) lanthanides made europium accessible even when present in low concentration, as it usually is.

===Isotopes===

Naturally occurring europium is composed of two isotopes, 151Eu and 153Eu, which occur in almost equal proportions; 153Eu is slightly more abundant (52.2% natural abundance). While 153Eu is stable, 151Eu was found to be unstable to alpha decay with a half-life of in 2007, giving about one alpha decay per two minutes in every kilogram of natural europium. This value is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. Besides the natural radioisotope 151Eu, 35 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 150Eu with a half-life of 36.9 years, 152Eu with a half-life of 13.516 years, and 154Eu with a half-life of 8.593 years. All the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than 4.7612 years, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 12.2 seconds; the known isotopes of europium range from 130Eu to 170Eu. This element also has 17 meta states, with the most stable being 150mEu (&quot;t&quot;1/2=12.8 hours), 152m1Eu (&quot;t&quot;1/2=9.3116 hours) and 152m2Eu (&quot;t&quot;1/2=96 minutes).

The primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than 153Eu is electron capture, and the primary mode for heavier isotopes is beta minus decay. The primary decay products before 153Eu are isotopes of samarium (Sm) and the primary products after are isotopes of gadolinium (Gd).

====Europium as a nuclear fission product====

Europium is produced by nuclear fission; 
155Eu (half-life 4.7612 years) has a fission yield of 330 parts per million (ppm) for uranium-235 and thermal neutrons.
The fission product yields of europium isotopes are low near the top of the mass range for fission products.

As with other lanthanides, many isotopes of europium, especially those that have odd mass numbers or are neutron-poor like 152Eu, have high cross sections for neutron capture, often high enough to be neutron poisons.

151Eu is the beta decay product of samarium-151, but since this has a long decay half-life and short mean time to neutron absorption, most 151Sm instead ends up as 152Sm.

152Eu (half-life 13.516 years) and 154Eu (half-life 8.593 years) cannot be beta decay products because 152Sm and 154Sm are non-radioactive, but 154Eu is the only long-lived &quot;shielded&quot; nuclide, other than 134Cs, to have a fission yield of more than 2.5 parts per million fissions. A larger amount of 154Eu is produced by neutron activation of a significant portion of the non-radioactive 153Eu; however, much of this is further converted to 155Eu.

===Occurrence===

Europium is not found in nature as a free element. Many minerals contain europium, with the most important sources being bastnäsite, monazite, xenotime and loparite-(Ce). No europium-dominant minerals are known yet, despite a single find of a tiny possible Eu–O or Eu–O–C system phase in the Moon&#x27;s regolith.

Depletion or enrichment of europium in minerals relative to other rare-earth elements is known as the europium anomaly. Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form igneous rocks (rocks that cooled from magma or lava). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks. The median crustal abundance of europium is 2 ppm; values of the less abundant elements may vary with location by several orders of magnitude. 

Divalent europium (Eu2+) in small amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852, although it was not until much later that europium was determined to be the cause.

In astrophysics, the signature of europium in stellar spectra can be used to classify stars and inform theories of how or where a particular star was born. For instance, astronomers used the relative levels of europium to iron within the star LAMOST J112456.61+453531.3 to propose that the accretion process for star occurred late.

==Production==
Europium is associated with the other rare-earth elements and is, therefore, mined together with them. Separation of the rare-earth elements occurs during later processing. Rare-earth elements are found in the minerals bastnäsite, loparite-(Ce), xenotime, and monazite in mineable quantities. Bastnäsite is a group of related fluorocarbonates, Ln(CO3)(F,OH). Monazite is a group of related of orthophosphate minerals (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium), loparite-(Ce) is an oxide, and xenotime is an orthophosphate (Y,Yb,Er...)PO4. Monazite also contains thorium and yttrium, which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore, followed by acidic and basic leaching, is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with zinc, zinc/amalgam, electrolysis or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as a carbonate or co-precipitated with barium sulfate. Europium metal is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten EuCl3 and NaCl (or CaCl2) in a graphite cell, which serves as cathode, using graphite as anode. The other product is chlorine gas.

A few large deposits produce or produced a significant amount of the world production. The Bayan Obo iron ore deposit in Inner Mongolia contains significant amounts of bastnäsite and monazite and is, with an estimated 36 million tonnes of rare-earth element oxides, the largest known deposit. The mining operations at the Bayan Obo deposit made China the largest supplier of rare-earth elements in the 1990s. Only 0.2% of the rare-earth element content is europium. The second large source for rare-earth elements between 1965 and its closure in the late 1990s was the Mountain Pass rare earth mine in California. The bastnäsite mined there is especially rich in the light rare-earth elements (La-Gd, Sc, and Y) and contains only 0.1% of europium. Another large source for rare-earth elements is the loparite found on the Kola peninsula. It contains besides niobium, tantalum and titanium up to 30% rare-earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in Russia.

==Compounds==

Europium compounds tend to exist in a trivalent oxidation state under most conditions. Commonly these compounds feature Eu(III) bound by 6–9 oxygenic ligands. The Eu(III) sulfates, nitrates and chlorides are soluble in water or polar organic solvents. Lipophilic europium complexes often feature acetylacetonate-like ligands, such as EuFOD.

===Halides===
Europium metal reacts with all the halogens:
:2 Eu + 3 X2 → 2 EuX3 (X = F, Cl, Br, I)
This route gives white europium(III) fluoride (EuF3), yellow europium(III) chloride (EuCl3), gray europium(III) bromide (EuBr3), and colorless europium(III) iodide (EuI3). Europium also forms the corresponding dihalides: yellow-green europium(II) fluoride (EuF2), colorless europium(II) chloride (EuCl2) (although it has a bright blue fluorescence under UV light), colorless europium(II) bromide (EuBr2), and green europium(II) iodide (EuI2).

===Chalcogenides and pnictides===
Europium forms stable compounds with all of the chalcogens, but the heavier chalcogens (S, Se, and Te) stabilize the lower oxidation state. Three oxides are known: europium(II) oxide (EuO), europium(III) oxide (Eu2O3), and the mixed-valence oxide Eu3O4, consisting of both Eu(II) and Eu(III). Otherwise, the main chalcogenides are europium(II) sulfide (EuS), europium(II) selenide (EuSe) and europium(II) telluride (EuTe): all three of these are black solids. Europium(II) sulfide is prepared by sulfiding the oxide at temperatures sufficiently high to decompose the Eu2O3:
:Eu2O3 + 3 H2S → 2 EuS + 3 H2O + S
The main nitride of europium is europium(III) nitride (EuN).

==History==
Although europium is present in most of the minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements it was not until the late 1800s that the element was isolated. William Crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements including those eventually assigned to europium.

Europium was first found in 1892 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who obtained basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not accounted for by samarium or gadolinium. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and who was able to isolate it in 1901; he then named it &quot;europium&quot;.

When the europium-doped yttrium orthovanadate red phosphor was discovered in the early 1960s, and understood to be about to cause a revolution in the color television industry, there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors, as the typical europium content in monazite is about 0.05%. However, the Molycorp bastnäsite deposit at the Mountain Pass rare earth mine, California, whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0.1%, was about to come on-line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry. Prior to europium, the color-TV red phosphor was very weak, and the other phosphor colors had to be muted, to maintain color balance. With the brilliant red europium phosphor, it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors, and a much brighter color TV picture was the result. Europium has continued to be in use in the TV industry ever since as well as in computer monitors. Californian bastnäsite now faces stiff competition from Bayan Obo, China, with an even &quot;richer&quot; europium content of 0.2%.

Frank Spedding, celebrated for his development of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related the story of how he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman had turned out to be Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.

==Applications==

Relative to most other elements, commercial applications for europium are few and rather specialized. Almost invariably, its phosphorescence is exploited, either in the +2 or +3 oxidation state.

It is a dopant in some types of glass in lasers and other optoelectronic devices. Europium oxide (Eu2O3) is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors. Color TV screens contain between 0.5 and 1 g of europium oxide. Whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors, the luminescence of divalent europium depends strongly on the composition of the host structure. UV to deep red luminescence can be achieved. The two classes of europium-based phosphor (red and blue), combined with the yellow/green terbium phosphors give &quot;white&quot; light, the color temperature of which can be varied by altering the proportion or specific composition of the individual phosphors. This phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs. Combining the same three classes is one way to make trichromatic systems in TV and computer screens, but as an additive, it can be particularly effective in improving the intensity of red phosphor. Europium is also used in the manufacture of fluorescent glass, increasing the general efficiency of fluorescent lamps. One of the more common persistent after-glow phosphors besides copper-doped zinc sulfide is europium-doped strontium aluminate. Europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug-discovery screens. It is also used in the anti-counterfeiting phosphors in euro banknotes.
An application that has almost fallen out of use with the introduction of affordable superconducting magnets is the use of europium complexes, such as Eu(fod)3, as shift reagents in NMR spectroscopy. Chiral shift reagents, such as Eu(hfc)3, are still used to determine enantiomeric purity.

Europium compounds are used to label antibodies for sensitive detection of antigens in body fluids, a form of immunoassay. When these europium-labeled antibodies bind to specific antigens, the resulting complex can be detected with laser excited fluorescence.

==Precautions==

There are no clear indications that europium is particularly toxic compared to other heavy metals. Europium chloride, nitrate and oxide have been tested for toxicity: europium chloride shows an acute intraperitoneal LD50 toxicity of 550 mg/kg and the acute oral LD50 toxicity is 5000 mg/kg. Europium nitrate shows a slightly higher intraperitoneal LD50 toxicity of 320 mg/kg, while the oral toxicity is above 5000 mg/kg. The metal dust presents a fire and explosion hazard.

<doc id="9478" wikidata="Q1849" url="?curid=9478" title="Erbium">
<text>Erbium is a chemical element; it has symbol Er and atomic number 68. A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated, natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements. It is a lanthanide, a rare-earth element, originally found in the gadolinite mine in Ytterby, Sweden, which is the source of the element&#x27;s name.

Erbium&#x27;s principal uses involve its pink-colored Er3+ ions, which have optical fluorescent properties particularly useful in certain laser applications. Erbium-doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media, where Er3+ ions are optically pumped at around 980 or and then radiate light at in stimulated emission. This process results in an unusually mechanically simple laser optical amplifier for signals transmitted by fiber optics. The wavelength is especially important for optical communications because standard single mode optical fibers have minimal loss at this particular wavelength.

In addition to optical fiber amplifier-lasers, a large variety of medical applications (e.g. dermatology, dentistry) rely on the erbium ion&#x27;s emission (see ) when lit at another wavelength, which is highly absorbed in water in tissues, making its effect very superficial. Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is helpful in laser surgery, and for the efficient production of steam which produces enamel ablation by common types of dental laser.

== Characteristics ==

===Physical properties===

A trivalent element, pure erbium metal is malleable (or easily shaped), soft yet stable in air, and does not oxidize as quickly as some other rare-earth metals. Its salts are rose-colored, and the element has characteristic sharp absorption spectra bands in visible light, ultraviolet, and near infrared. Otherwise it looks much like the other rare earths. Its sesquioxide is called erbia. Erbium&#x27;s properties are to a degree dictated by the kind and amount of impurities present. Erbium does not play any known biological role, but is thought to be able to stimulate metabolism.

Erbium is ferromagnetic below 19 K, antiferromagnetic between 19 and 80 K and paramagnetic above 80 K.

Erbium can form propeller-shaped atomic clusters Er3N, where the distance between the erbium atoms is 0.35 nm. Those clusters can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.

Like most rare-earth elements, erbium is usually found in the +3 oxidation state. However, it is possible for erbium to also be found in the 0, +1 and +2 oxidation states.

===Chemical properties===
Erbium metal retains its luster in dry air, however will tarnish slowly in moist air and burns readily to form erbium(III) oxide:
:4 Er + 3 O2 → 2 Er2O3

Erbium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form erbium hydroxide:
:2 Er (s) + 6 H2O (l) → 2 Er(OH)3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g)

Erbium metal reacts with all the halogens:
:2 Er (s) + 3 F2 (g) → 2 ErF3 (s) [pink]
:2 Er (s) + 3 Cl2 (g) → 2 ErCl3 (s) [violet]
:2 Er (s) + 3 Br2 (g) → 2 ErBr3 (s) [violet]
:2 Er (s) + 3 I2 (g) → 2 ErI3 (s) [violet]

Erbium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing hydrated Er(III) ions, which exist as rose red [Er(OH2)9]3+ hydration complexes:

:2 Er (s) + 3 H2SO4 (aq) → 2 Er3+ (aq) + 3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g)

=== Isotopes ===

Naturally occurring erbium is composed of 6 stable isotopes, Er, Er, Er, Er, Er, and Er, with Er being the most abundant (33.503% natural abundance). 32 radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being Er with a half-life of , Er with a half-life of , Er with a half-life of , Er with a half-life of , and Er with a half-life of . All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than , and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 4 minutes. This element also has 26 meta states, with the most stable being Er with a half-life of .

The isotopes of erbium range in Er to Er. The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, Er, is electron capture, and the primary mode after is beta decay. The primary decay products before Er are element 67 (holmium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element 69 (thulium) isotopes.

Er has been identified as useful for use in Auger therapy, as it decays via electron capture and emits no gamma radiation. It can also be used as a radioactive tracer to label antibodies and peptides, though it cannot be detected by any kind of imaging for the study of its biological distribution. The isotope can be produced via the bombardment of Er with Tm or Er with Ho, the latter of which is more convenient due to Ho being a stable primordial isotope, though it requires an initial supply of Er.

==Compounds==

===Oxides===

Erbium(III) oxide (also known as erbia) is the only known oxide of erbium, first isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1843, and first obtained in pure form in 1905 by Georges Urbain and Charles James. It has a cubic structure resembling the bixbyite motif. The Er3+ centers are octahedral. The formation of erbium oxide is accomplished by burning erbium metal, erbium oxalate or other oxyacid salts of erbium. Erbium oxide is insoluble in water and slightly soluble in heated mineral acids. The pink-colored compound is used as a phosphor activator and to produce infrared-absorbing glass.

===Halides===

Erbium(III) fluoride is a pinkish powder that can be produced by reacting erbium(III) nitrate and ammonium fluoride. It can be used to make infrared light-transmitting materials and up-converting luminescent materials, and is an intermediate in the production of erbium metal prior to its reduction with calcium. Erbium(III) chloride is a violet compounds that can be formed by first heating erbium(III) oxide and ammonium chloride to produce the ammonium salt of the pentachloride ([NH4]2ErCl5) then heating it in a vacuum at 350-400 °C. It forms crystals of the  type, with monoclinic crystals and the point group &quot;C&quot;2/m. Erbium(III) chloride hexahydrate also forms monoclinic crystals with the point group of &quot;P&quot;2/&quot;n&quot; (&quot;P&quot;2/&quot;c&quot;) - &quot;C&quot;42h. In this compound, erbium is octa-coordinated to form ions with the isolated completing the structure.

Erbium(III) bromide is a violet solid. It is used, like other metal bromide compounds, in water treatment, chemical analysis and for certain crystal growth applications. Erbium(III) iodide is a slightly pink compound that is insoluble in water. It can be prepared by directly reacting erbium with iodine.

===Organoerbium compounds===

Organoerbium compounds are very similar to those of the other lanthanides, as they all share an inability to undergo π backbonding. They are thus mostly restricted to the mostly ionic cyclopentadienides (isostructural with those of lanthanum) and the σ-bonded simple alkyls and aryls, some of which may be polymeric.

== History ==

Erbium (for Ytterby, a village in Sweden) was discovered by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1843. Mosander was working with a sample of what was thought to be the single metal oxide yttria, derived from the mineral gadolinite. He discovered that the sample contained at least two metal oxides in addition to pure yttria, which he named &quot;erbia&quot; and &quot;terbia&quot; after the village of Ytterby where the gadolinite had been found. Mosander was not certain of the purity of the oxides and later tests confirmed his uncertainty. Not only did the &quot;yttria&quot; contain yttrium, erbium, and terbium; in the ensuing years, chemists, geologists and spectroscopists discovered five additional elements: ytterbium, scandium, thulium, holmium, and gadolinium.

Erbia and terbia, however, were confused at this time. Marc Delafontaine, a Swiss spectroscopist, mistakenly switched the names of the two elements in his work separating the oxides erbia and terbia. After 1860, terbia was renamed erbia and after 1877 what had been known as erbia was renamed terbia. Fairly pure Er2O3 was independently isolated in 1905 by Georges Urbain and Charles James. Reasonably pure erbium metal was not produced until 1934 when Wilhelm Klemm and Heinrich Bommer reduced the anhydrous chloride with potassium vapor.

== Occurrence ==

The concentration of erbium in the Earth crust is about 2.8 mg/kg and in seawater 0.9 ng/L. (Concentration of less abundant elements may vary with location by several orders of magnitude making the relative abundance unreliable). Like other rare earths, this element is never found as a free element in nature but is found in monazite and bastnäsite ores. It has historically been very difficult and expensive to separate rare earths from each other in their ores but ion-exchange chromatography methods developed in the late 20th century have greatly reduced the cost of production of all rare-earth metals and their chemical compounds.

The principal commercial sources of erbium are from the minerals xenotime and euxenite, and most recently, the ion adsorption clays of southern China. Consequently, China has now become the principal global supplier of this element. In the high-yttrium versions of these ore concentrates, yttrium is about two-thirds of the total by weight, and erbia is about 4–5%. When the concentrate is dissolved in acid, the erbia liberates enough erbium ion to impart a distinct and characteristic pink color to the solution. This color behavior is similar to what Mosander and the other early workers in the lanthanides saw in their extracts from the gadolinite minerals of Ytterby.

==Production==
Crushed minerals are attacked by hydrochloric or sulfuric acid that transforms insoluble rare-earth oxides into soluble chlorides or sulfates. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. The solution is treated with magnesium nitrate to produce a crystallized mixture of double salts of rare-earth metals. The salts are separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Erbium metal is obtained from its oxide or salts by heating with calcium at under argon atmosphere.

== Applications ==
===Lasers and optics===
A large variety of medical applications (i.e., dermatology, dentistry) utilize erbium ion&#x27;s emission (see ), which is highly absorbed in water (absorption coefficient about ). Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is necessary for laser surgery, and the efficient production of steam for laser enamel ablation in dentistry. Common applications of erbium lasers in dentistry include ceramic cosmetic dentistry and removal of brackets in orthodontic braces; such laser applications have been noted as more time-efficient than performing the same procedures with rotary dental instruments.

Erbium-doped optical silica-glass fibers are the active element in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), which are widely used in optical communications. The same fibers can be used to create fiber lasers. In order to work efficiently, erbium-doped fiber is usually co-doped with glass modifiers/homogenizers, often aluminium or phosphorus. These dopants help prevent clustering of Er ions and transfer the energy more efficiently between excitation light (also known as optical pump) and the signal. Co-doping of optical fiber with Er and Yb is used in high-power Er/Yb fiber lasers. Erbium can also be used in erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers.

===Other applications===
When added to vanadium as an alloy, erbium lowers hardness and improves workability. An erbium-nickel alloy Er3Ni has an unusually high specific heat capacity at liquid-helium temperatures and is used in cryocoolers; a mixture of 65% Er3Co and 35% Er0.9Yb0.1Ni by volume improves the specific heat capacity even more.

Erbium oxide has a pink color, and is sometimes used as a colorant for glass, cubic zirconia and porcelain. The glass is then often used in sunglasses and jewellery, or where infrared absorption is needed.

Erbium is used in nuclear technology in neutron-absorbing control rods. or as a burnable poison in nuclear fuel design.

==Biological role and precautions==
Erbium does not have a biological role, but erbium salts can stimulate metabolism. Humans consume 1 milligram of erbium a year on average. The highest concentration of erbium in humans is in the bones, but there is also erbium in the human kidneys and liver.

Erbium is slightly toxic if ingested, but erbium compounds are generally not toxic. Ionic erbium behaves similar to ionic calcium, and can potentially bind to proteins such as calmodulin. When introduced into the body, nitrates of erbium, similar to other rare earth nitrates, increase triglyceride levels in the liver and cause leakage of hepatic (liver-related) enzymes to the blood, though they uniquely (along with gadolinium and dysprosium nitrates) increase RNA polymerase II activity. Ingestion and inhalation are the main routes of exposure to erbium and other rare earths, as they do not diffuse through unbroken skin.

Metallic erbium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard.

<text>Einsteinium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Es and atomic number 99. It is named after Albert Einstein and is a member of the actinide series and the seventh transuranium element. 

Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952. Its most common isotope, einsteinium-253 (Es; half-life 20.47 days), is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but in much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Due to the small amounts of einsteinium produced and the short half-life of its most common isotope, there are no practical applications for it except basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.

Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, paramagnetic metal. Its chemistry is typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of Es produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 watts per gram. Studying its properties is difficult due to Es&#x27;s decay to berkelium-249 and then californium-249 at a rate of about 3% per day. The longest-lived isotope of einsteinium, Es (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, not in bulk. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form as einsteinium-253.

Like all synthetic transuranium elements, isotopes of einsteinium are very radioactive and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion.

==History==

Einsteinium was first identified in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at University of California, Berkeley in collaboration with the Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, in the fallout from the &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; nuclear test. The test was done on November 1, 1952, at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a thermonuclear weapon. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, , which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays.
:&lt;chem&gt;^{238}_{92}U -&gt;[\ce{+ 6(n,\gamma)}][-2\ \beta^-]{} ^{244}_{94}Pu&lt;/chem&gt;
At the time, the multiple neutron absorption was thought to be an extremely rare process, but the identification of Pu indicated that still more neutrons could have been captured by the uranium, producing new elements heavier than californium.
Ghiorso and co-workers analyzed filter papers which had been flown through the explosion cloud on airplanes (the same sampling technique that had been used to discover Pu). Larger amounts of radioactive material were later isolated from coral debris of the atoll, and these were delivered to the U.S. The separation of suspected new elements was carried out in the presence of a citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH ≈ 3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperatures; fewer than 200 atoms of einsteinium were recovered in the end. Nevertheless, element 99, einsteinium, and in particular Es, could be detected via its characteristic high-energy alpha decay at 6.6 MeV. It was produced by the capture of 15 neutrons by uranium-238 nuclei followed by seven beta decays, and had a half-life of 20.5 days. Such multiple neutron absorption was made possible by the high neutron flux density during the detonation, so that newly generated heavy isotopes had plenty of available neutrons to absorb before they could disintegrate into lighter elements. Neutron capture initially raised the mass number without changing the atomic number of the nuclide, and the concomitant beta-decays resulted in a gradual increase in the atomic number:
:&lt;chem&gt;
^{238}_{92}U -&gt;[\ce{+15n}][6 \beta^-] ^{253}_{98}Cf -&gt;[\beta^-] ^{253}_{99}Es
&lt;/chem&gt;

Some U atoms, however, could absorb two additional neutrons (for a total of 17), resulting in Es, as well as in the Fm isotope of another new element, fermium. The discovery of the new elements and the associated new data on multiple neutron capture were initially kept secret on the orders of the U.S. military until 1955 due to Cold War tensions and competition with Soviet Union in nuclear technologies. However, the rapid capture of so many neutrons would provide needed direct experimental confirmation of the r-process multi-neutron absorption needed to explain the cosmic nucleosynthesis (production) of certain heavy elements (heavier than nickel) in supernovas, before beta decay. Such a process is needed to explain the existence of many stable elements in the universe.

Meanwhile, isotopes of element 99 (as well as of new element 100, fermium) were produced in the Berkeley and Argonne laboratories, in a nuclear reaction between nitrogen-14 and uranium-238, and later by intense neutron irradiation of plutonium or californium:
:&lt;chem&gt;^{252}_{98}Cf -&gt;[\ce{(n,\gamma)}] ^{253}_{98}Cf -&gt;[\beta^-][17.81 \ce{d}] ^{253}_{99}Es -&gt;[\ce{(n,\gamma)}] ^{254}_{99}Es -&gt;[\beta^-] ^{254}_{100}Fm&lt;/chem&gt;

These results were published in several articles in 1954 with the disclaimer that these were not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements. The Berkeley team also reported some results on the chemical properties of einsteinium and fermium. The &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; results were declassified and published in 1955.
In their discovery of elements 99 and 100, the American teams had competed with a group at the Nobel Institute for Physics, Stockholm, Sweden. In late 1953 – early 1954, the Swedish group succeeded in synthesizing light isotopes of element 100, in particular Fm, by bombarding uranium with oxygen nuclei. These results were also published in 1954. Nevertheless, the priority of the Berkeley team was generally recognized, as its publications preceded the Swedish article, and they were based on the previously undisclosed results of the 1952 thermonuclear explosion; thus the Berkeley team was given the privilege to name the new elements. As the effort which had led to the design of &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; was codenamed Project PANDA, element 99 had been jokingly nicknamed &quot;Pandemonium&quot; but the official names suggested by the Berkeley group derived from two prominent scientists, Einstein and Fermi: &quot;We suggest for the name for the element with the atomic number 99, einsteinium (symbol E) after Albert Einstein and for the name for the element with atomic number 100, fermium (symbol Fm), after Enrico Fermi.&quot; Both Einstein and Fermi died between the time the names were originally proposed and when they were announced. The discovery of these new elements was announced by Albert Ghiorso at the first Geneva Atomic Conference held on 8–20 August 1955. The symbol for einsteinium was first given as &quot;E&quot; and later changed to &quot;Es&quot; by IUPAC.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===

Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery, radioactive metal. In the periodic table, it is located to the right of the actinide californium, to the left of the actinide fermium and below the lanthanide holmium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84 g/cm is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79 g/cm), despite einsteinium being much heavier per atom than holmium. Einsteinium&#x27;s melting point (860 °C) is also relatively low – below californium (900 °C), fermium (1527 °C) and holmium (1461 °C). Einsteinium is a soft metal, with a bulk modulus of only 15 GPa, one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.

Unlike the lighter actinides californium, berkelium, curium and americium, which crystallize in a double hexagonal structure at ambient conditions; einsteinium is believed to have a face-centered cubic (&quot;fcc&quot;) symmetry with the space group &quot;Fm&quot;&quot;m&quot; and the lattice constant . However, there is a report of room-temperature hexagonal einsteinium metal with and , which converted to the &quot;fcc&quot; phase upon heating to 300 °C.

The self-damage induced by the radioactivity of einsteinium is so strong that it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, due to the small size of available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus, surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point.

The metal is trivalent and has a noticeably high volatility. In order to reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid einsteinium and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing. Also, some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant gas, for example HO+HCl for EsOCl so that the sample is partly regrown during its decomposition.

Apart from the self-destruction of solid einsteinium and its compounds, other intrinsic difficulties in studying this element include scarcity – the most common Es isotope is available only once or twice a year in sub-milligram amounts – and self-contamination due to rapid conversion of einsteinium to berkelium and then to californium at a rate of about 3.3% per day:
:&lt;chem&gt;
^{253}_{99}Es -&gt;[\alpha][20 \ce{d}] ^{249}_{97}Bk -&gt;[\beta^-][314 \ce{d}] ^{249}_{98}Cf
&lt;/chem&gt;

Thus, most einsteinium samples are contaminated, and their intrinsic properties are often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time. Other experimental techniques to circumvent the contamination problem include selective optical excitation of einsteinium ions by a tunable laser, such as in studying its luminescence properties.

Magnetic properties have been studied for einsteinium metal, its oxide and fluoride. All three materials showed Curie–Weiss paramagnetic behavior from liquid helium to room temperature. The effective magnetic moments were deduced as for EsO and for the EsF, which are the highest values among actinides, and the corresponding Curie temperatures are 53 and 37 K.

===Chemical===
Like all actinides, einsteinium is rather reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induces a pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in the solid phase; such +2 state is not observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride.

===Isotopes===

Eighteen isotopes and four nuclear isomers are known for einsteinium, with mass numbers 240–257. All are radioactive; the most stable one, Es, has half-life 471.7 days. The next most stable isotopes are Es (half-life 275.7 days), Es (39.8 days), and Es (20.47 days). All the other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 40 hours, most shorter than 30 minutes. Of the five isomers, the most stable is Es with a half-life of 39.3 hours.

===Nuclear fission===
Einsteinium has a high rate of nuclear fission that results in a low critical mass. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of Es, and can be lowered to 2.9 kg by adding a 30-centimeter-thick steel neutron reflector, or even to 2.26 kg with a 20-cm-thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass far exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated so far, especially of the rare Es.

===Natural occurrence===
Due to the short half-life of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium—that is, einsteinium that could have been present on Earth at its formation—has long since decayed. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally-occurring uranium and thorium in the Earth&#x27;s crust requires multiple neutron capture, an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all einsteinium on Earth is produced in laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or nuclear testing, and exists only within a few years from the time of the synthesis.

The transuranic elements americium to fermium, including einsteinium, were once created in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but any quantities produced then would have long since decayed away.

Einsteinium was theoretically observed in the spectrum of Przybylski&#x27;s Star. However, the lead author of the studies finding einsteinium and other short-lived actinides in Przybylski&#x27;s Star, Vera F. Gopka, admitted that &quot;the position of lines of the radioactive elements under search were simply visualized in synthetic spectrum as vertical markers because there are not any atomic data for these lines except for their wavelengths (Sansonetti et al. 2004), enabling one to calculate their profiles with more or less real intensities.&quot; The signature spectra of einsteinium&#x27;s isotopes have since been comprehensively analyzed experimentally (in 2021), though there is no published research confirming whether the theorized einsteinium signatures proposed to be found in the star&#x27;s spectrum match the lab-determined results.

==Synthesis and extraction==

Einsteinium is produced in minute quantities by bombarding lighter actinides with neutrons in dedicated high-flux nuclear reactors. The world&#x27;s major irradiation sources are the 85-megawatt High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Tennessee, U.S., and the SM-2 loop reactor at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Russia, which are both dedicated to the production of transcurium (&quot;Z&quot;&gt;96) elements. These facilities have similar power and flux levels, and are expected to have comparable production capacities for transcurium elements, though the quantities produced at NIIAR are not widely reported. In a &quot;typical processing campaign&quot; at ORNL, tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium, milligrams of berkelium (Bk) and einsteinium and picograms of fermium.

The first microscopic sample of Es sample weighing about 10 nanograms was prepared in 1961 at HFIR. A special magnetic balance was designed to estimate its weight. Larger batches were produced later starting from several kilograms of plutonium with the einsteinium yields (mostly Es) of 0.48 milligram in 1967–1970, 3.2 milligrams in 1971–1973, followed by steady production of about 3 milligrams per year between 1974 and 1978. These quantities however refer to the integral amount in the target right after irradiation. Subsequent separation procedures reduced the amount of isotopically pure einsteinium roughly tenfold.

===Laboratory synthesis===
Heavy neutron irradiation of plutonium results in four major isotopes of einsteinium: Es (α-emitter; half-life 20.47 days, spontaneous fission half-life 7×10 years); Es (β-emitter, half-life 39.3 hours), Es (α-emitter, half-life 276 days) and Es (β-emitter, half-life 39.8 days). An alternative route involves bombardment of uranium-238 with high-intensity nitrogen or oxygen ion beams.

Es (half-life 4.55 min) was produced by irradiating Am with carbon or U with nitrogen ions. The latter reaction was first realized in 1967 in Dubna, Russia, and the involved scientists were awarded the Lenin Komsomol Prize.

Es was produced by irradiating Cf with deuterium ions. It mainly β-decays to Cf with a half-life of minutes, but also releases 6.87-MeV α-particles; the ratio of β&#x27;s to α-particles is about 400.
:formula_1

Es were obtained by bombarding Bk with α-particles. One to four neutrons are released, so four different isotopes are formed in one reaction.
:&lt;chem&gt;^{249}_{97}Bk -&gt;[+\alpha] ^{249,250,251,252}_{99}Es&lt;/chem&gt;

Es was produced by irradiating a 0.1–0.2 milligram Cf target with a thermal neutron flux of (2–5)×10 neutrons/(cm·s) for 500–900 hours:
:&lt;chem&gt;^{252}_{98}Cf -&gt;[\ce{(n,\gamma)}] ^{253}_{98}Cf -&gt;[\beta^-][17.81 \ce{d}] ^{253}_{99}Es&lt;/chem&gt;

In 2020, scientists at ORNL created about 200 nanograms of Es; allowing some chemical properties of the element to be studied for the first time.

===Synthesis in nuclear explosions===

The analysis of the debris at the 10-megaton &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; nuclear test was a part of long-term project. One of the goals was studying the efficiency of production of transuranic elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motive for these experiments was that synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful man-made neutron sources, providing densities of the order 10 neutrons/cm within a microsecond, or about 10 neutrons/(cm·s). In comparison, the flux of HFIR is 5 neutrons/(cm·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at Enewetak Atoll for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the mainland U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, none of these were found even after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.

The atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, as it was hoped that powerful explosions in a confined space might give improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.

Of the nine underground tests between 1962 and 1969, the last one was the most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranics. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond. However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only ~4 of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only ~1 of the total charge. The amount of transuranic elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4-kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which showed the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranics yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds of kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.

Though no new elements (except einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranics were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.

===Separation===

Separation procedure of einsteinium depends on the synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target is attached to a thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.

Trivalent actinides can be separated from lanthanide fission products by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) as eluant. It is usually followed by anion-exchange chromatography using 6 molar HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with ammonium salts is then used to separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position/time, using α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB), for example, as eluant.

The 3+ actinides can also be separated via solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.

===Preparation of the metal===
Einsteinium is highly reactive, so strong reducing agents are required to obtain the pure metal from its compounds. This can be achieved by reduction of einsteinium(III) fluoride with metallic lithium:
:EsF + 3 Li → Es + 3 LiF

However, owing to its low melting point and high rate of self-radiation damage, einsteinium has a higher vapor pressure than lithium fluoride. This makes this reduction reaction rather inefficient. It was tried in the early preparation attempts and quickly abandoned in favor of reduction of einsteinium(III) oxide with lanthanum metal:
:EsO + 2 La → 2 Es + LaO

==Chemical compounds==

===Oxides===
Einsteinium(III) oxide (EsO) was obtained by burning einsteinium(III) nitrate. It forms colorless cubic crystals, which were first characterized from microgram samples sized about 30 nanometers. Two other phases, monoclinic and hexagonal, are known for this oxide. The formation of a certain EsO phase depends on the preparation technique and sample history, and there is no clear phase diagram. Interconversions between the three phases can occur spontaneously, as a result of self-irradiation or self-heating. The hexagonal phase is isotypic with lanthanum oxide where the Es ion is surrounded by a 6-coordinated group of O ions.

===Halides===
Einsteinium halides are known for the oxidation states +2 and +3. The most stable state is +3 for all halides from fluoride to iodide.

Einsteinium(III) fluoride (EsF) can be precipitated from Es(III) chloride solutions upon reaction with fluoride ions. An alternative preparation procedure is to exposure Es(III) oxide to chlorine trifluoride (ClF) or F gas at a pressure of 1–2 atmospheres and temperature 300–400°C. The EsF crystal structure is hexagonal, as in californium(III) fluoride (CfF) where the Es ions are 8-fold coordinated by fluorine ions in a bicapped trigonal prism arrangement.

Es(III) chloride (EsCl) can be prepared by annealing Es(III) oxide in the atmosphere of dry hydrogen chloride vapors at about 500°C for some 20 minutes. It crystallizes upon cooling at about 425°C into an orange solid with a hexagonal structure of UCl type, where einsteinium atoms are 9-fold coordinated by chlorine atoms in a tricapped trigonal prism geometry. Einsteinium(III) bromide (EsBr) is a pale-yellow solid with a monoclinic structure of AlCl type, where the einsteinium atoms are octahedrally coordinated by bromine (coordination number 6).

The divalent compounds of einsteinium are obtained by reducing the trivalent halides with hydrogen:
:2 EsX + H → 2 EsX + 2 HX; X = F, Cl, Br, I

Einsteinium(II) chloride (EsCl), einsteinium(II) bromide (EsBr), and einsteinium(II) iodide (EsI) have been produced and characterized by optical absorption, with no structural information available yet.

Known oxyhalides of einsteinium include EsOCl, EsOBr and EsOI. These salts are synthesized by treating a trihalide with a vapor mixture of water and the corresponding hydrogen halide: for example, EsCl + HO/HCl to obtain EsOCl.

===Organoeinsteinium compounds===
Einsteinium&#x27;s high radioactivity has a potential use in radiation therapy, and organometallic complexes have been synthesized in order to deliver einsteinium to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium citrate (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs. Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into β-diketone chelate complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate during the 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for americium, berkelium and fermium.

Luminescence of Es ions was however observed in inorganic hydrochloric acid solutions as well as in organic solution with di(2-ethylhexyl)orthophosphoric acid. It shows a broad peak at about 1064 nanometers (half-width about 100 nm) which can be resonantly excited by green light (ca. 495 nm wavelength). The luminescence has a lifetime of several microseconds and the quantum yield below 0.1%. The relatively high, compared to lanthanides, non-radiative decay rates in Es were associated with the stronger interaction of f-electrons with the inner Es electrons.

==Applications==
There is almost no use for any isotope of einsteinium outside basic scientific research aiming at production of higher transuranium elements and superheavy elements.

In 1955, mendelevium was synthesized by irradiating a target consisting of about 10 atoms of Es in the 60-inch cyclotron at Berkeley Laboratory. The resulting Es(α,n)Md reaction yielded 17 atoms of the new element with the atomic number of 101.

The rare isotope Es is favored for production of superheavy elements due to its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms. Hence Es was used as a target in the attempted synthesis of ununennium (element 119) in 1985 by bombarding it with calcium-48 ions at the superHILAC linear particle accelerator at Berkeley, California. No atoms were identified, setting an upper limit for the cross section of this reaction at 300 nanobarns.
:&lt;chem&gt;{^{254}_{99}Es} + {^{48}_{20}Ca} -&gt; {^{302}_{119}Uue^\ast} -&gt; no\ atoms&lt;/chem&gt;
Es was used as the calibration marker in the chemical analysis spectrometer (&quot;alpha-scattering surface analyzer&quot;) of the Surveyor 5 lunar probe. The large mass of this isotope reduced the spectral overlap between signals from the marker and the studied lighter elements of the lunar surface.

==Safety==
Most of the available einsteinium toxicity data is from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only ~0.01% of it ends in the bloodstream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it would remain for ~50 years if not for its radioactive decay, not to speak of the 3-year maximum lifespan of rats, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life ~20 years, though this is again rendered irrelevant by the short half-life of einsteinium), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested amount is excreted. The distribution of einsteinium over bone surfaces is uniform and is similar to that of plutonium.

<text>Edmund Rüdiger Stoiber (born 28 September 1941) is a German politician who served as the 16th minister-president of the state of Bavaria between 1993 and 2007 and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) between 1999 and 2007. In 2002, he ran for the office of Chancellor of Germany in the federal election, and in one of the narrowest elections in German history lost against Gerhard Schröder. On 18 January 2007, he announced that he would step down as minister-president and as party chairman by 30 September, after having been under fire in his own party for weeks.

==Early life==
Stoiber was born in Oberaudorf in the district of Rosenheim in Bavaria. Prior to entering politics in 1974 and serving in the Bavarian Parliament, he was a lawyer and worked at the University of Regensburg.

==Education and profession==
Stoiber attended the Ignaz-Günther-Gymnasium in Rosenheim, where he received his &quot;Abitur&quot; (high school diploma) in 1961, although he had to repeat one year for failing Latin. His military service was with the 1st Gebirgsdivision (mountain infantry division) in Mittenwald and Bad Reichenhall and was cut short due to a knee injury. Stoiber then studied political science and (from the fall of 1962) law at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. In 1967, he passed the state law exam and then worked at the University of Regensburg in criminal law and Eastern European law. He received a doctorate in jurisprudence, and then in 1971 passed the second state examination with distinction.

In 1971, Stoiber joined the Bavarian State Ministry of Development and Environment.

==Political career==
In 1978, Stoiber was elected secretary general of the CSU, a post he held until 1982/83. In this capacity, he served as campaign manager of Franz-Josef Strauss, the first Bavarian leader to run for the chancellorship, in the 1980 national elections. From 1982 to 1986 he served as deputy to the Bavarian secretary of the state and then, in the position of State Minister, led the State Chancellery from 1982 to 1988. From 1988 to 1993 he served as State Minister of the Interior.

===Minister-President of Bavaria, 1993–2007===
In May 1993, the Landtag of Bavaria, the state&#x27;s parliament, elected Stoiber as Minister-President succeeding Max Streibl. He came to power amid a political crisis involving a sex scandal, surrounding a contender for the state premiership. Upon taking office, he nominated Strauss&#x27; daughter Monika Hohlmeier as State Minister for Education and Cultural Affairs.

In his capacity as Minister-President, Stoiber served as President of the Bundesrat in 1995/96. In 1998, he also succeeded Theo Waigel as chairman of the CSU.

During Stoiber&#x27;s 14 years leading Bavaria, the state solidified its position as one of Germany&#x27;s richest. Already by 1998, under his leadership, the state had privatized more than $3 billion worth of state-owned businesses and used that money to invest in new infrastructure and provide venture capital for new companies. He was widely regarded a central figure in building one of Europe&#x27;s most powerful regional economies, attracting thousands of hi-tech, engineering and media companies and reducing unemployment to half the national average.

===Candidate for Chancellor, 2002===
In 2002, Stoiber politically outmaneuvered CDU chairwoman, Angela Merkel, and was declared the CDU/CSU&#x27;s candidate for the office of chancellor by practically the entire leadership of the CSU&#x27;s sister party CDU, challenging Gerhard Schröder. At that time, Merkel had generally been seen as a transitional chair and was strongly opposed by the CDU&#x27;s male leaders, often called the party&#x27;s &quot;crown princess&quot;.

In the run up to the 2002 national elections, the CSU/CDU held a huge lead in the opinion polls and Stoiber famously remarked that &quot;...this election is like a football match where it&#x27;s the second half and my team is ahead by 2–0.&quot; However, on election day things had changed. The SPD had mounted a huge comeback, and the CDU/CSU was narrowly defeated (though both the SPD and CDU/CSU had 38.5% of the vote, the SPD was ahead by a small 6,000 vote margin, winning 251 seats to the CDU/CSU&#x27;s 248). The election was one of modern Germany&#x27;s closest votes.

Gerhard Schröder was re-elected as chancellor by the parliament in a coalition with the Greens, who had increased their vote share marginally. Many commentators faulted Stoiber&#x27;s reaction to the floods in eastern Germany, in the run-up to the election, as a contributory factor in his party&#x27;s poor electoral result and defeat. In addition, Schröder distinguished himself from his opponent by taking an active stance against the upcoming United States-led Iraq War. His extensive campaigning on this stance was widely seen as swinging the election to the SPD in the weeks running up to the election.

===Later political career===
Stoiber subsequently led the CSU to an absolute majority in the 2003 Bavarian state elections, for the third time in a row, winning this time 60.7% of the votes and a two-thirds majority in the Landtag. This was the widest margin ever achieved by a German party in any state.

Between 2003 and 2004, Stoiber served as co-chair (alongside Franz Müntefering) of the First Commission on the modernization of the federal state (&quot;Föderalismuskommission I&quot;), which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany. In February 2004, he became a candidate of Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder for the presidency of the European Commission but he decided not to run for this office.

Stoiber had ambitions to run again for the chancellorship, but Merkel secured the nomination, and in November 2005 she won the general election. He was slated to join Merkel&#x27;s first grand coalition cabinet as Economics minister. However, on 1 November 2005, he announced his decision to stay in Bavaria, due to personnel changes on the SPD side of the coalition (Franz Müntefering resigned as SPD chairman) and an unsatisfactory apportionment of competences between himself and designated Science minister Annette Schavan. Stoiber also resigned his seat in the 16th Bundestag, being a member from 18 October to 8 November.

Subsequently, criticism grew in the CSU, where other politicians had to scale back their ambitions after Stoiber&#x27;s decision to stay in Bavaria. On 18 January 2007, he announced his decision to stand down from the posts of minister-president and party chairman by 30 September. Günther Beckstein, then Bavarian state minister of the interior, succeeded him as minister-president and Erwin Huber as party chairman, defeating Horst Seehofer at a convention at 18 September 2007 with 58,1% of the votes. Both Beckstein and Huber resigned after the 2008 state elections, in which the CSU vote dropped to 43,4% and the party had to form a coalition with another party for the first time since 1966.

==Life after politics==
Stoiber was first appointed in 2007 as a special adviser to European Commission President José Manuel Barroso to chair the &quot;High level group on administrative burdens&quot;, made up of national experts, NGOs, business and industry organizations. Quickly nicknamed the &quot;Stoiber Group&quot;, it produced a report in July 2014 with several proposals on streamlining the regulatory process. Stoiber was re-appointed in December 2014 by Jean-Claude Juncker to the same role, from which he resigned after one year in late 2015.

Since his retirement from German politics in 2007, Stoiber has worked as a lawyer and held paid and unpaid positions, including:

* Bundesliga Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Commerzbank, Member of the Central Advisory Board
* Deloitte Germany, chairman of the Advisory Board (since 2009)
* Donner &amp; Reuschel, Member of the Advisory Board
* FC Bayern Munich, Member of the Supervisory Board of the stock corporation and Chairman of the Advisory Board of the club.
* German-Russian Raw Materials Forum, Member of the Presidium
* Hanns Seidel Foundation, Member
* Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, Member of the Honorary Senate
* Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Munich Security Conference, Member of the Advisory Council
* Nürnberger Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft, Member of the Supervisory Board
* ProSiebenSat.1 Media, Member of the advisory board (since 2011)

Stoiber was a CSU delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2017.

==Political positions==

===Foreign policy===

In his capacity as Minister-President, Stoiber made 58 foreign trips, including to China (1995, 2003), Israel (2001), Egypt (2001), India (2004, 2007) and South Korea (2007).

In 2002, Stoiber publicly expressed support for the United States in their policy toward Iraq. During his election campaign, he made clear his opposition to war, and his support for the introduction of weapons inspectors to Iraq without preconditions as a way of avoiding war, and he criticized Schröder for harming the German-American alliance by not calling President George W. Bush and discussing the issue privately. He also attacked German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer for his criticism of the U.S. position.

Stoiber is known for backing Vladimir Putin and there have been comparisons to Gerhard Schröder. One author called Stoiber a &quot;Moscow&#x27;s Trojan Horse&quot;. Putin is known to have given Stoiber &quot;extreme forms of flattery&quot; and privileges such as a private dinner at Putin&#x27;s residence outside Moscow.

===European integration===
Stoiber has been said to be skeptical of Germany&#x27;s decision to adopt the euro. In 1997, he joined the minister-presidents of two other German states, Kurt Biedenkopf and Gerhard Schröder, in making the case for a five-year delay in Europe&#x27;s currency union. When the European Commission recommended that Greece be allowed to join the eurozone in 1998, he demanded that the country be barred from adopting the common currency for several years instead. He is a staunch opponent of Turkey&#x27;s integration into the European Union, claiming that its non-Christian culture would dilute the Union.
At the same time, Stoiber has repeatedly insisted he is a &quot;good European&quot; who is keen, for instance, on forging an EU-wide foreign policy, replete with a single European army. Earlier, in 1993, he had told German newspapers: &quot;I want a simple confederation. That means the nation-states maintain their dominant role, at least as far as internal matters are concerned.&quot;

===Economic policy===
While the conservative wing of the German political spectrum, primarily formed of the CDU and CSU, enjoys considerable support, this support tends to be less extended to Stoiber. He enjoys considerably more support in his home state of Bavaria than in the rest of Germany, where CDU chairwoman Angela Merkel is more popular. This has its reasons: Merkel supports a kind of fiscal conservatism, but a more liberal social policy. Stoiber, on the other hand, favors a more conservative approach to both fiscal and social matters, and while this ensures him the religious vote, strongest in Bavaria, it has weakened his support at the national level.

In 2005, Stoiber successfully lobbied Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, to move the headquarters of its Sandoz subsidiary to Munich, making it one of Europe&#x27;s highest-profile corporate relocations that year as well as a significant boost to Stoiber&#x27;s attempts to build up Bavaria as a pharmaceuticals and biotechnology center.

During his time as Minister-President of Bavaria, Stoiber pushed for the construction of a roughly 40-kilometer high-speed magnetic-levitation link from Munich&#x27;s main station to its airport, to be built by Transrapid International, a consortium including ThyssenKrupp and Munich-based Siemens. After he left office, the German federal government abandoned the plans in 2008 because of spiraling costs of as much as €3.4 billion.

===Domestic policy===
Stoiber, as a minister in the state of Bavaria, was widely known for advocating a reduction in the number of asylum seekers Germany accepts, something that prompted critics to label him xenophobic, anti-Turkish and anti-Islam. In the late 1990s, he criticized the incoming Chancellor Gerhard Schröder for saying that he would work hard in the interest of Germans &quot;and&quot; people living in Germany. Stoiber&#x27;s remarks drew heavy criticism in the press.

When Germany&#x27;s Federal Constitutional Court decided in 1995 that a Bavarian law requiring a crucifix to be hung in each of the state&#x27;s 40,000 classrooms was unconstitutional, Stoiber said he would not order the removal of crucifixes &quot;for the time being&quot;, and asserted that he was under no obligation to remove them in schools where parents unanimously opposed such action.

During his 2002 election campaign, Stoiber indicated he would not ban same-sex marriages—sanctioned by the Schröder government—a policy he had vehemently objected to when it was introduced.

===Media policy===
Stoiber has been a staunch advocate of changes in German law that would give more power to owners of private TV channels. In 1995, he publicly called for the abolition of Germany&#x27;s public television service ARD and a streamlining of its regional services, adding that he and Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf of Saxony would break the contract ARD has with regional governments if reforms were not undertaken. However, when European Commissioner for Competition Karel van Miert unveiled ideas for reforming the rules governing the financing of public service broadcasters in 1998, Stoiber led the way in rejecting moves to reform established practice.

==Controversies==

===Comments on East Germany===
During the run-up to the German general election in 2005, which was held ahead of schedule, Stoiber created controversy through a campaign speech held in the beginning of August 2005 in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg. He said, &quot;I do not accept that the East [of Germany] will again decide who will be Germany&#x27;s chancellor. It cannot be allowed that the frustrated determine Germany&#x27;s fate.&quot; People in the new federal states of Germany (the former German Democratic Republic) were offended by Stoiber&#x27;s remarks. While the CSU attempted to portray them as &quot;misinterpreted&quot;, Stoiber created further controversy when he claimed that &quot;if it was like Bavaria everywhere, there wouldn&#x27;t be any problems. But unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we have everywhere some sections of the populace not as intelligent as in Bavaria.&quot; The tone of the comments was exacerbated by a perception by some within Germany of the state of Bavaria as &quot;arrogant&quot;.

Many, including members of the CDU, attribute Stoiber&#x27;s comments and behavior as a contributing factor to the CDU&#x27;s losses in the 2005 general election. He was accused by many in the CDU/CSU of offering &quot;half-hearted&quot; support to Angela Merkel, with some even accusing him of being reluctant to support a female candidate from the East. (This also contrasted unfavorably with Merkel&#x27;s robust support for his candidacy in the 2002 election.) He has insinuated that votes were lost because of the choice of a female candidate. He came under heavy fire for these comments from press and politicians alike, especially since he himself lost almost 10% of the Bavarian vote—a dubious feat in itself as Bavarians tend to consistently vote conservatively. Nonetheless, a poll has suggested over 9% may have voted differently if the conservative candidate was a man from the West, although this does not clearly show if such a candidate would have gained or lost votes for the conservatives.

===BayernLB activities===
When the Croatian National Bank turned down BayernLB&#x27;s original bid to take over the local arm of Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International, this drew strong criticism from Stoiber, who said the decision was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and a &quot;severe strain&quot; for Bavaria&#x27;s relations with Croatia. Croatia was seeking to join the European Union at the time. The central bank&#x27;s board later reviewed and accepted BayernLB&#x27;s offer of 1.6 billion euros. The investment in Hypo Group Alpe Adria was part of a series of ill-fated investments, which later forced BayernLB to take a 10 billion-euro bailout in the financial crisis.

===Alleged intentions for a coup===
In Wolfgang Schäuble&#x27;s memoirs &quot;Erinnerungen. Mein Leben in der Politik&quot; (“Memories. My Life in Politics”), published posthumously in 2024, Schäuble claims that in 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis at the time, Stoiber tried to persuade him to overthrow Chancellor Angela Merkel, in order to become chancellor himself. Stoiber commented on that: “I have had as many personal and confidential conversations with few colleagues in my life from the 1980s until the last few years as with my long-standing and close colleague Wolfgang Schäuble. I have never commented on reports about it and of course that still applies to me today after his death.&quot;

==Personal life==
Stoiber is Roman Catholic. He is married to Karin Stoiber. They have three children: Constanze (born 1971, married &quot;Hausmann&quot;), Veronica (born 1977, married &quot;Saß&quot;), Dominic (born 1980) and five grandchildren: Johannes (1999), Benedikt (2001), Theresa Marie (2005), Ferdinand (2009) and another grandson (2011).

Stoiber is a keen football fan and operative. In his youth, he played for local football side BCF Wolfratshausen. Stoiber serves as Member of the Supervisory Board of FC Bayern München AG (the stock corporation that runs the professional football section) and Chairman of the Administrative Advisory Board of FC Bayern Munich e.V. (the club that owns the majority of the club corporation).

Before the 2002 election, FC Bayern general manager Uli Hoeneß expressed his support for Stoiber and the CSU. Football legend, former FC Bayern president and DFB vice president Franz Beckenbauer showed his support for Stoiber by letting him join the Germany national football team on their flight home from Japan after the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

<text>Erfurt() is the capital and largest city of the Central German state of Thuringia, with a population of around 216,000. It lies in the wide valley of the River Gera, in the southern part of the Thuringian Basin, north of the Thuringian Forest, and in the middle of a line of the six largest Thuringian cities (&quot;Thüringer Städtekette&quot;), stretching from Eisenach in the west, via Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar and Jena, to Gera in the east. Together with Kassel and Göttingen, it is one of the cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants lying closest to the geographic centre of Germany. Erfurt is south-west of Leipzig, north-east of Frankfurt, south-west of Berlin and north of Munich.

Erfurt&#x27;s old town is one of the best preserved medieval city centres in Germany. The Gera is spanned by the Merchants&#x27; Bridge (&quot;Krämerbrücke&quot;), one of the rare bridges with houses built on it. On the Erfurt Cathedral Hill is the ensemble of Erfurt Cathedral—which houses the world&#x27;s largest free-swinging medieval bell—and St Severus&#x27; Church. Petersberg Citadel is one of the largest and best preserved town fortresses in Central Europe. Erfurt&#x27;s Old Synagogue is the oldest synagogue in Europe, and together with the , which was only rediscovered in 2007, and the , forms the UNESCO World Heritage Site Jewish-Medieval Heritage of Erfurt.

The city&#x27;s economy is based on agriculture, horticulture and microelectronics. Its central location has made it a logistics hub for Germany and central Europe. Erfurt hosts the second-largest trade fair in eastern Germany (after Leipzig), as well as the public television children&#x27;s channel KiKa. The city is on the Via Regia, a medieval trade and pilgrims&#x27; road network. Erfurt Main Station is the junction of the Nuremberg–Erfurt and the Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed lines with the Halle–Bebra railway.

Erfurt was first mentioned in 742, as Saint Boniface founded the diocese. Although the town did not belong to any of the Thuringian states politically, it quickly became the economic centre of the region and was a member of the Hanseatic League. It was part of the Electorate of Mainz during the Holy Roman Empire, and became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1802. From 1949 until 1990 Erfurt was part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).

The University of Erfurt was founded in 1379, making it the first university to be established within the geographic area which constitutes modern Germany. It closed in 1816 and was re-established in 1994. Martin Luther (1483–1546) was its most famous student, studying there from 1501 before entering St Augustine&#x27;s Monastery in 1505. Other noted Erfurters include the medieval philosopher and mystic Meister Eckhart (c. 1260–1328), the Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel (1653–1706) and the sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920).

== History ==
=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
To the west of Erfurt in Frienstedt existed, in the AD era, a big Germanic village, which was found during the construction of a highway. Where they also discovered the oldest Germanic word ever discovered in Central Germany written in runic script was found on a comb from a sacrificial shaft the word: &quot;kaba&quot;. From Roman Times, however, they found 200 coins dating back to the third century, plus 150 Roman ceramic fragments and more than 200 fibulae. Also 11 inhumation graves of the Haßleben-Leuna group, which is an archeological cultural group.

The Melchendorf dig in the southern city part showed a settlement from the neolithic period. The Thuringii inhabited the Erfurt area in &quot;c.&quot; 480 and gave their name to Thuringia in &quot;c.&quot; 500.

=== Middle Ages ===

The town is first mentioned in 742 under the name of &quot;Erphesfurt&quot;: in that year, Saint Boniface wrote to Pope Zachary to inform him that he had established three dioceses in central Germany, one of them &quot;in a place called Erphesfurt, which for a long time has been inhabited by pagan natives.&quot; All three dioceses (the other two were Würzburg and Büraburg) were confirmed by Zachary the next year, though in 755 Erfurt was brought into the diocese of Mainz. That the place was populous already is borne out by archeological evidence, which includes 23 graves and six horse burials from the sixth and seventh centuries.

Throughout the Middle Ages, Erfurt was an important trading town because of its location, near a ford across the Gera river. Together with the other five Thuringian woad towns of Gotha, Tennstedt, Arnstadt and Langensalza it was the centre of the German woad trade, which made those cities very wealthy. Erfurt was the junction of important trade routes: the Via Regia was one of the most used east–west roads between France and Russia (via Frankfurt, Erfurt, Leipzig and Wrocław) and another route in the north–south direction was the connection between the Baltic Sea ports (e. g. Lübeck) and the potent upper Italian city-states like Venice and Milan.

During the tenth and eleventh centuries both the Emperor and the Electorate of Mainz held some privileges in Erfurt. The German kings had an important monastery on Petersberg hill and the Archbishops of Mainz collected taxes from the people. Around 1100, some people became free citizens by paying the annual &quot;&quot; (liberation tax), which marks a first step in becoming an independent city. During the 12th century, as a sign of more and more independence, the citizens built a city wall around Erfurt (in the area of today&#x27;s ). After 1200, independence was fulfilled and a city council was founded in 1217; the town hall was built in 1275. In the following decades, the council bought a city-owned territory around Erfurt which consisted at its height of nearly 100 villages and castles and even another small town (Sömmerda). Erfurt became an important regional power between the Landgraviate of Thuringia around, the Electorate of Mainz to the west and the Electorate of Saxony to the east. Between 1306 and 1481, Erfurt was allied with the two other major Thuringian cities (Mühlhausen and Nordhausen) in the Thuringian City Alliance and the three cities joined the Hanseatic League together in 1430. A peak in economic development was reached in the 15th century, when the city had a population of 20,000 making it one of the largest in Germany. Between 1432 and 1446, a second and higher city wall was established. In 1483, a first city fortress was built on Cyriaksburg hill in the southwestern part of the town.

In the year 1184, Erfurt was the location of a notable accident called the &quot;Erfurter Latrinensturz&quot; (&#x27;Erfurt latrine fall&#x27;). King Henry VI held council in a building of the Erfurt Cathedral to negotiate peace between two of his vassals, Archbishop Konrad I of Mainz and Landgrave Ludwig III of Thuringia. The amassed weight of all the gathered men proved too heavy for the floor to bear, which collapsed. According to contemporary accounts, dozens of people fell to their death into the latrine pit below. Ludwig III, Konrad I and Henry VI survived the affair.

The Jewish community of Erfurt was founded in the 11th century. Together with the Jewish communities in Mainz, Worms and Speyer, it became one of the most influential in Germany. The Old Synagogue is still extant and is a museum today, as is the mikveh at Gera river near . In 1349, during the wave of Black Death Jewish persecutions across Europe, the Jews of Erfurt were rounded up, with more than 100 killed and the rest driven from the city. Before the persecution, a wealthy Jewish merchant buried his property in the basement of his house. In 1998, this treasure was found during construction works. The Erfurt Treasure with various gold and silver objects is shown in the exhibition in the synagogue today. Only a few years after 1349, the Jews moved back to Erfurt and founded a second community, which was disbanded by the city council in 1454. Because of their exceptional testimony to the life of a medieval Jewish community, the Jewish sites in Erfurt were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2023.

In 1379, the University of Erfurt was founded. Together with the University of Cologne it was one of the first city-owned universities in Germany, while they were usually owned by the &quot;&quot;. Some buildings of this old university are extant or restored in the &quot;Latin Quarter&quot; in the northern city centre (like , student dorms &quot; and others, the hospital and the church of the university). The university quickly became a hotspot of German cultural life in Renaissance humanism with scholars like Ulrich von Hutten, Helius Eobanus Hessus and Justus Jonas.

=== Early modern period ===

In 1501 Martin Luther (1483–1546) moved to Erfurt and began his studies at the university. After 1505, he lived at St. Augustine&#x27;s Monastery as a friar. In 1507 he was ordained as a priest in Erfurt Cathedral. He moved permanently to Wittenberg in 1511. Erfurt was an early adopter of the Protestant Reformation, in 1521.

In 1530, the city became one of the first in Europe to be officially bi-confessional with the Hammelburg Treaty. It kept that status through all the following centuries. The later 16th and the 17th century brought a slow economic decline of Erfurt. Trade shrank, the population was falling and the university lost its influence. The city&#x27;s independence was endangered. In 1664, the city and surrounding area were brought under the dominion of the Electorate of Mainz and the city lost its independence. The Electorate built a huge fortress on Petersberg hill between 1665 and 1726 to control the city and instituted a governor to rule Erfurt.

In 1682 and 1683 Erfurt experienced the worst plague years in its history. In 1683 more than half of the population died because of the deadly disease.

In Erfurt witch-hunts are known to have taken place from 1526 to 1705. Trial records are incomplete. Twenty people were involved in witch trials and at least eight people died.

During the late 18th century, Erfurt saw another cultural peak. Governor Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg had close relations with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Johann Gottfried Herder, Christoph Martin Wieland and Wilhelm von Humboldt, who often visited him at his court in Erfurt.

=== Erfurt during the Napoleonic Wars ===
Erfurt became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1802, to compensate for territories Prussia lost to France on the Left Bank of the Rhine. In the Capitulation of Erfurt, the city, its 12,000 Prussian and Saxon defenders under William VI, Prince of Orange-Nassau, 65 artillery pieces, and the Petersberg Citadel and Cyriaksburg Citadel Cyriaksburg, were handed over to the French on 16 October 1806.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petre 1907/1993&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the capitulation, Joachim Murat, Marshal of France, had about 16,000 troops near Erfurt. With the attachment of the Saxe-Weimar territory of Blankenhain, the city became part of the First French Empire in 1806 as the Principality of Erfurt, directly subordinate to Napoleon as an &quot;imperial state domain&quot; (), separate from the Confederation of the Rhine, which the surrounding Thuringian states had joined. Erfurt was administered by a civilian and military Senate (&quot;&quot;) under a French governor, based in the , previously the seat of the city&#x27;s governor under the Electorate. Napoleon first visited the principality on 23 July 1807, inspecting the citadels and fortifications. In 1808, the Congress of Erfurt was held with Napoleon and Alexander I of Russia visiting the city.

During their administration, the French introduced street lighting and a tax on foreign horses to pay for maintaining the road surface. The suffered under the French occupation, with its inventory being auctioned off to other local churches – including the organ, bells and even the tower of the chapel (&quot;&quot;) – and the former monastery&#x27;s library being donated to the University of Erfurt (and then to the Boineburg Library when the university closed in 1816). Similarly the Cyriaksburg Citadel was damaged by the French, with the city-side walls being partially dismantled in the hunt for imagined treasures from the convent, workers being paid from the sale of the building materials.

In 1811, to commemorate the birth of the Prince Imperial, a ceremonial column (&#x27;) of wood and plaster was erected on the common. Similarly, the &#x27; – a Greek-style temple topped by a winged victory with shield, sword and lance and containing a bust of Napoleon sculpted by Friedrich Döll – was erected in the &#x27; woods, including a grotto with fountain and flower beds, using a large pond (&#x27;) from the , inaugurated with ceremony on 14 August 1811 after extravagant celebrations for Napoleon&#x27;s birthday, which were repeated in 1812 with a concert in the conducted by Louis Spohr.

With the Sixth Coalition forming after French defeat in Russia, on 24 February 1813 Napoleon ordered the Petersburg Citadel to prepare for siege, visiting the city on 25 April to inspect the fortifications, in particular both Citadels. On 10 July 1813, Napoleon put , baron of the Empire, in charge of the defences of Erfurt. However, when the French decreed that 1000 men would be conscripted into the , the recruits were joined by other citizens in rioting on 19 July that led to 20 arrests, of whom 2 were sentenced to death by French court-martial; as a result, the French ordered the closure of all inns and alehouses.

Within a week of the Sixth Coalition&#x27;s decisive victory at Leipzig (16–19 October 1813), however, Erfurt was besieged by Prussian, Austrian and Russian troops under the command of Prussian Lt Gen von Kleist. After a first capitulation signed by d&#x27;Alton on 20 December 1813 the French troops withdrew to the two fortresses of Petersberg and Cyriaksburg, allowing for the Coalition forces to march into Erfurt on 6 January 1814 to jubilant greetings; the &#x27; ceremonial column was burned and destroyed as a symbol of the citizens&#x27; oppression under the French; similarly the &#x27; was burned on 1 November 1813 and completely destroyed by Erfurters and their besiegers in 1814. After a call for volunteers 3 days later, 300 Erfurters joined the Coalition armies in France. Finally, in May 1814, the French capitulated fully, with 1,700 French troops vacating the Petersberg and Cyriaksburg fortresses. During the two and a half months of siege, the mortality rate rose in the city greatly; 1,564 Erfurt citizens died in 1813, around a thousand more than the previous year.

After the Congress of Vienna, Erfurt was restored to Prussia on 21 June 1815, becoming the capital of one of the three districts (&quot;&quot;) of the new Province of Saxony, but some southern and eastern parts of Erfurter lands joined Blankenhain in being transferred to the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach the following September. Although enclosed by Thuringian territory in the west, south and east, the city remained part of the Prussian Province of Saxony until 1944.

=== Since 1815 ===

After the 1848 Revolution, many Germans desired to have a united national state. An attempt in this direction was the failed Erfurt Union of German states in 1850.

The Industrial Revolution reached Erfurt in the 1840s, when the Thuringian Railway connecting Berlin and Frankfurt was built. During the following years, many factories in different sectors were founded. One of the biggest was the &quot;Royal Gun Factory of Prussia&quot; in 1862. After the Unification of Germany in 1871, Erfurt moved from the southern border of Prussia to the centre of Germany, so the fortifications of the city were no longer needed. The demolition of the city fortifications in 1873 led to a construction boom in Erfurt, because it was now possible to build in the area formerly occupied by the city walls and beyond. Many public and private buildings emerged and the infrastructure (such as a tramway, hospitals, and schools) improved rapidly. The number of inhabitants grew from 40,000 around 1870 to 130,000 in 1914, and the city expanded in all directions.

The &quot;Erfurt Program&quot; was adopted by the Social Democratic Party of Germany during its congress at Erfurt in 1891.

Between the wars, the city kept growing. Housing shortages were fought with building programmes and social infrastructure was broadened according to the welfare policy in the Weimar Republic. The Great Depression between 1929 and 1932 led to a disaster for Erfurt, nearly one out of three became unemployed. Conflicts between far-left and far-right-oriented milieus increased and many inhabitants supported the new Nazi government and Adolf Hitler. Others, especially some communist workers, put up resistance against the new administration. In 1938, the new synagogue was destroyed during the . Jews lost their property and emigrated or were deported to Nazi concentration camps (together with many communists). In 1914, the company &quot;Topf and Sons&quot; began the manufacture of crematoria later becoming the market leader in this industry. Under the Nazis, &quot;JA Topf &amp; Sons&quot; supplied specially developed crematoria, ovens and associated plants to the Auschwitz-Birkenau, Buchenwald and Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camps. On 27 January 2011 a memorial and museum dedicated to the Holocaust victims was opened at the former company premises in Erfurt.

During World War II, Erfurt experienced more than 27 British and American air raids, about 1600 civilians died. Bombed as a target of the Oil Campaign of World War II, Erfurt suffered only limited damage and was captured on 12 April 1945, by the US 80th Infantry Division. On 3 July, American troops left the city, which then became part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation and eventually of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1948, Erfurt became the capital of Thuringia, replacing Weimar. In 1952, the in the GDR were dissolved in favour of centralization under the new socialist government. Erfurt then became the capital of a new &quot;&quot; (district). In 1953, the of education was founded, followed by the of medicine in 1954, the first academic institutions in Erfurt since the closing of the university in 1816.

On 19 March 1970, the East and West German heads of government Willi Stoph and Willy Brandt met in Erfurt, the first such meeting since the division of Germany. During the 1970s and 1980s, as the economic situation in GDR worsened, many old buildings in city centre decayed, while the government fought against the housing shortage by building large settlements in the periphery. The Peaceful Revolution of 1989/1990 led to German reunification.
With the re-formation of the state of Thuringia in 1990, the city became the state capital. After reunification, a deep economic crisis occurred in Eastern Germany. Many factories closed and many people lost their jobs and moved to the former West Germany. At the same time, many buildings were redeveloped and the infrastructure improved massively. In 1994, the new university was opened, as was the Fachhochschule in 1991. Between 2005 and 2008, the economic situation improved as the unemployment rate decreased and new enterprises developed. In addition, the population began to increase once again.

A school shooting occurred on 26 April 2002 at the Gutenberg-Gymnasium.

Since the 1990s, organized crime has gained a foothold in Erfurt, with several mafia groups, including the Armenian mafia present in the city. Among other events, there has been a robbery and an arson attack targeting the gastronomy sector and in 2014 there was a shoot-out in an open street.

== Geography ==
=== Topography ===
Erfurt is situated in the south of the Thuringian basin, a fertile agricultural area between the Harz mountains to the north and the Thuringian Forest to the southwest. Whereas the northern parts of the city area are flat, the southern ones consist of hilly landscape up to 430 m of elevation. In this part lies the municipal forest of &quot;&quot; with beeches and oaks as main tree species. To the east and to the west are some non-forested hills so that the Gera river valley within the town forms a basin. North of the city are some gravel pits in operation, while others are abandoned, flooded and used as leisure areas.

=== Climate ===
Erfurt has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) bordering on a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification system. Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of and lows of . Winters are relatively cold with average high temperatures of and lows of . The city&#x27;s topography creates a microclimate caused by the location inside a basin with sometimes inversion in winter (quite cold nights under ) and inadequate air circulation in summer. Annual precipitation is only with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long.

The Erfurt (Erfurt–Weimar Airport) weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Its highest temperature was on 20 July 2022.
* Its lowest temperature was on 11 January 1982.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was in 2002.
* Its least annual precipitation was in 1982.
* The longest annual sunshine was 2,039.4 hours in 2022.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1,341 hours in 1977.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Erfurt abuts the districts of Sömmerda (municipalities Witterda, Elxleben, Walschleben, Riethnordhausen, Nöda, Alperstedt, Großrudestedt, Udestedt, Kleinmölsen and Großmölsen) in the north, Weimarer Land (municipalities Niederzimmern, Nohra, Mönchenholzhausen and Klettbach) in the east, Ilm-Kreis (municipalities Kirchheim, Rockhausen and Amt Wachsenburg) in the south and Gotha (municipalities Nesse-Apfelstädt, Nottleben, Zimmernsupra and Bienstädt) in the west.

The city itself is divided into 53 districts. The centre is formed by the district &#x27; (old town) and the districts &#x27; in the northwest, &#x27; in the northeast, &#x27; in the east, &#x27; in the southeast, &#x27; in the southwest and &#x27; in the west. More former industrial districts are &#x27; (incorporated in 1911), &#x27; and &#x27; in the north. Another group of districts is marked by Plattenbau settlements, constructed during the East Germany period: &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27; in the northern as well as &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27; in the southern city parts.

Eventually, there are many villages with an average population of approximately 1,000 which were incorporated during the 20th century; they have mostly retained a rural character to date, however:

==== Erfurt-Southeast ====

Erfurt-Southeast () is the collective name for a series of prefabricated housing areas that emerged in the southeast of Erfurt in the last ten years of East Germany. After Erfurt-Nord, Erfurt-Südost is the second-largest prefabricated building area in the city. The problems associated with large housing estates are not as pronounced in the southeast as in the north, but they are still present.

The districts of Melchendorf, Herrenberg and Wiesenhügel belong to Erfurt-Südost, all of which were formed from the former local area of Melchendorf. The village of Melchendorf with around 1,000 inhabitants lies between the prefabricated building areas. In addition to the old village, the district of Melchendorf also includes the prefab housing areas of Drosselberg and Buchenberg as well as several four-story apartment blocks from the 1950s and 1960s on . Around 24,000 people still live in the large settlement, which was once designed for almost 40,000 inhabitants.

== Population ==

Around the year 1500, the city had 18,000 inhabitants and was one of the largest cities in the Holy Roman Empire. The population then more or less stagnated until the 19th century. The population of Erfurt was 21,000 in 1820, and increased to 32,000 in 1847, the year of rail connection as industrialization began. In the following decades Erfurt grew up to 130,000 at the beginning of World War I and 190,000 inhabitants in 1950. A maximum was reached in 1988 with 220,000 persons. In 1991, after the German reunification and when Erfurt became the capital of Thuringia state, it had a population of about 205,000. The bad economic situation in eastern Germany after the reunification resulted in a decline in population, which fell to 200,000 in 2002 before rising again to 206,000 in 2011. The average growth of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.68 % p. a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Erfurt. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. Erfurt is also the 10th-largest city in Germany by area with area of .

The birth deficit was 200 in 2012, this is −1.0 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: −4.5; national average: −2.4). The net migration rate was +8.3 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: −0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important regions of origin of Erfurt migrants are rural areas of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Syria, Afghanistan and Hungary. Erfurt is today one of the popular cities in former East Germany due to its universities and broadcasting companies.

Like other cities within the area of former East Germany, foreigners account only for a small share of Erfurt&#x27;s population:  3.0 % are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 5.9 % are migrants (according to the 2011 European Union census).

Due to the official atheism of the former communist East German regime, most of the population is non-religious. 14.8 % are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 6.8 % are Catholics (according to the 2011 EU census). The Jewish community consists of 500 members. Most of them migrated to Erfurt from Russia and Ukraine in the 1990s.

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Residents notable in cultural history ===
The theologian, philosopher and mystic Meister Eckhart (c. 1260–1328) entered the Dominican monastery () in Erfurt when he was aged about 18 (around 1275). Eckhart was the Dominican prior at Erfurt from 1294 until 1298, and Vicar of Thuringia from 1298 to 1302. After a year in Paris, he returned to Erfurt in 1303 and administered his duties as Provincial of Saxony from there until 1311.

=== Theatre ===
Since 2003, the modern opera house is home to Theater Erfurt and its Philharmonic Orchestra. The &quot;grand stage&quot; section has 800 seats and the &quot;studio stage&quot; can hold 200 spectators. In September 2005, the opera &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot; by Philip Glass premiered in the opera house. The Erfurt Theatre has been a source of controversy. In 2005, a performance of Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s opera &quot;&quot; stirred up the local press since the performance contained suggestions of pedophilia and incest. The opera was advertised in the programme with the addition &quot;for adults only&quot;.

On 12 April 2008, a version of Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot; directed by Johann Kresnik opened at the Erfurt Theatre. The production stirred deep controversy by featuring nude performers in Mickey Mouse masks dancing on the ruins of the World Trade Center and a female singer with a painted on Hitler toothbrush moustache performing a straight arm Nazi salute, along with sinister portrayals of American soldiers, Uncle Sam, and Elvis Presley impersonators. The director described the production as a populist critique of modern American society, aimed at showing up the disparities between rich and poor. The controversy prompted one local politician to call for locals to boycott the performances, but this was largely ignored and the première was sold out.

=== Sport ===

The Messe Erfurt serves as home court for the Oettinger Rockets, a professional basketball team in Germany&#x27;s first division, the Basketball Bundesliga.

Notable types of sport in Erfurt are athletics, ice skating, cycling (with the oldest velodrome in use in the world, opened in 1885), swimming, handball, volleyball, tennis and football. The city&#x27;s football club is member of and based in with a capacity of 20,000. The &quot; was the second indoor speed skating arena in Germany.

=== Cityscape ===

Erfurt&#x27;s cityscape features a medieval core of narrow, curved alleys in the centre surrounded by a belt of &quot; architecture, created between 1873 and 1914. In 1873, the city&#x27;s fortifications were demolished and it became possible to build houses in the area in front of the former city walls. In the following years, Erfurt saw a construction boom. In the northern area (districts Andreasvorstadt, Johannesvorstadt and Ilversgehofen) tenements for the factory workers were built whilst the eastern area (Krämpfervorstadt and Daberstedt) featured apartments for white-collar workers and clerks and the southwestern part (Löbervorstadt and Brühlervorstadt) with its beautiful valley landscape saw the construction of villas and mansions of rich factory owners and notables.

During the interwar period, some settlements in Bauhaus style were realized, often as housing cooperatives.

After World War II and over the whole GDR period, housing shortages remained a problem even though the government started a big apartment construction programme. Between 1970 and 1990 large settlements with high-rise blocks on the northern (for 50,000 inhabitants) and southeastern (for 40,000 inhabitants) periphery were constructed. After reunification the renovation of old houses in city centre and the &quot; areas was a big issue. The federal government granted substantial subsidies, so that many houses could be restored.

Compared to many other German cities, little of Erfurt was destroyed in World War II. This is one reason why the centre today offers a mixture of medieval, Baroque and Neoclassical architecture as well as buildings from the last 150 years.

Public green spaces are located along Gera river and in several parks like the &#x27;, the &#x27; and the &quot;&quot;. The largest green area is the , a horticultural exhibition park and botanic garden established in 1961.

From 1066 until 1873 the old town of Erfurt was encircled by a fortified wall. About 1168 this was extended to run around the western side of Petersberg hill, enclosing it within the city boundaries.

After German Unification in 1871, Erfurt became part of the newly created German Empire. The threat to the city from its Saxon neighbours and from Bavaria was no longer present, so it was decided to dismantle the city walls. Only a few remnants remain today. A piece of inner wall can be found in a small park at the corner Juri-Gagarin-Ring and Johannesstraße and another piece at the flood ditch (&quot;Flutgraben&quot;) near Franckestraße. There is also a small restored part of the wall in the Brühler Garten, behind the Catholic orphanage. Only one of the wall&#x27;s fortified towers was left standing, on Boyneburgufer, but this was destroyed in an air raid in 1944.

The Petersberg Citadel is one of the largest and best preserved city fortresses in Europe, covering an area of 36 hectares in the north-west of the city centre. It was built from 1665 on Petersberg hill and was in military use until 1963. Since 1990, it has been significantly restored and is now open to the public as an historic site.

The is a smaller citadel south-west of the city centre, dating from 1480. Today, it houses the German horticulture museum.

=====19th- and 20th-century architecture in the outskirts=====

Between 1873 and 1914, a belt of &#x27; architecture emerged around the city centre. The mansion district in the south-west around , and hosts some interesting &#x27; and &quot;Art Nouveau&quot; buildings.

The &quot;Mühlenviertel&quot; (&quot;mill quarter&quot;), is an area of beautiful Art Nouveau apartment buildings, cobblestone streets and street trees just to the north of the old city, in the vicinity of Nord Park, bordered by the Gera river on its east side. The Schmale Gera stream runs through the area. In the Middle Ages numerous small enterprises using the power of water mills occupied the area, hence the name &quot;Mühlenviertel&quot;, with street names such as Waidmühlenweg (woad, or indigo, mill way), Storchmühlenweg (stork mill way) and Papiermühlenweg (paper mill way).

The &quot;Bauhaus&quot; style is represented by some housing cooperative projects in the east around and and in the north around . Lutherkirke Church in (1927), is an Art Deco building.

The former malt factory &quot;Wolff&quot; at in the east of Erfurt is a large industrial complex built between 1880 and 1939, and in use until 2000. A new use has not been found yet, but the area is sometimes used as a location in movie productions because of its atmosphere.

Examples of Nazi architecture include the buildings of the (Thuringian parliament) and (an event hall) in the south at . While the building (1930s) represents more the neo-Roman/fascist style, (1940s) is marked by some neo-Germanic &quot; style elements.

The Stalinist early-GDR style is manifested in the main building of the university at (1953) and the later more international modern GDR style is represented by the horticultural exhibition centre &quot; at , the housing complexes like Rieth or and the redevelopment of and area along in the city centre.

The current international glass and steel architecture is dominant among most larger new buildings like the Federal Labour Court of Germany (1999), the new opera house (2003), the new main station (2007), the university library, the Erfurt Messe (convention centre) and the ice rink.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved: the unemployment rate declined from 21% in 2005 to 9% in 2013. Nevertheless, some 14,000 households with 24,500 persons (12% of population) are dependent upon state social benefits (Hartz IV).

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===

Farming has a great tradition in Erfurt: the cultivation of woad made the city rich during the Middle Ages. Today, horticulture and the production of flower seeds is still an important business in Erfurt. There is also growing of fruits (like apples, strawberries and sweet cherries), vegetables (e.g. cauliflowers, potatoes, cabbage and sugar beets) and grain on more than 60% of the municipal territory.

Industrialization in Erfurt started around 1850. Until World War I, many factories were founded in different sectors like engine building, shoes, guns, malt and later electro-technics, so that there was no industrial monoculture in the city. After 1945, the companies were nationalized by the GDR government, which led to the decline of some of them. After reunification, nearly all factories were closed, either because they failed to successfully adopt to a free market economy or because the German government sold them to west German businessmen who closed them to avoid competition to their own enterprises. However, in the early 1990s the federal government started to subsidize the foundation of new companies. It still took a long time before the economic situation stabilized around 2006. Since this time, unemployment has decreased and overall, new jobs were created. Today, there are many small and medium-sized companies in Erfurt with electro-technics, semiconductors and photovoltaics in focus. Engine production, food production, the Braugold brewery, and Born Feinkost, a producer of Thuringian mustard, remain important industries.

Erfurt is an &quot;&quot; (which means &quot;supra-centre&quot; according to Central place theory) in German regional planning. Such centres are always hubs of service businesses and public services like hospitals, universities, research, trade fairs, retail etc. Additionally, Erfurt is the capital of the federal state of Thuringia, so that there are many institutions of administration like all the Thuringian state ministries and some nationwide authorities. Typical for Erfurt are the logistic business with many distribution centres of big companies, the Erfurt Trade Fair and the media sector with KiKa and MDR as public broadcast stations. A growing industry is tourism, due to the various historical sights of Erfurt. There are 4,800 hotel beds and (in 2012) 450,000 overnight visitors spent a total of 700,000 nights in hotels. Nevertheless, most tourists are one-day visitors from Germany. The Christmas Market in December attracts some 2,000,000 visitors each year.

=== Transport ===
==== By rail ====
The ICE railway network puts Erfurt 1 hours from Berlin, 2 hours from Frankfurt, 2 hours from Dresden, and 45 minutes from Leipzig. In 2017, the ICE line to Munich opened, making the trip to Erfurt main station only 2 hours.

There are regional trains from Erfurt to Weimar, Jena, Gotha, Eisenach, Bad Langensalza, Magdeburg, Nordhausen, Göttingen, Mühlhausen, Würzburg, Meiningen, Ilmenau, Arnstadt, and Gera.

In freight transport there is an intermodal terminal in the district of Vieselbach &quot;()&quot; with connections to rail and the autobahn.

==== By road ====
The two Autobahnen crossing each other nearby at &quot;Erfurter Kreuz&quot; are the Bundesautobahn 4 (Frankfurt–Dresden) and the Bundesautobahn 71 (Schweinfurt–Sangerhausen). Together with the east tangent both motorways form a circle road around the city and lead the interregional traffic around the centre. Whereas the A 4 was built in the 1930s, the A 71 came into being after the reunification in the 1990s and 2000s. In addition to both motorways there are two Bundesstraßen: the Bundesstraße 7 connects Erfurt parallel to A 4 with Gotha in the west and Weimar in the east. The Bundesstraße 4 is a connection between Erfurt and Nordhausen in the north. Its southern part to Coburg was annulled when A 71 was finished (in this section, the A 71 now effectively serves as B 4). Within the circle road, B 7 and B 4 are also annulled, so that the city government has to pay for maintenance instead of the German federal government. The access to the city is restricted as &quot; since 2012 for some vehicles. Large parts of the inner city are a pedestrian area which can not be reached by car (except for residents).

==== By light rail and bus ====

The Erfurt public transport system is marked by the area-wide (light rail) network, established as a tram system in 1883, upgraded to a light rail (&quot;) system in 1997, and continually expanded and upgraded through the 2000s. Today, there are six &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; lines running every ten minutes on every light rail route.

Additionally, Erfurt operates a bus system, which connects the sparsely populated outer districts of the region to the city center. Both systems are organized by &quot;SWE EVAG&quot;, a transit company owned by the city administration. Trolleybuses were in service in Erfurt from 1948 until 1975, but are no longer in service.

==== By airplane ====
Erfurt-Weimar Airport lies west of the city centre. It is linked to the central train station via Stadtbahn (tram). It was significantly extended in the 1990s, with flights mostly to Mediterranean holiday destinations and to London during the peak Christmas market tourist season. Connections to longer haul flights are easily accessible via Frankfurt Airport, which can be reached in 2 hours via a direct train from Frankfurt Airport to Erfurt, and from Leipzig/Halle Airport, which can be reached within half an hour.

==== By bike ====

Biking is becoming increasingly popular since construction of high quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. There are cycle lanes for general commuting within Erfurt city.

Long-distance trails, such as the &quot;Gera track&quot; and the &quot;&quot; (Thuringian cities trail), connect points of tourist interest. The former runs along the Gera river valley from the Thuringian Forest to the river Unstrut; the latter follows the medieval Via Regia from Eisenach to Altenburg via Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, and Jena.

The Rennsteig Cycle Way was opened in 2000. This designated high-grade hiking and bike trail runs along the ridge of the Thuringian Central Uplands. The bike trail, about long, occasionally departs from the course of the historic Rennsteig hiking trail, which dates back to the 1300s, to avoid steep inclines. It is therefore about longer than the hiking trail.

The Rennsteig is connected to the E3 European long distance path, which goes from the Atlantic coast of Spain to the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, and the E6 European long distance path, running from Arctic Finland to Turkey.

=== Education ===
After reunification, the educational system was reorganized. The University of Erfurt, founded in 1379 and closed in 1816, was refounded in 1994 with a focus on social sciences, modern languages, humanities and teacher training. Today there are approximately 6,000 students working within four faculties, the Max Weber Center for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies, and three academic research institutes. The university has an international reputation and participates in international student exchange programmes.

The &quot;Fachhochschule Erfurt&quot;, is a university of applied sciences, founded in 1991, which offers a combination of academic training and practical experience in subjects such as social work and social pedagogy, business studies, and engineering. There are nearly 5,000 students in six faculties, of which the faculty of landscaping and horticulture has a national reputation.

The International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef – Bonn (IUBH), is a privately run university with a focus on business and economics. It merged with the former Adam-Ries-Fachhochschule in 2013.

The world renowned Bauhaus design school was founded in 1919 in the city of Weimar, approximately from Erfurt, 12 minutes by train. The buildings are now part of a World Heritage Site and are today used by the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, which teaches design, arts, media and technology related subjects.

Furthermore, there are eight &#x27;, six state-owned, one Catholic and one Protestant (Evangelisches Ratsgymnasium Erfurt). One of the state-owned schools is a &#x27;, an elite boarding school for young talents in athletics, swimming, ice skating or football. Another state-owned school, &quot;&quot;, offers a focus in sciences as an elite boarding school in addition to the common curriculum.

=== Media ===

The German national public television children&#x27;s channel &quot;KiKa&quot; is based in Erfurt.

MDR, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, a radio and television company, has a broadcast centre and studios in Erfurt.

The Thüringer Allgemeine is a statewide newspaper that is headquartered in the city.

<text>Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin, (born 17 May 1961; anglicised as Enya Patricia Brennan) known mononymously as Enya, is an Irish singer and composer. With an estimated equivalent of over 90 million album sales worldwide, Enya is the best-selling Irish solo artist; the second-best-selling music act from Ireland overall after the rock band U2. Enya&#x27;s music has been widely recognised for its use of multi-layers of her own vocals and instrumentation, lengthened reverb, and interwoven elements of Celtic music. Her career in music spans four decades; Enya has been composing and recording music since the 1980s.

Enya was raised in the Irish-speaking region of Gweedore. In 1980, as Eithne Ní Bhraonáin, Enya began her musical career playing alongside her family&#x27;s Irish folk band Clannad. She left Clannad in 1982 to pursue a solo career, working with the former Clannad manager and producer, Nicky Ryan, and his partner Roma, as their lyricist. Over the following four years, Enya further developed her sound by combining multitracked vocals and keyboards with elements from a variety of musical genres, such as Celtic, classical, church, jazz, hip-hop, ambient, world, and Irish folk.

Enya&#x27;s earliest released compositions as a solo artist were two piano/synthesiser instrumentals for the &quot;Touch Travel&quot; T4 cassette compilation (1984) composed around 1982–83. The majority of the soundtrack for &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; (1985) was originally composed by Enya, and she sang two songs with lyrics for the project. Enya had also composed a body of work for a documentary series by the BBC named &quot;The Celts.&quot; A selection of Enya&#x27;s pieces for &quot;The Celts&quot; were released as her debut album, &quot;Enya&quot; (1986) with the documentary and BBC Records releases in 1987. The chairman of Warner Music at the time, Rob Dickins, found enjoyment in listening to Enya&#x27;s music for &quot;The Celts.&quot; He happened to meet the trio, expressed his interest in Enya&#x27;s music, and so the trio agreed to sign with Warner Music UK. The initial record deal granted her considerable artistic freedom and minimal interference. The success of the album &quot;Watermark&quot; (1988) propelled Enya to worldwide fame, primarily through her international hit single &quot;Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)&quot;. In the following decade and up to the new millennium, she released the multi-million-selling albums &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; (1991), &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; (1995), and &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; (2000). Sales of &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; and its lead single, &quot;Only Time&quot;, surged in the United States following its use in media coverage of the 9/11 attacks. After &quot;Amarantine&quot; (2005) and &quot;And Winter Came...&quot; (2008), Enya took a four-year break from music, returning to the recording studio in early 2012 to begin work on her eighth studio album &quot;Dark Sky Island&quot; (2015).

==Early life==

Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin was born in the Dore area of Gaoth Dobhair (Gweedore) in County Donegal on 17 May 1961. She is the sixth of nine children in the Brennan family of musicians, born to Máire &quot;Baba&quot; and Leopold &quot;Leo&quot; Brennan. In 1968, the couple took ownership of a pub in Meenaleck, Co. Donegal, naming it Leo&#x27;s Tavern. Leo Brennan was the leader of an Irish showband named the Slieve Foy Band, before performing solo. Baba Brennan (née Duggan) is said to have Spanish roots with ancestors who settled on Tory Island and she was an amateur musician who played with the Slieve Foy Band. Enya&#x27;s mother also taught music at Gweedore Community School.
Gweedore is a Gaeltacht region, where the Irish language, also known as Gaelic, is primarily spoken. Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin, her name, is anglicised as Enya Patricia Brennan, with &quot;Enya&quot; being the phonetic spelling of how &quot;Eithne&quot; is pronounced in the Donegal Ulster dialect.

The name Brennan was accidentally added to Leo&#x27;s name at his birth registration in 1925; his family name was Hardin; Leo used Brennan for the surname of his children. In Irish, the surname is &quot;Ó&quot;/&quot;Ní&quot; Bhraonáin - which corresponds to &quot;son of&#x27;/daughter of&quot; - &quot;Ní Bhraonáin&quot; translates to &quot;daughter of Brennan&quot;. Leo&#x27;s father Harry Hardin was a pianist, and he died performing on stage. Enya&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Minna Lenehan, played the drums. They were both believed to have been born in England. Regarding Baba&#x27;s parents, Enya&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Aodh (anglicised as Hugh; affectionately addressed as Hughie or &quot;Gog&quot;) was the headmaster of the primary school in Dore; her grandmother, Mháire Duggan (anglicised as Mary; née Gillespie) was a teacher. Aodh was also the founder of the Aisteoiri Ghaodobhair, the Gweedore Theatre company.

Enya has described her upbringing as &quot;very quiet and happy&quot;. She mentioned that &quot;the house I grew up in was on my grandparents’ property, behind their house. Ours was built in the 1950s and wasn’t very big.&quot; Regarding her position in the family, Enya said &quot;it was difficult to be heard, but I was very comfortable with that because I was able to be myself, able to be let alone.” However, she has acknowledged that there was &quot;continual hustle and bustle and crying and chaos&quot; amongst the nine siblings. Their maternal grandparents and aunt were quite involved with the siblings&#x27; upbringing at home, as Baba and Leo were travelling with the showband; Enya recalled &quot;they toured a great deal, mostly in Ireland and Scotland. When they did, my grandmother and my mother’s sister took care of us.&quot; Enya&#x27;s songs &quot;On Your Shore&quot; and &quot;Smaointe&quot; (first released as the Orinoco Flow B-side track &quot;Smaoitím&quot;) are dedicated to both her maternal grandmother and grandfather.

Along with the siblings&#x27; enjoyment of their childhood spent in Gweedore, they also grew up amid the Troubles. Enya recalls that when her family visited shops in Derry for instance, &quot;you’d be checked by people standing with guns”, and even speaking in Irish in Derry was &quot;pinpointing where you came from, and it was too political at the time. Whereas for [Enya and siblings] it was our first language, and we didn’t see anything wrong with it.&quot;

Enya took part in her first singing competitions at the annual Feis Ceoil music festival between the ages of three and five years old. She also participated in pantomimes at the Gweedore Theatre, as seen in an early group picture where Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh was also present . Enya often recalls that at three-and-a-half years of age, she played the character Little Red Riding Hood on stage, singing a song. At the age of four, Enya began piano lessons and was learning English throughout primary school. In 2008, Enya described her early studies, having &quot;to do school work and then travel to a neighbouring town for piano lessons, and then more school work. I remember my brothers and sisters playing outside and I would be inside playing the piano, this one big book of scales, practising them over and over.&quot;

One particular memory of a very early public performance of singing at age five was recounted by Enya in her 2016 Wall Street Journal article. At the theatre, contestants would &quot;perform two songs, starting with a slow one and finishing with a fast one [...] songs we were taught in primary school.&quot; Enya&#x27;s mother was the pianist, and provided the starting notes for each person performing. In mistake, Enya &quot;began with the fast song. I didn’t realize my error until I saw my mother’s frown. I stopped singing and covered my mouth. There was silence, followed by laughter.&quot; She then &quot;sang the right song. When I finished, there was a pause and I sang the fast song again. Enya &quot;won the contest [...] determined to get it right, and the audience’s laughter didn’t deter&quot; her.

As well as traditional Irish music and singing choral music with her siblings in their mother&#x27;s choir at St Mary&#x27;s church in Derrybeg, Enya and her siblings were introduced to a variety of music in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, and enjoyed watching musical films. In a radio interview with Elaine Page in November 2008, Enya shared a selection of favourite songs from musicals. She said of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, &quot;it was such an original piece of music in 1970 [...] played in my house every single day, and myself and my sisters would sing word for word&quot;.

Enya&#x27;s brother Ciarán also mentions that when the siblings were younger, before having a tape recorder, as Moya and Enya sang, he would play piano, &quot;give them two-part harmonies and say, &#x27;You go into the kitchen, you go into the bathroom&#x27; and they were fascinated by this because musically it was very melodic, even though they wouldn&#x27;t finally hear their parts until they sang together.&quot;

In addition to her musical endeavours, Enya also took part in the Gaeltacht Festival competitions in Gweedore as a child. At the age of nine, Enya was a participant in the Cailín Gaelach (Irish Girl) competition, which judged contestants on &quot;their fluency of spoken Irish, involvement in social and cultural activities in their parish and community, and appearance and deportment.&quot; The 1970 event was filmed and published in the RTÉ Archives in 2020.

From the age of 11, Enya attended a convent boarding school in Milford, Milford College, run by the Sisters of Loreto; Enya&#x27;s education there was paid for by her grandfather. The boarding school, now Loreto Community School, was where Enya developed a taste for classical music, art, Latin, and watercolour painting. She said, &quot;It was devastating to be torn away from such a large family but it was good for my music.&quot; Enya finished boarding school at age 17 towards the end of the 1970s, and she spent a year at college studying classical music. She previously saw herself becoming a piano teacher, as both her mother and grandmother had done, and gave piano lessons for a brief time in the early 1980s. This later evolved into composing and performing her own music. Enya states that &quot;music was never far from my mind but contrary to popular belief my ambitions were in no way connected to those of my family, as I knew I wanted to have my own career and make my own mark&quot;.

Enya has noted that she “was always quiet, even as a child, so there has always been an air of mystery around me,” also mentioning that “at school, they’d always say, ‘oh, we never know what Eithne’s thinking or what she’ll say next’.”

==Career==
===1980–1982: Clannad===
In 1970, several members of Enya&#x27;s family formed Clannad, a Celtic folk band. Clannad hired Nicky Ryan as their manager, sound engineer, and producer, and Ryan&#x27;s girlfriend (later his wife) Roma as tour manager and administrator. In 1980, after a year at college, Enya decided not to pursue a music degree and instead accepted Nicky Ryan&#x27;s invitation to play alongside the band Clannad, with him having wanted to expand their sound with keyboards and an additional vocalist. Enya performed an uncredited role on their sixth studio album, &quot;Crann Úll&quot; (1980), with a line-up of her eldest siblings Moya, Pól, and Ciarán Brennan, and twin uncles Noel and Pádraig Duggan. She features in their follow-up, &quot;Fuaim&quot; (1982), singing lead vocals on the song &quot;An Túll&quot; (The Apple).

The membership status of Enya in Clannad is a matter of some dispute. In a late 2000s interview, Ciarán mentioned that Enya was a &quot;hired hand&quot; and not a full member, commenting that &quot;she was 18, 19 and we were paying her £500 sterling a week.&quot; In a BBC Radio Ulster interview with Moya in late 2023, she also noted that Enya was considered a hired hand with Clannad. Nicky Ryan also said it was not his intention to make Enya a permanent member, as she was &quot;fiercely independent [...] intent on playing her own music. She was just not sure of how to go about it.&quot; However, on the official Clannad website, the &quot;about&quot; subsection quotes &quot;with younger sister Eithne, aka Enya, having quickly come and gone as a group member...&quot; which implies that Enya was considered to have been a member of the band, albeit for a short time.

In a 1991 interview, Enya herself said that she &quot;wouldn&#x27;t call what happened a &#x27;split&#x27;&quot; and that she &quot;wasn&#x27;t really a full member of Clannad.&quot; Enya added &quot;I always felt I was just passing through [...] I was 18 and had studied music and was really feeling my way, trying to see what I could do.&quot;

Nicky discussed the idea of layering vocals to create a &quot;choir of one&quot; with Enya, a concept inspired by Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound technique that had interested them both.

During a Clannad tour in 1982, Nicky called for a band meeting to address internal issues that had arisen, which he put down to the excessive drinking of one or two members. He recalled: &quot;It was short and only required a vote, I was a minority of one and lost. Roma and I were out. This left the question of what happened with Enya. I decided to stand back and say nothing.&quot; Enya chose to leave with the Ryans and pursue a solo career, having felt confined in the group and disliking being &quot;somebody in the background&quot;. In an extended interview from 1989, Enya said that &quot;I wasn&#x27;t composing it [the music], I was just &quot;there&quot;, you know.&quot; The split caused some friction between the parties but, in time, they settled their differences. Enya&#x27;s brother Ciarán also spoke to Nicky Ryan around 2006, interested in recording in their studio with her, but Ryan suggested that this was unlikely to occur. Moya often praises Enya for what she has gone on to achieve in her solo career, and supposes that there were some musical foundations that Enya had built from her short time with the band.

===1982–1986: Early solo career===

Enya said that, following her departure from Clannad &quot;the fact is that I had become very friendly with Nicky and Roma. I trusted them [...] basically, I felt there was more there for me career-wise.&quot;

Nicky suggested to Enya that either she return to Gweedore &quot;with no particular definite future&quot;, or live with him and Roma in suburban Artane, in Dublin, &quot;and see what happens, musically&quot;, the latter of which Enya decided was best for her career. After their bank denied them a loan, Enya reportedly sold her saxophone, which she had been learning to play at the time, and also gave piano lessons as a source of income. Nicky Ryan used what they could afford to build a recording facility in the Ryans&#x27; garden shed, formerly a Scout hut, which they named &quot;Aigle Studio&quot;, after the French word for eagle.

A visitor to the house in the early 1980s described access as having to &quot;walk through the house to get to the studio [...] the kids [Nicky and Roma&#x27;s daughters] were young then so the place was strewn with toys but the set-up suited everyone. They&#x27;d have breakfast and Enya would head off to the studio.&quot;

Shortly after leaving Clannad and thus the family home in Gweedore, Enya lived with the Ryans from 1982, until 1989, when she was able to buy a penthouse apartment in Killiney.

Enya and the Ryans rented Aigle Studio out to other musicians to help recoup the costs. The trio formed a musical and business partnership, with Nicky as Enya&#x27;s producer and arranger and Roma as her lyricist. They called their company, of which each owns a third, Aigle Music. In the following two years, Enya developed her technique and composition by listening to recordings of her reciting pieces of classical music and repeated this process until she started to improvise sections and develop her own arrangements.

Following her departure from Clannad in 1982, Enya (as Eithne Ní Bhraonáin) featured on tracks alongside a few artists, often on keyboards or backing vocals, with Nicky Ryan as producer. She played the Prophet-5 synthesiser on the group Altan&#x27;s &quot;Ceol Aduaidh,&quot; led by Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh and the late Frankie Kennedy.That year, Enya had the original offer from Mike Oldfield to sing on a new song of his, likely to have been &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;. Supposedly due to existing contract clashes, she had to decline, so Oldfield later approached Scottish singer Maggie Reilly who sang on the record for Oldfield. An Irish folk-type song named &quot;Bailieboro and Me&quot;, penned by Charlie McGettigan, features Enya singing backing vocals on a 1982 recording, primarily credited as Eithne Ní Bhraonáin playing the grand piano for the song.

Enya&#x27;s first solo endeavours began around 1982-83, when she began to compose two piano instrumentals, &quot;An Ghaoth Ón Ghrian&quot; (Irish for &quot;The Solar Wind&quot;) and &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot;. Both were recorded at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin and released on &quot;Touch Travel&quot; (1984), a limited-release cassette compilation of music from various artists on the UK &quot;Touch&quot; label. She is credited as Eithne Ní Bhraonáin in the liner notes.

After several months of preparation, Enya&#x27;s first live solo performance took place at the National Stadium in Dublin on 23 September 1983, and was televised for RTÉ&#x27;s music show &quot;Festival Folk&quot;. Niall Morris, a musician who worked with her during this time, recalled she &quot;was so nervous she could barely get on stage, and she cowered behind the piano until the gig was over&quot;. Morris assisted Enya in the production of a demo tape, adding additional keyboards to her compositions.

Roma thought the music would suit accompanying visuals and sent it to various film producers. Among them was David Puttnam, after Roma had read an interview where he stated a particular interest in strong melodies. Puttnam liked the tape and offered Enya to compose the soundtrack to the upcoming romantic comedy film, &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; (1984), directed by Brian Gilbert. Enya scored nine pieces for the soundtrack. However, Enya&#x27;s instrumental pieces for the film were rearranged and orchestrated by Richard Myhill. The film editor Jim Clark said the rearrangements were necessary as Enya found it difficult to compose to picture. Enya&#x27;s two songs with vocals were not in the film, but on the soundtrack album, those being &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot;, but the melodies are present throughout the film soundtrack. The words to &quot;Dreams&quot; were penned by Charlie McGettigan.

Released in 1985, the album is the first commercial release that credits her as &quot;Enya&quot;. The spelling as &quot;Enya&quot; for her began in 1983. Nicky Ryan suggested this phonetic spelling of her name, with the likeliness that Eithne would be mispronounced by non-Irish speakers. Enya looked back at her composition work on the film as a good career move, but a disappointing one as &quot;we weren&#x27;t part of it at the end&quot;. Also in 1985, she sang on three tracks on the album &quot;Ordinary Man&quot; (1985) by Christy Moore.

Enya&#x27;s earliest interviews in English as a solo artist began in 1986. Whatever direction her music would take, she believed in being a &quot;true Celt at heart&quot; and stated that &quot;any music I write, whether it be a pop song or a classical piece, would be Celtic music&quot;.

===1985–1989: &quot;The Celts&quot; and &quot;Watermark&quot;===

In 1985, producer Tony McAuley asked Enya to contribute a track for the six-part BBC television documentary series &quot;The Celts&quot;. She had already written a Celtic-influenced song called &quot;March of the Celts&quot;, and Nicky Ryan submitted it to the project. Each episode was to feature a different composer at first, but director David Richardson liked her track so much that he had Enya score the entire series. Enya recorded 72 minutes of music at Aigle Studio and the BBC studios in Wood Lane, London, without recording to the picture. She was required to portray certain themes and ideas that the producers wanted; however, in contrast with &quot;The Frog Prince&quot;, she worked with little interference, which granted her freedom to establish the sound that she would adopt throughout her future career, signified by layered vocals, keyboard-oriented music, and percussion with elements of Celtic, classical, church, and folk music.

In March 1987, two months before &quot;The Celts&quot; aired, a 40-minute selection of Enya&#x27;s score was released as her debut solo album, &quot;Enya&quot;, by BBC Records in the United Kingdom, with the Atlantic Records release in the United States in 1986. The latter promoted it with a new-age imprint on the packaging, which Nicky thought was &quot;a cowardly thing for them to do&quot;. The album gained enough public attention to reach number 8 on the Irish Albums Chart and number 69 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;I Want Tomorrow&quot; was released as Enya&#x27;s first single. &quot;Boadicea&quot; was later sampled by The Fugees on their 1996 song &quot;Ready or Not&quot;; the group neither sought permission nor gave credit. Enya took legal action and the group subsequently gave her credit; they paid a fee of approximately $3 million. Later in 1987, Enya appeared on Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Lion and the Cobra&quot;, reciting Psalm 91 in Irish on the track &quot;Never Get Old&quot; which Enya later posted the words of as her tribute message to Sinéad following her passing in July 2023.

Several weeks after the release of &quot;Enya&quot;, Enya secured a recording contract with Warner Music UK after Rob Dickins, the label&#x27;s chairman and a fan of Clannad, took a liking to &quot;Enya&quot; and found himself playing it &quot;every night before I went to bed&quot;. He later met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the Irish Recorded Music Association award ceremony in Dublin, where he learned that Enya had entered negotiations with a rival label. Dickins seized the opportunity and signed her, in doing so granting her wish to write and record with artistic freedom, minimal interference from the label, and without set deadlines to finish albums. Dickins said: &quot;Sometimes you sign an act to make money, and sometimes you sign an act to make music. This was the latter... I just wanted to be involved with this music.&quot; Enya left Atlantic and signed with the Warner-led Geffen Records to handle her American distribution.

When asked about whether women in pop have a hard time, she responded &quot;yes, they do. Definitely.&quot; However, Enya has considered her position as a composer rather than just a vocalist to be an advantage &quot;because I write and perform much of the music, I&#x27;m taken more seriously than the girls who just walk into a studio, do a vocal and that&#x27;s it. I can&#x27;t even &quot;imagine&quot; what that would be like.&quot;
With the green light to produce a new album, Enya recorded &quot;Watermark&quot; from June 1987 to April 1988. It was initially recorded in analogue at Aigle before Dickins requested to have it re-recorded digitally at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London.

&quot;Watermark&quot; was released in September 1988 and became an unexpected hit, reaching number 5 in the United Kingdom and number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States following its release there in January 1989. Its lead single, &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;, was the last song written for the album. It was not intended to be a single at first, but Enya and the Ryans chose it after Dickins jokingly asked for a single; he knew that Enya&#x27;s music was not made for the Top 40 chart. Dickins and engineer Ross Cullum are referenced in the song&#x27;s lyrics. &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; became an international top 10 hit and was number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks, and is credited with bringing new-age music to the mainstream market in America. The new-found success propelled Enya to international fame and she received endorsement deals and offers to use her music in television commercials She spent a year traveling worldwide to promote the album which increased her exposure through interviews, appearances, and live performances.

=== 1989–1998: &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; and &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; ===

After promoting &quot;Watermark&quot;, Enya purchased new recording equipment and started work on her next album, &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;. She found that the success of &quot;Watermark&quot; added a considerable amount of pressure when it came to writing new songs, stating, &quot;I kept thinking, &#x27;Would this have gone on &quot;Watermark&quot;? Is it as good?&#x27; Eventually I had to forget about this and start on a blank canvas and just really go with what felt right&quot;.

Roma Ryan wrote songs based on several ideas, including diary entries from Enya, the Blitz in London, and her grandparents. &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; was released in November 1991, her first album released under Warner-led Reprise Records in the United States. It became a greater commercial success than &quot;Watermark&quot;, reaching number one in the UK for one week and number 17 in the United States. &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot;, its lead single, charted at number 13 in the United Kingdom.

In 1991, Warner Music released a collection of five Enya music videos as &quot;Moonshadows&quot; for home video. In 1993 Enya won her first Grammy Award in the Best New Age Album category for &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;. Soon after, Enya and Nicky entered discussions with Industrial Light &amp; Magic, founded by George Lucas, regarding an elaborate stage lighting system for a proposed concert tour, but nothing resulted from those discussions. In November 1992, Warner obtained the rights to &quot;Enya&quot; and re-released the album as &quot;The Celts&quot; with new artwork. It surpassed its initial sale performance, reaching number 10 in the UK.

After travelling worldwide to promote &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, Enya started to write and record her fourth album, &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;. By this time, the Ryans had moved to the southern Dublin suburb of Killiney, and a new Aigle Studio had been built alongside their home, with new recording facilities which eliminated the need to go to London to finish recording for the album. The new album was released in November 1995 and peaked at number 5 in the UK and number 9 in the US, where it sold over 3 million copies. Its lead single, &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, reached number 7 in the UK. The second, &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, reached number 26 in the UK. In late 1994, Enya put out an extended play of Christmas music titled &quot;The Christmas EP&quot;. Enya was offered the opportunity to compose the film score for &quot;Titanic&quot; but declined as it would be a collaboration, rather than solely her composition and singing. A recording of her singing &quot;Oíche Chiúin&quot;, an Irish-language version of &quot;Silent Night&quot;, appeared on the charity album &quot;A Very Special Christmas 3&quot;, released in benefit of the Special Olympics in October 1997.

In early 1997, Enya began to select tracks for her first compilation album, &quot;trying to select the obvious ones, the hits, and others.&quot; She chose to work on the collection following the promotional tour for &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; as she felt it was the right time in her career, and that her contract with WEA required her to release a &quot;best of&quot; album. The set, named &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars: The Best of Enya&quot;, features two new tracks, &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; and &quot;Only If...&quot;. Released in November 1997, the album was a worldwide commercial success, reaching number 4 in the UK and number 30 in the US, where it went on to sell over 4 million copies.

&quot;Only If...&quot; was released as a single in 1997. Enya described the album as &quot;like a musical diary... each melody has a little story and I live through that whole story from the beginning... your mind goes back to that day and what you were thinking.&quot;

===1998–2007: &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; and &quot;Amarantine&quot;===
In 1998, Enya, Roma and Nicky Ryan received the Ivor Novello award for International Achievement. That year, Enya started work on her fifth studio album, titled &quot;A Day Without Rain.&quot; In a departure from her previous albums, Enya incorporated greater use of a synthesised string section into her compositions, something that was not a conscious decision at first, but Enya and Nicky Ryan agreed that it complemented the songs that were being written. The album was released in November 2000 and reached number 6 in the UK and an initial peak of number 17 in the US.

In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, US sales of the album and its lead single &quot;Only Time&quot; surged after the song was widely used during radio and television coverage of the events, leading to its description as &quot;a post-September 11th anthem&quot;. The exposure caused &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; to outperform its original chart performance to peak at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and the release of a maxi-single containing the original and a pop remix of &quot;Only Time&quot; in November 2001. Enya donated its proceeds in aid of the International Association of Firefighters. The song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and went to number 10 on the Hot 100 singles, Enya&#x27;s highest charting US single to date.

In 2001, Enya agreed to write and perform on two tracks for the soundtrack of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001) at the request of director Peter Jackson. Its composer Howard Shore &quot;imagined her voice&quot; as he wrote the film&#x27;s score, making an uncommon exception to include another artist in one of his soundtracks. After flying to New Zealand to observe the filming and to watch a rough cut of the film, Enya returned to Ireland and composed &quot;Aníron&quot; (the theme for Aragorn and Arwen), with lyrics by Roma in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional Elvish language Sindarin, and &quot;May It Be&quot;, sung in English and another Tolkien language, Quenya. Shore then based his orchestrations around Enya&#x27;s recorded vocals and themes to create &quot;a seamless sound&quot;.

In 2002, Enya released &quot;May It Be&quot; as a single which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. She performed the song live with an orchestra at the 74th Academy Awards ceremony in March 2002, and later cited the moment as a career highlight. Her two songs for the film were recorded at &quot;Abbey Road Studios&quot;.

Enya undertook additional studio projects in 2001 and 2002. The first was work on the soundtrack of the Japanese romantic film &quot;Calmi Cuori Appassionati&quot; (2001), which was subsequently released as &quot;Themes from Calmi Cuori Appassionati&quot; (2001).

This release is formed of tracks spanning her career from &quot;Enya&quot; to &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; with two B-sides. The album went to number 2 in Japan and became Enya&#x27;s second album to sell one million copies in the country.

In 2004, Enya had another significant &quot;Boadicea&quot; sampling request from Diddy, for the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; performed by Mario Winans. She said that the producer &quot;phoned the studio we were working in and Nicky took the call and he [Diddy] just said he had this fantastic singer that he was working with and it was Mario Winans. Immediately we said “send the song” and it was a great song.&quot; 

In September 2003, Enya returned to Aigle Studio to start work on her sixth studio album, &quot;Amarantine&quot;. Roma said the title means &quot;everlasting&quot;. The album marks the first instance of Enya singing in Loxian, a fictional language created by Roma that came about when Enya was working on &quot;Water Shows the Hidden Heart&quot;. After numerous attempts to sing the song in English, Irish, and Latin, Roma suggested a new language based on some of the sounds Enya would sing along to when developing her songs. It was a success, and Enya sang &quot;Less Than a Pearl&quot; and &quot;The River Sings&quot; in the same way. Roma worked on the language further, creating a &quot;culture and history&quot; behind it surrounding the Loxian people who are on another planet, questioning the existence of life outside of Earth. &quot;Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)&quot; is sung in Japanese. &quot;Amarantine&quot; was a global success, reaching number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 8 in the UK. It has sold over 1 million certified copies in the US, a considerable drop in sales in comparison to her previous albums. Enya dedicated the album to BBC producer Tony McAuley who had commissioned Enya to write the soundtrack to &quot;The Celts&quot;, following his death in 2003. The lead single, &quot;Amarantine&quot;, was released in December 2005.

===2008–2017: &quot;And Winter Came...&quot; and &quot;Dark Sky Island&quot;===
Enya wrote music with a winter and Christmas theme for her seventh studio album, &quot;And Winter Came...&quot; Initially, she intended to make an album of seasonal songs and hymns, set for a release in late 2007, but the trio decided to produce a winter-themed album instead.

The second promotional single of the album &quot;My! My! Time Flies!&quot;, is a tribute to the late Irish guitarist Jimmy Faulkner, incorporates a guitar solo performed by Pat Farrell, the first guitar solo on an Enya album since &quot;I Want Tomorrow&quot; from &quot;Enya&quot;. The lyrics also include some musical pop-culture references, such as The Beatles&#x27; famous photo shoot for the cover of &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; and &quot;a rap on a rhapsody&quot; possibly referring to &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; by Queen. Upon its release in November 2008, &quot;And Winter Came...&quot; reached number 6 in the UK, number 8 in the US and sold almost 3.5 million copies worldwide by 2011.

After promoting &quot;And Winter Came&quot;, Enya took an extended break from writing and recording music. She spent her time resting, visiting family in Australia, and renovating her new home in the south of France. In March 2009, her first four studio albums were reissued in Japan in the Super High Material CD format with bonus tracks. Her second compilation album, &quot;The Very Best of Enya&quot;, was released in November 2009 and featured songs from 1987 to 2008, including a previously unreleased version of &quot;Aníron&quot; and a DVD compiling most of her music videos to date.

In 2012, Enya returned to the studio to record her eighth album, &quot;Dark Sky Island&quot;. Its name refers to the island of Sark, which became the first island to be designated a dark-sky preserve, and a series of poems on islands by Roma Ryan.

In 2013, &quot;Only Time&quot; was used in the &quot;Epic Split&quot; advertisement by Volvo Trucks starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, who does the splits while suspended between two lorries. As a result, Enya&#x27;s song &quot;Only Time&quot; re-entered both the US Billboard 100 and UK Official Charts in November 2013.

Dark Sky Island was announced on Enya&#x27;s website on 15 September 2015. Prior to this, guest musician Eddie Lee shared a post in August 2015, which indicated that new music by Enya was in progress.

Upon the album&#x27;s streaming release on 20 November 2015, a week before physical release, &quot;Dark Sky Island&quot; went to number 4 in the UK album charts, Enya&#x27;s highest charting studio album since &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; went to number 1. The album went to number 8 in the US. A deluxe edition features three additional songs. Enya completed a promotional tour of the UK, Europe, the US, and Japan. During her visit to Japan, Enya performed &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; and &quot;Echoes in Rain&quot; at the Universal Studios Japan Christmas show in Osaka. In Japan, in addition to performances of her music, she made several TV appearances featuring her partaking in Japanese culture, including wearing a kimono, walking through Maruyama Park in Kyoto, and visiting the top floor of the Tokyo Skytree.

On 22 July 2016, Bosnian-Swedish DJ Salvatore Ganacci released the single &quot;Dive&quot;, which heavily samples &quot;Boadicea&quot; and features vocals from Alex Aris. The single peaked number 14 on the US Billboard Dance/Electronic Digital Songs Sales chart.

In December 2016, Enya appeared on the Irish television show &quot;Christmas Carols from Cork&quot;, marking her first Irish television appearance in over seven years. She sang &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot;, &quot;Oíche Chiúin&quot;, and &quot;The Spirit of Christmas Past&quot;.

===2019–present; further acclaim and future projects===
Since late 2019, there had been a significant increase in activity from Enya&#x27;s official social platforms. There have been more official Enya posts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, updates to Enya tracks and playlists on Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music, as well as YouTube channel updates and new content. Several music videos on Enya&#x27;s official YouTube channel have undergone 4K/HD conversion since 2020. Numerous YouTube &quot;watch party&quot; videos and vinyl re-releases marking anniversaries of Enya&#x27;s music albums and compilations have been released since. Regarding a new studio album, there have been mentions about Enya recording new music, according to several close sources. As of 2019, Enya&#x27;s sister Moya Brennan had mentioned that Enya was recording music.

The first of these videos was in November 2020, posted on Enya&#x27;s official YouTube channel to commemorate the 20th anniversary of &quot;A Day Without Rain.&quot; In addition to the individual tracks from the album, it included handwritten introductory messages from Enya and Roma Ryan, plus a closing message from Nicky Ryan. Some behind-the-scenes clips from the making-of the music videos for &quot;Only Time&quot; and &quot;Wild Child&quot;, both directed by Graham Fink, were also included.

For the &quot;Shepherd Moons 30th Anniversary Watch Party video&quot; in November 2021, Nicky Ryan&#x27;s introductory message noted that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Aigle Studio underwent some renovations, with new recording equipment and instruments installed, and that with this done, Enya and the Ryans were eager to start working on new music.

A 20th-anniversary vinyl picture disc re-release of the &quot;May It Be&quot; single was also released in late 2021.

Enya&#x27;s music continues to be sampled or interpolated by many modern-day producers, particularly her 1986 humming song &quot;Boadicea&quot;, in songs within the R&amp;B or hip-hop genres. Enya had previously noted for her 2015 album Dark Sky Island, that &quot;several songs here have a stronger beat, and even a little hip-hop influence&quot;.

In 2022, for Metro Boomin and The Weeknd&#x27;s song &quot;Creepin&#x27;&quot; featuring samples from her 1987 song &quot;Boadicea&quot;, Enya didn&#x27;t approve of the song to be released under the working title &quot;IDWK&quot; (referring to the song I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know). Metro reportedly asked Enya to select song titles that she would be happy with, which included &quot;Undecided,&quot; &quot;Creepin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Back to Me&quot;, &quot;Better Off That Way&quot; and &quot;Wanna Let You Know&quot;. Metro said &quot;Creepin was the one [...] It ended up being a blessing because it&#x27;s the best name for it.&quot;

In early December 2024, Creepin&#x27; won the BMI London Song of the Year, with composition credits and awards including both Enya and Nick [sic] Ryan.

In June 2023, Enya&#x27;s 1997 limited compilation &quot;A Box of Dreams&quot; was re-issued on 6 vinyl LPs, featuring new liner notes. Nicky Ryan confirmed that the trio were working on a new album and floated the possibility of a book based on the trio&#x27;s thoughts regarding the &quot;Oceans&quot; tracks. Enya&#x27;s note, in Irish, read &quot;Beidh muid ag teacht le chéile gan mhoile&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;We will meet again soon&quot;. Roma Ryan also updated the liner notes with several newer thoughts about the songs, constellations, and poetry.

On 19 September 2023, a watch party video for the 35th anniversary of &quot;Watermark&quot; was also presented. Alongside this, vinyl LPs of Watermark and a Dolby Atmos upmixed audio for &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; were also released.

Enya&#x27;s official website was rebooted, returned to Warner ownership and stylised in September 2023. It has, however, lain dormant since.

On 20 February 2025, on the RTÉ Gold Breakfast Show, Enya was announced as the 2024 winner of the RTÉ Choice Music Prize, for Classic Irish Album, &quot;Watermark&quot;. Enya will receive her award at a live event at Vicar Street, Dublin, on 6 March 2025. The Music Prize show will be officially televised on 13 March 2025. 

The announcement of her award was soon followed by Enya&#x27;s statement: &quot;I am delighted to win the RTÉ Choice Music Classic Album Prize. &quot;Watermark&quot; has a special place in my heart - it was my second album and really launched my career internationally. It is wonderful that people are still discovering it today and it&#x27;s an honour to be chosen for this prize recognising Irish music.&quot;

==Musical style==

Enya has cited her musical foundations as &quot;the classics&quot;, church music, and &quot;Irish reels and jigs&quot; with a particular interest in Sergei Rachmaninoff, a favourite composer of hers. Enya was also an early adopter of synthesiser music, a skilled synth player, which equalled the significance of her singing, especially on her album &quot;Watermark&quot;. Since 1982, Enya has recorded music with Nicky Ryan as her producer and arranger, and his wife Roma Ryan as lyricist. During her time with Clannad, Enya chose to work with Nicky as the two shared an interest in vocal harmonies, and Ryan, influenced by The Beach Boys and the &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; technique that Phil Spector pioneered, wanted to explore the idea of &quot;the multi-vocals&quot; for which her music became known. According to Enya, &quot;Angeles&quot; from &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; has roughly 500 vocals recorded individually and layered. Enya performs all vocals and the majority of instruments in her songs, apart from guest musicians (some percussion, guitar, violin, uilleann pipes, cornet, and double bass). Her early works, including &quot;Enya&quot; and &quot;Watermark,&quot; feature numerous keyboard synthesisers including the Yamaha KX88 Master, Yamaha DX7, Oberheim Matrix, Kurzweil K250, Fairlight III, E-mu Emulator II, Akai S900, PPG Wave Computer 360, Roland D-50 (with the &quot;Pizzagogo&quot; patch, famously used in &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;), and the Roland Juno-60, the latter a particular favourite of hers. Her vast vocal range has been classified as mezzo-soprano.

Numerous critics and reviewers classify Enya&#x27;s albums as new-age music and she has won four Grammy Awards in the category. However, Enya does not consider her music as part of the genre; &quot;the only way I can describe it [...] it&#x27;s &quot;Enya&quot; music&quot;. Nicky Ryan commented on the new age designation: &quot;Initially it was fine, but it&#x27;s really not new age. Enya plays a whole lot of instruments, not just keyboards. Her melodies are strong and she sings a lot. So I can&#x27;t see a comparison.&quot; In 1988, Enya is believed to have said about New Age music &quot;it&#x27;s air, thin air. It&#x27;s a musical drug&quot; and noted its often spineless nature, dissimilar to the approach taken in her own music. In an interview first published in 2017, Enya said that she &quot;felt that title [New-Age] was given to any musician whom critics didn&#x27;t know how to pigeonhole.&quot;

The inspirations behind several of the visuals accompanying Enya&#x27;s music originate from old artwork. The 1991 music video for &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot;, and the 1995 album cover artwork for &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; both feature adapted works from artist Maxfield Parrish. In the 1996 music video for &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, scenes of girls lighting paper lanterns to hang in flowery foliage were inspired by John Singer Sargent&#x27;s painting &quot;Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose&quot;.

In addition to her native Irish, Enya has recorded songs in languages including English, French, Latin, Spanish, and Welsh. She has recorded music influenced by works from fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien, including the instrumental &quot;Lothlórien&quot; from &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;. For &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, she sang &quot;May It Be&quot; in English and Tolkien&#x27;s fictional language Quenya, and she sang &quot;Aníron&quot; in another of Tolkien&#x27;s fictional languages, Sindarin. &quot;Amarantine&quot; and &quot;Dark Sky Island&quot; include songs sung in Loxian, a fictional language created by Roma Ryan, that has no official syntax. Its vocabulary was formed by Enya singing the song&#x27;s notes to which Roma wrote their phonetic spelling.

Enya adopted a composing and songwriting method that has deviated little throughout her career. At the start of the recording process for an album, she enters the studio, forgetting about her previous success, fame, and songs of hers that became hits. &quot;If I did that&quot;, she said, &quot;I&#x27;d have to call it a day&quot;. She then develops ideas on the piano, keeping note of any arrangement that can be worked on further. During her time writing the music, Enya works a five-day week, takes weekends off, and does not work on her music at home. With Irish as her first language, Enya initially records her songs in Irish as she can express &quot;feeling much more directly&quot; in Irish than in English. After some time, Enya presents her ideas to Nicky to discuss what pieces work best, while Roma works in parallel to devise lyrics for the songs. Enya considered &quot;Fallen Embers&quot; from &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; a perfect time when the lyrics reflect how she felt while writing the song. In 2008, she realised her tendency to write &quot;two or three songs&quot; during the winter months, work on the arrangements and lyrics the following spring and summer, and then work on the next couple of songs when autumn arrives.

==Live performances==
Enya says that Warner Music and she &quot;did not see eye to eye&quot; initially as the label imagined her performing on stage &quot;with a piano... maybe two or three synthesizer players and that&#x27;s it&quot;. Enya also explained that the time put into her studio albums caused her to &quot;run overtime&quot;, leaving little time to plan for other such projects. She also expressed the difficulty in recreating her studio-oriented sound for the stage. In 1996, Nicky Ryan said Enya had received and turned down an offer worth almost £500,000 to perform one concert in Japan. In 2016, Enya spoke about the prospect of a live concert when she revealed talks with the Ryans during her three-year break after &quot;And Winter Came...&quot; (2008) to perform a show at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City that would be simulcast to cinemas worldwide. Before such an event could happen, Nicky suggested that she enter a studio and record &quot;all the hits&quot; live with an orchestra and choir to see how they would sound.

Enya has performed with live and lip-syncing vocals on various talk and music shows, events, and ceremonies throughout her career, most often during her worldwide press tours for each album. In December 1995, she performed &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; at a Christmas concert at Vatican City with Pope John Paul II in attendance; he later met and thanked her for performing. In April 1996, Enya performed the same song during her surprise appearance at the fiftieth birthday celebration for Carl XVI Gustaf, the king of Sweden and a fan of Enya&#x27;s. In 1997, Enya participated in a live Christmas Eve broadcast in London and flew to County Donegal afterward to join her family for their annual midnight Mass choral performance, in which she participates each year. In March 2002, she performed &quot;May It Be&quot; with an orchestra at the year&#x27;s Academy Awards/Oscars ceremony. Enya and her sisters performed as part of the local choir Cór Mhuire in July 2005 at St. Mary&#x27;s church in Derrybeg, Gweedore, during the annual Earagail Arts Festival.

==Personal life==

Known for her private lifestyle alongside the music, Enya said in the mid-1990s, &quot;The music is what sells. Not me, or what I stand for... that&#x27;s the way I&#x27;ve always wanted it.&quot; In a German interview from 2005, Enya stated &quot;I have always been shy. In former times, I wasn’t happy with that, but today I accept it and live my life after it. And I dare to express something private like emotions in my music and make it visible for the public&quot;. Enya later mentioned in 2008 that “it’s more important to have my private life and freedom than come out and argue about how I’m seen”, regarding it as &quot;a small disadvantage in trying to retain my privacy. I can live with it.&quot;

She has not married and has no children, but has many nieces and nephews and is considered an aunt to the Ryans&#x27; two daughters, having shared their Artane home for almost a decade. In 1991, she said, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid of marriage because I&#x27;m afraid someone might want me because of who I am instead of because they loved me... I wouldn&#x27;t go rushing into anything unexpected, but I do think a great deal about this.&quot; Press often alluded to a relationship ending for Enya in 1997, and that around this time she was considering taking time out of music to have a family. Enya found she was putting pressure on herself over the matter and has &quot;gone the route [she] wanted to go&quot; after all.

Enya has identified herself as &quot;more spiritual than religious&quot; and has said that she sometimes prays, but prefers &quot;going into churches when they&#x27;re empty&quot;. Though her political stances are rarely disclosed, in 1988 she stated that &quot;there is money in Ireland but it&#x27;s not fairly divided. Generations-old potentates and politicians have reduced the whole nation to beggary.&quot;

As a result of injury from a car crash in Dublin that year, Enya mentioned that &quot;it took a lot of work to get my body back to singing. It was traumatic and shocking, but as a result I became more aware of my health and stronger as a person.&quot; This was several weeks before that of Princess Diana. Enya recalled in 1997, &quot;I met Lady Diana twice and the second time we met she told me that my composition Watermark was a favourite melody of hers.&quot; Enya&#x27;s track Watermark was included on the artist compilation album in 1997, &quot;Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute&quot;.

At an auction in 1997, Enya spent £2.5 million on a 157-year-old Victorian listed castellated mansion in Killiney. Formerly known as &quot;Victoria Castle&quot; and &quot;Ayesha Castle&quot;, the house was renamed by Enya as Manderley Castle after the house featured in Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Rebecca&quot; . Prior to moving into the castle, Enya was believed to have resided in London, and spent time there throughout the 2000s. She spent several years renovating the castle, and installing considerable security measures because of threats from stalkers. The improvements covered gaps in the house&#x27;s outer wall, installed new solid timber entrance gates and iron railings, and brought the surrounding of stone wall up to a new height of . In late 2005, the property had two security breaches; during one incident, two people attacked and tied up one of her housekeepers before stealing several items. Enya alerted police by raising an alarm from her safe room. Enya oversaw most of the interior design (decorations and furnishings of her castle) as she was &quot;not going to trust that to anyone else&quot;. Enya also has an autographed picture of Sergei Rachmaninoff in her home. Enya later bought a home in the south of France, also close in location to the home of U2 singer Bono, near Èze. She spent time renovating it to a more contemporary style than the Victorian style of her castle home.

Enya also has a great appreciation for art, collecting artworks by Irish artists including Jack Butler Yeats and Louis le Brocquy and the British artist Albert Goodwin. She also likes painting, although has been reluctant to share it previously as &quot;it shows too much of myself. If it is included in a song, it’s less a problem for me.&quot; Enya later mentioned that painting is &quot;something very personal. I share my thoughts when composing music but I prefer painting to stay private, at least for a few years.&quot;

Enya recalled reading books in her youth such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and the Malory Towers series by Enid Blyton, prior to going to boarding school herself. Enya mentioned her favourite books being &quot;Rebecca&quot; by Daphne du Maurier and &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; by Oscar Wilde. Enya has shown admiration for the literary works of both Wilde and J. R. R. Tolkien. First editions of books are also something Enya enjoys collecting.

Visual-media-wise, Enya has mentioned watching operas, such as Madame Butterfly at the Sydney Opera House, especially as she frequently travels to Australia to visit her sister and other relatives, occasionally getting noticed &quot;at the most obscure places&quot; she added in 2008. She also likes watching classic black-and-white films, especially those directed by Alfred Hitchcock. She is also drawn to watching crime dramas or period drama series, such as &quot;Breaking Bad,&quot; and &quot;Mad Men,&quot; saying &quot;myself, Nicky, and Roma are huge fans of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. We just didn&#x27;t miss an episode.&quot;

==Recognition and legacy==
Enya is the best-selling Irish solo artist and one of the most influential vocalists of all time. At the family pub Leo&#x27;s Tavern, memorabilia that celebrates musical achievements of Enya and her siblings, notably those in Clannad, are displayed across the walls inside. Enya is admired by, and has influenced a number of artists from several genres, including Aurora, Weyes Blood, FKA Twigs, Grimes, Adam Young, Cynthia Erivo, and Nicki Minaj, who declared in a television interview: &quot;One of my biggest [musical influences] is Enya&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; estimated her fortune at £91 million, making her part of their Top 50 millionaire musicians in Britain and Ireland. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, Enya is one of the all-time highest-charted Irish acts on U.S charts, and is one of the highest-certified music artists by album units in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Mark Dezzani commented in 1997, that she popularized conventional pop melodies and ethereal ethnic music, while &quot;Audio&quot; magazine credited her for helping popularize the &quot;New Celtic&quot; sound. Enya was described by National Geographic&#x27;s &quot;Ireland&quot; (2022) book, as the &quot;Queen of ambient Celtic lullabies&quot;. In Lonely Planet&#x27;s 2024 description of Donegal, the county in Ireland that Enya is from, Donegal was described by the Destination Editor as the &quot;wild child of Ireland&quot;, a likely reference to the single &quot;Wild Child&quot; by Enya in 2000. Two of Enya&#x27;s albums, &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars: The Best of Enya&quot; (1997) and &quot;Themes from Calmi Cuori Appassionati&quot; (2001) have sold over a million copies in Japan, the latter a soundtrack of Enya&#x27;s hits from 1986 to 2000 that was included in the Japanese film &quot;Calmi Cuori Appassionati&quot;.

Enya receiving the 2024 RTÉ Choice Music Prize for Classic Album is testament to her lasting significance in Irish music and beyond.

===Honorary degrees and namings===

In 1991, a minor planet first discovered in 1978, 6433 Enya, was named after her. In June 2007, she received an honorary PhD doctorate from the National University of Ireland, Galway, for her contributions to music. A month later, she also received another honorary doctorate, a DLitt from the University of Ulster. In 2017, a newly discovered species of fish, &quot;Leporinus enyae&quot;, found in the Orinoco River drainage area, was named after Enya, in reference to her song, &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;.

<text>East Berlin (; ) was the partially recognised capital of East Germany (GDR) from 1949 to 1990. From 1945, it was the Soviet occupation sector of Berlin. The American, British, and French sectors were known as West Berlin. From 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989, East Berlin was separated from West Berlin by the Berlin Wall. The Western Allied powers did not recognize East Berlin as the GDR&#x27;s capital, nor the GDR&#x27;s authority to govern East Berlin. For most of its administrative existence, East Berlin was officially known as Berlin, capital of the GDR () by the GDR government. On 3 October 1990, the day Germany was officially reunified, East and West Berlin formally reunited as the city of Berlin.

==Overview==
With the London Protocol of 1944 signed on 12 September 1944, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union decided to divide Germany into three occupation zones and to establish a special area of Berlin, which was occupied by the three Allied Forces together. In May 1945, the Soviet Union installed a city government for the whole city that was called &quot;Magistrate of Greater Berlin&quot;, which existed until 1947. After the war, the Allied Forces initially administered the city together within the Allied Kommandatura, which served as the governing body of the city. However, in 1948 the Soviet representative left the Kommandatura and the common administration broke apart during the following months. In the Soviet sector, a separate city government was established, which continued to call itself the &quot;Magistrate of Greater Berlin&quot;.

When the German Democratic Republic was established in 1949, it immediately claimed East Berlin as its capital—a claim that was recognized by all communist countries. Nevertheless, East Berlin&#x27;s representatives to the were not directly elected and did not have full voting rights until 1981.

In June 1948, all railways and roads leading to West Berlin were blocked, and East Berliners were not allowed to emigrate. Nevertheless, more than 1,000 East Germans were escaping to West Berlin each day by 1960, caused by the strains on the East German economy from war reparations owed to the Soviet Union, massive destruction of industry, and lack of assistance from the Marshall Plan. In August 1961, the East German Government tried to stop the population exodus by separating West Berlin by the Berlin Wall. It was very dangerous for fleeing residents to cross because armed soldiers were trained to shoot illegal emigrants.

East Germany was a socialist republic. Eventually, Christian churches were allowed to operate without restraint after years of harassment by authorities. In the 1970s, the wages of East Berliners rose and working hours fell.

The Soviet Union and the Communist Bloc recognized East Berlin as the GDR&#x27;s capital. However, Western Allies (the United States, United Kingdom, and France) never formally acknowledged the authority of the East German government to govern East Berlin. Official Allied protocol recognized only the authority of the Soviet Union in East Berlin in accordance with the occupation status of Berlin as a whole. The United States Command Berlin, for example, published detailed instructions for U.S. military and civilian personnel wishing to visit East Berlin. In fact, the three Western commandants regularly protested against the presence of the East German National People&#x27;s Army in East Berlin, particularly on the occasion of military parades. Nevertheless, the three Western Allies eventually established embassies in East Berlin in the 1970s, although they never recognized it as the capital of East Germany. Treaties instead used terms such as &quot;seat of government&quot;.

On 3 October 1990, East and West Germany and East and West Berlin were reunited, thus formally ending the existence of East Berlin. Citywide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first &quot;all-Berlin&quot; mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring at the time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.

== Historical population ==
East Berlin reached its highest population in 1988 with 1.28 million. The lowest value was in 1961, the year the Berlin Wall was built, with under 1.06 million registered. The figures in the following table, unless otherwise indicated, are from the official central statistical office of East Germany. 
==East Berlin today==
Since reunification, the German government has spent vast amounts of money on reintegrating the two halves of the city and bringing services and infrastructure in the former East Berlin up to the standard established in West Berlin.

After reunification, the East German economy suffered significantly. Under the adopted policy of privatization of state-owned firms under the auspices of the , many East German factories were shut down—which also led to mass unemployment—due to gaps in productivity with and investment compared to West German companies, as well as an inability to comply with West German pollution and safety standards in a way that was deemed cost-effective. Because of this, a massive amount of West German economic aid was poured into East Germany to revitalize it. This stimulus was part-funded through a 7.5% tax on income for individuals and companies (in addition to normal income tax or company tax) known as the &quot;&quot; (SolZG) or &quot;solidarity surcharge&quot;, which though only in effect for 1991–1992 (later reintroduced in 1995 at 7.5 and then dropped down to 5.5% in 1998 and continues to be levied to this day) led to a great deal of resentment toward the East Germans.

Despite the large sums of economic aid poured into East Berlin, there still remain obvious differences between the former East and West Berlins. East Berlin has a distinct visual style; this is partly due to the greater survival of prewar façades and streetscapes, with some still showing signs of wartime damage. The unique look of Socialist Classicism that was used in East Berlin (along with the rest of the former GDR) also contrasts markedly with the urban development styles employed in the former West Berlin. Additionally, the former East Berlin (along with the rest of the former GDR) retains a small number of its GDR-era street and place names commemorating German socialist heroes, such as Karl-Marx-Allee, Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, and Karl-Liebknecht-Straße. Many such names, however, were deemed inappropriate (for various reasons) and, through decommunization, changed after a long process of review (so, for instance, Leninallee reverted to Landsberger Allee in 1991, and Dimitroffstraße reverted to Danziger Straße in 1995).

Another symbolic icon of the former East Berlin (and of East Germany as a whole) is the (tr. &quot;little traffic light men&quot;), a stylized version of a fedora-wearing man crossing the street, which is found on traffic lights at many pedestrian crosswalks throughout the former East. Following a civic debate about whether the should be abolished or disseminated more widely (due to concerns of consistency), several crosswalks in some parts of the former West Berlin began to employ the .

Twenty-five years after the two cities were reunified, the people of East and West Berlin still had noticeable differences between them, and these differences became more apparent among the older generations. The two groups also had sometimes-derogatory slang terms to refer to each other. A former East Berliner (or East German) was known as an &quot;&#x27;&quot; (from the German word for east, &#x27;), and a former West Berliner (or West German) was known as a &quot;&#x27;&quot; (from the German word for west, &#x27;). Both sides also engaged in stereotyping the other. A stereotypical &#x27; had little ambition or poor work ethic and was chronically bitter, while a stereotypical &#x27; was arrogant, selfish, impatient and pushy.

<text>This is a list of international environmental agreements.

Most of the following agreements are legally binding for countries that have formally ratified them. Some, such as the Kyoto Protocol, differentiate between types of countries and each nation&#x27;s respective responsibilities under the agreement. Several hundred international environmental agreements exist but most cover only a limited number of countries. These bilateral or sometimes trilateral agreements are only binding for the countries that have ratified them but are nevertheless essential in the international environmental regime. Including the major conventions listed below, more than 3,000 international environmental instruments have been identified by the IEA Database Project.

<doc id="9487" wikidata="Q14392" url="?curid=9487" title="Epsilon">
<text>Epsilon (, ; uppercase &#x27;, lowercase &#x27; or ; ) is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, corresponding phonetically to a mid front unrounded vowel or . In the system of Greek numerals it also has the value five. It was derived from the Phoenician letter He . Letters that arose from epsilon include the Roman E, Ë and Ɛ, and Cyrillic Е, È, Ё, Є and Э. The name of the letter was originally (), but it was later changed to ( &#x27;simple e&#x27;) in the Middle Ages to distinguish the letter from the digraph , a former diphthong that had come to be pronounced the same as epsilon.

The uppercase form of epsilon is identical to Latin but has its own code point in Unicode: . The lowercase version has two typographical variants, both inherited from medieval Greek handwriting. One, the most common in modern typography and inherited from medieval minuscule, looks like a reversed number &quot;3&quot; and is encoded . The other, also known as lunate or uncial epsilon and inherited from earlier uncial writing, looks like a semicircle crossed by a horizontal bar: it is encoded . While in normal typography these are just alternative font variants, they may have different meanings as mathematical symbols: computer systems therefore offer distinct encodings for them. In TeX, codice_1 ( formula_1 ) denotes the lunate form, while codice_2 ( formula_2 ) denotes the epsilon number. Unicode versions 2.0.0 and onwards use as the lowercase Greek epsilon letter, but in version 1.0.0, was used. The lunate or uncial epsilon provided inspiration for the euro sign, .

There is also a &#x27;Latin epsilon&#x27;, or &quot;open e&quot;, which looks similar to the Greek lowercase epsilon. It is encoded in Unicode as and and is used as an IPA phonetic symbol. This Latin uppercase epsilon, , is not to be confused with the Greek uppercase (sigma)

The lunate epsilon, , is not to be confused with the set membership symbol . The symbol formula_3, first used in set theory and logic by Giuseppe Peano and now used in mathematics in general for set membership (&quot;belongs to&quot;), evolved from the letter epsilon, since the symbol was originally used as an abbreviation for the Latin word . In addition, mathematicians often read the symbol as &quot;element of&quot;, as in &quot;1 is an element of the natural numbers&quot; for formula_4, for example. As late as 1960, itself was used for set membership, while its negation &quot;does not belong to&quot; (now ) was denoted by (epsilon prime). Only gradually did a fully separate, stylized symbol take the place of epsilon in this role. In a related context, Peano also introduced the use of a backwards epsilon, , for the phrase &quot;such that&quot;, although the abbreviation &quot;s.t.&quot; is occasionally used in place of in informal cardinals.

==History==

===Origin===
The letter was adopted from the Phoenician letter He () when Greeks first adopted alphabetic writing. In archaic Greek writing, its shape is often still identical to that of the Phoenician letter. Like other Greek letters, it could face either leftward or rightward (), depending on the current writing direction, but, just as in Phoenician, the horizontal bars always faced in the direction of writing. Archaic writing often preserves the Phoenician form with a vertical stem extending slightly below the lowest horizontal bar. In the classical era, through the influence of more cursive writing styles, the shape was simplified to the current glyph.

===Sound value===
While the original pronunciation of the Phoenician letter &quot;He&quot; was , the earliest Greek sound value of Ε was determined by the vowel occurring in the Phoenician letter name, which made it a natural choice for being reinterpreted from a consonant symbol to a vowel symbol denoting an sound. Besides its classical Greek sound value, the short phoneme, it could initially also be used for other -like sounds. For instance, in early Attic before , it was used also both for the long, open , and for the long close . In the former role, it was later replaced in the classic Greek alphabet by Eta (), which was taken over from eastern Ionic alphabets, while in the latter role it was replaced by the digraph spelling ΕΙ.

===Epichoric alphabets===
Some dialects used yet other ways of distinguishing between various e-like sounds.

In Corinth, the normal function of to denote and was taken by a glyph resembling a pointed B (), while was used only for long close . The letter Beta, in turn, took the deviant shape .

In Sicyon, a variant glyph resembling an () was used in the same function as Corinthian .

In Thespiai (Boeotia), a special letter form consisting of a vertical stem with a single rightward-pointing horizontal bar () was used for what was probably a raised variant of in pre-vocalic environments. This tack glyph was used elsewhere also as a form of &quot;Heta&quot;, i.e. for the sound .

===Glyph variants===
After the establishment of the canonical classical Ionian (Euclidean) Greek alphabet, new glyph variants for Ε were introduced through handwriting. In the uncial script (used for literary papyrus manuscripts in late antiquity and then in early medieval vellum codices), the &quot;lunate&quot; shape () became predominant. In cursive handwriting, a large number of shorthand glyphs came to be used, where the cross-bar and the curved stroke were linked in various ways. Some of them resembled a modern lowercase Latin &quot;e&quot;, some a &quot;6&quot; with a connecting stroke to the next letter starting from the middle, and some a combination of two small &quot;c&quot;-like curves. Several of these shapes were later taken over into minuscule book hand. Of the various minuscule letter shapes, the inverted-3 form became the basis for lower-case Epsilon in Greek typography during the modern era.

==Uses==

===International Phonetic Alphabet===
Despite its pronunciation as mid, in the International Phonetic Alphabet, the Latin epsilon represents open-mid front unrounded vowel, as in the English word &quot;pet&quot; .

===Symbol===
The uppercase Epsilon is not commonly used outside of the Greek language because of its similarity to the Latin letter E. However, it is commonly used in structural mechanics with Young&#x27;s Modulus equations for calculating tensile, compressive and areal strain.

The Greek lowercase epsilon , the lunate epsilon symbol , and the Latin lowercase epsilon (see above) are used in a variety of places:

* In engineering mechanics, strain calculations ϵ = increase of length / original length. Usually this relates to extensometer testing of metallic materials.
* In mathematics 
** (In early calculus or nonstandard analysis) An infinitesimally small positive quantity is commonly denoted ε. 
*** (In analysis) By extension, a quantity thought of as &quot;small,&quot; &quot;negligible,&quot; or, especially, &quot;arbitrarily small,&quot; is often denoted ε. For instance, quantities subject to a limit which takes them towards zero are often denoted ε; see (ε, δ)-definition of limit.
** Hilbert introduced epsilon terms formula_5 as an extension to first-order logic; see epsilon calculus.
** it is used to represent the Levi-Civita symbol.
** it is used to represent dual numbers: formula_6, with formula_7 and formula_8.
** it is sometimes used to denote the Heaviside step function.
** in set theory, the epsilon numbers are ordinal numbers that satisfy the fixed point ε = ωε. The first epsilon number, ε0, is the limit ordinal of the set {ω, ωω, ωωω, ...}.
** in numerical analysis and statistics it is used as the error term
** in group theory it is used as the idempotent group when e is in use as a variable name
* In computer science
** it often represents the empty string, though different writers use a variety of other symbols for the empty string as well; usually the lower-case Greek letter lambda (λ).
** the machine epsilon indicates the upper bound on the relative error due to rounding in floating point arithmetic.
* In physics, 
** it indicates the permittivity of a medium; with the subscript 0 (ε0) it is the permittivity of free space.
** it can also indicate the strain of a material (a ratio of extensions).
** in quantum field theory, it usually indicates the dimensional regularization parameter.
* In automata theory, it shows a transition that involves no shifting of an input symbol.
* In astronomy, 
** it stands for the fifth-brightest star in a constellation (see Bayer designation).
** Epsilon is the name for the most distant and most visible ring of Uranus.
** In planetary science, ε denotes the axial tilt.
* In chemistry, it represents the molar extinction coefficient of a chromophore.
* In economics, ε refers to elasticity.
* In statistics, 
** it is used to refer to error terms.
** it also can to refer to the degree of sphericity in repeated measures ANOVAs.
* In agronomy, it is used to represent the &quot;photosynthetic efficiency&quot; of a particular plant or crop.

<text>Eta ( ; uppercase &#x27;, lowercase &#x27;; &quot;ē̂ta&quot; or &quot;ita&quot; ) is the seventh letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the close front unrounded vowel, . Originally denoting the voiceless glottal fricative, , in most dialects of Ancient Greek, its sound value in the classical Attic dialect was a long open-mid front unrounded vowel, , which was raised to in Hellenistic Greek, a process known as iotacism or itacism.

In the ancient Attic number system (Herodianic or acrophonic numbers), the number 100 was represented by &quot;&quot;, because it was the initial of , the ancient spelling of = &quot;one hundred&quot;. In the later system of (Classical) Greek numerals eta represents 8. 

Eta was derived from the Phoenician letter heth . Letters that arose from eta include the Latin H and the Cyrillic letters И and Й.

==History==

===Consonant h===

The letter shape &#x27;H&#x27; was originally used in most Greek dialects to represent the voiceless glottal fricative, . In this function, it was borrowed in the 8th century BC by the Etruscan and other Old Italic alphabets, which were based on the Euboean form of the Greek alphabet. This also gave rise to the Latin alphabet with its letter H.

Other regional variants of the Greek alphabet (epichoric alphabets), in dialects that still preserved the sound , employed various glyph shapes for consonantal &quot;heta&quot; side by side with the new vocalic &quot;eta&quot; for some time. 
In the southern Italian colonies of Heracleia and Tarentum, the letter shape was reduced to a &quot;half-heta&quot; lacking the right vertical stem (Ͱ). From this sign later developed the sign for rough breathing or &quot;spiritus asper&quot;, which brought back the marking of the sound into the standardized post-classical (polytonic) orthography.
Dionysius Thrax in the second century BC records that the letter name was still pronounced &quot;heta&quot; (ἥτα), correctly explaining this irregularity by stating &quot;in the old days the letter Η served to stand for the rough breathing, as it still does with the Romans.&quot;

===Long e===
In the East Ionic dialect, however, the sound disappeared by the sixth century BC, and the letter was re-used initially to represent a development of a long open front unrounded vowel, , which later merged in East Ionic with the long open-mid front unrounded vowel, instead. In 403 BC, Athens took over the Ionian spelling system and with it the vocalic use of H (even though it still also had the sound itself at that time). This later became the standard orthography in all of Greece.

===Itacism===
During the time of post-classical Koiné Greek, the sound represented by eta was raised and merged with several other formerly distinct vowels, a phenomenon called &quot;iotacism&quot; or &quot;itacism&quot;, after the new pronunciation of the letter name as &quot;ita&quot; instead of &quot;eta&quot;.

Itacism is continued into Modern Greek, where the letter name is pronounced and represents the close front unrounded vowel, . It shares this function with several other letters (ι, υ) and digraphs (ει, οι, υι), which are all pronounced alike.

===Cyrillic script===
Eta was also borrowed with the sound value of into the Cyrillic script, where it gave rise to the Cyrillic letter И.

==Uses==

===Letter===
In Modern Greek, due to iotacism, the letter (pronounced ) represents a close front unrounded vowel, . In Classical Greek, it represented the long open-mid front unrounded vowel, .

===Symbol===

====Upper case====
The uppercase letter Η is used as a symbol in textual criticism for the Alexandrian text-type (from Hesychius, its once-supposed editor).

In chemistry, the letter H as symbol of enthalpy sometimes is said to be a Greek eta, but since enthalpy comes from ἐνθάλπος, which begins in a smooth breathing and epsilon, it is more likely a Latin H for &#x27;heat&#x27;.

In information theory the uppercase Greek letter Η is used to represent the concept of entropy of a discrete random variable.

====Lower case====
The lowercase letter η is used as a symbol in:
*Thermodynamics, the efficiency of a Carnot heat engine, or packing fraction.
*Aeronautics, the propulsive efficiency, or percentage of chemical energy converted to kinetic energy. 
*Chemistry, the hapticity, or the number of atoms of a ligand attached to one coordination site of the metal in a coordination compound. For example, an allyl group can coordinate to palladium in the η¹ mode (only one atom of an allyl group attached to palladium) or the η³ mode (3 atoms attached to palladium).
*Optics, the electromagnetic impedance of a medium, or the quantum efficiency of detectors.
*Particle physics, to represent the η mesons.
*Experimental particle physics, η stands for pseudorapidity.
*Cosmology, η represents conformal time; dt = adη.
*Cosmology, baryon–photon ratio.
*Relativity and Quantum field theory (physics), η (with two subscripts) represents the metric tensor of Minkowski space (flat spacetime).
*Statistics, &quot;η&quot;2 is the &quot;partial regression coefficient&quot;. &quot;η&quot; is the symbol for the linear predictor of a generalized linear model, and can also be used to denote the median of a population, or thresholding parameter in Sparse Partial Least Squares regression.
*Economics, &quot;η&quot; is the elasticity.
*Astronomy, the seventh-brightest (usually) star in a constellation. &quot;See&quot; Bayer designation.
*Mathematics, η-reduction in lambda calculus.
*Mathematics, the Dirichlet eta function, Dedekind eta function, and Weierstrass eta function.
*In category theory, the unit of an adjunction or monad is usually denoted &quot;η&quot;.
*Biology, a DNA polymerase found in higher eukaryotes and implicated in Translesion Synthesis.
*Neural network backpropagation, and stochastic gradient descent more generally, η stands for the learning rate.
*Telecommunications, η stands for efficiency
*Electronics, η stands for the ideality factor of a bipolar transistor, and has a value close to 1.000. It appears in contexts where the transistor is used as a temperature sensing device, e.g. the thermal &quot;diode&quot; transistor that is embedded within a computer&#x27;s microprocessor.
*Power electronics, η stands for the efficiency of a power supply, defined as the output power divided by the input power.
*Atmospheric science, η represents absolute atmospheric vorticity.
*Rheology, η represents viscosity.
*Oceanography, η is the measurement (usually in metres) of sea-level height above or below the mean sea-level at that same location.

<doc id="9491" wikidata="Q131242" url="?curid=9491" title="Eskimo">
<text>Eskimo () is an exonym that refers to two closely related Indigenous peoples: Inuit (including the Alaska Native Iñupiat, the Canadian Inuit, and the Greenlandic Inuit) and the Yupik (or Yuit) of eastern Siberia and Alaska. A related third group, the Aleut, who inhabit the Aleutian Islands, are generally excluded from the definition of &quot;Eskimo&quot;. The three groups share a relatively recent common ancestor, and speak related languages belonging to the family of Eskaleut languages.

These circumpolar peoples have traditionally inhabited the Arctic and subarctic regions from eastern Siberia (Russia) to Alaska (United States), Northern Canada, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut, and Greenland.

Some Inuit, Yupik, Aleut, and other individuals consider the term &quot;Eskimo&quot;, which is of a disputed etymology, to be pejorative or even offensive. &quot;Eskimo&quot; continues to be used within a historical, linguistic, archaeological, and cultural context. The governments in Canada and the United States have made moves to cease using the term &quot;Eskimo&quot; in official documents, but it has not been eliminated, as the word is in some places written into tribal, and therefore national, legal terminology. Canada officially uses the term &quot;Inuit&quot; to describe the indigenous Canadian people who are living in the country&#x27;s northern sectors and are not First Nations or Métis. The United States government legally uses &quot;Alaska Native&quot; for enrolled tribal members of the Yupik, Inuit, and Aleut, and also for non-Eskimos including the Tlingit, the Haida, the Eyak, and the Tsimshian, in addition to at least nine northern Athabaskan/Dene peoples. Other non-enrolled individuals also claim Eskimo/Aleut descent, making it the world&#x27;s &quot;most widespread aboriginal group&quot;. 

There are between 171,000 and 187,000 Inuit and Yupik, the majority of whom live in or near their traditional circumpolar homeland. Of these, 53,785 (2010) live in the United States, 70,545 (2021) in Canada, 51,730 (2021) in Greenland and 1,657 (2021) in Russia. In addition, 16,730 people living in Denmark were born in Greenland. The Inuit Circumpolar Council, a non-governmental organization (NGO), claims to represent 180,000 people.

In the Eskaleut language family, the Eskimo branch has an Inuit language sub-branch, and a sub-branch of four Yupik languages. Two Yupik languages are used in the Russian Far East as well as on St. Lawrence Island, and two in western Alaska, southwestern Alaska, and western Southcentral Alaska. The extinct Sirenik language is sometimes claimed to be related.

== Nomenclature ==

=== Etymology ===
A variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origin of the word &quot;Eskimo&quot;. According to Smithsonian linguist Ives Goddard, etymologically the word derives from the Innu-aimun (Montagnais) word , meaning &#x27;a person who laces a snowshoe&#x27;, and is related to &quot;husky&quot; (a breed of dog). The word means &#x27;she laces a snowshoe&#x27; in Innu, and Innu language speakers refer to the neighbouring Mi&#x27;kmaq people using words that sound like &quot;eskimo&quot;. This interpretation is generally confirmed by more recent academic sources.

In 1978, José Mailhot, a Quebec anthropologist who speaks Innu-aimun (Montagnais), published a paper suggesting that &quot;Eskimo&quot; meant &#x27;people who speak a different language&#x27;. French traders who encountered the Innu (Montagnais) in the eastern areas adopted their word for the more western peoples and spelled it as or in a transliteration.

Some people consider &quot;Eskimo&quot; offensive, because it is popularly perceived to mean &#x27;eaters of raw meat&#x27; in Algonquian languages common to people along the Atlantic coast. An unnamed Cree speaker suggested the original word that became corrupted to Eskimo might have been (meaning &#x27;he eats it raw&#x27;); Inuit are referred to in some Cree texts as (meaning &#x27;eats something raw&#x27;). Regardless, the term still carries a derogatory connotation for many Inuit and Yupik.

One of the first printed uses of the French word comes from Samuel Hearne&#x27;s &quot;A Journey from Prince of Wales&#x27;s Fort in Hudson&#x27;s Bay to the Northern Ocean in the Years 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772&quot; first published in 1795.

=== Usage ===

The term &quot;Eskimo&quot; is still used by people to encompass Inuit and Yupik, as well as other Indigenous or Alaska Native and Siberian peoples. In the 21st century, usage in North America has declined. Linguistic, ethnic, and cultural differences exist between Yupik and Inuit.

In Canada and Greenland, and to a certain extent in Alaska, the term &quot;Eskimo&quot; is predominantly seen as offensive and has been widely replaced by the term &quot;Inuit&quot; or terms specific to a particular group or community. This has resulted in a trend whereby some non-Indigenous people believe that they should use &quot;Inuit&quot; even for Yupik who are non-Inuit.

Greenlandic Inuit generally refer to themselves as Greenlanders ( or ) and speak the Greenlandic language and Danish. Greenlandic Inuit belong to three groups: the Kalaallit of west Greenland, who speak Kalaallisut; the Tunumiit of Tunu (east Greenland), who speak Tunumiit oraasiat (&quot;East Greenlandic&quot;); and the Inughuit of north Greenland, who speak Inuktun.

The word &quot;Eskimo&quot; is a racially charged term in Canada. In Canada&#x27;s Central Arctic, is the preferred term, and in the eastern Canadian Arctic . The language is often called &quot;Inuktitut&quot;, though other local designations are also used.

Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and section 35 of the Canadian Constitution Act of 1982 recognized Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Although &quot;Inuit&quot; can be applied to all of the Eskimo peoples in Canada and Greenland, that is not true in Alaska and Siberia. In Alaska, the term &quot;Eskimo&quot; is still used because it includes both Iñupiat (singular: Iñupiaq), who are Inuit, and Yupik, who are not.

The term &quot;Alaska Native&quot; is inclusive of (and under U.S. and Alaskan law, as well as the linguistic and cultural legacy of Alaska, refers to) all Indigenous peoples of Alaska, including not only the Iñupiat (Alaskan Inuit) and the Yupik, but also groups such as the Aleut, who share a recent ancestor, as well as the largely unrelated indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast and the Alaskan Athabaskans, such as the Eyak people. The term &quot;Alaska Native&quot; has important legal usage in Alaska and the rest of the United States as a result of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. It does not apply to Inuit or Yupik originating outside the state. As a result, the term Eskimo is still in use in Alaska. Alternative terms, such as &quot;Inuit-Yupik&quot;, have been proposed, but none has gained widespread acceptance. Early 21st century population estimates registered more than 135,000 individuals of Eskimo descent, with approximately 85,000 living in North America, 50,000 in Greenland, and the rest residing in Siberia.

=== Inuit Circumpolar Council ===
In 1977, the Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) meeting in Barrow, Alaska (now Utqiaġvik, Alaska), officially adopted &quot;Inuit&quot; as a designation for all circumpolar Native peoples, regardless of their local view on an appropriate term. They voted to replace the word &quot;Eskimo&quot; with &quot;Inuit&quot;. Even at that time, such a designation was not accepted by all. As a result, the Canadian government usage has replaced the term &quot;Eskimo&quot; with ( in singular).

The ICC charter defines &quot;Inuit&quot; as including &quot;the Inupiat, Yupik (Alaska), Inuit, Inuvialuit (Canada), Kalaallit (Greenland) and Yupik (Russia)&quot;. Despite the ICC&#x27;s 1977 decision to adopt the term &quot;Inuit&quot;, this has not been accepted by all or even most Yupik people.

In 2010, the ICC passed a resolution in which they implored scientists to use &quot;Inuit&quot; and &quot;Paleo-Inuit&quot; instead of &quot;Eskimo&quot; or &quot;Paleo-Eskimo&quot;.

==== Academic response ====
In a 2015 commentary in the journal &quot;Arctic&quot;, Canadian archaeologist Max Friesen argued fellow Arctic archaeologists should follow the ICC and use &quot;Paleo-Inuit&quot; instead of &quot;Paleo-Eskimo&quot;. In 2016, Lisa Hodgetts and &quot;Arctic&quot; editor Patricia Wells wrote: &quot;In the Canadian context, continued use of any term that incorporates &quot;Eskimo&quot; is potentially harmful to the relationships between archaeologists and the Inuit and Inuvialuit communities who are our hosts and increasingly our research partners.&quot;

Hodgetts and Wells suggested using more specific terms when possible (e.g., Dorset and Groswater) and agreed with Frieson in using the &quot;Inuit tradition&quot; to replace &quot;Neo-Eskimo&quot;, although they noted replacement for &quot;Palaeoeskimo&quot; was still an open question and discussed &quot;Paleo-Inuit&quot;, &quot;Arctic Small Tool Tradition&quot;, and &quot;pre-Inuit&quot;, as well as Inuktitut loanwords like and , as possibilities.

In 2020, Katelyn Braymer-Hayes and colleagues argued in the &quot;Journal of Anthropological Archaeology&quot; that there is a &quot;clear need&quot; to replace the terms &quot;Neo-Eskimo&quot; and &quot;Paleo-Eskimo&quot;, citing the ICC resolution, but finding a consensus within the Alaskan context particularly is difficult, since Alaska Natives do not use the word &quot;Inuit&quot; to describe themselves nor is the term legally applicable only to Iñupiat and Yupik in Alaska, and as such, terms used in Canada like &quot;Paleo Inuit&quot; and &quot;Ancestral Inuit&quot; would not be acceptable.

American linguist Lenore Grenoble has also explicitly deferred to the ICC resolution and used &quot;Inuit–Yupik&quot; instead of &quot;Eskimo&quot; with regards to the language branch.

== History ==
Genetic evidence suggests that the Americas were populated from northeastern Asia in multiple waves. While the great majority of indigenous American peoples can be traced to a single early migration of Paleo-Indians, the Na-Dené, Inuit and Indigenous Alaskan populations exhibit admixture from distinct populations that migrated into America at a later date and are closely linked to the peoples of far northeastern Asia (e.g. Chukchi), and only more remotely to the majority indigenous American type. For modern Eskimo–Aleut speakers, this later ancestral component makes up almost half of their genomes. The ancient Paleo-Eskimo population was genetically distinct from the modern circumpolar populations, but eventually derives from the same far northeastern Asian cluster. It is understood that some or all of these ancient people migrated across the Chukchi Sea to North America during the pre-neolithic era, somewhere around 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. It is believed that ancestors of the Aleut people inhabited the Aleutian Chain 10,000 years ago.


The earliest positively identified Paleo-Eskimo cultures (Early Paleo-Eskimo) date to 5,000 years ago. Several earlier indigenous peoples existed in the northern circumpolar regions of eastern Siberia, Alaska, and Canada (although probably not in Greenland). The Paleo-Eskimo peoples appear to have developed in Alaska from people related to the Arctic small tool tradition in eastern Asia, whose ancestors had probably migrated to Alaska at least 3,000 to 5,000 years earlier.

The Yupik languages and cultures in Alaska evolved in place, beginning with the original pre-Dorset Indigenous culture developed in Alaska. At least 4,000 years ago, the Unangan culture of the Aleut became distinct. It is not generally considered an Eskimo culture. However, there is some possibility of an Aleutian origin of the Dorset people, who in turn are a likely ancestor of today&#x27;s Inuit and Yupik.

Approximately 1,500 to 2,000 years ago, apparently in northwestern Alaska, two other distinct variations appeared. Inuit language became distinct and, over a period of several centuries, its speakers migrated across northern Alaska, through Canada, and into Greenland. The distinct culture of the Thule people (drawing strongly from the Birnirk culture) developed in northwestern Alaska. It very quickly spread over the entire area occupied by Eskimo peoples, though it was not necessarily adopted by all of them.

== Languages ==
=== Language family ===

The Eskimo–Aleut (also known as Eskaleut or Inuit–Yupik–Unangan) family of languages includes two cognate branches: the Aleut (Unangan) branch and the Inuit–Yupik branch.

The number of cases varies, with Aleut languages having a greatly reduced case system compared to those of the Inuit–Yupik subfamily. Inuit–Yupik–Unangan languages possess voiceless plosives at the bilabial, coronal, velar and uvular positions in all languages except Aleut, which has lost the bilabial stops but retained the nasal. In the Inuit–Yupik subfamily a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative is also present.

The Inuit–Yupik sub-family consists of the Inuit and Yupik language sub-groups. The Sirenik language, which is virtually extinct, is sometimes regarded as a third branch of the Inuit–Yupik language family. Other sources regard it as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.

Inuit languages comprise a dialect continuum, or dialect chain, that stretches from Unalakleet and Norton Sound in Alaska, across northern Alaska and Canada, and east to Greenland. Changes from western (Iñupiaq) to eastern dialects are marked by the dropping of vestigial Yupik-related features, increasing consonant assimilation (e.g., &quot;kumlu&quot;, meaning &quot;thumb&quot;, changes to &quot;kuvlu&quot;, changes to &quot;kublu&quot;, changes to &quot;kulluk&quot;, changes to &quot;kulluq&quot;,) and increased consonant lengthening, and lexical change. Thus, speakers of two adjacent Inuit dialects would usually be able to understand one another, but speakers from dialects distant from each other on the dialect continuum would have difficulty understanding one another. Seward Peninsula dialects in western Alaska, where much of the Iñupiat culture has been in place for perhaps less than 500 years, are greatly affected by phonological influence from the Yupik languages. Eastern Greenlandic, at the opposite end of Inuit range, has had significant word replacement due to a unique form of ritual name avoidance.

Ethnographically, Greenlandic Inuit belong to three groups: the Kalaallit of west Greenland, who speak Kalaallisut; the Tunumiit of Tunu (east Greenland), who speak Tunumiit oraasiat (&quot;East Greenlandic&quot;), and the Inughuit of north Greenland, who speak Inuktun.

The four Yupik languages, by contrast, including Alutiiq (Sugpiaq), Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik, Naukan (Naukanski), and Siberian Yupik, are distinct languages with phonological, morphological, and lexical differences. They demonstrate limited mutual intelligibility. Additionally, both Alutiiq and Central Yup&#x27;ik have considerable dialect diversity. The northernmost Yupik languages – Siberian Yupik and Naukan Yupik – are linguistically only slightly closer to Inuit than is Alutiiq, which is the southernmost of the Yupik languages. Although the grammatical structures of Yupik and Inuit languages are similar, they have pronounced differences phonologically. Differences of vocabulary between Inuit and any one of the Yupik languages are greater than between any two Yupik languages. Even the dialectal differences within Alutiiq and Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik sometimes are relatively great for locations that are relatively close geographically.

Despite the relatively small population of Naukan speakers, documentation of the language dates back to 1732. While Naukan is only spoken in Siberia, the language acts as an intermediate between two Alaskan languages: Siberian Yupik and Central Yup&#x27;ik.
An overview of the Inuit–Yupik–Unangan languages family is given below:
* Inuit–Yupik–Unangan
**Aleut or Unangan
****Western-Central dialects: Atkan, Attuan, Unangan, Bering (60–80 speakers)
****Eastern dialect: Unalaskan, Pribilof (400 speakers)
**Inuit–Yupik or Eskimo (Yup&#x27;ik, Yuit, and Inuit)
***Yupik
****Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik (10,000 speakers)
****Alutiiq or Pacific Gulf Yup&#x27;ik (400 speakers)
****Central Siberian Yupik or Yuit (Chaplinon and St Lawrence Island, 1,400 speakers)
****Naukan (700 speakers)
***Inuit or Inupik (75,000 speakers)
****Greenlandic (Greenland, 47,000 speakers)
*****Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic, 44,000-52,000 speakers)
*****Tunumiisut (East Greenlandic, 3,500 speakers)
****Iñupiaq (northern Alaska, 3,500 speakers)
****Inuvialuktun (western Canada; together with Siglitun, Natsilingmiutut, Inuinnaqtun and Uummarmiutun 765 speakers)
****Inuktitut (eastern Canada; together with Inuktun and Inuinnaqtun, 30,000 speakers)
****Inuktun (Avanersuarmiutut, Thule dialect or Polar Eskimo, approximately 1,000 speakers)
***Sirenik (Sirenikskiy) 
American linguist Lenore Grenoble has explicitly deferred to the ICC resolution and used &quot;Inuit–Yupik&quot; instead of &quot;Eskimo&quot; with regards to the language branch.

=== Words for &quot;snow&quot; ===

There has been a long-running linguistic debate about whether or not the speakers of the Inuit–Yupik–Unangan language group have an unusually large number of words for snow. The general modern consensus is that, in multiple Inuit–Yupik languages, there are, or have been in simultaneous usage, indeed fifty plus words for snow.

== Diet ==
== Inuit ==


Inuit inhabit the Arctic and northern Bering Sea coasts of Alaska in the United States, and Arctic coasts of the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador in Canada, and Greenland (associated with Denmark). Until fairly recent times, there has been a remarkable homogeneity in the culture throughout this area, which traditionally relied on fish, marine mammals, and land animals for food, heat, light, clothing, and tools. Their food sources primarily relied on seals, whales, whale blubber, walrus, and fish, all of which they hunted using harpoons on the ice. Clothing consisted of robes made of wolfskin and reindeer skin to acclimate to the low temperatures. They maintain a unique Inuit culture.

=== Greenland&#x27;s Inuit ===

Greenlandic Inuit make up 90% of Greenland&#x27;s population. They belong to three major groups:
* Kalaallit of west Greenland, who speak Kalaallisut
* Tunumiit of east Greenland, who speak Tunumiisut
* Inughuit of north Greenland, who speak Inuktun or Polar Eskimo.

=== Canadian Inuit ===

Canadian Inuit live primarily in Inuit Nunangat (lit. &quot;lands, waters and ices of the [Inuit] people&quot;), their traditional homeland although some people live in southern parts of Canada. Inuit Nunangat ranges from the Yukon–Alaska border in the west across the Arctic to northern Labrador.

The Inuvialuit live in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, the northern part of Yukon and the Northwest Territories, which stretches to the Amundsen Gulf and the Nunavut border and includes the western Canadian Arctic Islands. The land was demarked in 1984 by the Inuvialuit Final Agreement.

The majority of Inuit live in Nunavut (a territory of Canada), Nunavik (the northern part of Quebec) and in Nunatsiavut (Inuit settlement region in Labrador).

=== Alaska&#x27;s Iñupiat ===

The Iñupiat are Inuit of Alaska&#x27;s Northwest Arctic and North Slope boroughs and the Bering Straits region, including the Seward Peninsula. Utqiaġvik, the northernmost city in the United States, is above the Arctic Circle and in the Iñupiat region. Their language is known as Iñupiaq. Their current communities include 34 villages across &quot;Iñupiat Nunaŋat&quot; (Iñupiaq lands) including seven Alaskan villages in the North Slope Borough, affiliated with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation; eleven villages in Northwest Arctic Borough; and sixteen villages affiliated with the Bering Straits Regional Corporation.

== Yupik ==

The Yupik are indigenous or aboriginal peoples who live along the coast of western Alaska, especially on the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta and along the Kuskokwim River (Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik); in southern Alaska (the Alutiiq); and along the eastern coast of Chukotka in the Russian Far East and St. Lawrence Island in western Alaska (the Siberian Yupik). The Yupik economy has traditionally been strongly dominated by the harvest of marine mammals, especially seals, walrus, and whales.

=== Alutiiq ===
The Alutiiq language is relatively close to that spoken by the Yupik in the Bethel, Alaska area. But, it is considered a distinct language with two major dialects: the Koniag dialect, spoken on the Alaska Peninsula and on Kodiak Island, and the Chugach dialect, spoken on the southern Kenai Peninsula and in Prince William Sound. Residents of Nanwalek, located on southern part of the Kenai Peninsula near Seldovia, speak what they call Sugpiaq. They are able to understand those who speak Yupik in Bethel. With a population of approximately 3,000, and the number of speakers in the hundreds, Alutiiq communities are working to revitalize their language.

=== Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik ===
&quot;Yup&#x27;ik&quot;, with an apostrophe, denotes the speakers of the Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik language, who live in western Alaska and southwestern Alaska from southern Norton Sound to the north side of Bristol Bay, on the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, and on Nelson Island. The use of the apostrophe in the name &quot;Yup&#x27;ik&quot; is a written convention to denote the long pronunciation of the &quot;p&quot; sound; but it is spoken the same in other Yupik languages. Of all the Alaska Native languages, Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik has the most speakers, with about 10,000 of a total Yup&#x27;ik population of 21,000 still speaking the language. The five dialects of Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik include General Central Yup&#x27;ik, and the Egegik, Norton Sound, Hooper Bay-Chevak, and Nunivak dialects. In the latter two dialects, both the language and the people are called &quot;Cup&#x27;ik&quot;.

===Siberian Yupik===

Siberian Yupik reside along the Bering Sea coast of the Chukchi Peninsula in Siberia in the Russian Far East and in the villages of Gambell and Savoonga on St. Lawrence Island in Alaska. The Central Siberian Yupik spoken on the Chukchi Peninsula and on St. Lawrence Island is nearly identical. About 1,050 of a total Alaska population of 1,100 Siberian Yupik people in Alaska speak the language. It is the first language of the home for most St. Lawrence Island children. In Siberia, about 300 of a total of 900 Siberian Yupik people still learn and study the language, though it is no longer learned as a first language by children.

===Naukan===
About 70 of 400 Naukan people still speak Naukanski. The Naukan originate on the Chukot Peninsula in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in Siberia. Despite the relatively small population of Naukan speakers, documentation of the language dates back to 1732. While Naukan is only spoken in Siberia, the language acts as an intermediate between two Alaskan languages: Siberian Yupik Eskimo and Central Yup&#x27;ik Eskimo.

==Sireniki==
Some speakers of Siberian Yupik languages used to speak a divergent Inuit–Yupik variant in the past, before they underwent a language shift. These former speakers of the Sirenik language inhabited the settlements of Sireniki, Imtuk, and some small villages stretching to the west from Sireniki along south-eastern coasts of Chukchi Peninsula. They lived in neighborhoods with Siberian Yupik and Chukchi peoples.

As early as in 1895, Imtuk was a settlement with a mixed population of Sireniki and Ungazigmit (the latter belonging to Siberian Yupik). Sirenik culture has been influenced by that of Chukchi, and the language shows Chukchi language influences. Folktale motifs also show the influence of Chuckchi culture.

The above peculiarities of this (already extinct) Inuit–Yupik language amounted to mutual unintelligibility even with its nearest language relatives: in the past, Sireniki had to use the unrelated Chukchi language as a lingua franca for communicating with Siberian Yupik.

Many words are formed from entirely different roots from in Siberian Yupik, but even the grammar has several peculiarities distinct not only among Inuit–Yupik languages, but even compared to Aleut. For example, dual number is not known in Sirenik, while most Inuit–Yupik–Unangan languages have dual, including its neighboring Siberian Yupikax relatives.

Little is known about the origin of this diversity. The peculiarities of this language may be the result of a supposed long isolation from other Inuit and Yupik groups, and being in contact only with speakers of unrelated languages for many centuries. The influence of the Chukchi language is clear.

Because of all these factors, the classification of the Sirenik language is not settled yet: Sireniki language is sometimes regarded as a third branch of Inuit–Yupik (at least, its possibility is mentioned). Sometimes it is regarded rather as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.

<text>Epiphenomenalism is a position in the philosophy of mind on the mind–body problem. It holds that subjective mental events are completely dependent for their existence on corresponding physical and biochemical events within the human body, but do not themselves influence physical events. According to epiphenomenalism, the appearance that subjective mental states (such as intentions) influence physical events is an illusion, with consciousness being a by-product of physical states of the world. For instance, fear seems to make the heart beat faster, but according to epiphenomenalism the biochemical secretions of the brain and nervous system (such as adrenaline)—not the experience of fear—is what raises the heartbeat. Because mental events are a kind of overflow that cannot cause anything physical, yet have non-physical properties, epiphenomenalism is viewed as a form of property dualism.

== Development ==
During the 17th century, René Descartes argued that animals are subject to mechanical laws of nature. He defended the idea of automatic behavior, or the performance of actions without conscious thought. Descartes questioned how the immaterial mind and the material body can interact causally. His interactionist model (1649) held that the body relates to the mind through the pineal gland. La Mettrie, Leibniz, and Spinoza all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by Cabanis (1802), and was further explicated by Hodgson (1870) and Thomas Henry Huxley (1874).

Thomas Henry Huxley agreed with Descartes that behavior is determined solely by physical mechanisms, but he also believed that humans enjoy an intelligent life. In 1874, Huxley argued, in the Presidential Address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, that animals are conscious automata. Huxley proposed that psychical changes are collateral products of physical changes. Like the bell of a clock that has no role in keeping the time, consciousness has no role in determining behavior.

Huxley defended automatism by testing reflex actions, originally supported by Descartes. Huxley hypothesized that frogs that undergo lobotomy would swim when thrown into water, despite being unable to initiate actions. He argued that the ability to swim was solely dependent on the molecular change in the brain, concluding that consciousness is not necessary for reflex actions. According to epiphenomenalism, animals experience pain only as a result of neurophysiology.

In 1870, Huxley conducted a case study on a French soldier who had sustained a shot in the Franco-Prussian war that fractured his left parietal bone. Every few weeks the soldier would enter a trance-like state, smoking, dressing himself, and aiming his cane like a rifle all while being insensitive to pins, electric shocks, odorous substances, vinegar, noise, and certain light conditions. Huxley used this study to show that consciousness was not necessary to execute these purposeful actions, justifying the assumption that humans are insensible machines. Huxley&#x27;s mechanistic attitude towards the body convinced him that the brain alone causes behavior.

In the early 1900s, scientific behaviorists such as Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of eliminativism or mental fictionalism, positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. George Santayana (1905) believed that all motion has physical causes. Because consciousness is accessory to life and not essential to it, natural selection is responsible for ingraining tendencies to avoid certain contingencies without any conscious achievement involved. By the 1960s, scientific behaviorism met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the cognitive revolution. Participants in that revolution, such as Jerry Fodor, reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of &quot;epiphobia&quot;—fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.

However, since the cognitive revolution, there have been several who have argued for a version of epiphenomenalism. In 1970, Keith Campbell proposed his &quot;new epiphenomenalism&quot;, which states that the body produces a spiritual mind that does not act on the body. How the brain causes a spiritual mind, according to Campbell, is destined to remain beyond our understanding forever. In 2001, David Chalmers and Frank Jackson argued that claims about conscious states should be deduced a priori from claims about physical states alone. They offered that epiphenomenalism bridges, but does not close, the explanatory gap between the physical and the phenomenal realms. These more recent versions maintain that only the subjective, qualitative aspects of mental states are epiphenomenal. Imagine both Pierre and a robot eating a cupcake. Unlike the robot, Pierre is conscious of eating the cupcake while the behavior is under way. This subjective experience is often called a &quot;quale&quot; (plural qualia), and it describes the private &quot;raw feel&quot; or the subjective &quot;what-it-is-like&quot; that is the inner accompaniment of many mental states. Thus, while Pierre and the robot are both doing the same thing, only Pierre has the inner conscious experience.

Frank Jackson (1982), for example, once espoused the following view:
Some thinkers draw distinctions between different varieties of epiphenomenalism. In &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;, Daniel Dennett distinguishes between a purely metaphysical sense of epiphenomenalism, in which the epiphenomenon has no causal impact at all, and Huxley&#x27;s &quot;steam whistle&quot; epiphenomenalism, in which effects exist but are not functionally relevant.

== Arguments for ==
Some neurophysiological data has been proffered in support of epiphenomenalism. Some of the oldest such data is the Bereitschaftspotential or &quot;readiness potential&quot; in which electrical activity related to voluntary actions can be recorded up to two seconds before the subject is aware of making a decision to perform the action. More recently Benjamin Libet et al. (1979) have shown that it can take 0.5 seconds before a stimulus becomes part of conscious experience even though subjects can respond to the stimulus in reaction time tests within 200 milliseconds. The methods and conclusions of this experiment have received much criticism (e.g., see the many critical commentaries in Libet&#x27;s (1985) target article), including fairly recently by neuroscientists such as Peter Tse, who claim to show that the readiness potential has nothing to do with consciousness at all.

== Arguments against ==
The most powerful argument against epiphenomenalism is that it is self-contradictory: if we have knowledge about epiphenomenalism, then our brains know about the existence of the mind, but if epiphenomenalism were correct, then our brains should not have any knowledge about the mind, because the mind does not affect anything physical.

However, some philosophers do not accept this as a rigorous refutation. For example, philosopher Victor Argonov states that epiphenomenalism is a questionable, but experimentally falsifiable theory. He argues that the personal mind is not the only source of knowledge about the existence of mind in the world. A creature (even a philosophical zombie) could have knowledge about the mind and the mind-body problem by virtue of some innate knowledge. The information about the mind (and its problematic properties such as qualia and the hard problem of consciousness) could have been, in principle, implicitly &quot;written&quot; in the material world since its creation. Epiphenomenalists can say that God created an immaterial mind and a detailed &quot;program&quot; of material human behavior that makes it possible to speak about the mind–body problem. That version of epiphenomenalism seems highly exotic, but it cannot be excluded from consideration by pure theory. However, Argonov suggests that experiments could refute epiphenomenalism. In particular, epiphenomenalism could be refuted if neural correlates of consciousness can be found in the human brain, and it is proven that human speech about consciousness is caused by them.

Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, reject both epiphenomenalism and the existence of qualia with the same charge that Gilbert Ryle leveled against a Cartesian &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;, that they too are category mistakes. A quale or conscious experience would not belong to the category of objects of reference on this account, but rather to the category of ways of doing things.

Functionalists assert that mental states are well described by their overall role, their activity in relation to the organism as a whole. &quot;This doctrine is rooted in Aristotle&#x27;s conception of the soul, and has antecedents in Hobbes&#x27;s conception of the mind as a &#x27;calculating machine&#x27;, but it has become fully articulated (and popularly endorsed) only in the last third of the 20th century.&quot; In so far as it mediates stimulus and response, a mental function is analogous to a program that processes input/output in automata theory. In principle, multiple realisability would guarantee platform dependencies can be avoided, whether in terms of hardware and operating system or, &quot;ex hypothesi&quot;, biology and philosophy. Because a high-level language is a practical requirement for developing the most complex programs, functionalism implies that a non-reductive physicalism would offer a similar advantage over a strictly eliminative materialism.

Eliminative materialists believe &quot;folk psychology&quot; is so unscientific that, ultimately, it will be better to eliminate primitive concepts such as &quot;mind,&quot; &quot;desire&quot; and &quot;belief,&quot; in favor of a future neuroscientific account. A more moderate position such as J. L. Mackie&#x27;s &quot;error theory&quot; suggests that false beliefs should be stripped away from a mental concept without eliminating the concept itself, the legitimate core meaning being left intact.

Benjamin Libet&#x27;s results are quoted in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a &quot;conscious veto&quot;, since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot;, Daniel Dennett argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet&#x27;s results. Similar criticism of Libet-style research has been made by neuroscientist Adina Roskies and cognitive theorists Tim Bayne and Alfred Mele.

Others have argued that data such as the Bereitschaftspotential undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience and a conscious decision occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is &quot;completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery&quot;. Mind–body dualists reject epiphenomenalism on the same grounds.

Adrian G. Guggisberg and Annaïs Mottaz have also challenged those findings.

A study by Aaron Schurger and colleagues published in PNAS challenged assumptions about the causal nature of the readiness potential itself (and the &quot;pre-movement buildup&quot; of neural activity in general), thus denying the conclusions drawn from studies such as Libet&#x27;s and Fried&#x27;s.

In favor of interactionism, Celia Green (2003) argues that epiphenomenalism does not even provide a satisfactory solution to the problem of interaction posed by substance dualism. Although it does not entail substance dualism, according to Green, epiphenomenalism implies a one-way form of interactionism that is just as hard to conceive of as the two-way form embodied in substance dualism. Green suggests the assumption that it is less of a problem may arise from the unexamined belief that physical events have some sort of primacy over mental ones.

A number of scientists and philosophers, including William James, Karl Popper, John C. Eccles and Donald Symons, dismiss epiphenomenalism from an evolutionary perspective. They point out that the view that mind is an epiphenomenon of brain activity is not consistent with evolutionary theory, because if mind were functionless, it would have disappeared long ago, as it would not have been favoured by evolution.

<text>Esperantujo () or Esperantio () is the community of speakers of the Esperanto language and their culture, as well as the places and institutions where the language is used. The term is used &quot;as if it were a country.&quot;

Although it does not occupy its own area of Earth&#x27;s surface, it can be said to constitute the 120 countries which have their own national Esperanto association.

== Etymology and terminology ==
The word is formed analogously to country names. In Esperanto, the names of countries were traditionally formed from the ethnic name of their inhabitants plus the suffix &quot;-ujo&quot;. For example, &quot;France&quot; was , from (a Frenchman).

The term analogous to &quot;Francujo&quot; would be &quot;Esperantistujo&quot; (Esperantist-nation). However, that would convey the idea of a physical body of people, whereas using the name of the language as the basis of the word gives it the more abstract connotation of a cultural sphere.

Currently, names of nation states are often formed with the suffix &quot;-io&quot; (traditionally reserved for deriving country names from geographic features — e.g. instead of ), and recently the form &quot;Esperantio&quot; has been used, among others, in the Pasporta Servo and the Esperanto Citizens&#x27; Community.

== History ==

In 1908, Dr. Wilhelm Molly attempted to create an Esperanto state in the Prussian-Belgian condominium of Neutral Moresnet, known as &quot;Amikejo&quot; (place of friendship). What became of it is unclear, and Neutral Moresnet was annexed to Belgium in the Treaty of Versailles, 1919.

During the 1960s came a new effort of creating an Esperanto state, which this time was called theRepublic of Rose Island. The state island stood in the Adriatic Sea near Italy.

In Europe, on 2 June 2001, a number of organizations (they prefer to call themselves establishments) founded the &quot;Esperanta Civito&quot;, which &quot;aims to be a subject of international law&quot; and &quot;aims to consolidate the relations between the Esperantists who feel themselves belonging to the diaspora language group which does not belong to any country&quot;. &quot;Esperanto Civito&quot; always uses the name Esperantujo (introduced by Hector Hodler in 1908), which itself is defined according to their interpretation of &quot;raumism&quot;, and the meaning, therefore, may differ from the traditional Esperanto understanding of the word &quot;Esperantujo&quot;.

A language learning partner application called Amikumu was launched in 2017, allowing Esperanto speakers to find each other.

== Geography ==
Esperantujo includes any physical place where Esperanto speakers meet, such as Esperanto gatherings or virtual networks. Sometimes it is said that it is everywhere where Esperanto speakers are connected.

Although Esperantujo does not have its own official territory, a number of places around the world are owned by Esperanto organizations or are otherwise permanently connected to the Esperanto language and its community:

* Białystok, the birthplace of L. L. Zamenhof (the creator of Esperanto), and very much the place which inspired him to create an international auxiliary language and facilitate communication across language barriers.
* The German city Herzberg am Harz is home to the &quot;Interkultura Centro Herzberg&quot;, and, since 12 July 2006, advertises itself as &quot;Esperanto city&quot; (, ). There are bilingual signs and pointers, in both German and Esperanto.
* The Château de Grésillon () in France is owned by the non-profit organization &quot;Cultural House of Esperanto&quot; (), which hosts various Esperanto events in the summer and during French school holidays.
* The Esperanto Museum and Collection of Planned Languages, a department of the Austrian National Library, is a museum for Esperanto and other constructed languages, located in Vienna.
* Zamenhof-Esperanto objects can be found all over the world. These are places and objects — such as streets, memorials, public spaces, buildings, vehicles, or even geographic features — that are named after, or otherwise linked to the language, its creator L. L. Zamenhof, or its community of speakers.

The countries with the most members of the World Esperanto Association are (in descending order): Brazil, Germany, Japan, France, the United States, China, Italy.

== Politics ==
=== Associations ===

There is no governmental system in Esperantujo because it is not a true state. However, there is a social hierarchy of associations:

* Universal Esperanto Association (UEA) is the principal association created in 1908, its central office is located in Rotterdam. The aim of the UEA is to promote the use of Esperanto, to strive for the solution of the language problem in international relations, to encourage all types of spiritual and material relations among people and &quot;to nurture among its members a strong sense of solidarity, and to develop in them understanding and respect for other peoples&quot;.
* Sometimes there are associations by continent, for example, the European Esperanto Union. On the same level there are UEA commissions dedicated to promoting the spread of Esperanto in Africa, America (North &amp; South), Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania.
* In at least 120 countries in the world there are national associations: Brazilian Esperanto League, the German Esperanto Association, Japanese Esperanto Association, Esperanto-USA and Australian Esperanto Association are examples from all continents across the world. The goals are usually to help teach the language and use of Esperanto in the country.
* Finally, there are local associations or Esperanto clubs where volunteers or activists offer courses to learn the language or get to know more about the culture of Esperanto. Sometimes they teach Esperanto in universities or schools.

Also there are thematic associations worldwide, which are concerned with spirituality, hobbies, science or bringing together Esperantists who share common interests.

There is also a number of global organizations, such as Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda (SAT), or the World Esperanto Youth Organization (TEJO), which has 46 national sections.

=== Foreign relations ===
Universal Esperanto Association is not a governmental system; however, the association represents Esperanto worldwide. In addition to the United Nations and UNESCO, the UEA has consultative relationships with UNICEF and the Council of Europe and general cooperative relations with the Organization of American States. UEA officially collaborates with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) by means of an active connection to the ISO Committee on terminology (ISO/TC 37). The association is active for information on the European Union and other interstate and international organizations and conferences. UEA is a member of European Language Council, a joint forum of universities and linguistic associations to promote the knowledge of languages and cultures within and outside the European Union. Moreover, on 10 May 2011, the UEA and the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm) signed an Agreement on Cooperation, its objectives are inter exchange information, support each other and help out for projects, meetings, publications in the field of terminology and by which the UEA become Associate Member of Infoterm.

=== Political movement ===
In 2003 there was a European political movement called Europe–Democracy–Esperanto created. Within it is found a European federation that brings together local associations whose statutes depends on the countries. The working language of the movement is Esperanto. The goal is &quot;to provide the European Union with the necessary tools to set up member rights democracy&quot;. The international language is a tool to enable cross-border political and social dialogue and actively contribute to peace and understanding between peoples. The original idea in the first ballot was mainly to spread the existence and the use of Esperanto to the general public. However, in France voices have grown steadily: 25067 (2004) 28944 (2009) and 33115 (2014). In this country there are a number of movements which support the issue: France Équité, Europe-Liberté, and Politicat.

=== Symbols ===
The flag of Esperanto is called &quot;Verda Flago&quot; (Green Flag). It consists of:
* a rectangular shape, officially with a 2:3 ratio.
* a green field, where the green color symbolizes hope. There is no indication that any &quot;official&quot; color was ever chosen. The shade used varies in different sources, yet the color is most often used.
* a white, square canton (upper hoist quarter), measuring exactly half the hoist, where the white color symbolizes peace and neutrality.
* in the canton, a green five-pointed star known as &quot;Verda Stelo&quot; (Green Star), which symbolizes the five continents.

The anthem is called &quot;La Espero&quot; since 1891: it is a poem written by L. L. Zamenhof. The song is usually sung to the triumphal march composed by Félicien Menu de Ménil in 1909.

The Jubilee symbol represents the language internally, while the flag represents the Esperanto movement. It contains the Latin letter E (Esperanto) and the Cyrillic letter Э (Эсперанто) symbolizing the unification of West and East. The Jubilee symbol has been controversial, with some Esperantists derisively calling it &quot;the melon.&quot;

In addition, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, the initiator of the language, is often used as a symbol. Sometimes he is even called &quot;Uncle Zam&quot;, referring to the cartoon incarnation of American Uncle Sam.

=== Education ===
In addition to textbooks, including the &quot;Fundamento de Esperanto&quot; by Zamenhof, the Assimil-methods and the video-methods such as Muzzy in Gondoland of the BBC and &quot;Pasporto al la tuta mondo&quot;, there are many courses for learning online. Moreover, some universities teach Esperanto, and the Higher Foreign Language training (University Eötvös Loránd) delivers certificates in accordance with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). More than 1600 people have such a certificate around the world: in 2014 around 470 at the level of B1, 510 at the level of B2 and 700 for C1. The International League of Esperanto Teachers (ILEI) is also working to publish learning materials for teachers.

The University of Esperanto offers video lectures in Esperanto, for specialties like Confronting War, Informational Technologies and Astronomy. Courses are also held during the World Esperanto Congress in the framework of the Internacia Kongresa Universitato (IKU). After that, UEA uploads the related documents on its website.

Science is an appropriate department for works in Esperanto. For example, the Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology (KAEST) occurs in November every year since 1998 in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Personal initiatives are also common: Doctor of mathematics Ulrich Matthias created a document about the foundations of Linear Algebra and the American group of Maine (USA) wrote a guidebook to learn the programming language Python.

In general, Esperanto is used as a lingua franca in some websites aiming teaching of other languages, such as German, Slovak, Swahili, Wolof or Toki Pona.

=== Media ===
Since 1889 when &quot;La Esperantisto&quot; appeared, and soon other magazines in Esperanto throughout many countries in the world. Some of them are information media of Esperanto associations (&quot;Esperanto&quot;, &quot;Sennaciulo&quot; and &quot;Kontakto&quot;). Online Esperanto magazines like &quot;Libera Folio&quot;, launched in 2003, offer independent view of the Esperanto movement, aiming to soberly and critically shed light on current development. Most of the magazines deal with current events; one of such magazines is &quot;Monato&quot;, which is read in more than 60 countries. Its articles are written by correspondents from 40 countries, which know the local situation very well. Other most popular Esperanto newspapers are &quot;La Ondo de Esperanto&quot;, &quot;Beletra Almanako&quot;, &quot;Literatura Foiro&quot;, and &quot;Heroldo de Esperanto&quot;. Often national associations magazines are also published in order to inform about the movement in the country, such as &quot;Le Monde de l&#x27;espéranto&quot; of Espéranto-France. There are also scientific journals, such as &quot;Scienca Revuo&quot; of Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista (ISAE).

&quot;Muzaiko&quot; is a radio that has broadcast an all-day international program of songs, interviews and current events in Esperanto since 2011. The latest two can be downloaded as podcasts. Besides Muzaiko, these other stations offer an hour of Esperanto-language broadcasting of various topics: &quot;Radio Libertaire&quot;, &quot;Polskie Radio&quot;, &quot;Vatican Radio&quot;, &quot;Varsovia Vento, &quot;Radio Verda and &quot;Kern.punkto&quot;.

=== Internet ===
Spread of the Internet has enabled more efficient communication among Esperanto speakers and slightly replaced slower media such as mail. Many massively used websites such as Facebook or Google offer Esperanto interface. On 15 December 2009, on the occasion of the jubilee of 150th birthday of L. L. Zamenhof, Google additionally made visible the Esperanto flag as a part of their Google Doodles. Media as Twitter, Telegram, Reddit or Ipernity also contain a significant number of people in this community. In addition, content-providers such as WordPress and YouTube also enable bloggers write in Esperanto. Esperanto versions of programs such as the office suite LibreOffice and Mozilla Firefox browser, or the educational program about programming Scratch are also available. Additionally, online games like Minecraft offer complete Esperanto interface.

Monero, an anonymous cryptocurrency, was named after the Esperanto word for &quot;coin&quot; and its official wallet is available in Esperanto. The same applies to Monerujo (&quot;Monero container&quot;).

=== Sport ===
Although Esperantujo is not a country, there is an Esperanto football team, which has existed since 2014 and participates in matches during World Esperanto Congresses. The team is part of the N.F.-Board and not of FIFA, and have played against the teams of Armenian-originating Argentine Community in 2014 and the team from Western Sahara in 2015.

=== Esperanto speakers and Esperantists ===
Initially, Esperanto speakers learned the language as it was described by L. L. Zamenhof. In 1905, the &quot;Fundamento de Esperanto&quot; put together the first Esperanto textbook, an exercise book and a universal dictionary.

The &quot;Declaration about the essence of Esperantism&quot; (1905) defines an &quot;Esperantist&quot; to be anyone who speaks and uses Esperanto. &quot;Esperantism&quot; was defined to be a movement to promote the widespread use of Esperanto as a supplement to mother tongues in international and inter-ethnic contexts. As the word &quot;esperantist&quot; is linked with this &quot;esperantism&quot; (the Esperanto movement) and as -ists and -isms are linked with ideologies, today many people who speak Esperanto prefer to be called &quot;Esperanto speaker&quot;.

The monthly magazine &quot;La Ondo de Esperanto&quot; every year since 1998 proclaims an &#x27;Esperantist of the year&#x27;, who remarkably contributed to the spreading of the language during the year.

== Economy ==

=== Businesses ===
Publishing and selling books, the so-called book services, is the main market and is often the first expenditure of many Esperanto associations. Some companies are already well known: for example Vinilkosmo, which publishes and makes popular Esperanto music since 1990. Then there are initiatives such as the job-seeking website &quot;Eklaboru&quot;, created by Chuck Smith, for job offers and candidates within Esperanto associations or Esperanto meetings.

=== Currency ===

In 1907, René de Saussure proposed the spesmilo ⟨₷⟩ as an international currency. It had some use before the First World War.

In 1942 a currency called the &quot;stelo&quot; (&quot;star&quot;; plural, &quot;steloj&quot;) was created. It was used at meetings of the &quot;Universala Ligo&quot; and in Esperanto environments such as the annual Universal Congress. Over the years it slowly became unusable and at the official closing of the Universala Ligo in the 1990s, the remaining &quot;steloj&quot; coins were handed over to the UEA. They can be bought at the UEA&#x27;s book service as souvenirs.

The current &quot;steloj&quot; are made of plastic; they are used in a number of meetings, especially among young people. The currency is maintained by Stelaro, which calculates the rates, keeps the stock, and opened branches in various e-meetings. Currently, there are &quot;stelo&quot;-coins of 1 ★, 3 ★ and 10 ★. The exchange rate at 31 December 2014 was 1 EUR = 4.189 ★.

== Culture ==
=== Architectural heritage ===

There exist Zamenhof-Esperanto objects (ZEOs), scattered in numerous countries around the world, which are the things named in honor of L. L. Zamenhof or Esperanto: monuments, street names, places and so on. There also exists a UEA-committee for ZEOs.

In addition, in several countries there are also sites dedicated to Esperanto: meetup places, workshops, seminars, festivals, Esperanto houses. These places provide attractions for Esperantists. Here are two: the Castle of Grésilion in France and the Department of Planned Languages and Esperanto Museum in Vienna (Austria).

=== Cultural heritage ===
Esperanto literary heritage is the richest and the most diverse of any constructed language. There are over 25,000 Esperanto books (originals and translations) as well as over a hundred regularly distributed Esperanto magazines.

There are also a number of movies which have been published in Esperanto. Moreover, Esperanto itself was used in numerous movies.

=== Celebrations ===
Many public holidays recognized by Esperanto speakers are celebrated internationally, having gained full acceptance by organizations such as UN and UNESCO, and are also publicly observed in select countries that are UN members. This is largely a byproduct of the influence the Esperanto community once had on organizations that worked in the field of international relations (including the United Nations) in the mid-20th century. Here are the celebrations proposed as international holidays by the UEA since 2010:
=== Cultural events ===

Every year numerous meetings of Esperanto speakers in different topics around the world take place. They mobilize Esperanto-speakers which share the same will about a specific topic. The main example is the Universal Congress of Esperanto (UK), a week-long summer conference organized annually by the UEA. Other events:
* SAT-Kongreso, annually organized by Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda;
* International Youth Congress of Esperanto (IJK), official annual congress of TEJO;
* Internacia Infana Kongreseto (IIK), arrangement for children between 6 and 16 years that occur simultaneously with and close to the Universal Congress of Esperanto;
* Somera Esperanto-Studado (SES), the largest international Esperanto meeting aimed at learning of Esperanto.

Next to these globally comprising meetings there are also local events such as New Year&#x27;s Gathering (NR) or Esperanto Youth Week (JES), which occur during the last days of December and first days of January. These meetings seem to have been successful during the last 20 years.

Due to the fact that there are a lot of Esperanto meetings around the globe, there are websites which aim to list and share them. Eventa Servo provides an up-to-date list of online meetings and in-person events happening each week. Eventoj.hu describes events with a list and dates, and contains an archive until 1996.

<text>Ethernet ( ) is a family of wired computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN) and wide area networks (WAN). It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3. Ethernet has since been refined to support higher bit rates, a greater number of nodes, and longer link distances, but retains much backward compatibility. Over time, Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as Token Ring, FDDI and ARCNET.

The original 10BASE5 Ethernet uses a thick coaxial cable as a shared medium. This was largely superseded by 10BASE2, which used a thinner and more flexible cable that was both cheaper and easier to use. More modern Ethernet variants use twisted pair and fiber optic links in conjunction with switches. Over the course of its history, Ethernet data transfer rates have been increased from the original to the latest , with rates up to under development. The Ethernet standards include several wiring and signaling variants of the OSI physical layer.

Systems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called frames. Each frame contains source and destination addresses, and error-checking data so that damaged frames can be detected and discarded; most often, higher-layer protocols trigger retransmission of lost frames. Per the OSI model, Ethernet provides services up to and including the data link layer. The 48-bit MAC address was adopted by other IEEE 802 networking standards, including IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), as well as by FDDI. EtherType values are also used in Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) headers.

Ethernet is widely used in homes and industry, and interworks well with wireless Wi-Fi technologies. The Internet Protocol is commonly carried over Ethernet and so it is considered one of the key technologies that make up the Internet.

==History==
Ethernet was developed at Xerox PARC between 1973 and 1974 as a means to allow Alto computers to communicate with each other. It was inspired by ALOHAnet, which Robert Metcalfe had studied as part of his PhD dissertation and was originally called the Alto Aloha Network. Metcalfe&#x27;s idea was essentially to limit the Aloha-like signals inside a cable, instead of broadcasting into the air. The idea was first documented in a memo that Metcalfe wrote on May 22, 1973, where he named it after the luminiferous aether once postulated to exist as an &quot;omnipresent, completely passive medium for the propagation of electromagnetic waves.&quot;

In 1975, Xerox filed a patent application listing Metcalfe, David Boggs, Chuck Thacker, and Butler Lampson as inventors. In 1976, after the system was deployed at PARC, Metcalfe and Boggs published a seminal paper. Ron Crane, Yogen Dalal, Robert Garner, Hal Murray, Roy Ogus, Dave Redell and John Shoch facilitated the upgrade from the original 2.94 Mbit/s protocol to the 10 Mbit/s protocol, which was released to the market in 1980.

Metcalfe left Xerox in June 1979 to form 3Com. He convinced Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Intel, and Xerox to work together to promote Ethernet as a standard. As part of that process Xerox agreed to relinquish their &#x27;Ethernet&#x27; trademark. The first standard was published on September 30, 1980, as &quot;The Ethernet, A Local Area Network. Data Link Layer and Physical Layer Specifications&quot;. This so-called DIX standard (Digital Intel Xerox) specified 10 Mbit/s Ethernet, with 48-bit destination and source addresses and a global 16-bit Ethertype-type field. Version 2 was published in November 1982 and defines what has become known as Ethernet II. Formal standardization efforts proceeded at the same time and resulted in the publication of IEEE 802.3 on June 23, 1983.

Ethernet initially competed with Token Ring and other proprietary protocols. Ethernet was able to adapt to market needs, and with 10BASE2 shift to inexpensive thin coaxial cable, and from 1990 to the now-ubiquitous twisted pair with 10BASE-T. By the end of the 1980s, Ethernet was clearly the dominant network technology. In the process, 3Com became a major company. 3Com shipped its first 10 Mbit/s Ethernet 3C100 NIC in March 1981, and that year started selling adapters for PDP-11s and VAXes, as well as Multibus-based Intel and Sun Microsystems computers. This was followed quickly by DEC&#x27;s Unibus to Ethernet adapter, which DEC sold and used internally to build its own corporate network, which reached over 10,000 nodes by 1986, making it one of the largest computer networks in the world at that time. An Ethernet adapter card for the IBM PC was released in 1982, and, by 1985, 3Com had sold 100,000. In the 1980s, IBM&#x27;s own PC Network product competed with Ethernet for the PC, and through the 1980s, LAN hardware, in general, was not common on PCs. However, in the mid to late 1980s, PC networking did become popular in offices and schools for printer and fileserver sharing, and among the many diverse competing LAN technologies of that decade, Ethernet was one of the most popular. Parallel port based Ethernet adapters were produced for a time, with drivers for DOS and Windows. By the early 1990s, Ethernet became so prevalent that Ethernet ports began to appear on some PCs and most workstations. This process was greatly sped up with the introduction of 10BASE-T and its relatively small modular connector, at which point Ethernet ports appeared even on low-end motherboards.

Since then, Ethernet technology has evolved to meet new bandwidth and market requirements. In addition to computers, Ethernet is now used to interconnect appliances and other personal devices. As Industrial Ethernet it is used in industrial applications and is quickly replacing legacy data transmission systems in the world&#x27;s telecommunications networks. By 2010, the market for Ethernet equipment amounted to over $16 billion per year.

==Standardization==
In February 1980, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) started project 802 to standardize local area networks (LAN). The DIX group with Gary Robinson (DEC), Phil Arst (Intel), and Bob Printis (Xerox) submitted the so-called &quot;Blue Book&quot; CSMA/CD specification as a candidate for the LAN specification. In addition to CSMA/CD, Token Ring (supported by IBM) and Token Bus (selected and henceforward supported by General Motors) were also considered as candidates for a LAN standard. Competing proposals and broad interest in the initiative led to strong disagreement over which technology to standardize. In December 1980, the group was split into three subgroups, and standardization proceeded separately for each proposal.

Delays in the standards process put at risk the market introduction of the Xerox Star workstation and 3Com&#x27;s Ethernet LAN products. With such business implications in mind, David Liddle (General Manager, Xerox Office Systems) and Metcalfe (3Com) strongly supported a proposal of Fritz Röscheisen (Siemens Private Networks) for an alliance in the emerging office communication market, including Siemens&#x27; support for the international standardization of Ethernet (April 10, 1981). Ingrid Fromm, Siemens&#x27; representative to IEEE 802, quickly achieved broader support for Ethernet beyond IEEE by the establishment of a competing Task Group &quot;Local Networks&quot; within the European standards body ECMA TC24. In March 1982, ECMA TC24 with its corporate members reached an agreement on a standard for CSMA/CD based on the IEEE 802 draft. Because the DIX proposal was most technically complete and because of the speedy action taken by ECMA which decisively contributed to the conciliation of opinions within IEEE, the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD standard was approved in December 1982. IEEE published the 802.3 standard as a draft in 1983 and as a standard in 1985.

Approval of Ethernet on the international level was achieved by a similar, cross-partisan action with Fromm as the liaison officer working to integrate with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Committee 83 and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee 97 Sub Committee 6. The ISO 8802-3 standard was published in 1989.

==Evolution==

Ethernet has evolved to include higher bandwidth, improved medium access control methods, and different physical media. The multidrop coaxial cable was replaced with physical point-to-point links connected by Ethernet repeaters or switches.

Ethernet stations communicate by sending each other data packets: blocks of data individually sent and delivered. As with other IEEE 802 LANs, adapters come programmed with globally unique 48-bit MAC address so that each Ethernet station has a unique address. The MAC addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data packet. Ethernet establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Ethernet stations.

An EtherType field in each frame is used by the operating system on the receiving station to select the appropriate protocol module (e.g., an Internet Protocol version such as IPv4). Ethernet frames are said to be &quot;self-identifying&quot;, because of the EtherType field. Self-identifying frames make it possible to intermix multiple protocols on the same physical network and allow a single computer to use multiple protocols together. Despite the evolution of Ethernet technology, all generations of Ethernet (excluding early experimental versions) use the same frame formats. Mixed-speed networks can be built using Ethernet switches and repeaters supporting the desired Ethernet variants.

Due to the ubiquity of Ethernet, and the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, by 2004 most manufacturers built Ethernet interfaces directly into PC motherboards, eliminating the need for a separate network card.

=== Shared medium ===
Ethernet was originally based on the idea of computers communicating over a shared coaxial cable acting as a broadcast transmission medium. The method used was similar to those used in radio systems, with the common cable providing the communication channel likened to the &quot;Luminiferous aether&quot; in 19th-century physics, and it was from this reference that the name &quot;Ethernet&quot; was derived.

Original Ethernet&#x27;s shared coaxial cable (the shared medium) traversed a building or campus to every attached machine. A scheme known as carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) governed the way the computers shared the channel. This scheme was simpler than competing Token Ring or Token Bus technologies. Computers are connected to an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) transceiver, which is in turn connected to the cable (with thin Ethernet the transceiver is usually integrated into the network adapter). While a simple passive wire is highly reliable for small networks, it is not reliable for large extended networks, where damage to the wire in a single place, or a single bad connector, can make the whole Ethernet segment unusable.

Through the first half of the 1980s, Ethernet&#x27;s 10BASE5 implementation used a coaxial cable in diameter, later called &quot;thick Ethernet&quot; or &quot;thicknet&quot;. Its successor, 10BASE2, called &quot;thin Ethernet&quot; or &quot;thinnet&quot;, used the RG-58 coaxial cable. The emphasis was on making installation of the cable easier and less costly.

Since all communication happens on the same wire, any information sent by one computer is received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination. The network interface card interrupts the CPU only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it. Use of a single cable also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are simultaneously active.

A collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduces throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. However, a Xerox report in 1980 studied performance of an existing Ethernet installation under both normal and artificially generated heavy load. The report claimed that 98% throughput on the LAN was observed. This is in contrast with token passing LANs (Token Ring, Token Bus), all of which suffer throughput degradation as each new node comes into the LAN, due to token waits. This report was controversial, as modeling showed that collision-based networks theoretically became unstable under loads as low as 37% of nominal capacity. Many early researchers failed to understand these results. Performance on real networks is significantly better.

In a modern Ethernet, the stations do not all share one channel through a shared cable or a simple repeater hub; instead, each station communicates with a switch, which in turn forwards that traffic to the destination station. In this topology, collisions are only possible if station and switch attempt to communicate with each other at the same time, and collisions are limited to this link. Furthermore, the 10BASE-T standard introduced a full duplex mode of operation which became common with Fast Ethernet and the de facto standard with Gigabit Ethernet. In full duplex, switch and station can send and receive simultaneously, and therefore modern Ethernets are completely collision-free.

===Repeaters and hubs===

For signal degradation and timing reasons, coaxial Ethernet segments have a restricted size. Somewhat larger networks can be built by using an Ethernet repeater. Early repeaters had only two ports, allowing, at most, a doubling of network size. Once repeaters with more than two ports became available, it was possible to wire the network in a star topology. Early experiments with star topologies (called &quot;Fibernet&quot;) using optical fiber were published by 1978.

Shared cable Ethernet is always hard to install in offices because its bus topology is in conflict with the star topology cable plans designed into buildings for telephony. Modifying Ethernet to conform to twisted-pair telephone wiring already installed in commercial buildings provided another opportunity to lower costs, expand the installed base, and leverage building design, and, thus, twisted-pair Ethernet was the next logical development in the mid-1980s.

Ethernet on unshielded twisted-pair cables (UTP) began with StarLAN at 1 Mbit/s in the mid-1980s. In 1987 SynOptics introduced the first twisted-pair Ethernet at 10 Mbit/s in a star-wired cabling topology with a central hub, later called LattisNet. These evolved into 10BASE-T, which was designed for point-to-point links only, and all termination was built into the device. This changed repeaters from a specialist device used at the center of large networks to a device that every twisted pair-based network with more than two machines had to use. The tree structure that resulted from this made Ethernet networks easier to maintain by preventing most faults with one peer or its associated cable from affecting other devices on the network.

Despite the physical star topology and the presence of separate transmit and receive channels in the twisted pair and fiber media, repeater-based Ethernet networks still use half-duplex and CSMA/CD, with only minimal activity by the repeater, primarily generation of the jam signal in dealing with packet collisions. Every packet is sent to every other port on the repeater, so bandwidth and security problems are not addressed. The total throughput of the repeater is limited to that of a single link, and all links must operate at the same speed.

=== Bridging and switching ===

While repeaters can isolate some aspects of Ethernet segments, such as cable breakages, they still forward all traffic to all Ethernet devices. The entire network is one collision domain, and all hosts have to be able to detect collisions anywhere on the network. This limits the number of repeaters between the farthest nodes and creates practical limits on how many machines can communicate on an Ethernet network. Segments joined by repeaters have to all operate at the same speed, making phased-in upgrades impossible.

To alleviate these problems, bridging was created to communicate at the data link layer while isolating the physical layer. With bridging, only well-formed Ethernet packets are forwarded from one Ethernet segment to another; collisions and packet errors are isolated. At initial startup, Ethernet bridges work somewhat like Ethernet repeaters, passing all traffic between segments. By observing the source addresses of incoming frames, the bridge then builds an address table associating addresses to segments. Once an address is learned, the bridge forwards network traffic destined for that address only to the associated segment, improving overall performance. Broadcast traffic is still forwarded to all network segments. Bridges also overcome the limits on total segments between two hosts and allow the mixing of speeds, both of which are critical to the incremental deployment of faster Ethernet variants.

In 1989, Motorola Codex introduced their 6310 EtherSpan, and Kalpana introduced their EtherSwitch; these were examples of the first commercial Ethernet switches. Early switches such as this used cut-through switching where only the header of the incoming packet is examined before it is either dropped or forwarded to another segment. This reduces the forwarding latency. One drawback of this method is that it does not readily allow a mixture of different link speeds. Another is that packets that have been corrupted are still propagated through the network. The eventual remedy for this was a return to the original store and forward approach of bridging, where the packet is read into a buffer on the switch in its entirety, its frame check sequence verified and only then the packet is forwarded. In modern network equipment, this process is typically done using application-specific integrated circuits allowing packets to be forwarded at wire speed.

When a twisted pair or fiber link segment is used and neither end is connected to a repeater, full-duplex Ethernet becomes possible over that segment. In full-duplex mode, both devices can transmit and receive to and from each other at the same time, and there is no collision domain. This doubles the aggregate bandwidth of the link and is sometimes advertised as double the link speed (for example, 200 Mbit/s for Fast Ethernet). The elimination of the collision domain for these connections also means that all the link&#x27;s bandwidth can be used by the two devices on that segment and that segment length is not limited by the constraints of collision detection.

Since packets are typically delivered only to the port they are intended for, traffic on a switched Ethernet is less public than on shared-medium Ethernet. Despite this, switched Ethernet should still be regarded as an insecure network technology, because it is easy to subvert switched Ethernet systems by means such as ARP spoofing and MAC flooding.

The bandwidth advantages, the improved isolation of devices from each other, the ability to easily mix different speeds of devices and the elimination of the chaining limits inherent in non-switched Ethernet have made switched Ethernet the dominant network technology.

===Advanced networking===
Simple switched Ethernet networks, while a great improvement over repeater-based Ethernet, suffer from single points of failure, attacks that trick switches or hosts into sending data to a machine even if it is not intended for it, scalability and security issues with regard to switching loops, broadcast radiation, and multicast traffic.

Advanced networking features in switches use Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) or the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to maintain a loop-free, meshed network, allowing physical loops for redundancy (STP) or load-balancing (SPB). Shortest Path Bridging includes the use of the link-state routing protocol IS-IS to allow larger networks with shortest path routes between devices.

Advanced networking features also ensure port security, provide protection features such as MAC lockdown and broadcast radiation filtering, use VLANs to keep different classes of users separate while using the same physical infrastructure, employ multilayer switching to route between different classes, and use link aggregation to add bandwidth to overloaded links and to provide some redundancy.

In 2016, Ethernet replaced InfiniBand as the most popular system interconnect of TOP500 supercomputers.

==Varieties==

The Ethernet physical layer evolved over a considerable time span and encompasses coaxial, twisted pair and fiber-optic physical media interfaces, with speeds from to . The first introduction of twisted-pair CSMA/CD was StarLAN, standardized as 802.3 1BASE5. While 1BASE5 had little market penetration, it defined the physical apparatus (wire, plug/jack, pin-out, and wiring plan) that would be carried over to 10BASE-T through 10GBASE-T.

The most common forms used are 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE-T. All three use twisted-pair cables and 8P8C modular connectors. They run at , , and , respectively.

Fiber optic variants of Ethernet (that commonly use SFP modules) are also very popular in larger networks, offering high performance, better electrical isolation and longer distance (tens of kilometers with some versions). In general, network protocol stack software will work similarly on all varieties.

==Frame structure==

In IEEE 802.3, a datagram is called a &quot;packet&quot; or &quot;frame&quot;. &quot;Packet&quot; is used to describe the overall transmission unit and includes the preamble, start frame delimiter (SFD) and carrier extension (if present). The &quot;frame&quot; begins after the start frame delimiter with a frame header featuring source and destination MAC addresses and the EtherType field giving either the protocol type for the payload protocol or the length of the payload. The middle section of the frame consists of payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The frame ends with a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check, which is used to detect corruption of data in transit. Notably, Ethernet packets have no time-to-live field, leading to possible problems in the presence of a switching loop.

==Autonegotiation==

Autonegotiation is the procedure by which two connected devices choose common transmission parameters, e.g. speed and duplex mode. Autonegotiation was initially an optional feature, first introduced with 100BASE-TX (1995 IEEE 802.3u Fast Ethernet standard), and is backward compatible with 10BASE-T. The specification was improved in the 1998 release of IEEE 802.3. Autonegotiation is mandatory for 1000BASE-T and faster.

==Error conditions==
===Switching loop===

A switching loop or bridge loop occurs in computer networks when there is more than one Layer 2 (OSI model) path between two endpoints (e.g. multiple connections between two network switches or two ports on the same switch connected to each other). The loop creates broadcast storms as broadcasts and multicasts are forwarded by switches out every port, the switch or switches will repeatedly rebroadcast the broadcast messages flooding the network. Since the Layer 2 header does not support a &quot;time to live&quot; (TTL) value, if a frame is sent into a looped topology, it can loop forever.

A physical topology that contains switching or bridge loops is attractive for redundancy reasons, yet a switched network must not have loops. The solution is to allow physical loops, but create a loop-free logical topology using the SPB protocol or the older STP on the network switches.

===Jabber===
A node that is sending longer than the maximum transmission window for an Ethernet packet is considered to be &quot;jabbering&quot;. Depending on the physical topology, jabber detection and remedy differ somewhat.
* An MAU is required to detect and stop abnormally long transmission from the DTE (longer than 20–150 ms) in order to prevent permanent network disruption.
* On an electrically shared medium (10BASE5, 10BASE2, 1BASE5), jabber can only be detected by each end node, stopping reception. No further remedy is possible.
* A repeater/repeater hub uses a jabber timer that ends retransmission to the other ports when it expires. The timer runs for 25,000 to 50,000 bit times for 1 Mbit/s, 40,000 to 75,000 bit times for 10 and 100 Mbit/s, and 80,000 to 150,000 bit times for 1 Gbit/s. Jabbering ports are partitioned off the network until a carrier is no longer detected.
* End nodes utilizing a MAC layer will usually detect an oversized Ethernet frame and cease receiving. A bridge/switch will not forward the frame.
* A non-uniform frame size configuration in the network using jumbo frames may be detected as jabber by end nodes. Jumbo frames are not part of the official IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard.
* A packet detected as jabber by an upstream repeater and subsequently cut off has an invalid frame check sequence and is dropped.

===Runt frames===
* Runts are packets or frames smaller than the minimum allowed size. They are dropped and not propagated.

<doc id="9505" wikidata="Q80064" url="?curid=9505" title="Elias Canetti">
<text>Elias Canetti (; 25 July 1905 – 14 August 1994; ; ) was a German-language writer, known as a modernist novelist, playwright, memoirist, and nonfiction writer. Born in Ruse, Bulgaria, to a Sephardic Jewish family, he later lived in England, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. He won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Literature, &quot;for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power&quot;. He is noted for his nonfiction book &quot;Crowds and Power&quot;, among other works.

==Early life==
Born in 1905 to businessman Jacques Canetti and Mathilde &quot;née&quot; Arditti in Ruse, a city on the Danube in Bulgaria, Canetti was the eldest of three sons. His ancestors were Sephardic Jews. His paternal ancestors settled in Ruse from Ottoman Adrianople. The original family name was &quot;Cañete&quot;, named after Cañete, Cuenca, a village in Spain.

In Ruse, Canetti&#x27;s father and grandfather were successful merchants who operated out of a commercial building, which they had built in 1898. Canetti&#x27;s mother descended from the Arditti family, one of the oldest Sephardic families in Bulgaria, who were among the founders of the Ruse Jewish colony in the late 18th century. The Ardittis can be traced to the 14th century, when they were court physicians and astronomers to the Aragonese royal court of Alfonso IV and Pedro IV. Before settling in Ruse, they had migrated to Italy and lived in Livorno in the 17th century.
Canetti spent his childhood years, from 1905 to 1911, in Ruse until the family moved to Manchester, England, where Canetti&#x27;s father joined a business established by his wife&#x27;s brothers. In 1912, his father suddenly died, and his mother moved with their children first to Lausanne, and later in the same year, when Canetti was seven, to Vienna. His mother insisted that he learn and speak German. By this time, Canetti already spoke Ladino (his native language), Bulgarian, English, and some French; the last two he studied in the year he spent in Britain. Subsequently, the family moved first (from 1916 to 1921) to Zürich and then (until 1924) to Frankfurt, where Canetti graduated from high school.

Canetti went back to Vienna in 1924 in order to study chemistry. However, his primary interests during his years in Vienna became philosophy and literature.

==Career==
Introduced into the literary circles of First Republic Vienna, he started writing. Politically leaning towards the left, he was present at the July Revolt of 1927, came near to the action accidentally, was most impressed by the burning of books (recalled frequently in his writings) and left the place quickly with his bicycle. He received a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Vienna in 1929 but never worked as a chemist.

He published two works in Vienna, &quot;Komödie der Eitelkeit&quot; 1934 (The Comedy of Vanity) and &quot;Die Blendung&quot; 1935 (&quot;Auto-da-Fé&quot;, 1935), before escaping to Great Britain. He reflected on the experiences of Nazi Germany and political chaos in his works, especially exploring mob action and group thinking in the novel &quot;Die Blendung&quot; and in the non-fiction &quot;Crowds and Power&quot; (1960). He wrote several volumes of memoirs, contemplating the influence of his multi-lingual background and childhood.
==Personal life==
In 1934 in Vienna he married Veza (Venetiana) Taubner-Calderon (1897–1963), who acted as his muse and devoted literary assistant. Canetti remained open to relationships with other women. He had a short affair with the sculptor Anna Mahler, the daughter of the composer Gustav Mahler. In 1938, after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Germany, the Canettis moved to London. He became closely involved with the painter Marie-Louise von Motesiczky, who was to remain a close companion for many years. He was one of Iris Murdoch&#x27;s lovers. Her husband John Bayley&#x27;s memoir refers to him variously as &#x27;the Dichter&#x27;, &#x27;sage&#x27;, and &#x27;the monster of Hampstead&#x27;. Canetti, who demanded submission from women, later mercilessly skewered Murdoch in his posthumous memoir &quot;Party im Blitz&quot; (2003).

After Veza died in 1963, Canetti married Hera Buschor (1933–1988), with whom he had a daughter, Johanna, in 1972. Canetti&#x27;s brother Jacques Canetti settled in Paris, where he championed a revival of French chanson. Despite being a German-language writer, Canetti settled in Britain until the 1970s, receiving British citizenship in 1952. For his last 20 years, Canetti lived mostly in Zürich.

==Awards==
A writer in German, Canetti won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981, &quot;for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power&quot;. He is known chiefly for his celebrated trilogy of autobiographical memoirs of his childhood and of pre-Anschluss Vienna: &quot;Die Gerettete Zunge&quot; (The Tongue Set Free); &quot;Die Fackel im Ohr&quot; (The Torch in My Ear), and &quot;Das Augenspiel&quot; (The Play of the Eyes); for his modernist novel &quot;Auto-da-Fé&quot; (&quot;Die Blendung&quot;); and for &quot;Crowds and Power&quot;, a psychological study of crowd behaviour as it manifests itself in human activities ranging from mob violence to religious congregations.

==Death==
In the 1970s, Canetti began to travel more frequently to Zurich, where he settled and lived for his last 20 years. He died in Zürich in 1994.

<text>Edward Jenner (17 May 1749 – 26 January 1823) was an English physician and scientist who pioneered the concept of vaccines and created the smallpox vaccine, the world&#x27;s first vaccine. The terms &quot;vaccine&quot; and &quot;vaccination&quot; are derived from &quot;Variolae vaccinae&quot; (&#x27;pustules of the cow&#x27;), the term devised by Jenner to denote cowpox. He used it in 1798 in the title of his &quot;Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox&quot;, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox.

In the West, Jenner is often called &quot;the father of immunology&quot;, and his work is said to have saved &quot;more lives than any other man&quot;. In Jenner&#x27;s time, smallpox killed around 10% of the global population, with the number as high as 20% in towns and cities where infection spread more easily. In 1821, he was appointed physician to King George IV, and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace. He was a member of the Royal Society. In the field of zoology, he was among the first modern scholars to describe the brood parasitism of the cuckoo (Aristotle also noted this behaviour in his &quot;History of Animals&quot;). In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot;.

==Early life==

Edward Jenner was born on 17 May 1749 in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England as the eighth of nine children. His father, the Reverend Stephen Jenner, was the vicar of Berkeley, so Jenner received a strong basic education.

=== Education and training ===
When he was young, he went to school in Wotton-under-Edge at Katherine Lady Berkeley&#x27;s School and in Cirencester. During this time, he was inoculated (by variolation) for smallpox, which had a lifelong effect upon his general health. At the age of 14, he was apprenticed for seven years to Daniel Ludlow, a surgeon of Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire, where he gained most of the experience needed to become a surgeon himself.

In 1770, aged 21, Jenner became apprenticed in surgery and anatomy under surgeon John Hunter and others at St George&#x27;s Hospital, London. William Osler records that Hunter gave Jenner William Harvey&#x27;s advice, well known in medical circles (and characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment), &quot;Don&#x27;t think; try.&quot; Hunter remained in correspondence with Jenner over natural history and proposed him for the Royal Society. Returning to his native countryside by 1773, Jenner became a successful family doctor and surgeon, practising on dedicated premises at Berkeley. In 1792, &quot;with twenty years&#x27; experience of general practice and surgery, Jenner obtained the degree of MD from the University of St Andrews&quot;.

=== Later life ===
Jenner and others formed the Fleece Medical Society or Gloucestershire Medical Society, so called because it met in the parlour of the Fleece Inn, Rodborough, Gloucestershire. Members dined together and read papers on medical subjects. Jenner contributed papers on angina pectoris, ophthalmia, and cardiac valvular disease and commented on cowpox. He also belonged to a similar society which met in Alveston, near Bristol.

He became a master mason on 30 December 1802, in Lodge of Faith and Friendship #449. From 1812 to 1813, he served as worshipful master of Royal Berkeley Lodge of Faith and Friendship.

== Zoology ==
Jenner was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1788, following his publication of a careful study of the previously misunderstood life of the nested cuckoo, a study that combined observation, experiment, and dissection.

Jenner described how the newly hatched cuckoo pushed its host&#x27;s eggs and fledgling chicks out of the nest (contrary to existing belief that the adult cuckoo did it). Having observed this behaviour, Jenner demonstrated an anatomical adaptation for itthe baby cuckoo has a depression in its back, not present after 12 days of life, that enables it to cup eggs and other chicks. The adult does not remain long enough in the area to perform this task. Jenner&#x27;s findings were published in &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; in 1788.

&quot;The singularity of its shape is well adapted to these purposes; for, different from other newly hatched birds, its back from the scapula downwards is very broad, with a considerable depression in the middle. This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.&quot; Jenner&#x27;s nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.

Jenner&#x27;s understanding of the cuckoo&#x27;s behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist Jemima Blackburn, a keen observer of birdlife, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host&#x27;s egg. Blackburn&#x27;s description and illustration were enough to convince Charles Darwin to revise a later edition of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.

Jenner&#x27;s interest in zoology played a large role in his first experiment with inoculation. Not only did he have a profound understanding of human anatomy due to his medical training, but he also understood animal biology and its role in human-animal trans-species boundaries in disease transmission. At the time, there was no way of knowing how important this connection would be to the history and discovery of vaccinations. We see this connection now; many present-day vaccinations include animal parts from cows, rabbits, and chicken eggs, which can be attributed to the work of Jenner and his cowpox/smallpox vaccination.

==Marriage and human medicine==
Jenner married Catherine Kingscote (who died in 1815 from tuberculosis) in March 1788. He might have met her while he and other fellows were experimenting with balloons. Jenner&#x27;s trial balloon descended into Kingscote Park, Gloucestershire, owned by Catherine&#x27;s father Anthony Kingscote. They had three children: Edward Robert (1789–1810), Robert Fitzharding (1792–1854) and Catherine (1794–1833).

He earned his MD from the University of St Andrews in 1792. He is credited with advancing the understanding of angina pectoris. In his correspondence with Heberden, he wrote: &quot;How much the heart must suffer from the coronary arteries not being able to perform their functions&quot;.

==Invention of the vaccine==
Inoculation was already a standard practice in Asian and African medicine but involved serious risks, including the possibility that those inoculated would become contagious and spread the disease to others. In 1721, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had imported variolation to Britain after having observed it in Constantinople. While Johnnie Notions had great success with his self-devised inoculation (and was reputed not to have lost a single patient), his method&#x27;s practice was limited to the Shetland Islands. Voltaire wrote that at this time 60% of the population caught smallpox and 20% of the population died from it. He also stated that the Circassians used the inoculation from times immemorial, and that the Turks may have borrowed the custom from them. In 1766, Daniel Bernoulli analysed smallpox morbidity and mortality data to demonstrate the efficacy of inoculation.

By 1768, English physician John Fewster had realised that prior infection with cowpox rendered a person immune to smallpox. In the years following 1770, at least five investigators in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendell, Plett 1791) successfully tested a cowpox vaccine against smallpox in humans. For example, Dorset farmer Benjamin Jesty successfully vaccinated with cowpox and presumably induced immunity in his wife and two children during the 1774 smallpox epidemic, though it was not until Jenner&#x27;s work that the procedure became widely understood. Jenner may have been aware of Jesty&#x27;s procedures and success. In 1780, Jacques Antoine Rabaut-Pommier made similar observations in France.

Jenner postulated that the pus in blisters from sufferers of cowpox (a disease similar to smallpox but much less virulent) protected them from smallpox. On 14 May 1796, Jenner tested his hypothesis by inoculating James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of Jenner&#x27;s gardener. He scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid who had caught cowpox from a cow called Blossom (whose hide now hangs on the wall of the St. George&#x27;s Medical School library, now in Tooting, London). Phipps was the 17th case described in Jenner&#x27;s first paper on vaccination.

Jenner inoculated Phipps in both arms that day; this led to a fever and some uneasiness but no full-blown infection. Later, Jenner injected Phipps with variolous material, the routine method of immunization at that time and again no disease followed. The boy was later challenged with variolous material and again showed no sign of infection. There were no unexpected side effects, and neither Phipps nor any other recipients underwent any future &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; cases.

Jenner&#x27;s biographer John Baron later speculated that it was Jenner&#x27;s observation of the unblemished complexion of milkmaids that led to his understanding that it was possible to be inoculated against smallpox by being exposed to cowpox, that is he did not build on the work of his predecessors. The milkmaid story is still widely repeated even though it appears to be a myth.

US physician Donald Hopkins has written, &quot;Jenner&#x27;s unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox, but that he then proved [by subsequent challenges] that they were immune to smallpox. Moreover, he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person, not just directly from cattle.&quot; Jenner successfully tested his hypothesis on 23 additional subjects.

Jenner continued his research and reported it to the Royal Society, though the initial paper was not published. After revisions and further investigations, he published his findings on the 23 cases, including his 11-month-old son Robert. Some of his conclusions were correct, some erroneous; modern microbiological and microscopic methods would make his studies easier to reproduce. The medical establishment deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. Eventually, vaccination was accepted, and in 1840, the British government banned variolationthe use of smallpox to induce immunityand provided vaccination using cowpox free of charge (&quot;see&quot; Vaccination Act).

The success of Jenner&#x27;s discovery soon spread around Europe and was used &quot;en masse&quot; in the Spanish Balmis Expedition (1803–1806), a three-year-long mission to the Americas, the Philippines, Macao and China led by Francisco Javier de Balmis with the aim of giving the smallpox vaccine to thousands. The expedition was successful, and Jenner wrote: &quot;I don&#x27;t imagine the annals of history furnish an example of philanthropy so noble, so extensive as this&quot;. Napoleon, who at the time was at war with Britain, had all his French troops vaccinated, awarded Jenner a medal, and at Jenner&#x27;s request, released two English prisoners of war, allowing them to their return home. Napoleon remarked he could not &quot;refuse anything to one of the greatest benefactors of mankind&quot;.

Jenner&#x27;s continuing work on vaccination prevented him from continuing his ordinary medical practice. He was supported by his colleagues and King George III in petitioning Parliament, and in 1802 was granted £10,000 for his work on vaccination. In 1807, he was granted another £20,000 after the Royal College of Physicians confirmed the widespread efficacy of vaccination.


== Later life ==
Jenner was later elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1802, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1804, and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1806. In 1803 in London, he became president of the Jennerian Society, concerned with promoting vaccination to eradicate smallpox. The Jennerian ceased operations in 1809. Jenner became a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Society on its founding in 1805 (now the Royal Society of Medicine) and presented several papers there. In 1808, with government aid, the National Vaccine Establishment was founded, but Jenner felt dishonoured by the men selected to run it and resigned his directorship.

Returning to London in 1811, Jenner observed a significant number of cases of smallpox after vaccination. He found that in these cases the severity of the illness was notably diminished by previous vaccination. In 1821, he was appointed physician extraordinary to King George IV, and was also made mayor of Berkeley and magistrate (justice of the peace). He continued to investigate natural history, and in 1823, the last year of his life, he presented his &quot;Observations on the Migration of Birds&quot; to the Royal Society.

Jenner was a Freemason.

== Death ==
Jenner was found in a state of apoplexy on 25 January 1823, with his right side paralysed. He did not recover and died the next day of an apparent stroke, his second, on 26 January 1823, aged 73. He was buried in the family vault at the Church of St Mary, Berkeley.

== Religious views ==
Neither fanatic nor lax, Jenner was a Christian who in his personal correspondence showed himself quite spiritual. Some days before his death, he stated to a friend: &quot;I am not surprised that men are not grateful to me; but I wonder that they are not grateful to God for the good which He has made me the instrument of conveying to my fellow creatures&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox an eradicated disease. This was the result of coordinated public health efforts, but vaccination was an essential component. Although the disease was declared eradicated, some pus samples still remain in laboratories in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta in the US, and in State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia.

Jenner&#x27;s vaccine laid the foundation for contemporary discoveries in immunology. In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote. Commemorated on postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail, in 1999 he featured in their World Changers issue along with Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday and Alan Turing. The lunar crater Jenner is named in his honour.

<text>The is a general knowledge English-language encyclopaedia. It has been published by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. since 1768, although the company has changed ownership seven times. The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32 volumes and 32,640 pages, was the last printed edition. Since 2016, it has been published exclusively as an online encyclopaedia.

Printed for 244 years, the &quot;Britannica&quot; was the longest-running in-print encyclopaedia in the English language. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh, Scotland, in three volumes. The encyclopaedia grew in size; the second edition was 10 volumes, and by its fourth edition (1801–1810), it had expanded to 20 volumes. Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875–1889) and 11th editions (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Starting with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the &quot;Britannica&quot; shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market.

In 1933, the &quot;Britannica&quot; became the first encyclopaedia to adopt &quot;continuous revision&quot;, in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule. In the 21st century, the &quot;Britannica&quot; suffered first from competition with the digital multimedia encyclopaedia Microsoft &quot;Encarta&quot;, and later with the online peer-produced encyclopaedia Wikipedia.

In March 2012, it announced it would no longer publish printed editions and would focus instead on the online version.

The 15th edition (1974–2010) has a three-part structure: a 12-volume of short articles (generally fewer than 750 words), a 17-volume of long articles (two to 310 pages), and a single volume to give a hierarchical outline of knowledge. The was meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the ; readers are advised to study the outline to understand a subject&#x27;s context and to find more detailed articles. Over 70 years, the size of the &quot;Britannica&quot; has remained steady, with about 40 million words on half a million topics. Though published in the United States since 1901, the &quot;Britannica&quot; has for the most part maintained British English spelling.

== History ==
Past owners have included, in chronological order, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based printers Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, Scottish bookseller Archibald Constable, Scottish publisher A &amp; C Black, Horace Everett Hooper, Sears Roebuck, William Benton, and Jacqui Safra, a Swiss billionaire of New York.

Recent advances in information technology and the rise of electronic encyclopaedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite, &quot;Encarta&quot; and Wikipedia have reduced the demand for print encyclopaedias. To remain competitive, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has stressed the reputation of the &quot;Britannica&quot;, reduced its price and production costs, and developed electronic versions on CD-ROM, DVD, and the World Wide Web. Since the early 1930s, the company has promoted spin-off reference works.

=== Editions ===
The &quot;Britannica&quot; has been issued in 15 editions, with multi-volume supplements to the 3rd and 4th editions (see the Table below). The 5th and 6th editions were reprints of the 4th, and the 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. The 15th underwent massive reorganization in 1985, but the updated, current version is still known as the 15th. The 14th and 15th editions were edited every year throughout their runs, so that later printings of each were entirely different from early ones.

Throughout history, the &quot;Britannica&quot; has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book, and to provide educational material. In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematize all human knowledge. The history of the &quot;Britannica&quot; can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management, or reorganization of the dictionary.

==== 1768–1826 ====

In the first era (1st–6th editions, 1768–1826), the &quot;Britannica&quot; was managed and published by its founders, Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, by Archibald Constable, and by others. The &quot;Britannica&quot; was first published between December 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh as the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan&quot;. In part, it was conceived in reaction to the French &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert (published 1751–1772), which had been inspired by Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; (first edition 1728). It went on sale 10 December.

The &quot;Britannica&quot; of this period was primarily a Scottish enterprise, and it is one of the most enduring legacies of the Scottish Enlightenment. In this era, the &quot;Britannica&quot; moved from being a three-volume set (1st edition) compiled by one young editor—William Smellie—to a 20-volume set written by numerous authorities. Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period, among them editions of Abraham Rees&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopædia&quot; and Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot; and David Brewster&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopædia&quot;.

==== 1827–1901 ====
During the second era (7th–9th editions, 1827–1901), the &quot;Britannica&quot; was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm A &amp; C Black. Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably Macvey Napier, others were attracted by the &quot;Britannica&quot; reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world&#x27;s most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974.

Production of the 9th edition was overseen by Thomas Spencer Baynes, the first English-born editor-in-chief. Dubbed the &quot;Scholar&#x27;s Edition&quot;, the 9th edition is the most scholarly of all &quot;Britannicas&quot;. After 1880, Baynes was assisted by William Robertson Smith. No biographies of living persons were included. James Clerk Maxwell and Thomas Huxley were special advisors on science. However, by the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated, and the &quot;Britannica&quot; faced financial difficulties.

==== 1901–1973 ====
In the third era (10th–14th editions, 1901–1973), the &quot;Britannica&quot; was managed by American businessmen who introduced direct marketing and door-to-door sales. The American owners gradually simplified articles, making them less scholarly for a mass market. The 10th edition was an eleven-volume supplement (including one each of maps and an index) to the 9th, numbered as volumes 25–35, but the 11th edition was a completely new work, and is still praised for excellence; its owner, Horace Hooper, lavished enormous effort on its perfection.

When Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the &quot;Britannica&quot; was managed by Sears Roebuck for 18 years (1920–1923, 1928–1943). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, Elkan Harrison Powell, assumed presidency of the &quot;Britannica&quot;; in 1936, he began the policy of continuous revision. This was a departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced, at roughly 25-year intervals, some articles unchanged from earlier editions. Powell developed new educational products that built upon the &quot;Britannica&quot; reputation.

In 1943, Sears donated the to the University of Chicago. William Benton, then a vice president of the university, provided the working capital for its operation. The stock was divided between Benton and the university, with the university holding an option on the stock. Benton became chairman of the board and managed the &quot;Britannica&quot; until his death in 1973. Benton set up the Benton Foundation, which managed the &quot;Britannica&quot; until 1996, and whose sole beneficiary was the University of Chicago. In 1968, the &quot;Britannica&quot; celebrated its bicentennial.

==== 1974–1994 ====

In the fourth era (1974–1994), the &quot;Britannica&quot; introduced its 15th edition, which was reorganized into three parts: the , the , and the . Under Mortimer J. Adler (member of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica since its inception in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of &quot;Britannica&quot; from 1965), the &quot;Britannica&quot; sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool, but to systematize all human knowledge. The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias (the and ) provoked a &quot;firestorm of criticism&quot; of the initial 15th edition. In response, the 15th edition was completely reorganized and indexed for a re-release in 1985. This second version of the 15th edition continued to be published and revised through the release of the 2010 print version. The official title of the 15th edition is the &quot;New Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, although it has also been promoted as &quot;Britannica 3&quot;.

On 9 March 1976 the US Federal Trade Commission entered an opinion and order enjoining Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. from using: a) deceptive advertising practices in recruiting sales agents and obtaining sales leads, and b) deceptive sales practices in the door-to-door presentations of its sales agents.

==== 1994–present ====

In the fifth era (1994–present), digital versions have been developed and released on optical media and online.

In 1996, the &quot;Britannica&quot; was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value, owing to the company&#x27;s financial difficulties. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, Britannica.com Incorporated, developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, Ilan Yeshua, who has continued Powell&#x27;s strategy of introducing new products with the &quot;Britannica&quot; name. In March 2012, Britannica&#x27;s president, Jorge Cauz, announced that it would not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools.

&quot;Britannica&quot; final print edition was in 2010, a 32-volume set. &quot;Britannica Global Edition&quot; was also printed in 2010, containing 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller &quot;compact&quot; volumes, as well as over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain and sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up through the 14th had. The following is &quot;Britannica&quot; description of the work:

In 2020, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. released the &quot;Britannica All New Children&#x27;s Encyclopedia: What We Know and What We Don&#x27;t&quot;, an encyclopaedia aimed primarily at younger readers, covering major topics. The encyclopedia was widely praised for bringing back the print format. It was &quot;Britannica&quot;&#x27;s first encyclopaedia for children since 1984.

=== Dedications ===
The &quot;Britannica&quot; was dedicated to the reigning British monarch from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an American partnership, to the British monarch and the President of the United States. Thus, the 11th edition is &quot;dedicated by Permission to His Majesty George the Fifth, King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and to William Howard Taft, President of the United States of America.&quot; The order of the dedications has changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with relative sales; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is &quot;Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, Dwight David Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second.&quot;

== Print version ==

From 1985, the &quot;Britannica&quot; consisted of four parts: the , the , the , and a two-volume index. The &quot;Britannica&quot; articles are contained in the and , which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007 has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from two pages to 310 pages, with references and named contributors. In contrast, the 2007 has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority (about 97%) of which contain fewer than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors. The articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the . The articles are meant as authoritative, well-written commentaries on their subjects, as well as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere. The longest article (310 pages) is on the subject of the United States, and it resulted from merging separate articles on the individual US states. A 2013 &quot;Global Edition&quot; of &quot;Britannica&quot; contained approximately 40,000 articles.

Information can be found in the &quot;Britannica&quot; by following the cross-references in the and ; these are sparse, however, averaging one cross-reference per page. Readers are instead recommended to consult the alphabetical index or the , which organizes the &quot;Britannica&quot; contents by topic.

The core of the is its &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot;, which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge. Accordingly, the Outline is consulted by the &quot;Britannica&quot; editors to decide which articles should be included in the and . The Outline can also be used as a study guide, as it puts subjects in their proper perspective and suggests a series of &quot;Britannica&quot; articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth. However, libraries have found that it is scarcely used for this purpose, and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopaedia. The contains colour transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members, advisors, and contributors to all three parts of the &quot;Britannica&quot;.

Taken together, the and comprise roughly 40 million words and 24,000 images. The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the &quot;Britannica&quot;, together with 474,675 subentries under those topics. The &quot;Britannica&quot; generally prefers British spelling over American; for example, it uses &quot;colour&quot; (not &quot;color&quot;), &quot;centre&quot; (not &quot;center&quot;), and &quot;encyclopaedia&quot; (not &quot;encyclopedia&quot;). There are some exceptions to this rule, such as &quot;defense&quot; rather than &quot;defence&quot;. Common alternative spellings are provided with cross-references such as &quot;Color: &quot;see&quot; Colour.&quot;

Since 1936, the &quot;Britannica&quot; has been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of the articles considered for revision each year. According to one Britannica website, 46% of the articles in the 2007 edition were revised over the preceding three years; however, according to another Britannica website, only 35% of the articles were revised over the same period.

The alphabetization of articles in the and follows strict rules. Diacritical marks and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as &quot;1812, War of&quot; are alphabetized as if the number had been written out (&quot;Eighteen-twelve, War of&quot;). Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons, then by places, then by things. Rulers with identical names are organized first alphabetically by country and then by chronology; thus, Charles III of France precedes Charles I of England, listed in &quot;Britannica&quot; as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland. (That is, they are alphabetized as if their titles were &quot;Charles, France, 3&quot; and &quot;Charles, Great Britain and Ireland, 1&quot;.) Similarly, places that share names are organized alphabetically by country, then by ever-smaller political divisions.

In March 2012, the company announced that the 2010 edition would be the last printed version. This was part of a move by the company to adapt to the times and focus on its future using digital distribution. The peak year for the printed encyclopaedia was 1990, when 120,000 sets were sold, but sales had dropped to 40,000 per annum by 1996. There were 12,000 sets of the 2010 edition printed, of which 8,000 had been sold by March 2012. By late April 2012, the remaining copies of the 2010 edition had sold out at Britannica&#x27;s online store. , a replica of Britannica&#x27;s 1768 first edition is available via the online store.

&quot;Britannica Junior&quot; was first published in 1934 as 12 volumes. It was expanded to 15 volumes in 1947, and renamed &quot;Britannica Junior Encyclopædia&quot; in 1963. It was taken off the market after the 1984 printing.

A British &quot;Children&#x27;s Britannica&quot; edited by John Armitage was issued in London in 1960. Its contents were determined largely by the eleven-plus standardized tests given in Britain. Britannica introduced the &quot;Children&#x27;s Britannica&quot; to the US market in 1988, aimed at ages seven to 14.

In 1961, a 16-volume &quot;Young Children&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot; was issued for children just learning to read. &quot;My First Britannica&quot; is aimed at children ages six to 12, and the &quot;Britannica Discovery Library&quot; is for children aged three to six (issued 1974 to 1991). &quot;Compton&#x27;s by Britannica&quot;, first published in 2007, incorporating the former &quot;Compton&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;, is aimed at 10- to 17-year-olds and consists of 26 volumes and 11,000 pages.

It has daily features, updates and links to news reports from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the BBC. , roughly 60% of Encyclopædia Britannica&#x27;s revenue came from online operations, of which around 15% came from subscriptions to the consumer version of the websites. , subscriptions were available on a yearly, monthly or weekly basis. Special subscription plans are offered to schools, colleges and libraries; such institutional subscribers constitute an important part of Britannica&#x27;s business. Beginning in early 2007, the &quot;Britannica&quot; made articles freely available if they are hyperlinked from an external site. Non-subscribers are served pop-ups and advertising.

On 20 February 2007, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced that it was working with mobile phone search company AskMeNow to launch a mobile encyclopaedia. Users would be able to send a question via text message, and AskMeNow would search &quot;Britannica&quot; 28,000-article concise encyclopaedia to return an answer to the query. Daily topical features sent directly to users&#x27; mobile phones were also planned.

On 3 June 2008, an initiative to facilitate collaboration between online expert and amateur scholarly contributors for Britannica&#x27;s online content (in the spirit of a wiki), with editorial oversight from Britannica staff, was announced. Approved contributions would be credited, though contributing automatically grants Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. perpetual, irrevocable licence to those contributions.

On 22 January 2009, Britannica&#x27;s president, Jorge Cauz, announced that the company would be accepting edits and additions to the online &quot;Britannica&quot; website from the public. The published edition of the encyclopaedia would not be affected by the changes. Individuals wishing to edit the &quot;Britannica&quot; website would have to register under their real name and address prior to editing or submitting their content. All edits submitted would be reviewed and checked and will have to be approved by the encyclopaedia&#x27;s professional staff. Contributions from non-academic users would sit in a separate section from the expert-generated &quot;Britannica&quot; content, as would content submitted by non-&quot;Britannica&quot; scholars. Articles written by users, if vetted and approved, would also only be available in a special section of the website, separate from the professional articles. Official &quot;Britannica&quot; material would carry a &quot;Britannica Checked&quot; stamp, to distinguish it from the user-generated content.

== Personnel and management ==
=== Contributors ===
The print version of the &quot;Britannica&quot; has 4,411 contributors, many eminent in their fields, such as Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman, astronomer Carl Sagan, and surgeon Michael DeBakey. Roughly a quarter of the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 (Alfred North Whitehead), while another quarter are retired or emeritus. Most (approximately 98%) contribute to only a single article; however, 64 contributed to three articles, 23 contributed to four articles, 10 contributed to five articles, and 8 contributed to more than five articles. An exceptionally prolific contributor is Christine Sutton of the University of Oxford, who contributed 24 articles on particle physics.

While &quot;Britannica&quot; authors have included writers such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Leon Trotsky, as well as notable independent encyclopaedists such as Isaac Asimov, some have been criticized for lack of expertise. In 1911, the historian George L. Burr wrote:

=== Staff ===

 in the 15th edition of &quot;Britannica&quot;, Dale Hoiberg, a sinologist, was listed as &quot;Britannica&quot; Senior Vice President and editor-in-chief. Among his predecessors as editors-in-chief were Hugh Chisholm (1902–1924), James Louis Garvin (1926–1932), Franklin Henry Hooper (1932–1938), Walter Yust (1938–1960), Harry Ashmore (1960–1963), Warren E. Preece (1964–1968, 1969–1975), Sir William Haley (1968–1969), Philip W. Goetz (1979–1991), and Robert McHenry (1992–1997). Anita Wolff was listed as the Deputy Editor and Theodore Pappas as Executive Editor. Prior Executive Editors include John V. Dodge (1950–1964) and Philip W. Goetz.

Paul T. Armstrong remains the longest working employee of Encyclopædia Britannica. He began his career there in 1934, eventually earning the positions of treasurer, vice president, and chief financial officer in his 58 years with the company, before retiring in 1992.

The 2007 editorial staff of the &quot;Britannica&quot; included five Senior Editors and nine Associate Editors, supervised by Dale Hoiberg and four others. The editorial staff helped to write the articles of the and some sections of the .

=== Editorial advisors ===
As of 2012, &quot;Britannica&quot; had an editorial board of advisors, which included a number of distinguished figures, primarily scholars from a variety of disciplines.

The &quot;Propædia&quot; and its &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot; were produced by dozens of editorial advisors under the direction of Mortimer J. Adler. Roughly half of these advisors have since died, including some of the Outline&#x27;s chief architects – Rene Dubos (d. 1982), Loren Eiseley (d. 1977), Harold D. Lasswell (d. 1978), Mark Van Doren (d. 1972), Peter Ritchie Calder (d. 1982) and Mortimer J. Adler (d. 2001). The also lists just under 4,000 advisors who were consulted for the unsigned articles.

=== Corporate structure ===
During much of the 20th century, the &quot;Britannica&quot; had a significant ownership stake from the University of Chicago, with many people associated with the university serving senior positions in the organisation.331-332 During the mid 20th century, managers and executives at the &quot;Britannica&quot; company were lavishly rewarded due to the healthy profit encyclopedia sales generated, with division managers at the top of the sales organisation earning an average salary of $125,000 in 1958 ($ around in current USD adjusted for inflation).329

From 1974, the company was controlled by the Benton Foundation, of which the University of Chicago was the sole beneficiary. In January 1996, the &quot;Britannica&quot; was purchased from the Benton Foundation by billionaire Swiss financier Jacqui Safra, who serves as its current chair of the board. In 1997, Don Yannias, a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became CEO of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.

In 1999, a new company, Britannica.com Incorporated, was created to develop digital versions of the &quot;Britannica&quot;; Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company, while his former position at the parent company remained vacant for two years. Yannias&#x27; tenure at Britannica.com Incorporated was marked by missteps, considerable lay-offs, and financial losses. In 2001, Yannias was replaced by Ilan Yeshua, who reunited the leadership of the two companies. Yannias later returned to investment management, but remains on the &quot;Britannica&quot; Board of Directors.

In 2003, former management consultant Jorge Aguilar-Cauz was appointed President of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the &quot;Britannica&quot; Board of Directors. Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the &quot;Britannica&quot; brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO Elkan Harrison Powell in the mid-1930s.

In the fall of 2017, Karthik Krishnan was appointed global chief executive officer of the Encyclopædia Britannica Group. Krishnan brought a varied perspective to the role based on several high-level positions in digital media, including RELX (formerly known as Reed Elsevier, and one of the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index) and Rodale, in which he was responsible for &quot;driving business and cultural transformation and accelerating growth&quot;.

Taking the reins of the company as it was preparing to mark its 250th anniversary and define the next phase of its digital strategy for consumers and K–12 schools, Krishnan launched a series of new initiatives in his first year.

First was Britannica Insights, a free, downloadable software extension to the Google Chrome browser that served up edited, fact-checked Britannica information with queries on search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Its purpose, the company said, was to &quot;provide trusted, verified information&quot; in conjunction with search results that were thought to be increasingly unreliable in the era of misinformation and &quot;fake news.&quot;

The product was quickly followed by Britannica School Insights, which provided similar content for subscribers to Britannica&#x27;s online classroom products, and a partnership with YouTube in which verified Britannica content appeared on the site as an antidote to user-generated video content that could be false or misleading.

=== Sales and marketing ===
Although prior to 1920 the &quot;Britannica&quot; was primarily sold by mail-order, after that time the &quot;Britannica&quot; was almost exclusively sold by door-to-door salesmen, who often used high-pressure sales tactics or outright deception in order to secure purchases of the expensive work,317-330 from which they gained a significant commission, which in the United States in 1971 was $120–200 (around $-$ adjusted for inflation) per sale. These high-pressure sales tactics resulted in high levels of turnover among &quot;Britannica&quot; salesmen, with the company often exaggerating the ease of making a sale to employees, as well as engaging in deceptive job advertising in order to entice people to become salesmen.317-330 The &quot;Britannica&quot; was sued several times by the American Federal Trade Commission for deceptive practices.317-330 These practices were common among American encyclopedia companies.317-330 The development of the significant sales force began in 1932, with most senior leadership of the company by the late 20th century coming from the sales division.

While early on the &quot;Britannica&quot; was marketed to adults and in particular during the 19th and early 20th centuries, to an elite educated audience,152-153 by the mid 20th century, the &quot;Britannica&quot; (as well as other American encyclopedias) were primarily marketed to middle-class parents who wished to seek a good education for their children, despite the text not being aimed at a child&#x27;s reading level.317-330 During the 20th century, the &quot;Britannica&quot; differentiated itself from other encyclopedias by using its long pedigree to present itself as a premium brand. Once the encyclopedia was purchased, it was often little read by its buyers.

== Competition ==
As the &quot;Britannica&quot; is a general encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with specialized encyclopaedias such as the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Mathematics&quot; or the &quot;Dictionary of the Middle Ages&quot;, which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the &quot;Britannica&quot; main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and, soon thereafter, &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; and Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot;. In the 20th century, successful competitors included &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;, the &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;, and the &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot;. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the &quot;Britannica&quot; was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English-language encyclopaedia, especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors. The print version of the &quot;Britannica&quot; was significantly more expensive than its competitors.

Since the early 1990s, the &quot;Britannica&quot; has faced new challenges from digital information sources. The Internet, facilitated by the development of search engines, has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions, thanks in part to initiatives such as Google Books, MIT&#x27;s release of its educational materials and the open PubMed Central library of the National Library of Medicine.

The Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated. In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the &quot;Britannica&quot; has struggled to stay up to date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor Walter Yust. Eventually, the &quot;Britannica&quot; turned to focus more on its online edition.

=== Print encyclopaedias ===
The has been compared with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A well-known comparison is that of Kenneth Kister, who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the 1993 &quot;Britannica&quot; with two comparable encyclopaedias, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; and the &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;. For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random—circumcision, Charles Drew, Galileo, Philip Glass, heart disease, IQ, panda bear, sexual harassment, Shroud of Turin and Uzbekistan—and letter grades of A–D or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between B− and B+, chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the &quot;Britannica&quot; received one &quot;D&quot; and seven &quot;A&quot;s, &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; received eight &quot;A&quot;s, and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; received one &quot;D&quot; and seven &quot;A&quot;s; thus, &quot;Britannica&quot; received an average score of 92% for accuracy to &quot;Americana&quot; 95% and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; 92%. In the timeliness category, &quot;Britannica&quot; averaged an 86% to &quot;Americana&quot;&#x27;s 90% and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; 85%.

=== Digital encyclopaedias on optical media ===
The most notable competitor of the &quot;Britannica&quot; among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopaedias was &quot;Encarta&quot;, now discontinued, a modern multimedia encyclopaedia that incorporated three print encyclopaedias: &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s,&quot; and the &quot;New Merit Scholar&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;. &quot;Encarta&quot; was the top-selling multimedia encyclopaedia, based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006. Both occupied the same price range, with the &quot;2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate&quot; CD or DVD costing US$40–50 and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45.

The &quot;Britannica&quot; disc contains 100,000 articles and &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary and Thesaurus&quot; (US only) and offers primary and secondary school editions. &quot;Encarta&quot; contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language, and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition. Like &quot;Encarta&quot;, the digital &quot;Britannica&quot; has been criticized for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary. Like the &quot;Britannica&quot;, &quot;Encarta&quot; was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed for free.

=== Wikipedia ===

The main online alternative to &quot;Britannica&quot; is Wikipedia. The key differences between the two lie in accessibility; the model of participation they bring to an encyclopedic project; their respective style sheets and editorial policies; relative ages; the number of subjects treated; the number of languages in which articles are written and made available; and their underlying economic models: unlike &quot;Britannica&quot;, Wikipedia is not-for-profit, does not carry advertising on its site, and is not connected with traditional profit- and contract-based publishing distribution networks.

&quot;Britannica&quot;″s articles either have known authorship or a set of possible authors (the editorial staff). With the exception of the editorial staff, most &quot;Britannica&quot; contributors are experts in their field—some are Nobel laureates. By contrast, the articles on Wikipedia are written by people of unknown degrees of expertise; most do not claim any particular expertise, and of those who do, many are anonymous and have no verifiable credentials. It is for this lack of institutional vetting or certification that former &quot;Britannica&quot; editor-in-chief Robert McHenry noted his belief in 2004 that Wikipedia could not hope to rival the &quot;Britannica&quot; in accuracy.

In 2005, the journal &quot;Nature&quot; chose articles from both websites in a wide range of science topics and sent them to what it called &quot;relevant&quot; field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles—one from each site on a given topic—side by side, but were not told which article came from which site. &quot;Nature&quot; got back 42 usable reviews. The journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts: four from each site. It also discovered many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in &quot;Britannica&quot;, an average of 3.86 mistakes per article for Wikipedia and 2.92 for &quot;Britannica&quot;.

Although &quot;Britannica &quot;was revealed as the more accurate encyclopaedia, with fewer errors, in its rebuttal, it called &quot;Nature&quot;&#x27;s study flawed and misleading and called for a &quot;prompt&quot; retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a &quot;Britannica&quot; yearbook and not the encyclopaedia, and another two were from &quot;Compton&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; (called the &quot;Britannica Student Encyclopedia&quot; on the company&#x27;s website).

&quot;Nature&quot; defended its story and declined to retract, stating that, as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of &quot;Britannica&quot;, it used whatever relevant material was available on &quot;Britannica&quot; website. Interviewed in February 2009, the managing director of &quot;Britannica UK&quot; said: 

For the 15th anniversary of Wikipedia, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; published two opinion pieces which compared Wikipedia to &quot;Britannica&quot; and falsely claimed that &quot;Britannica&quot; had gone bankrupt in 1996. In a January 2016 press release, &quot;Britannica&quot; responded by calling Wikipedia &quot;an impressive achievement&quot; but argued that critics should avoid &quot;false comparisons&quot; to &quot;Britannica&quot; in terms of differing models and purposes.

== Critical and popular assessments ==
=== Reputation ===

Since the 3rd edition, the &quot;Britannica&quot; has enjoyed a popular and critical reputation for general excellence, though this reputation has not been without its critics. The 3rd and 9th editions were pirated for sale in the United States, beginning with &quot;Dobson&#x27;s Encyclopædia&quot;. On the release of the 14th edition, &quot;Time&quot; magazine dubbed the &quot;Britannica&quot; the &quot;Patriarch of the Library&quot;. In a related advertisement, naturalist William Beebe was quoted as saying that the &quot;Britannica&quot; was &quot;beyond comparison because there is no competitor&quot;. References to the &quot;Britannica&quot; can be found throughout English literature, most notably in one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;. The tale was highlighted by the Lord Mayor of London, Gilbert Inglefield, at the bicentennial of the &quot;Britannica&quot;.

The &quot;Britannica&quot; has a reputation for summarizing knowledge. To further their education, some people have devoted themselves to reading the entire &quot;Britannica&quot;, taking anywhere from three to 22 years to do so. When Fat&#x27;h Ali became the Shah of Persia in 1797, he was given a set of the &quot;Britannica&quot; 3rd edition; after reading the complete set, he extended his royal title to include &quot;Most Formidable Lord and Master of the &quot;.

Writer George Bernard Shaw has claimed to have read the complete 9th edition, except for the science articles; Richard Evelyn Byrd took the &quot;Britannica&quot; as reading material for his five-month stay at the South Pole in 1934; and Philip Beaver read it during a sailing expedition. More recently, A. J. Jacobs, an editor at &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, read the entire 2002 version of the 15th edition, describing his experiences in the well-received 2004 book &quot;The Know-It-All: One Man&#x27;s Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World&quot;. Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author C. S. Forester and Amos Urban Shirk, an American businessman who read the 11th and 14th editions, devoting roughly three hours per night for four and a half years to read the 11th.

=== Awards ===
The CD/DVD-ROM version of the &quot;Britannica&quot;, &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite&quot;, received the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the Association of Educational Publishers. On 15 July 2009, was awarded a spot as one of &quot;Top Ten Superbrands in the UK&quot; by a panel of more than 2,000 independent reviewers, as reported by the BBC.

=== Coverage of topics ===
Topics are chosen in part by reference to the &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot;. The bulk of the 15th edition of the &quot;Britannica&quot; is devoted to geography (26% of the ), biography (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophy (4%), and law (3%). A complementary study of the found that geography accounted for 25% of articles, science 18%, social sciences 17%, biography 17%, and all other humanities 25%. Writing in 1992, one reviewer judged that the &quot;range, depth, and of coverage [of the &quot;Britannica&quot;] are unsurpassed by any other general Encyclopaedia.&quot;

The &quot;Britannica&quot; does not cover topics in equal detail; for example, the whole of Buddhism and most other religions is covered in a single article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to Christianity, comprising nearly half of all religion articles. The &quot;Britannica&quot; covers 50,479 biographies, 5,999 of them about women, with 11.87% being British citizens and 25.51% US citizens. However, the &quot;Britannica&quot; has been lauded as the &quot;least&quot; biased of general Encyclopaedias marketed to Western readers and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras.

=== Criticism of editorial decisions ===
Harvey Einbinder in the &quot;Myth of the Britannica&quot; criticised the 11th edition for the inaccessibility of the text for laymen, saying that many of its articles were too technical for people unfamiliar to the subject to understand.152-153 He made similar criticisms of many of the mathematics and science articles of the then-current 14th edition.236-250

On rare occasions, the &quot;Britannica&quot; has been criticized for its editorial choices. Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974–1985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children&#x27;s literature, military decorations, and the French poet Joachim du Bellay; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies. Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the and . Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a &quot;qualified failure ... [that] cares more for juggling its format than for preserving.&quot; More recently, reviewers from the American Library Association were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 , along with the article on psychology. Harvey Einbinder in &quot;The Myth of the Britannica&quot; criticised the practice of condensing entries in the 14th edition, which usually involved simply removing large amounts of the text rather than attempting to condense it by rewriting, resulting in what he considered to be considerable reduction in the quality of the articles.151-168

Some very few &quot;Britannica&quot;-appointed contributors are mistaken. A notorious instance from the &quot;Britannica&quot; early years is the rejection of Newtonian gravity by George Gleig, the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the classical element of fire. The &quot;Britannica&quot; has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics, as it did with William Robertson Smith&#x27;s articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875).

=== Other criticisms ===
The &quot;Britannica&quot; has received criticism, particularly as editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the &quot;Britannica&quot;, and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible (usually about 25 years).

For example, despite continuous revision, the 14th edition became outdated after 35 years (1929–1964). When American physicist Harvey Einbinder detailed its failings in his 1964 book, &quot;The Myth of the Britannica&quot;, the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work. Editors have struggled at times to keep the &quot;Britannica&quot; current: one 1994 critic writes, &quot;It is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision&quot;, noting that the longer articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter articles. Information in the is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding article(s), mainly because of the failure to update one or the other. The bibliographies of the articles have been criticized for being more out-of-date than the articles themselves.

In 2005, a 12-year-old schoolboy in Britain found several inaccuracies in the &quot;Britannica&quot; entries on Poland and wildlife in Eastern Europe. In 2010, an entry about the Irish Civil War, which incorrectly described it as having been fought between the north and south of Ireland, was discussed in the Irish press following a decision by the Department of Education and Science to pay for online access.

Writing about the 3rd edition (1788–1797), &quot;Britannica&quot; chief editor George Gleig observed that &quot;perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan and embracing such a variety of subjects.&quot; In March 2006, the &quot;Britannica&quot; wrote, &quot;we in no way mean to imply that &quot;Britannica&quot; is error-free; we have never made such a claim&quot;. However, the &quot;Britannica&quot; sales department had previously made a well-known claim in 1962 regarding the 14th edition that &quot;[i]t is truth. It is unquestionable fact.&quot; The sentiment of the 2006 statement was also reflected in the introduction to the first edition of the &quot;Britannica&quot;, written by its original editor William Smellie:

<text>The endometrium is the inner epithelial layer, along with its mucous membrane, of the mammalian uterus. It has a basal layer and a functional layer: the basal layer contains stem cells which regenerate the functional layer. The functional layer thickens and then is shed during menstruation in humans and some other mammals, including other apes, Old World monkeys, some species of bat, the elephant shrew and the Cairo spiny mouse. In most other mammals, the endometrium is reabsorbed in the estrous cycle. During pregnancy, the glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fetus. The speculated presence of an endometrial microbiota
has been argued against.

==Structure==


The endometrium consists of a single layer of columnar epithelium plus the stroma on which it rests. The stroma is a layer of connective tissue that varies in thickness according to hormonal influences. In the uterus, simple tubular glands reach from the endometrial surface through to the base of the stroma, which also carries a rich blood supply provided by the spiral arteries. In women of reproductive age, two layers of endometrium can be distinguished. These two layers occur only in the endometrium lining the cavity of the uterus, and not in the lining of the fallopian tubes where a potentially life-threatening ectopic pregnancy may occur nearby.

* The &quot;functional layer&quot; is adjacent to the uterine cavity. This layer is built up after the end of menstruation during the first part of the previous menstrual cycle. Proliferation is induced by estrogen (follicular phase of menstrual cycle), and later changes in this layer are engendered by progesterone from the corpus luteum (luteal phase). It is adapted to provide an optimum environment for the implantation and growth of the embryo. This layer is completely shed during menstruation.
* The &quot;basal layer&quot;, adjacent to the myometrium and below the functional layer, is not shed at any time during the menstrual cycle. It contains stem cells that regenerate the functional layer, which develops on top of it.
In the absence of progesterone, the arteries supplying blood to the functional layer constrict, so that cells in that layer become ischaemic and die, leading to menstruation.

It is possible to identify the phase of the menstrual cycle by reference to either the ovarian cycle or the uterine cycle by observing microscopic differences at each phase—for example in the ovarian cycle:

===Gene and protein expression===
About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and some 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal endometrium. Just over 100 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the endometrium with only a handful genes being highly endometrium specific. The corresponding specific proteins are expressed in the glandular and stromal cells of the endometrial mucosa. The expression of many of these proteins vary depending on the menstrual cycle, for example the progesterone receptor and thyrotropin-releasing hormone both expressed in the proliferative phase, and PAEP expressed in the secretory phase. Other proteins such as the HOX11 protein that is required for female fertility, is expressed in endometrial stroma cells throughout the menstrual cycle. Certain specific proteins such as the estrogen receptor are also expressed in other types of female tissue types, such as the cervix, fallopian tubes, ovaries and breast.

===Microbiome speculation===
The uterus and endometrium was for a long time thought to be sterile. The cervical plug of mucosa was seen to prevent the entry of any microorganisms ascending from the vagina. In the 1980s this view was challenged when it was shown that uterine infections could arise from weaknesses in the barrier of the cervical plug. Organisms from the vaginal microbiota could enter the uterus during uterine contractions in the menstrual cycle. Further studies sought to identify microbiota specific to the uterus which would be of help in identifying cases of unsuccessful IVF and miscarriages. Their findings were seen to be unreliable due to the possibility of cross-contamination in the sampling procedures used. The well-documented presence of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species, for example, was easily explained by an increase in the vaginal population being able to seep into the cervical mucous. Another study highlighted the flaws of the earlier studies including cross-contamination. It was also argued that the evidence from studies using germ-free offspring of axenic animals (germ-free) clearly showed the sterility of the uterus. The authors concluded that in light of these findings there was no existence of a microbiome.

The normal dominance of Lactobacilli in the vagina is seen as a marker for vaginal health. However, in the uterus this much lower population is seen as invasive in a closed environment that is highly regulated by female sex hormones, and that could have unwanted consequences. In studies of endometriosis &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; is not the dominant type and there are higher levels of &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species. Half of the cases of bacterial vaginitis showed a polymicrobial biofilm attached to the endometrium.

==Function==
The endometrium is the innermost lining layer of the uterus, and functions to prevent adhesions between the opposed walls of the myometrium, thereby maintaining the patency of the uterine cavity. During the menstrual cycle or estrous cycle, the endometrium grows to a thick, blood vessel-rich, glandular tissue layer. This represents an optimal environment for the implantation of a blastocyst upon its arrival in the uterus. The endometrium is central, echogenic (detectable using ultrasound scanners), and has an average thickness of 6.7 mm.

During pregnancy, the glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fetus.

===Cycle===
The functional layer of the endometrial lining undergoes cyclic regeneration from stem cells in the basal layer. Humans, apes, and some other species display the menstrual cycle, whereas most other mammals are subject to an estrous cycle. In both cases, the endometrium initially proliferates under the influence of estrogen. However, once ovulation occurs, the ovary (specifically the corpus luteum) will produce much larger amounts of progesterone. This changes the proliferative pattern of the endometrium to a secretory lining. Eventually, the secretory lining provides a hospitable environment for one or more blastocysts.

Upon fertilization, the egg may implant into the uterine wall and provide feedback to the body with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG provides continued feedback throughout pregnancy by maintaining the corpus luteum, which will continue its role of releasing progesterone and estrogen. In case of implantation, the endometrial lining remains as &quot;decidua&quot;. The decidua becomes part of the placenta; it provides support and protection for the gestation.

Without implantation of a fertilized egg, the endometrial lining is either reabsorbed (estrous cycle) or shed (menstrual cycle). In the latter case, the process of shedding involves the breaking down of the lining, the tearing of small connective blood vessels, and the loss of the tissue and blood that had constituted it through the vagina. The entire process occurs over a period of several days. Menstruation may be accompanied by a series of uterine contractions; these help expel the menstrual endometrium.

If there is inadequate stimulation of the lining, due to lack of hormones, the endometrium remains thin and inactive. In humans, this will result in amenorrhea, or the absence of a menstrual period. After menopause, the lining is often described as being atrophic. In contrast, endometrium that is chronically exposed to estrogens, but not to progesterone, may become hyperplastic. Long-term use of oral contraceptives with highly potent progestins can also induce endometrial atrophy.

In humans, the cycle of building and shedding the endometrial lining lasts an average of 28 days. The endometrium develops at different rates in different mammals. Various factors including the seasons, climate, and stress can affect its development. The endometrium itself produces certain hormones at different stages of the cycle and this affects other parts of the reproductive system.

==Diseases related with endometrium==
Chorionic tissue can result in marked endometrial changes, known as an Arias-Stella reaction, that have an appearance similar to cancer. Historically, this change was diagnosed as endometrial cancer and it is important only in so far as it should not be misdiagnosed as cancer.

* Adenomyosis is the growth of the endometrium into the muscle layer of the uterus (the myometrium).
* Endometriosis is the growth of tissue similar to the endometrium, outside the uterus.
* Endometrial hyperplasia
* Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the human female genital tract.
* Asherman&#x27;s syndrome, also known as intrauterine adhesions, occurs when the basal layer of the endometrium is damaged by instrumentation (e.g., D&amp;C) or infection (e.g., endometrial tuberculosis) resulting in endometrial sclerosis and adhesion formation partially or completely obliterating the uterine cavity.

Thin endometrium may be defined as an endometrial thickness of less than 8 mm. It usually occurs after menopause. Treatments that can improve endometrial thickness include Vitamin E, L-arginine and sildenafil citrate.

Gene expression profiling using cDNA microarray can be used for the diagnosis of endometrial disorders.
The European Menopause and Andropause Society (EMAS) released Guidelines with detailed information to assess the endometrium.

===Embryo transfer===
An endometrial thickness (EMT) of less than 7 mm decreases the pregnancy rate in in vitro fertilization by an odds ratio of approximately 0.4 compared to an EMT of over 7 mm. However, such low thickness rarely occurs, and any routine use of this parameter is regarded as not justified. The optimal endometrial thickness is 10mm. Nevertheless, in human a perfect synchrony is not necessary; if the endometrium is not ready to receive the embryo an ectopic pregnancy may occur. This consist of the implantation of the blast outside the uterus, which can be extremely dangerous.

Observation of the endometrium by transvaginal ultrasonography is used when administering fertility medication, such as in in vitro fertilization. At the time of embryo transfer, it is favorable to have an endometrium of a thickness of between 7 and 14 mm with a &quot;triple-line&quot; configuration, which means that the endometrium contains a hyperechoic (usually displayed as light) line in the middle surrounded by two more hypoechoic (darker) lines. A &quot;triple-line&quot; endometrium reflects the separation of the basal layer and the functional layer, and is also observed in the periovulatory period secondary to rising estradiol levels, and disappears after ovulation.

Endometrial thickness is also associated with live births in IVF. The live birth rate in a normal endometrium is halved when the thickness is &lt;5mm.

==Endometrial protection==
Estrogens stimulate endometrial proliferation and carcinogenesis. Conversely, progestogens inhibit endometrial proliferation and carcinogenesis caused by estrogens and stimulate differentiation of the endometrium into decidua, which is termed endometrial transformation or decidualization. This is mediated by the progestogenic and functional antiestrogenic effects of progestogens in this tissue. These effects of progestogens and their protection against endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer caused by estrogens is referred to as &quot;endometrial protection&quot;.

==Endometrial receptivity==

Endometrial receptivity is a crucial factor in achieving successful embryo implantation in assisted reproduction treatments. It refers to the ability of the endometrium to accept an embryo during a specific time window, known as the &quot;implantation window.&quot; The synchronization between endometrial development and the embryo is essential to ensure a successful pregnancy.

Currently, there are three main tests that help evaluate endometrial receptivity and optimize fertility treatments:

ERA (Endometrial Receptivity Analysis): 

This genetic test analyzes the expression of specific genes in the endometrium to identify whether it is in a receptive, pre-receptive or post-receptive phase, allowing the ideal moment for embryo transfer to be personalized.

EMMA (Endometrial Microbiome Metagenomic Analysis) and ALICE (Analysis of Infectious Chronic Endometritis): 

Perform a test on the intrauterine microflora, using a small sample of the endometrium, in order to determine the presence of microorganisms that may promote or harm embryo implantation.

<doc id="9510" wikidata="Q9778" url="?curid=9510" title="Electronic music">
<text>Electronic music broadly is a group of music genres that employ electronic musical instruments, circuitry-based music technology and software, or general-purpose electronics (such as personal computers) in its creation. It includes both music made using electronic and electromechanical means (electroacoustic music). Pure electronic instruments depend entirely on circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an electronic oscillator, theremin, or synthesizer: no acoustic waves need to be previously generated by mechanical means and then converted into electrical signals. On the other hand, electromechanical instruments have mechanical parts such as strings or hammers that generate the sound waves, together with electric elements including magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers that convert the acoustic waves into electrical signals, process them and convert them back into sound waves that travel through the air to our ears. Such electromechanical devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano and electric guitar.

The first electronic musical devices were developed at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, some electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions featuring them were written. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s in Egypt and France. Musique concrète, created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953 by Karlheinz Stockhausen. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s and algorithmic composition with computers was first demonstrated in the same decade.

During the 1960s, digital computer music was pioneered, innovation in live electronics took place, and Japanese electronic musical instruments began to influence the music industry. In the early 1970s, Moog synthesizers and drum machines helped popularize synthesized electronic music. The 1970s also saw electronic music begin to have a significant influence on popular music, with the adoption of polyphonic synthesizers, electronic drums, drum machines, and turntables, through the emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, new wave, synth-pop, hip hop, and electronic dance music (EDM). In the early 1980s, mass-produced digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7 became popular, and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture. In Berlin starting in 1989, the Love Parade became the largest street party with over 1 million visitors, inspiring other such popular celebrations of electronic music.

Contemporary electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from experimental art music to popular forms such as electronic dance music. Pop electronic music is most recognizable in its 4/4 form and more connected with the mainstream than preceding forms which were popular in niche markets.

==Origins: late 19th century to early 20th century==

At the turn of the 20th century, experimentation with emerging electronics led to the first electronic musical instruments. These initial inventions were not sold, but were instead used in demonstrations and public performances. The audiences were presented with reproductions of existing music instead of new compositions for the instruments. While some were considered novelties and produced simple tones, the Telharmonium synthesized the sound of several orchestral instruments with reasonable precision. It achieved viable public interest and made commercial progress into streaming music through telephone networks.

Critics of musical conventions at the time saw promise in these developments. Ferruccio Busoni encouraged the composition of microtonal music allowed for by electronic instruments. He predicted the use of machines in future music, writing the influential &quot;Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music&quot; (1907). Futurists such as Francesco Balilla Pratella and Luigi Russolo began composing music with acoustic noise to evoke the sound of machinery. They predicted expansions in timbre allowed for by electronics in the influential manifesto &quot;The Art of Noises&quot; (1913).

=== Early compositions ===

Developments of the vacuum tube led to electronic instruments that were smaller, amplified, and more practical for performance. In particular, the theremin, ondes Martenot and trautonium were commercially produced by the early 1930s.

From the late 1920s, the increased practicality of electronic instruments influenced composers such as Joseph Schillinger and Maria Schuppel to adopt them. They were typically used within orchestras, and most composers wrote parts for the theremin that could otherwise be performed with string instruments.

Avant-garde composers criticized the predominant use of electronic instruments for conventional purposes. The instruments offered expansions in pitch resources that were exploited by advocates of microtonal music such as Charles Ives, Dimitrios Levidis, Olivier Messiaen and Edgard Varèse. Further, Percy Grainger used the theremin to abandon fixed tonation entirely, while Russian composers such as Gavriil Popov treated it as a source of noise in otherwise-acoustic noise music.

=== Recording experiments ===
Developments in early recording technology paralleled that of electronic instruments. The first means of recording and reproducing audio was invented in the late 19th century with the mechanical phonograph. Record players became a common household item, and by the 1920s composers were using them to play short recordings in performances.

The introduction of electrical recording in 1925 was followed by increased experimentation with record players. Paul Hindemith and Ernst Toch composed several pieces in 1930 by layering recordings of instruments and vocals at adjusted speeds. Influenced by these techniques, John Cage composed &quot;Imaginary Landscape No. 1&quot; in 1939 by adjusting the speeds of recorded tones.

Composers began to experiment with newly developed sound-on-film technology. Recordings could be spliced together to create sound collages, such as those by Tristan Tzara, Kurt Schwitters, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Walter Ruttmann and Dziga Vertov. Further, the technology allowed sound to be graphically created and modified. These techniques were used to compose soundtracks for several films in Germany and Russia, in addition to the popular &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; in the United States. Experiments with graphical sound were continued by Norman McLaren from the late 1930s.

==Development: 1940s to 1950s==
=== Electroacoustic tape music ===
The first practical audio tape recorder was unveiled in 1935. Improvements to the technology were made using the AC biasing technique, which significantly improved recording fidelity. As early as 1942, test recordings were being made in stereo. Although these developments were initially confined to Germany, recorders and tapes were brought to the United States following the end of World War II. These were the basis for the first commercially produced tape recorder in 1948.

In 1944, before the use of magnetic tape for compositional purposes, Egyptian composer Halim El-Dabh, while still a student in Cairo, used a cumbersome wire recorder to record sounds of an ancient &quot;zaar&quot; ceremony. Using facilities at the Middle East Radio studios El-Dabh processed the recorded material using reverberation, echo, voltage controls and re-recording. What resulted is believed to be the earliest tape music composition. The resulting work was entitled &quot;The Expression of Zaar&quot; and it was presented in 1944 at an art gallery event in Cairo. While his initial experiments in tape-based composition were not widely known outside of Egypt at the time, El-Dabh is also known for his later work in electronic music at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in the late 1950s.

=== Musique concrète ===

Following his work with Studio d&#x27;Essai at Radiodiffusion Française (RDF), during the early 1940s, Pierre Schaeffer is credited with originating the theory and practice of musique concrète. In the late 1940s, experiments in sound-based composition using shellac record players were first conducted by Schaeffer. In 1950, the techniques of musique concrete were expanded when magnetic tape machines were used to explore sound manipulation practices such as speed variation (pitch shift) and tape splicing.

On 5 October 1948, RDF broadcast Schaeffer&#x27;s &quot;Etude aux chemins de fer&quot;. This was the first &quot;movement&quot; of &quot;Cinq études de bruits&quot;, and marked the beginning of studio realizations and musique concrète (or acousmatic art). Schaeffer employed a disc cutting lathe, four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit. Not long after this, Pierre Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, Edgard Varèse, began work on &quot;Déserts&quot;, a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer&#x27;s studio and were later revised at Columbia University.

In 1950, Schaeffer gave the first public (non-broadcast) concert of musique concrète at the École Normale de Musique de Paris. &quot;Schaeffer used a PA system, several turntables, and mixers. The performance did not go well, as creating live montages with turntables had never been done before.&quot; Later that same year, Pierre Henry collaborated with Schaeffer on &quot;Symphonie pour un homme seul&quot; (1950) the first major work of musique concrete. In Paris in 1951, in what was to become an important worldwide trend, RTF established the first studio for the production of electronic music. Also in 1951, Schaeffer and Henry produced an opera, &quot;Orpheus&quot;, for concrete sounds and voices.

By 1951 the work of Schaeffer, composer-percussionist Pierre Henry, and sound engineer Jacques Poullin had received official recognition and The Groupe de Recherches de Musique Concrète, Club d &#x27;Essai de la Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française was established at RTF in Paris, the ancestor of the ORTF.

===Elektronische Musik, Germany===

Karlheinz Stockhausen worked briefly in Schaeffer&#x27;s studio in 1952, and afterward for many years at the WDR Cologne&#x27;s Studio for Electronic Music.

1954 saw the advent of what would now be considered authentic electric plus acoustic compositions—acoustic instrumentation augmented/accompanied by recordings of manipulated or electronically generated sound. Three major works were premiered that year: Varèse&#x27;s &quot;Déserts&quot;, for chamber ensemble and tape sounds, and two works by Otto Luening and Vladimir Ussachevsky: &quot;Rhapsodic Variations for the Louisville Symphony&quot; and &quot;A Poem in Cycles and Bells&quot;, both for orchestra and tape. Because he had been working at Schaeffer&#x27;s studio, the tape part for Varèse&#x27;s work contains much more concrete sounds than electronic. &quot;A group made up of wind instruments, percussion and piano alternate with the mutated sounds of factory noises and ship sirens and motors, coming from two loudspeakers.&quot;

At the German premiere of &quot;Déserts&quot; in Hamburg, which was conducted by Bruno Maderna, the tape controls were operated by Karlheinz Stockhausen. The title &quot;Déserts&quot; suggested to Varèse not only &quot;all physical deserts (of sand, sea, snow, of outer space, of empty streets), but also the deserts in the mind of man; not only those stripped aspects of nature that suggest bareness, aloofness, timelessness, but also that remote inner space no telescope can reach, where man is alone, a world of mystery and essential loneliness.&quot;

In Cologne, what would become the most famous electronic music studio in the world, was officially opened at the radio studios of the NWDR in 1953, though it had been in the planning stages as early as 1950 and early compositions were made and broadcast in 1951. The brainchild of Werner Meyer-Eppler, Robert Beyer, and Herbert Eimert (who became its first director), the studio was soon joined by Karlheinz Stockhausen and Gottfried Michael Koenig. In his 1949 thesis &quot;Elektronische Klangerzeugung: Elektronische Musik und Synthetische Sprache&quot;, Meyer-Eppler conceived the idea to synthesize music entirely from electronically produced signals; in this way, &quot;elektronische Musik&quot; was sharply differentiated from French &quot;musique concrète&quot;, which used sounds recorded from acoustical sources.

In 1953, Stockhausen composed his &quot;Studie I&quot;, followed in 1954 by &quot;Elektronische Studie II&quot;—the first electronic piece to be published as a score. In 1955, more experimental and electronic studios began to appear. Notable were the creation of the Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano, a studio at the NHK in Tokyo founded by Toshiro Mayuzumi, and the Philips studio at Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which moved to the University of Utrecht as the Institute of Sonology in 1960.

&quot;With Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel in residence, [Cologne] became a year-round hive of charismatic avant-gardism.&quot; on two occasions combining electronically generated sounds with relatively conventional orchestras—in &quot;Mixtur&quot; (1964) and &quot;Hymnen, dritte Region mit Orchester&quot; (1967). Stockhausen stated that his listeners had told him his electronic music gave them an experience of &quot;outer space&quot;, sensations of flying, or being in a &quot;fantastic dream world&quot;.

===United States===
In the United States, electronic music was being created as early as 1939, when John Cage published &quot;Imaginary Landscape, No. 1&quot;, using two variable-speed turntables, frequency recordings, muted piano, and cymbal, but no electronic means of production. Cage composed five more &quot;Imaginary Landscapes&quot; between 1942 and 1952 (one withdrawn), mostly for percussion ensemble, though No. 4 is for twelve radios and No. 5, written in 1952, uses 42 recordings and is to be realized as a magnetic tape. According to Otto Luening, Cage also performed &quot;Williams Mix&quot; at Donaueschingen in 1954, using eight loudspeakers, three years after his alleged collaboration. &quot;Williams Mix&quot; was a success at the Donaueschingen Festival, where it made a &quot;strong impression&quot;.

The Music for Magnetic Tape Project was formed by members of the New York School (John Cage, Earle Brown, Christian Wolff, David Tudor, and Morton Feldman), and lasted three years until 1954. Cage wrote of this collaboration: &quot;In this social darkness, therefore, the work of Earle Brown, Morton Feldman, and Christian Wolff continues to present a brilliant light, for the reason that at the several points of notation, performance, and audition, action is provocative.&quot;

Cage completed &quot;Williams Mix&quot; in 1953 while working with the Music for Magnetic Tape Project. The group had no permanent facility, and had to rely on borrowed time in commercial sound studios, including the studio of Bebe and Louis Barron.

===Columbia-Princeton Center===

In the same year Columbia University purchased its first tape recorder—a professional Ampex machine—to record concerts. Vladimir Ussachevsky, who was on the music faculty of Columbia University, was placed in charge of the device, and almost immediately began experimenting with it.

Herbert Russcol writes: &quot;Soon he was intrigued with the new sonorities he could achieve by recording musical instruments and then superimposing them on one another.&quot; Ussachevsky said later: &quot;I suddenly realized that the tape recorder could be treated as an instrument of sound transformation.&quot; On Thursday, 8 May 1952, Ussachevsky presented several demonstrations of tape music/effects that he created at his Composers Forum, in the McMillin Theatre at Columbia University. These included &quot;Transposition, Reverberation, Experiment, Composition&quot;, and &quot;Underwater Valse&quot;. In an interview, he stated: &quot;I presented a few examples of my discovery in a public concert in New York together with other compositions I had written for conventional instruments.&quot;
Otto Luening, who had attended this concert, remarked: &quot;The equipment at his disposal consisted of an Ampex tape recorder . . . and a simple box-like device designed by the brilliant young engineer, Peter Mauzey, to create feedback, a form of mechanical reverberation. Other equipment was borrowed or purchased with personal funds.&quot;

Just three months later, in August 1952, Ussachevsky traveled to Bennington, Vermont, at Luening&#x27;s invitation to present his experiments. There, the two collaborated on various pieces. Luening described the event: &quot;Equipped with earphones and a flute, I began developing my first tape-recorder composition. Both of us were fluent improvisors and the medium fired our imaginations.&quot; They played some early pieces informally at a party, where &quot;a number of composers almost solemnly congratulated us saying, &#x27;This is it&#x27; (&#x27;it&#x27; meaning the music of the future).&quot;

Word quickly reached New York City. Oliver Daniel telephoned and invited the pair to &quot;produce a group of short compositions for the October concert sponsored by the American Composers Alliance and Broadcast Music, Inc., under the direction of Leopold Stokowski at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. After some hesitation, we agreed. . . . Henry Cowell placed his home and studio in Woodstock, New York, at our disposal. With the borrowed equipment in the back of Ussachevsky&#x27;s car, we left Bennington for Woodstock and stayed two weeks. . . . In late September 1952, the travelling laboratory reached Ussachevsky&#x27;s living room in New York, where we eventually completed the compositions.&quot;

Two months later, on 28 October, Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening presented the first Tape Music concert in the United States. The concert included Luening&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy in Space&quot; (1952)—&quot;an impressionistic virtuoso piece&quot; using manipulated recordings of flute—and &quot;Low Speed&quot; (1952), an &quot;exotic composition that took the flute far below its natural range.&quot; Both pieces were created at the home of Henry Cowell in Woodstock, New York. After several concerts caused a sensation in New York City, Ussachevsky and Luening were invited onto a live broadcast of NBC&#x27;s Today Show to do an interview demonstration—the first televised electroacoustic performance. Luening described the event: &quot;I improvised some [flute] sequences for the tape recorder. Ussachevsky then and there put them through electronic transformations.&quot;

The score for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, by Louis and Bebe Barron, was entirely composed using custom-built electronic circuits and tape recorders in 1956 (but no synthesizers in the modern sense of the word).

=== USSR ===

In 1929, Nikolai Obukhov invented the &quot;sounding cross&quot; (la croix sonore), comparable to the principle of the theremin. In the 1930s, Nikolai Ananyev invented &quot;sonar&quot;, and engineer Alexander Gurov — neoviolena, I. Ilsarov — ilston., and A. Ivanov — . Composer and inventor Arseny Avraamov was engaged in scientific work on sound synthesis and conducted a number of experiments that would later form the basis of Soviet electro-musical instruments.

In 1956 Vyacheslav Mescherin created the , which used theremins, electric harps, electric organs, the first synthesizer in the USSR &quot;Ekvodin&quot;, and also created the first Soviet reverb machine. The style in which Meshcherin&#x27;s ensemble played is known as &quot;Space age pop&quot;. In 1957, engineer Igor Simonov assembled a working model of a noise recorder (electroeoliphone), with the help of which it was possible to extract various timbres and consonances of a noise nature. In 1958, Evgeny Murzin designed ANS synthesizer, one of the world&#x27;s first polyphonic musical synthesizers.

Founded by Murzin in 1966, the Moscow Experimental Electronic Music Studio became the base for a new generation of experimenters – Eduard Artemyev, , Sándor Kallós, Sofia Gubaidulina, Alfred Schnittke, and Vladimir Martynov. By the end of the 1960s, musical groups playing light electronic music appeared in the USSR. At the state level, this music began to be used to attract foreign tourists to the country and for broadcasting to foreign countries. In the mid-1970s, composer Alexander Zatsepin designed an &quot;orchestrolla&quot; – a modification of the mellotron.

The Baltic Soviet Republics also had their own pioneers: in Estonian SSR — Sven Grunberg, in Lithuanian SSR — Gedrus Kupriavicius, in Latvian SSR — Opus and Zodiac.

===Australia===
The world&#x27;s first computer to play music was CSIRAC, which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the Colonel Bogey March, of which no known recordings exist, only the accurate reconstruction. However, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice. CSIRAC was never recorded, but the music played was accurately reconstructed. The oldest known recordings of computer-generated music were played by the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, a commercial version of the Baby Machine from the University of Manchester in the autumn of 1951. The music program was written by Christopher Strachey.

===Japan===

Among the earliest group of electric musical instruments in Japan was the Yamaha Magna Organ, an electroacoustic instrument built in 1935. After World War II, Japanese composers such as Minao Shibata began to learn of the development of electronic musical instruments in other countries. By the late 1940s, Japanese composers began experimenting with electronic music, and institutional sponsorship enabled them to experiment with advanced equipment. Their infusion of Asian music into the emerging genre would eventually support Japan&#x27;s popularity in the development of music technology several decades later.

Following the foundation of electronics company Sony in 1946, composers Toru Takemitsu and Minao Shibata independently explored possible uses for electronic technology to produce music. Takemitsu had ideas similar to musique concrète, which he was unaware of, while Shibata foresaw the development of synthesizers and predicted a drastic change in music. Sony began producing popular magnetic tape recorders for government and public use.

The avant-garde collective Jikken Kōbō (Experimental Workshop), founded in 1950, was offered access to emerging audio technology by Sony. The company hired Toru Takemitsu to demonstrate their tape recorders with compositions and performances of electronic tape music. The first electronic tape pieces by the group were &quot;Toraware no Onna&quot; (&quot;Imprisoned Woman&quot;) and &quot;Piece B&quot;, composed in 1951 by Kuniharu Akiyama. Many of the electroacoustic tape pieces they produced were used as incidental music for radio, film, and theatre. They also held concerts employing a slide show synchronized with a recorded soundtrack. Composers outside of the Jikken Kōbō, such as Yasushi Akutagawa, Saburo Tominaga, and Shirō Fukai, were also experimenting with radiophonic tape music between 1952 and 1953.

Musique concrète was introduced to Japan by Toshiro Mayuzumi, who was influenced by a Pierre Schaeffer concert. From 1952, he composed tape music pieces for a comedy film, a radio broadcast, and a radio drama. However, Schaeffer&#x27;s concept of &quot;sound object&quot; was not influential among Japanese composers, who were mainly interested in overcoming the restrictions of human performance. This led to several Japanese electroacoustic musicians making use of serialism and twelve-tone techniques, evident in Yoshirō Irino&#x27;s 1951 dodecaphonic piece &quot;Concerto da
Camera&quot;, in the organization of electronic sounds in Mayuzumi&#x27;s &quot;X, Y, Z for Musique Concrète&quot;, and later in Shibata&#x27;s electronic music by 1956.

Modelling the NWDR studio in Cologne, an NHK electronic music studio was established by Mayuzumi in Tokyo in 1954, which became one of the world&#x27;s leading electronic music facilities. The studio was equipped with technologies such as tone-generating and audio processing equipment, recording and radiophonic equipment, ondes Martenots, Monochords and Melochords, sine-wave oscillators, tape recorders, ring modulators, band-pass filters, and four- and eight-channel mixers. Musicians associated with the studio included Toshiro Mayuzumi, Minao Shibata, Joji Yuasa, Toshi Ichiyanagi, and Toru Takemitsu. The studio&#x27;s first electronic compositions were completed in 1955, including Mayuzumi&#x27;s five-minute pieces &quot;Studie I: Music for Sine Wave by Proportion of Prime Number&quot;, &quot;Music for Modulated Wave by Proportion of Prime Number&quot; and &quot;Invention for Square Wave and Sawtooth Wave&quot; produced using the studio&#x27;s various tone-generating capabilities, and Shibata&#x27;s 20-minute stereo piece &quot;Musique Concrète for Stereophonic Broadcast&quot;.

===Mid-to-late 1950s===

The impact of computers continued in 1956. Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson composed &quot;Illiac Suite&quot; for string quartet, the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using algorithmic composition. &quot;... Hiller postulated that a computer could be taught the rules of a particular style and then called on to compose accordingly.&quot; Later developments included the work of Max Mathews at Bell Laboratories, who developed the influential MUSIC I program in 1957, one of the first computer programs to play electronic music. Vocoder technology was also a major development in this early era. In 1956, Stockhausen composed &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot;, the first major work of the Cologne studio, based on a text from the &quot;Book of Daniel&quot;. An important technological development of that year was the invention of the Clavivox synthesizer by Raymond Scott with subassembly by Robert Moog.

In 1957, Kid Baltan (Dick Raaymakers) and Tom Dissevelt released their debut album, &quot;Song Of The Second Moon&quot;, recorded at the Philips studio in the Netherlands. The public remained interested in the new sounds being created around the world, as can be deduced by the inclusion of Varèse&#x27;s &quot;Poème électronique&quot;, which was played over four hundred loudspeakers at the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 Brussels World Fair. That same year, Mauricio Kagel, an Argentine composer, composed &quot;Transición II&quot;. The work was realized at the WDR studio in Cologne. Two musicians performed on the piano, one in the traditional manner, the other playing on the strings, frame, and case. Two other performers used tape to unite the presentation of live sounds with the future of prerecorded materials from later on and its past of recordings made earlier in the performance.

In 1958, Columbia-Princeton developed the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer, the first programmable synthesizer. Prominent composers such as Vladimir Ussachevsky, Otto Luening, Milton Babbitt, Charles Wuorinen, Halim El-Dabh, Bülent Arel and Mario Davidovsky used the RCA Synthesizer extensively in various compositions. One of the most influential composers associated with the early years of the studio was Egypt&#x27;s Halim El-Dabh who, after having developed the earliest known electronic tape music in 1944, became more famous for &quot;Leiyla and the Poet&quot;, a 1959 series of electronic compositions that stood out for its immersion and fusion of electronic and folk music, in contrast to the more mathematical approach used by serial composers of the time such as Babbitt. El-Dabh&#x27;s &quot;Leiyla and the Poet&quot;, released as part of the album &quot;Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center&quot; in 1961, would be cited as a strong influence by a number of musicians, ranging from Neil Rolnick, Charles Amirkhanian and Alice Shields to rock musicians Frank Zappa and The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band.

Following the emergence of differences within the GRMC (Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrète) Pierre Henry, Philippe Arthuys, and several of their colleagues, resigned in April 1958. Schaeffer created a new collective, called Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM) and set about recruiting new members including Luc Ferrari, Beatriz Ferreyra, François-Bernard Mâche, Iannis Xenakis, Bernard Parmegiani, and Mireille Chamass-Kyrou. Later arrivals included Ivo Malec, Philippe Carson, Romuald Vandelle, Edgardo Canton and François Bayle.

==Expansion: 1960s==
These were fertile years for electronic music—not just for academia, but for independent artists as synthesizer technology became more accessible. By this time, a strong community of composers and musicians working with new sounds and instruments was established and growing. 1960 witnessed the composition of Otto Luening&#x27;s &quot;Gargoyles&quot; for violin and tape as well as the premiere of Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Kontakte&quot; for electronic sounds, piano, and percussion. This piece existed in two versions—one for 4-channel tape, and the other for tape with human performers. &quot;In &quot;Kontakte&quot;, Stockhausen abandoned traditional musical form based on linear development and dramatic climax. This new approach, which he termed &#x27;moment form&#x27;, resembles the &#x27;cinematic splice&#x27; techniques in early twentieth-century film.&quot;

The theremin had been in use since the 1920s but it attained a degree of popular recognition through its use in science-fiction film soundtrack music in the 1950s (e.g., Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s classic score for &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;).

In the UK in this period, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop (established in 1958) came to prominence, thanks in large measure to their work on the BBC science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. One of the most influential British electronic artists in this period was Workshop staffer Delia Derbyshire, who is now famous for her 1963 electronic realisation of the iconic &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme, composed by Ron Grainer. Other composers of electronic music active in the UK included Ernest Berk (who established his first studio in 1955), Tristram Cary, Hugh Davies, Brian Dennis, George Newson, Daphne Oram and Peter Zinovieff.

During the time of the UNESCO fellowship for studies in electronic music (1958) Israeli composer Josef Tal went on a study tour in the US and Canada. He summarized his conclusions in two articles that he submitted to UNESCO. In 1961, he established the &quot;Centre for Electronic Music in Israel&quot; at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1962, Canadian composer Hugh Le Caine arrived in Jerusalem to install his &quot;Creative Tape Recorder&quot; in the centre. In the 1990s Tal conducted, together with Dr. Shlomo Markel, in cooperation with the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology and the Volkswagen Foundation, a research project (&#x27;Talmark&#x27;) aimed at the development of a novel musical notation system for electronic music.

Milton Babbitt composed his first electronic work using the synthesizer—his &quot;Composition for Synthesizer&quot; (1961)—which he created using the RCA synthesizer at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center.

Collaborations also occurred across oceans and continents. In 1961, American composer Vladimir Ussachevsky invited Edgar Varèse from France to the Columbia-Princeton Studio (CPEMC). Upon arrival, Varèse embarked upon a revision of his work &quot;Déserts&quot;. He was assisted by Mario Davidovsky and Bülent Arel.

The intense activity occurring at CPEMC and elsewhere inspired the establishment of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1963 by Morton Subotnick, with additional members Pauline Oliveros, Ramon Sender, Anthony Martin, and Terry Riley.

Later, the Center moved to Mills College, directed by Pauline Oliveros, and has since been renamed Center for Contemporary Music.

Pietro Grossi was an Italian pioneer of computer composition and tape music, who first experimented with electronic techniques in the early sixties. Grossi was a cellist and composer, born in Venice in 1917. He founded the S 2F M (Studio de Fonologia Musicale di Firenze) in 1963 to experiment with electronic sound and composition.

Simultaneously in San Francisco, composer Stan Shaff and equipment designer Doug McEachern, presented the first &quot;Audium&quot; concert at San Francisco State College (1962), followed by work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA, 1963), conceived of as in time, controlled movement of sound in space. Twelve speakers surrounded the audience, and four speakers were mounted on a rotating, mobile-like construction above. In an SFMOMA performance the following year (1964), the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; music critic Alfred Frankenstein commented, &quot;the possibilities of the space-sound continuum have seldom been so extensively explored&quot;. In 1967, the first Audium, a &quot;sound-space continuum&quot; opened, holding weekly performances through 1970. In 1975, enabled by seed money from the National Endowment for the Arts, a new Audium opened, designed floor to ceiling for spatial sound composition and performance. &quot;In contrast, there are composers who manipulated sound space by locating multiple speakers at various locations in a performance space and then switching or panning the sound between the sources. In this approach, the composition of spatial manipulation is dependent on the location of the speakers and usually exploits the acoustical properties of the enclosure. Examples include Varese&#x27;s &quot;Poeme Electronique&quot; (tape music performed in the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 World Fair, Brussels) and Stan Schaff&#x27;s &quot;Audium&quot; installation, currently active in San Francisco.&quot; Through weekly programs (over 4,500 in 40 years), Shaff &quot;sculpts&quot; sound, performing now-digitized spatial works live through 176 speakers.

Jean-Jacques Perrey experimented with Pierre Schaeffer&#x27;s techniques on tape loops and was among the first to use the recently released Moog synthesizer developed by Robert Moog. With this instrument he composed some works with Gershon Kingsley and solo. A well-known example of the use of Moog&#x27;s full-sized Moog modular synthesizer is the 1968 &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; album by Wendy Carlos, which triggered a craze for synthesizer music. In 1969 David Tudor brought a Moog modular synthesizer and Ampex tape machines to the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad with the support of the Sarabhai family, forming the foundation of India&#x27;s first electronic music studio. Here a group of composers Jinraj Joshipura, Gita Sarabhai, SC Sharma, IS Mathur and Atul Desai developed experimental sound compositions between 1969 and 1973.

===Computer music===

Musical melodies were first generated by the computer CSIRAC in Australia in 1950. There were newspaper reports from America and England (early and recently) that computers may have played music earlier, but thorough research has debunked these stories as there is no evidence to support the newspaper reports (some of which were obviously speculative). Research has shown that people &quot;speculated&quot; about computers playing music, possibly because computers would make noises, but there is no evidence that they actually did it.

The world&#x27;s first computer to play music was CSIRAC, which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard in the 1950s. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; of which no known recordings exist.
However, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice which is current computer-music practice.

The first music to be performed in England was a performance of the British National Anthem that was programmed by Christopher Strachey on the Ferranti Mark I, late in 1951. Later that year, short extracts of three pieces were recorded there by a BBC outside broadcasting unit: the National Anthem, &quot;Ba, Ba Black Sheep&quot;, and &quot;In the Mood&quot; and this is recognised as the earliest recording of a computer to play music. This recording can be heard at this Manchester University site. Researchers at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch declicked and restored this recording in 2016 and the results may be heard on SoundCloud.

The late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s also saw the development of large mainframe computer synthesis. Starting in 1957, Max Mathews of Bell Labs developed the MUSIC programs, culminating in MUSIC V, a direct digital synthesis language. Laurie Spiegel developed the algorithmic musical composition software &quot;Music Mouse&quot; (1986) for Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari computers.

===Stochastic music===

An important new development was the advent of computers to compose music, as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds. Iannis Xenakis began what is called &quot;musique stochastique&quot;, or &quot;stochastic music&quot;, which is a composing method that uses mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used computers to compose pieces like &quot;ST/4&quot; for string quartet and &quot;ST/48&quot; for orchestra (both 1962), &quot;Morsima-Amorsima&quot;, &quot;ST/10&quot;, and &quot;Atrées&quot;. He developed the computer system UPIC for translating graphical images into musical results and composed &quot;Mycènes Alpha&quot; (1978) with it.

===Live electronics===
In Europe in 1964, Karlheinz Stockhausen composed &quot;Mikrophonie I&quot; for tam-tam, hand-held microphones, filters, and potentiometers, and &quot;Mixtur&quot; for orchestra, four sine-wave generators, and four ring modulators. In 1965 he composed &quot;Mikrophonie II&quot; for choir, Hammond organ, and ring modulators.

In 1966–1967, Reed Ghazala discovered and began to teach &quot;circuit bending&quot;—the application of the creative short circuit, a process of chance short-circuiting, creating experimental electronic instruments, exploring sonic elements mainly of timbre and with less regard to pitch or rhythm, and influenced by John Cage&#x27;s aleatoric music concept.

Cosey Fanni Tutti&#x27;s performance art and musical career explored the concept of &#x27;acceptable&#x27; music and she went on to explore the use of sound as a means of desire or discomfort.

Wendy Carlos performed selections from her album &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; on stage with a synthesizer with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra; another live performance was with Kurzweil Baroque Ensemble for &quot;Bach at the Beacon&quot; in 1997. In June 2018, Suzanne Ciani released &quot;LIVE Quadraphonic&quot;, a live album documenting her first solo performance on a Buchla synthesizer in 40 years. It was one of the first quadraphonic vinyl releases in over 30 years.

===Japanese instruments===

In the 1950s, Japanese electronic musical instruments began influencing the international music industry. Ikutaro Kakehashi, who founded Ace Tone in 1960, developed his own version of electronic percussion that had been already popular on the overseas electronic organ. At the 1964 NAMM Show, he revealed it as the R-1 Rhythm Ace, a hand-operated percussion device that played electronic drum sounds manually as the user pushed buttons, in a similar fashion to modern electronic drum pads.
In 1963, Korg released the Donca-Matic DA-20, an electro-mechanical drum machine. In 1965, Nippon Columbia patented a fully electronic drum machine. Korg released the Donca-Matic DC-11 electronic drum machine in 1966, which they followed with the Korg Mini Pops, which was developed as an option for the Yamaha Electone electric organ. Korg&#x27;s Stageman and Mini Pops series were notable for &quot;natural metallic percussion&quot; sounds and incorporating controls for drum &quot;breaks and fill-ins.&quot;

In 1967, Ace Tone founder Ikutaro Kakehashi patented a preset rhythm-pattern generator using diode matrix circuit similar to the Seeburg&#x27;s prior filed in 1964 (See Drum machine#History), which he released as the FR-1 Rhythm Ace drum machine the same year. It offered 16 preset patterns, and four buttons to manually play each instrument sound (cymbal, claves, cowbell and bass drum). The rhythm patterns could also be cascaded together by pushing multiple rhythm buttons simultaneously, and the possible combination of rhythm patterns were more than a hundred. Ace Tone&#x27;s Rhythm Ace drum machines found their way into popular music from the late 1960s, followed by Korg drum machines in the 1970s. Kakehashi later left Ace Tone and founded Roland Corporation in 1972, with Roland synthesizers and drum machines becoming highly influential for the next several decades. The company would go on to have a big impact on popular music, and do more to shape popular electronic music than any other company.
Turntablism has origins in the invention of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspin or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables. It was succeeded by the Technics SL-1100 and SL-1200 in the early 1970s, and they were widely adopted by hip hop musicians, with the SL-1200 remaining the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for several decades.

===Jamaican dub music===

In Jamaica, a form of popular electronic music emerged in the 1960s, dub music, rooted in sound system culture. Dub music was pioneered by studio engineers, such as Sylvan Morris, King Tubby, Errol Thompson, Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, and Scientist, producing reggae-influenced experimental music with electronic sound technology, in recording studios and at sound system parties. Their experiments included forms of tape-based composition comparable to aspects of &quot;musique concrète&quot;, an emphasis on repetitive rhythmic structures (often stripped of their harmonic elements) comparable to minimalism, the electronic manipulation of spatiality, the sonic electronic manipulation of pre-recorded musical materials from mass media, deejays toasting over pre-recorded music comparable to live electronic music, remixing music, turntablism, and the mixing and scratching of vinyl.

Despite the limited electronic equipment available to dub pioneers such as King Tubby and Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, their experiments in remix culture were musically cutting-edge. King Tubby, for example, was a sound system proprietor and electronics technician, whose small front-room studio in the Waterhouse ghetto of western Kingston was a key site of dub music creation.

==Late 1960s to early 1980s==
===Rise of popular electronic music===
In the late 1960s, pop and rock musicians, including the Beach Boys and the Beatles, began to use electronic instruments, like the theremin and Mellotron, to supplement and define their sound. The first bands to utilize the Moog synthesizer would be the Doors on Strange Days as well as the Monkees on Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd. In his book &quot;Electronic and Experimental Music&quot;, Thom Holmes recognises the Beatles&#x27; 1966 recording &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; as the song that &quot;ushered in a new era in the use of electronic music in rock and pop music&quot; due to the band&#x27;s incorporation of tape loops and reversed and speed-manipulated tape sounds.

Also in the late 1960s, the music duos Silver Apples, Beaver and Krause, and experimental rock bands like White Noise, the United States of America, Fifty Foot Hose, and Gong are regarded as pioneers in the electronic rock and electronica genres for their work in melding psychedelic rock with oscillators and synthesizers. The 1969 instrumental &quot;Popcorn&quot; written by Gershon Kingsley for &quot;Music To Moog By&quot; became a worldwide success due to the 1972 version made by Hot Butter.

The Moog synthesizer was brought to the mainstream in 1968 by &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, a bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer by American composer Wendy Carlos. The album achieved critical and commercial success, winning the 1970 Grammy Awards for Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording.

In 1969, David Borden formed the world&#x27;s first synthesizer ensemble called the Mother Mallard&#x27;s Portable Masterpiece Company in Ithaca, New York.
By the end of the 1960s, the Moog synthesizer took a leading place in the sound of emerging progressive rock with bands including Pink Floyd, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, and Genesis making them part of their sound. Instrumental prog rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Cluster, Can, Neu!, and Faust to circumvent the language barrier. Their synthesiser-heavy &quot;krautrock&quot;, along with the work of Brian Eno (for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music), would be a major influence on subsequent electronic rock.

Ambient dub was pioneered by King Tubby and other Jamaican sound artists, using DJ-inspired ambient electronics, complete with drop-outs, echo, equalization and psychedelic electronic effects. It featured layering techniques and incorporated elements of world music, deep basslines and harmonic sounds. Techniques such as a long echo delay were also used. Other notable artists within the genre include Dreadzone, Higher Intelligence Agency, The Orb, Ott, Loop Guru, Woob and Transglobal Underground.

Dub music influenced electronic musical techniques later adopted by hip hop music when Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc in the early 1970s introduced Jamaica&#x27;s sound system culture and dub music techniques to America. One such technique that became popular in hip hop culture was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables in alternation, extending the b-dancers&#x27; favorite section. The turntable eventually went on to become the most visible electronic musical instrument, and occasionally the most virtuosic, in the 1980s and 1990s.

Electronic rock was also produced by several Japanese musicians, including Isao Tomita&#x27;s &quot;Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock&quot; (1972), which featured Moog synthesizer renditions of contemporary pop and rock songs, and Osamu Kitajima&#x27;s progressive rock album &quot;Benzaiten&quot; (1974). The mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art music musicians such as Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis, Tomita and Klaus Schulze who were significant influences on the development of new-age music. The &quot;hi-tech&quot; appeal of these works created for some years the trend of listing the electronic musical equipment employed in the album sleeves, as a distinctive feature. Electronic music began to enter regularly in radio programming and top-sellers charts, as the French band Space with their debut studio album &quot;Magic Fly&quot; or Jarre with &quot;Oxygène&quot;. Between 1977 and 1981, Kraftwerk released albums such as &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;, &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; and &quot;Computer World&quot;, which influenced subgenres of electronic music.

In this era, the sound of rock musicians like Mike Oldfield and The Alan Parsons Project (who is credited the first rock song to feature a digital vocoder in 1975, &quot;The Raven&quot;) used to be arranged and blended with electronic effects and/or music as well, which became much more prominent in the mid-1980s. Jeff Wayne achieved a long-lasting success with his 1978 electronic rock musical version of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.

Film scores also benefit from the electronic sound. During the 1970s and 1980s, Wendy Carlos composed the score for &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot; and &quot;Tron&quot;. In 1977, Gene Page recorded a disco version of the hit theme by John Williams from Steven Spielberg film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. Page&#x27;s version peaked on the R&amp;B chart at #30. The score of 1978 film &quot;Midnight Express&quot; composed by Italian synth-pioneer Giorgio Moroder won the Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1979, as did it again in 1981 the score by Vangelis for &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. After the arrival of punk rock, a form of basic electronic rock emerged, increasingly using new digital technology to replace other instruments. The American duo Suicide, who arose from the punk scene in New York, utilized drum machines and synthesizers in a hybrid between electronics and punk on their eponymous 1977 album.

Synth-pop pioneering bands which enjoyed success for years included Ultravox with their 1977 track &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot; on &quot;Ha!-Ha!-Ha!&quot;, Yellow Magic Orchestra with their self-titled album (1978), The Buggles with their prominent 1979 debut single &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, Gary Numan with his solo debut album &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; and single &quot;Cars&quot; in 1979, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark with their 1979 single &quot;Electricity&quot; featured on their eponymous debut album, Depeche Mode with their first single &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot; recorded in 1980 and released in 1981 album &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;, A Flock of Seagulls with their 1981 single &quot;Talking&quot;, New Order with &quot;Ceremony&quot; in 1981, and The Human League with their 1981 hit &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; from their third album &quot;Dare&quot;.
The definition of MIDI and the development of digital audio made the development of purely electronic sounds much easier, with audio engineers, producers and composers exploring frequently the possibilities of virtually every new model of electronic sound equipment launched by manufacturers. Synth-pop sometimes used synthesizers to replace all other instruments, but it was more common that bands had one or more keyboardists in their line-ups along with guitarists, bassists, and/or drummers. These developments led to the growth of synth-pop, which after it was adopted by the New Romantic movement, allowed synthesizers to dominate the pop and rock music of the early 1980s until the style began to fall from popularity in the mid-to-end of the decade. Along with the aforementioned successful pioneers, key acts included Yazoo, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, Culture Club, Talk Talk, Japan, and Eurythmics.

Synth-pop was taken up across the world, with international hits for acts including Men Without Hats, Trans-X and Lime from Canada, Telex from Belgium, Peter Schilling, Sandra, Modern Talking, Propaganda and Alphaville from Germany, Yello from Switzerland and Azul y Negro from Spain. Also, the synth sound is a key feature of Italo-disco.

Some synth-pop bands created futuristic visual styles of themselves to reinforce the idea of electronic sounds were linked primarily with technology, as Americans Devo and Spaniards Aviador Dro.

Keyboard synthesizers became so common that even heavy metal rock bands, a genre often regarded as the &quot;opposite&quot; in aesthetics, sound and lifestyle from that of electronic pop artists by fans of both sides, achieved worldwide success with themes as 1983 &quot;Jump&quot; by Van Halen and 1986 &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; by Europe, which feature synths prominently.

===Proliferation of electronic music research institutions===
 (EMS), formerly known as Electroacoustic Music in Sweden, is the Swedish national centre for electronic music and sound art. The research organisation started in 1964 and is based in Stockholm.
STEIM (1969-2021) was a center for research and development of new musical instruments in the electronic performing arts, located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It was founded by Misha Mengelberg, Louis Andriessen, Peter Schat, Dick Raaymakers, , Reinbert de Leeuw, and Konrad Boehmer. This group of Dutch composers had fought for the reformation of Amsterdam&#x27;s feudal music structures; they insisted on Bruno Maderna&#x27;s appointment as musical director of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and enforced the first public fundings for experimental and improvised electronic music in the Netherlands. From 1981-2008, Michel Waisvisz was artistic director, and his live-electronic instruments like the Cracklebox or The Hands inspired international artists to work at STEIM which entertained a residency program since 1992.

IRCAM in Paris became a major center for computer music research and realization and development of the Sogitec 4X computer system, featuring then revolutionary real-time digital signal processing. Pierre Boulez&#x27;s &quot;Répons&quot; (1981) for 24 musicians and 6 soloists used the 4X to transform and route soloists to a loudspeaker system.

Barry Vercoe describes one of his experiences with early computer sounds:

===Keyboard synthesizers===
Released in 1970 by Moog Music, the Mini-Moog was among the first widely available, portable, and relatively affordable synthesizers. It became once the most widely used synthesizer at that time in both popular and electronic art music.
Patrick Gleeson, playing live with Herbie Hancock at the beginning of the 1970s, pioneered the use of synthesizers in a touring context, where they were subject to stresses the early machines were not designed for.

In 1974, the WDR studio in Cologne acquired an EMS Synthi 100 synthesizer, which many composers used to produce notable electronic works—including Rolf Gehlhaar&#x27;s &quot;Fünf deutsche Tänze&quot; (1975), Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Sirius&quot; (1975–1976), and John McGuire&#x27;s &quot;Pulse Music III&quot; (1978).

Thanks to miniaturization of electronics in the 1970s, by the start of the 1980s keyboard synthesizers, became lighter and affordable, integrating into a single slim unit all the necessary audio synthesis electronics and the piano-style keyboard itself, in sharp contrast with the bulky machinery and &quot;cable spaguetty&quot; employed along with the 1960s and 1970s. First, with analog synthesizers, the trend followed with digital synthesizers and samplers as well (see below).

===Digital synthesizers===

In 1975, the Japanese company Yamaha licensed the algorithms for frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis) from John Chowning, who had experimented with it at Stanford University since 1971. Yamaha&#x27;s engineers began adapting Chowning&#x27;s algorithm for use in a digital synthesizer, adding improvements such as the &quot;key scaling&quot; method to avoid the introduction of distortion that normally occurred in analog systems during frequency modulation.

In 1980, Yamaha eventually released the first FM digital synthesizer, the Yamaha GS-1, but at an expensive price. In 1983, Yamaha introduced the first stand-alone digital synthesizer, the DX7, which also used FM synthesis and would become one of the best-selling synthesizers of all time. The DX7 was known for its recognizable bright tonalities that was partly due to an overachieving sampling rate of 57 kHz.
The Korg Poly-800 is a synthesizer released by Korg in 1983. Its initial list price of $795 made it the first fully programmable synthesizer that sold for less than $1000. It had 8-voice polyphony with one Digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) per voice.

The Casio CZ-101 was the first and best-selling phase distortion synthesizer in the Casio CZ line. Released in November 1984, it was one of the first (if not the first) fully programmable polyphonic synthesizers that was available for under $500.

The Roland D-50 is a digital synthesizer produced by Roland and released in April 1987. Its features include subtractive synthesis, on-board effects, a joystick for data manipulation, and an analogue synthesis-styled layout design. The external Roland PG-1000 (1987–1990) programmer could also be attached to the D-50 for more complex manipulation of its sounds.

===Samplers===

A sampler is an electronic or digital musical instrument which uses sound recordings (or &quot;samples&quot;) of real instrument sounds (e.g., a piano, violin or trumpet), excerpts from recorded songs (e.g., a five-second bass guitar riff from a funk song) or found sounds (e.g., sirens and ocean waves). The samples are loaded or recorded by the user or by a manufacturer. These sounds are then played back using the sampler program itself, a MIDI keyboard, sequencer or another triggering device (e.g., electronic drums) to perform or compose music. Because these samples are usually stored in digital memory, the information can be quickly accessed. A single sample may often be pitch-shifted to different pitches to produce musical scales and chords.
Before computer memory-based samplers, musicians used tape replay keyboards, which store recordings on analog tape. When a key is pressed the tape head contacts the moving tape and plays a sound. The Mellotron was the most notable model, used by many groups in the late 1960s and the 1970s, but such systems were expensive and heavy due to the multiple tape mechanisms involved, and the range of the instrument was limited to three octaves at the most. To change sounds a new set of tapes had to be installed in the instrument. The emergence of the digital sampler made sampling far more practical.

The earliest digital sampling was done on the EMS Musys system, developed by Peter Grogono (software), David Cockerell (hardware and interfacing), and Peter Zinovieff (system design and operation) at their London (Putney) Studio c. 1969.

The first commercially available sampling synthesizer was the Computer Music Melodian by Harry Mendell (1976).

First released in 1977–1978, the Synclavier I using FM synthesis, re-licensed from Yamaha, and sold mostly to universities, proved to be highly influential among both electronic music composers and music producers, including Mike Thorne, an early adopter from the commercial world, due to its versatility, its cutting-edge technology, and distinctive sounds.

The first polyphonic digital sampling synthesizer was the Australian-produced Fairlight CMI, first available in 1979. These early sampling synthesizers used wavetable sample-based synthesis.

===Birth of MIDI===

In 1980, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface that new instruments could use to communicate control instructions with other instruments and computers. This standard was dubbed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and resulted from a collaboration between leading manufacturers, initially Sequential Circuits, Oberheim, Roland—and later, other participants that included Yamaha, Korg, and Kawai. A paper was authored by Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits and proposed to the Audio Engineering Society in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.

MIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.

MIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals. Acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via sampling and sampled-ROM-based instruments.

Miller Puckette developed graphic signal-processing software for 4X called Max (after Max Mathews) and later ported it to Macintosh (with Dave Zicarelli extending it for Opcode) for real-time MIDI control, bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background.

===Sequencers and drum machines===
The early 1980s saw the rise of bass synthesizers, the most influential being the Roland TB-303, a bass synthesizer and sequencer released in late 1981 that later became a fixture in electronic dance music, particularly acid house. One of the first to use it was Charanjit Singh in 1982, though it would not be popularized until Phuture&#x27;s &quot;Acid Tracks&quot; in 1987. Music sequencers began being used around the mid 20th century, and Tomita&#x27;s albums in mid-1970s being later examples. In 1978, Yellow Magic Orchestra were using computer-based technology in conjunction with a synthesiser to produce popular music, making their early use of the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer sequencer.

Drum machines, also known as rhythm machines, also began being used around the late-1950s, with a later example being Osamu Kitajima&#x27;s progressive rock album &quot;Benzaiten&quot; (1974), which used a rhythm machine along with electronic drums and a synthesizer. In 1977, Ultravox&#x27;s &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot; was one of the first singles to use the metronome-like percussion of a Roland TR-77 drum machine. In 1980, Roland Corporation released the TR-808, one of the first and most popular programmable drum machines. The first band to use it was Yellow Magic Orchestra in 1980, and it would later gain widespread popularity with the release of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; and Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot; in 1982. The TR-808 was a fundamental tool in the later Detroit techno scene of the late 1980s, and was the drum machine of choice for Derrick May and Juan Atkins.

===Chiptunes===
The characteristic lo-fi sound of chip music was initially the result of early computer&#x27;s sound chips and sound cards&#x27; technical limitations; however, the sound has since become sought after in its own right.

Common cheap popular sound chips of the first home computers of the 1980s include the SID of the Commodore 64 and General Instrument AY series and clones (like the Yamaha YM2149) used in the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX compatibles and Atari ST models, among others.

==Late 1980s to 1990s==
=== Rise of dance music ===

Synth-pop continued into the late 1980s, with a format that moved closer to dance music, including the work of acts such as British duos Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and The Communards, achieving success along much of the 1990s.

The trend has continued to the present day with modern nightclubs worldwide regularly playing electronic dance music (EDM). Today, electronic dance music has radio stations, websites, and publications like &quot;Mixmag&quot; dedicated solely to the genre. Despite the industry&#x27;s attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including dance-pop, house, techno, electro, and trance, as well as their respective subgenres. Moreover, the genre has found commercial and cultural significance in the United States and North America, thanks to the wildly popular big room house/EDM sound that has been incorporated into the U.S. pop music and the rise of large-scale commercial raves such as Electric Daisy Carnival, Tomorrowland and Ultra Music Festival.

===Electronica===
On the other hand, a broad group of electronic-based music styles intended for listening rather than strictly for dancing became known under the &quot;electronica&quot; umbrella which was also a music scene in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom. According to a 1997 &quot;Billboard&quot; article, &quot;the union of the club community and independent labels&quot; provided the experimental and trend-setting environment in which electronica acts developed and eventually reached the mainstream, citing American labels such as Astralwerks (the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, the Future Sound of London, Fluke), Moonshine (DJ Keoki), Sims, Daft Punk and City of Angels (the Crystal Method) for popularizing the latest version of electronic music.

===Indie electronic===

The category &quot;indie electronic&quot; (or &quot;indietronica&quot;) has been used to refer to a wave of groups with roots in independent rock who embraced electronic elements (such as synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, and computer programs) and influences such as early electronic composition, krautrock, synth-pop, and dance music. Recordings are commonly made on laptops using digital audio workstations.

The first wave of indie electronic artists began in the 1990s with acts such as Stereolab (who used vintage gear) and Disco Inferno (who embraced modern sampling technology), and the genre expanded in the 2000s as home recording and software synthesizers came into common use. Other acts included Broadcast, Lali Puna, Múm, the Postal Service, Skeletons, and School of Seven Bells. Independent labels associated with the style include Warp, Morr Music, Sub Pop, and Ghostly International.

==2000s and 2010s==

As computer technology has become more accessible and music software has advanced, interacting with music production technology is now possible using means that bear no relationship to traditional musical performance practices: for instance, laptop performance (&quot;laptronica&quot;), live coding and Algorave. In general, the term Live PA refers to any live performance of electronic music, whether with laptops, synthesizers, or other devices.

Beginning around the year 2000, some software-based virtual studio environments emerged, with products such as Propellerhead&#x27;s Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal. Such tools provide viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, it is now possible to create high-quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. Such advances have democratized music creation, leading to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the internet. Software-based instruments and effect units (so-called &quot;plugins&quot;) can be incorporated in a computer-based studio using the VST platform. Some of these instruments are more or less exact replicas of existing hardware (such as the Roland D-50, ARP Odyssey, Yamaha DX7, or Korg M1).

===Circuit bending===
Circuit bending is the modification of battery-powered toys and synthesizers to create new unintended sound effects. It was pioneered by Reed Ghazala in the 1960s and Reed coined the name &quot;circuit bending&quot; in 1992.

===Modular synth revival===
Following the circuit bending culture, musicians also began to build their own modular synthesizers, causing a renewed interest in the early 1960s designs. Eurorack became a popular system.
