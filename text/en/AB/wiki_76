<text>Deep Space 1 (DS1) was a NASA technology demonstration spacecraft which flew by an asteroid and a comet. It was part of the New Millennium Program, dedicated to testing advanced technologies.

Launched on 24 October 1998, the &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; spacecraft carried out a flyby of asteroid 9969 Braille, which was its primary science target. The mission was extended twice to include an encounter with comet 19P/Borrelly and further engineering testing. Problems during its initial stages and with its star tracker led to repeated changes in mission configuration. While the flyby of the asteroid was only a partial success, the encounter with the comet retrieved valuable information.

The Deep Space series was continued by the &quot;Deep Space 2&quot; probes, which were launched in January 1999 piggybacked on the Mars Polar Lander and were intended to strike the surface of Mars (though contact was lost and the mission failed). &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; was the first NASA spacecraft to use ion propulsion rather than the traditional chemical-powered rockets.

===Autonav===
The Autonav system, developed by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, takes images of known bright asteroids. The asteroids in the inner Solar System move in relation to other bodies at a noticeable, predictable speed. Thus a spacecraft can determine its relative position by tracking such asteroids across the star background, which appears fixed over such timescales. Two or more asteroids let the spacecraft triangulate its position; two or more positions in time let the spacecraft determine its trajectory. Existing spacecraft are tracked by their interactions with the transmitters of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN), in effect an inverse GPS. However, DSN tracking requires many skilled operators, and the DSN is overburdened by its use as a communications network. The use of Autonav reduces mission cost and DSN demands.

The Autonav system can also be used in reverse, tracking the position of bodies relative to the spacecraft. This is used to acquire targets for the scientific instruments. The spacecraft is programmed with the target&#x27;s coarse location. After initial acquisition, Autonav keeps the subject in frame, even commandeering the spacecraft&#x27;s attitude control. The next spacecraft to use Autonav was &quot;Deep Impact&quot;.

===SCARLET concentrating solar array===
Primary power for the mission was produced by a new solar array technology, the Solar Concentrator Array with Refractive Linear Element Technology (SCARLET), which uses linear Fresnel lenses made of silicone to concentrate sunlight onto solar cells. ABLE Engineering developed the concentrator technology and built the solar array for DS1, with Entech Inc, who supplied the Fresnel optics, and the NASA Glenn Research Center. The activity was sponsored by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, developed originally for the SSI - Conestoga 1620 payload, METEOR. The concentrating lens technology was combined with dual-junction solar cells, which had considerably better performance than the GaAs solar cells that were the state of the art at the time of the mission launch.

The SCARLET arrays generated 2.5 kilowatts at 1 AU, with less size and weight than conventional arrays.

===NSTAR ion engine===
Although ion engines had been developed at NASA since the late 1950s, with the exception of the SERT missions in the 1960s, the technology had not been demonstrated in flight on United States spacecraft, though hundreds of Hall-effect engines had been used on Soviet and Russian spacecraft. This lack of a performance history in space meant that despite the potential savings in propellant mass, the technology was considered too experimental to be used for high-cost missions. Furthermore, unforeseen side effects of ion propulsion might in some way interfere with typical scientific experiments, such as fields and particle measurements. Therefore, it was a primary mission of the &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; demonstration to show long-duration use of an ion thruster on a scientific mission.

The NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) electrostatic ion thruster, developed at NASA Glenn, achieves a specific impulse of 1000–3000 seconds. This is an order of magnitude higher than traditional space propulsion methods, resulting in a mass savings of approximately half. This leads to much cheaper launch vehicles. Although the engine produces just thrust at maximal power (2,100 W on DS1), the craft achieved high speeds because ion engines thrust continuously for long periods.

The next spacecraft to use NSTAR engines was &quot;Dawn&quot;, with three redundant units.

===Remote Agent===
Remote Agent (RAX), remote intelligent self-repair software developed at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was the first artificial-intelligence control system to control a spacecraft without human supervision. Remote Agent successfully demonstrated the ability to plan onboard activities and correctly diagnose and respond to simulated faults in spacecraft components through its built-in REPL environment. Autonomous control will enable future spacecraft to operate at greater distances from Earth and to carry out more sophisticated science-gathering activities in deep space. Components of the Remote Agent software have been used to support other NASA missions. Major components of Remote Agent were a robust planner (EUROPA), a plan-execution system (EXEC) and a model-based diagnostic system (Livingstone). EUROPA was used as a ground-based planner for the Mars Exploration Rovers. EUROPA II was used to support the &quot;Phoenix&quot; Mars lander and the Mars Science Laboratory. Livingstone2 was flown as an experiment aboard Earth Observing-1 and on an F/A-18 Hornet at NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center.

===Beacon Monitor===
Another method for reducing DSN burdens is the Beacon Monitor experiment. During the long cruise periods of the mission, spacecraft operations are essentially suspended. Instead of data, Deep Space 1 transmitted a carrier signal on a predetermined frequency. Without data decoding, the carrier could be detected by much simpler ground antennas and receivers. If DS1 detected an anomaly, it changed the carrier between four tones, based on urgency. Ground receivers then signal operators to divert DSN resources. This prevented skilled operators and expensive hardware from babysitting an unburdened mission operating nominally. A similar system was used on the &quot;New Horizons&quot; Pluto probe to keep costs down during its ten-year cruise from Jupiter to Pluto.

===SDST===

The Small Deep Space Transponder (SDST) is a compact and lightweight radio-communications system. Aside from using miniaturized components, the SDST is capable of communicating over the Ka band. Because this band is higher in frequency than bands currently in use by deep-space missions, the same amount of data can be sent by smaller equipment in space and on the ground. Conversely, existing DSN antennas can split time among more missions. At the time of launch, the DSN had a small number of Ka receivers installed on an experimental basis; Ka operations and missions are increasing.

The SDST has since been used on many other space missions such as the Mars Science Laboratory (the Mars rover &quot;Curiosity&quot;).

===PEPE===
Once at a target, DS1 senses the particle environment with the PEPE (Plasma Experiment for Planetary Exploration) instrument. This instrument measured the flux of ions and electrons as a function of their energy and direction. The composition of the ions was determined by using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer.

===MICAS===
The MICAS (Miniature Integrated Camera And Spectrometer) instrument combined visible light imaging with infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy to determine chemical composition. All channels share a telescope, which uses a silicon carbide mirror.

Both PEPE and MICAS were similar in capabilities to larger instruments or suites of instruments on other spacecraft. They were designed to be smaller and require lower power than those used on previous missions.

==Mission overview==
Prior to launch, &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; was intended to visit comet 76P/West–Kohoutek–Ikemura and asteroid 3352 McAuliffe. Because of the delayed launch, the targets were changed to asteroid 9969 Braille (at the time called 1992 KD) and comet 19P/Borrelly, with comet 107P/Wilson–Harrington being added following the early success of the mission. It achieved an impaired flyby of Braille and, due to problems with the star tracker, abandoned targeting Wilson–Harrington in order to maintain its flyby of comet 19P/Borrelly, which was successful. An August 2002 flyby of asteroid as another extended mission was considered, but ultimately was not advanced on the basis that the scientific justification was not sufficiently strong when considering risk and cost. During the mission, high quality infrared spectra of Mars were also taken.

===Results and achievements===

The ion propulsion engine initially failed after 4.5 minutes of operation. However, it was later restored to action and performed excellently. Early in the mission, material ejected during launch vehicle separation caused the closely spaced ion extraction grids to short-circuit. The contamination was eventually cleared, as the material was eroded by electrical arcing, sublimed by outgassing, or simply allowed to drift out. This was achieved by repeatedly restarting the engine in an engine repair mode, arcing across trapped material.

It was thought that the ion engine exhaust might interfere with other spacecraft systems, such as radio communications or the science instruments. The PEPE detectors had a secondary function to monitor such effects from the engine. No interference was found although the flux of ions from the thruster prevented PEPE from observing ions below approximately 20 eV.

Another failure was the loss of the star tracker. The star tracker determines spacecraft orientation by comparing the star field to its internal charts. The mission was saved when the MICAS camera was reprogrammed to substitute for the star tracker. Although MICAS is more sensitive, its field-of-view is an order of magnitude smaller, creating a greater information processing burden. Ironically, the star tracker was an off-the-shelf component, expected to be highly reliable.

Without a working star tracker, ion thrusting was temporarily suspended. The loss of thrust time forced the cancellation of a flyby past comet 107P/Wilson–Harrington.

The Autonav system required occasional manual corrections. Most problems were in identifying objects that were too dim, or were difficult to identify because of brighter objects causing diffraction spikes and reflections in the camera, causing Autonav to misidentify targets.

The Remote Agent system was presented with three simulated failures on the spacecraft and correctly handled each event.
# a failed electronics unit, which Remote Agent fixed by reactivating the unit.
# a failed sensor providing false information, which Remote Agent recognized as unreliable and therefore correctly ignored.
# an attitude control thruster (a small engine for controlling the spacecraft&#x27;s orientation) stuck in the &quot;off&quot; position, which Remote Agent detected and compensated for by switching to a mode that did not rely on that thruster.
Overall this constituted a successful demonstration of fully autonomous planning, diagnosis, and recovery.

The MICAS instrument was a design success, but the ultraviolet channel failed due to an electrical fault. Later in the mission, after the star tracker failure, MICAS assumed this duty as well. This caused continual interruptions in its scientific use during the remaining mission, including the Comet Borrelly encounter.

The flyby of the asteroid 9969 Braille was only a partial success. &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; was intended to perform the flyby at at only from the asteroid. Due to technical difficulties, including a software crash shortly before approach, the craft instead passed Braille at a distance of . This, plus Braille&#x27;s lower albedo, meant that the asteroid was not bright enough for the Autonav to focus the camera in the right direction, and the picture shoot was delayed by almost an hour. The resulting pictures were disappointingly indistinct.

However, the flyby of Comet Borrelly was a great success and returned extremely detailed images of the comet&#x27;s surface. Such images were of higher resolution than the only previous pictures of a comet -- Halley&#x27;s Comet, taken by the &quot;Giotto&quot; spacecraft. The PEPE instrument reported that the comet&#x27;s solar wind interaction was offset from the nucleus. This is believed to be due to emission of jets, which were not distributed evenly across the comet&#x27;s surface.

Despite having no debris shields, the spacecraft survived the comet passage intact. Once again, the sparse comet jets did not appear to point towards the spacecraft. &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; then entered its second extended mission phase, focused on retesting the spacecraft&#x27;s hardware technologies. The focus of this mission phase was on the ion engine systems. The spacecraft eventually ran out of hydrazine fuel for its attitude control thrusters. The highly efficient ion thruster had a sufficient amount of propellant left to perform attitude control in addition to main propulsion, thus allowing the mission to continue.

During late October and early November 1999, during the spacecraft&#x27;s post-Braille encounter coast phase, &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; observed Mars with its MICAS instrument. Although this was a very distant flyby, the instrument did succeed in taking multiple infrared spectra of the planet.

===Current status===
&quot;Deep Space 1&quot; succeeded in its primary and secondary objectives, returning valuable science data and images. DS1&#x27;s ion engines were shut down on 18 December 2001 at approximately 20:00:00 UTC, signaling the end of the mission. On-board communications were set to remain in active mode in case the craft should be needed in the future. However, attempts to resume contact in March 2002 were unsuccessful. It remains within the Solar System, in orbit around the Sun.

<doc id="9072" wikidata="Q83155" url="?curid=9072" title="Jacques-Louis David">
<text>Jacques-Louis David (; 30 August 1748 – 29 December 1825) was a French painter in the Neoclassical style, considered to be the preeminent painter of the era. In the 1780s, his cerebral brand of history painting marked a change in taste away from Rococo frivolity toward classical austerity, severity, and heightened feeling, which harmonized with the moral climate of the final years of the Ancien Régime.

David later became an active supporter of the French Revolution and friend of Maximilien Robespierre (1758–1794), and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the French Republic. Imprisoned after Robespierre&#x27;s fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release: that of Napoleon, the First Consul of France. At this time he developed his Empire style, notable for its use of warm Venetian colours. After Napoleon&#x27;s fall from Imperial power and the Bourbon revival, David exiled himself to Brussels, then in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, where he remained until his death. David had many pupils, making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic Salon painting.

==Early life==

Jacques-Louis David was born into a prosperous French family in Paris on 30 August 1748. When he was about nine his father was killed in a duel and his mother left him with his well-off architect uncles. They saw to it that he received an excellent education at the Collège des Quatre-Nations, University of Paris, but he was never a good student—he had a facial tumor that impeded his speech, and he was always preoccupied with drawing. He covered his notebooks with drawings, and he once said, &quot;I was always hiding behind the instructor&#x27;s chair, drawing for the duration of the class&quot;. Soon, he desired to be a painter, but his uncles and mother wanted him to be an architect. He overcame the opposition, and went to learn from François Boucher (1703–1770), the leading painter of the time, who was also a distant relative. Boucher was a Rococo painter, but tastes were changing, and the fashion for Rococo was giving way to a more classical style. Boucher decided that instead of taking over David&#x27;s tutelage, he would send David to his friend, Joseph-Marie Vien (1716–1809), a painter who embraced the classical reaction to Rococo. There, David attended the Royal Academy, based in what is now the Louvre.

Each year the academy awarded an outstanding student the prestigious , which funded a 3- to 5-year stay in Rome. Since artists were now revisiting classical styles, the trip provided its winners the opportunity to study the remains of classical antiquity and the works of the Italian Renaissance masters at first hand. Called &quot;pensionnaire&quot; they were housed in the French Academy&#x27;s Rome outpost, which from the years 1737 to 1793 was the Palazzo Mancini in the Via del Corso. David made three consecutive attempts to win the annual prize, (with &quot;Minerva Fighting Mars&quot;, &quot;Diana and Apollo Killing Niobe&#x27;s Children&quot; and &quot;The Death of Seneca&quot;) with each failure allegedly contributing to his lifelong grudge against the institution. After his second loss in 1772, David went on a hunger strike, which lasted two and a half days before the faculty encouraged him to continue painting. Confident he now had the support and backing needed to win the prize, he resumed his studies with great zeal—only to fail to win the again the following year. Finally, in 1774, David was awarded the on the strength of his painting of &quot;Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus&#x27; Disease&quot;, a subject set by the judges. In October 1775 he made the journey to Italy with his mentor, Joseph-Marie Vien, who had just been appointed director of the French Academy at Rome.

While in Italy, David mostly studied the works of 17th-century masters such as Poussin, Caravaggio, and the Carracci. Although he declared, &quot;the Antique will not seduce me, it lacks animation, it does not move&quot;, David filled twelve sketchbooks with drawings that he and his studio used as model books for the rest of his life. He was introduced to the painter Raphael Mengs (1728–1779), who opposed the Rococo tendency to sweeten and trivialize ancient subjects, advocating instead the rigorous study of classical sources and close adherence to ancient models. Mengs&#x27; principled, historicizing approach to the representation of classical subjects profoundly influenced David&#x27;s pre-revolutionary painting, such as &quot;The Vestal Virgin&quot;, probably from the 1780s. Mengs also introduced David to the theoretical writings on ancient sculpture by Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768), the German scholar held to be the founder of modern art history. As part of the , David toured the newly excavated ruins of Pompeii in 1779, which deepened his belief that the persistence of classical culture was an index of its eternal conceptual and formal power. During the trip David also assiduously studied the High Renaissance painters, Raphael making a profound and lasting impression on the young French artist.

==Early work==
Although David&#x27;s fellow students at the academy found him difficult to get along with, they recognized his genius. David&#x27;s stay at the French Academy in Rome was extended by a year. In July 1780, he returned to Paris. There, he found people ready to use their influence for him, and he was made an official member of the Royal Academy. He sent the academy two paintings, and both were included in the Salon of 1781, a high honor. He was praised by his famous contemporary painters, but the administration of the Royal Academy was very hostile to this young upstart. After the Salon, the King granted David lodging in the Louvre, an ancient and much desired privilege of great artists. When the contractor of the King&#x27;s buildings, M. Pécoul, was arranging with David, he asked the artist to marry his daughter, Marguerite Charlotte. This marriage brought him money and eventually four children. David had about 50 of his own pupils and was commissioned by the government to paint &quot;&quot;Horace defended by his Father&quot;, but he soon decided, &quot;Only in Rome can I paint Romans.&quot;&quot; His father-in-law provided the money he needed for the trip, and David headed for Rome with his wife, Charlotte, and three of his students, one of whom, Jean-Germain Drouais (1763–1788), was the winner of that year.

In Rome, David painted his famous &quot;Oath of the Horatii&quot;, 1784. In this piece, the artist references Enlightenment values while alluding to Rousseau&#x27;s social contract. The republican ideal of the general became the central focus of the painting with all three sons positioned in compliance with the father. The Oath between the characters can be read as an act of unification of men to the binding of the state. The issue of gender roles also becomes apparent in this piece, as the women in Horatii greatly contrast the group of brothers. David depicts the father with his back to the women, shutting them out of the oath. They also appear to be smaller in scale and physically isolated from the male figures. The masculine virility and discipline displayed by the men&#x27;s rigid and confident stances is also severely contrasted to the slouching, swooning female softness created in the other half of the composition. Here we see the clear division of male-female attributes that confined the sexes to specific roles under Rousseau&#x27;s popularized doctrine of &quot;separate spheres&quot;.

These revolutionary ideals are also apparent in the &quot;Distribution of Eagles&quot;. While &quot;Oath of the Horatii&quot; and &quot;The Tennis Court Oath&quot; stress the importance of masculine self-sacrifice for one&#x27;s country and patriotism, the &quot;Distribution of Eagles&quot; would ask for self-sacrifice for one&#x27;s Emperor (Napoleon) and the importance of battlefield glory.
In 1787, David did not become the Director of the French Academy in Rome, which was a position he wanted dearly. The Count in charge of the appointments said David was too young, but said he would support him in 6 to 12 years. This situation would be one of many that would cause him to lash out at the academy in years to come.

For the Salon of 1787, David exhibited his famous &quot;Death of Socrates&quot;. &quot;Condemned to death, Socrates, strong, calm and at peace, discusses the immortality of the soul. Surrounded by Crito, his grieving friends and students, he is teaching, philosophizing, and in fact, thanking the God of Health, Asclepius, for the hemlock brew which will ensure a peaceful death... The wife of Socrates can be seen grieving alone outside the chamber, dismissed for her weakness. Plato is depicted as an old man seated at the end of the bed.&quot; Critics compared the Socrates with Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Ceiling and Raphael&#x27;s Stanze, and one, after ten visits to the Salon, described it as &quot;in every sense perfect&quot;. Denis Diderot said it looked as if he copied it from some ancient bas-relief. The painting was very much in tune with the political climate at the time. For this painting, David was not honored by a royal &quot;works of encouragement&quot;.

For his next painting, David created &quot;The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons&quot;. The work had tremendous appeal for the time. Before the opening of the Salon, the French Revolution had begun. The National Assembly had been established, and the Bastille had fallen. The royal court did not want propaganda agitating the people, so all paintings had to be checked before being hung. David&#x27;s portrait of Lavoisier, who was a chemist and physicist as well as an active member of the Jacobin party, was banned by the authorities for such reasons. When the newspapers reported that the government had not allowed the showing of &quot;The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons&quot;, the people were outraged, and the royals were forced to give in. The painting was hung in the exhibition, protected by art students. The painting depicts Lucius Junius Brutus, the Roman leader, grieving for his sons. Brutus&#x27;s sons had attempted to overthrow the government and restore the monarchy, so the father ordered their death to maintain the republic. Brutus was the heroic defender of the republic, sacrificing his own family for the good of the republic. On the right, the mother holds her two daughters, and the nurse is seen on the far right, in anguish. Brutus sits on the left, alone, brooding, seemingly dismissing the dead bodies of his sons. Knowing what he did was best for his country, but the tense posture of his feet and toes reveals his inner turmoil. The whole painting was a Republican symbol, and obviously had immense meaning during these times in France. It exemplified civic virtue, a value highly regarded during the Revolution.

==The French Revolution==
In the beginning, David was a supporter of the Revolution, a friend of Maximilien Robespierre, and a member of the Jacobin Club. While others were leaving the country for new and greater opportunities, David stayed behind to help destroy the old order; he was a regicide who voted in the National Convention for the execution of Louis XVI. It is uncertain why he did this, as there were many more opportunities for him under the King than the new order; some people suggest David&#x27;s love for the classical made him embrace everything about that period, including a republican government.
Others believed that they found the key to the artist&#x27;s revolutionary career in his personality. Undoubtedly, David&#x27;s artistic sensibility, mercurial temperament, volatile emotions, ardent enthusiasm, and fierce independence might have been expected to help turn him against the established order but they did not fully explain his devotion to the republican regime. Nor did the vague statements of those who insisted upon his &quot;powerful ambition...and unusual energy of will&quot; actually account for his revolutionary connections. Those who knew him maintained that &quot;generous ardor&quot;, high-minded idealism and well-meaning though sometimes fanatical enthusiasm, rather than opportunism and jealousy, motivated his activities during this period.

Soon, David turned his critical sights on the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. This attack was probably caused primarily by the hypocrisy of the organization and their personal opposition to his work, as seen in previous episodes in David&#x27;s life. The Royal Academy was controlled by royalists, who opposed David&#x27;s attempts at reform; so the National Assembly finally ordered it to make changes to conform to the new constitution.

David then began work on something that would later hound him: propaganda for the new republic. David&#x27;s painting of Brutus was shown during the play &quot;Brutus&quot; by Voltaire.

In 1789, Jacques-Louis David attempted to leave his artistic mark on the historical beginnings of the French Revolution with his painting of &quot;The Oath of the Tennis Court&quot;. David undertook this task not out of personal political conviction but rather because he was commissioned to do so. The painting was meant to commemorate the event of the same name but was never completed. A meeting of the Estates General was convened in May to address reforms of the monarchy. Dissent arose over whether the three estates would meet separately, as had been tradition, or as one body. The King&#x27;s acquiescence in the demands of the upper orders led to the deputies of the Third Estate renaming themselves as the National Assembly on 17 June. They were locked out of the meeting hall three days later when they attempted to meet, and forced to reconvene to the royal indoor tennis court. Presided over by Jean-Sylvain Bailly, they made a &#x27;solemn oath never to separate&#x27; until a national constitution had been created. In 1789 this event was seen as a symbol of the national unity against the &quot;ancien regime&quot;. Rejecting the current conditions, the oath signified a new transition in human history and ideology. David was enlisted by the Society of Friends of the Constitution, the body that would eventually form the Jacobins, to enshrine this symbolic event.

This instance is notable in more ways than one because it eventually led David to finally become involved in politics as he joined the Jacobins. The picture was meant to be massive in scale; the figures in the foreground were to be life-sized portraits of the counterparts, including Jean-Sylvain Bailly, the President of the Constituent Assembly. Seeking additional funding, David turned to the Society of Friends of the Constitution. The funding for the project was to come from over three thousand subscribers hoping to receive a print of the image. However, when the funding was insufficient, the state ended up financing the project.

David set out in 1790 to transform the contemporary event into a major historical picture which would appear at the Salon of 1791 as a large pen-and-ink drawing. As in the &quot;Oath of the Horatii&quot;, David represents the unity of men in the service of a patriotic ideal. The outstretched arms which are prominent in both works betray David&#x27;s deeply held belief that acts of republican virtue akin to those of the Romans were being played out in France. In what was essentially an act of intellect and reason, David creates an air of drama in this work. The very power of the people appears to be &quot;blowing&quot; through the scene with the stormy weather, in a sense alluding to the storm that would be the revolution.

Symbolism in this work of art closely represents the revolutionary events taking place at the time. The figure in the middle is raising his right arm making the oath that they will never disband until they have reached their goal of creating a &quot;constitution of the realm fixed upon solid foundations&quot;. The importance of this symbol is highlighted by the fact that the crowd&#x27;s arms are angled to his hand forming a triangular shape. Additionally, the open space in the top half contrasted to the commotion in the lower half serves to emphasize the magnitude of the Tennis Court Oath.

In his attempt to depict political events of the Revolution in &quot;real time&quot;, David was venturing down a new and untrodden path in the art world. However, Thomas Crow argues that this path &quot;proved to be less a way forward than a cul-de-sac for history painting&quot;. Essentially, the history of the demise of David&#x27;s &quot;The Tennis Court Oath&quot; illustrates the difficulty of creating works of art that portray current and controversial political occurrences. Political circumstances in France proved too volatile to allow the completion of the painting. The unity that was to be symbolized in &quot;The Tennis Court Oath&quot; no longer existed in radicalized 1792. The National Assembly had split between conservatives and radical Jacobins, both vying for political power. By 1792 there was no longer consensus that all the revolutionaries at the tennis court were &quot;heroes&quot;. A sizeable number of the heroes of 1789 had become the villains of 1792. In this unstable political climate David&#x27;s work remained unfinished. With only a few nude figures sketched onto the massive canvas, David abandoned &quot;The Oath of the Tennis Court&quot;. To have completed it would have been politically unsound. After this incident, when David attempted to make a political statement in his paintings, he returned to the less politically charged use of metaphor to convey his message.

When Voltaire died in 1778, the church denied him a church burial, and his body was interred near a monastery. A year later, Voltaire&#x27;s old friends began a campaign to have his body buried in the Panthéon, as church property had been confiscated by the French Government. In 1791, David was appointed to head the organizing committee for the ceremony, a parade through the streets of Paris to the Panthéon. Despite rain and opposition from conservatives due to the amount of money spent, the procession went ahead. Up to 100,000 people watched the &quot;Father of the Revolution&quot; being carried to his resting place. This was the first of many large festivals organized by David for the republic. He went on to organize festivals for martyrs that died fighting royalists. These funerals echoed the religious festivals of the pagan Greeks and Romans and are seen by many as Saturnalian.

David incorporated many revolutionary symbols into these theatrical performances and orchestrated ceremonial rituals, in effect radicalizing the applied arts themselves. The most popular symbol for which David was responsible as propaganda minister was drawn from classical Greek images; changing and transforming them with contemporary politics. In an elaborate festival held on the anniversary of the revolt that brought the monarchy to its knees, David&#x27;s Hercules figure was revealed in a procession following the Goddess of Liberty (Marianne). Liberty, the symbol of Enlightenment ideals was here being overturned by the Hercules symbol; that of strength and passion for the protection of the Republic against disunity and factionalism. In his speech during the procession, David &quot;explicitly emphasized the opposition between people and monarchy; Hercules was chosen, after all, to make this opposition more evident&quot;. The ideals that David linked to his Hercules single-handedly transformed the figure from a sign of the old regime into a powerful new symbol of revolution. &quot;David turned him into the representation of a collective, popular power. He took one of the favorite signs of monarchy and reproduced, elevated, and monumentalized it into the sign of its opposite.&quot; Hercules, the image, became to the revolutionaries, something to rally around.

In June 1791, the King made an ill-fated attempt to flee the country, but was apprehended short of his goal on the Austrian Netherlands border and was forced to return under guard to Paris. Louis XVI had made secret requests to Emperor Leopold II of Austria, Marie-Antoinette&#x27;s brother, to restore him to his throne. This was granted and Austria threatened France if the royal couple were hurt. In reaction, the people arrested the King. This led to an Invasion after the trials and execution of Louis and Marie-Antoinette. The Bourbon monarchy was destroyed by the French people in 1792—it would be restored after Napoleon, then destroyed again with the Restoration of the House of Bonaparte. When the new National Convention held its first meeting, David was sitting with his friends Jean-Paul Marat and Robespierre. In the convention, David soon earned the nickname &quot;ferocious terrorist&quot;. Robespierre&#x27;s agents discovered a secret vault containing the King&#x27;s correspondence which proved he was trying to overthrow the government, and demanded his execution. The National Convention held the trial of Louis XVI; David voted for the death of the King, causing his wife, Marguerite Charlotte, a royalist, to divorce him.

When Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793, another man had already died as well—Louis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau. Le Peletier was killed on the preceding day by a royal bodyguard in revenge for having voted for the death of the King. David was called upon to organize a funeral, and he painted &quot;Le Peletier Assassinated&quot;. In it, the assassin&#x27;s sword was seen hanging by a single strand of horsehair above Le Peletier&#x27;s body, a concept inspired by the proverbial ancient tale of the sword of Damocles, which illustrated the insecurity of power and position. This underscored the courage displayed by Le Peletier and his companions in routing an oppressive king. The sword pierces a piece of paper on which is written &quot;I vote the death of the tyrant&quot;, and as a tribute at the bottom right of the picture David placed the inscription &quot;David to Le Peletier. 20 January 1793&quot;. The painting was later destroyed by Le Peletier&#x27;s royalist daughter, and is known by only a drawing, an engraving, and contemporary accounts. Nevertheless, this work was important in David&#x27;s career because it was the first completed painting of the French Revolution, made in less than three months, and a work through which he initiated the regeneration process that would continue with &quot;The Death of Marat&quot;, David&#x27;s masterpiece.

On 13 July 1793, David&#x27;s friend Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday with a knife she had hidden in her clothing. She gained entrance to Marat&#x27;s house on the pretense of presenting him a list of people who should be executed as enemies of France. Marat thanked her and said that they would be guillotined next week upon which Corday immediately fatally stabbed him. She was guillotined shortly thereafter. Corday was of an opposing political party, whose name can be seen in the note Marat holds in David&#x27;s subsequent painting, &quot;The Death of Marat&quot;. Marat, a member of the National Convention and a journalist, had a skin disease that caused him to itch horribly. The only relief he could get was in his bath over which he improvised a desk to write his list of suspect counter-revolutionaries who were to be quickly tried and, if convicted, guillotined. David once again organized a spectacular funeral, and Marat was buried in the Panthéon. Marat&#x27;s body was to be placed upon a Roman bed, his wound displayed and his right arm extended holding the pen which he had used to defend the Republic and its people. This concept was to be complicated by the fact that the corpse had begun to putrefy. Marat&#x27;s body had to be periodically sprinkled with water and vinegar as the public crowded to see his corpse prior to the funeral on 15 and 16 July. The stench became so bad however that the funeral had to be brought forward to the evening of 16 July.

&quot;The Death of Marat&quot;, perhaps David&#x27;s most famous painting, has been called the Pietà of the revolution. Upon presenting the painting to the convention, he said &quot;Citizens, the people were again calling for their friend; their desolate voice was heard: David, take up your brushes..., avenge Marat... I heard the voice of the people. I obeyed.&quot;

&quot;The Death of Marat&quot;, 1793, became the leading image of the Terror and immortalized both Marat and David in the world of the revolution. This piece stands today as &quot;a moving testimony to what can be achieved when an artist&#x27;s political convictions are directly manifested in his work&quot;. A political martyr was instantly created as David portrayed Marat with all the marks of the real murder, in a fashion which greatly resembles that of Christ or his disciples. The subject although realistically depicted remains lifeless in a rather supernatural composition. With the surrogate tombstone placed in front of him and the almost holy light cast upon the whole scene; alluding to an out of this world existence. &quot;Atheists though they were, David and Marat, like so many other fervent social reformers of the modern world, seem to have created a new kind of religion.&quot; At the very center of these beliefs, there stood the republic.

After the King&#x27;s execution, war broke out between the new Republic and virtually every major power in Europe. David, as a member of the Committee of General Security, contributed directly to the Reign of Terror. David organized his last festival: the festival of the Supreme Being. Robespierre had realized what a tremendous propaganda tool these festivals were, and he decided to create a new religion, mixing moral ideas with the Republic and based on the ideas of Rousseau. This process had already begun by confiscating church lands and requiring priests to take an oath to the state. The festivals, called fêtes, would be the method of indoctrination. On the appointed day, 20 Prairial by the revolutionary calendar, Robespierre spoke, descended steps, and with a torch presented to him by David, incinerated a cardboard image symbolizing atheism, revealing an image of wisdom underneath.

Soon, the war began to go well; French troops marched across the southern half of the Netherlands (which would later become Belgium), and the emergency that had placed the Committee of Public Safety in control was no more. Then plotters seized Robespierre at the National Convention and he was later guillotined, in effect ending the Reign of Terror. As Robespierre was arrested, David yelled to his friend &quot;if you drink hemlock, I shall drink it with you.&quot; After this, he supposedly fell ill, and did not attend the evening session because of &quot;stomach pain&quot;, which saved him from being guillotined along with Robespierre. David was arrested and placed in prison twice, first from 2 August to 28 December 1794 and then from 29 May to 3 August 1795. Most of the time he served his sentence in the not uncomfortable Palais du Luxembourg in Paris. There he painted his own portrait, showing him much younger than he actually was, as well as that of his jailer.

==Post-revolution==

After David&#x27;s wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story of the rape of the Sabine women. &quot;The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running between the Combatants&quot;, also called &quot;The Intervention of the Sabine Women&quot; is said to have been painted to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution.

David conceived a new style for this painting, one which he called the &quot;Pure Greek Style&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;Roman style&quot; of his earlier historical paintings. The new style was influenced heavily by the work of art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann. In David&#x27;s words, &quot;the most prominent general characteristics of the Greek masterpieces are a noble simplicity and silent greatness in pose as well as in expression.&quot; Instead of the muscularity and angularity of the figures of his past works, these were smoother, more feminine, and painterly.

This work also brought him to the attention of Napoleon. The story for the painting is as follows: &quot;The Romans have abducted the daughters of their neighbors, the Sabines. To avenge this abduction, the Sabines attacked Rome, although not immediately—since Hersilia, the daughter of Tatius, the leader of the Sabines, had been married to Romulus, the Roman leader, and then had two children by him in the interim. Here we see Hersilia between her father and husband as she adjures the warriors on both sides not to take wives away from their husbands or mothers away from their children. The other Sabine Women join in her exhortations.&quot;

During this time, the martyrs of the Revolution were taken from the Pantheon and buried in common ground, and revolutionary statues were destroyed. When David was finally released to the country, France had changed. His wife managed to get him released from prison, and he wrote letters to his former wife, and told her he never ceased loving her. He remarried her in 1796. Finally, wholly restored to his position, he retreated to his studio, took pupils and for the most part retired from politics.

In August 1796, David and many other artists signed a petition orchestrated by Quatremère de Quincy which questioned the wisdom of the planned seizure of works of art from Rome. The Director Barras believed that David was &quot;tricked&quot; into signing, although one of David&#x27;s students recalled that in 1798 his master lamented the fact that masterpieces had been imported from Italy.

==Napoleon==
David&#x27;s close association with the Committee of Public Safety during the Terror resulted in his signing of the death warrant for Alexandre de Beauharnais, a minor noble. Beauharnais&#x27;s widow, Joséphine, went on to marry Napoleon Bonaparte and became his empress; David himself depicted their coronation in the &quot;Coronation of Napoleon and Josephine, 2 December 1804&quot;.
David had been an admirer of Napoleon from their first meeting, struck by Bonaparte&#x27;s classical features. Requesting a sitting from the busy and impatient general, David was able to sketch Napoleon in 1797. David recorded the face of the conqueror of Italy, but the full composition of Napoleon holding the peace treaty with Austria remains unfinished. This was likely a decision by Napoleon himself after considering the current political situation. He may have considered the publicity the portrait would bring about to be ill-timed. Bonaparte had high esteem for David, and asked him to accompany him to Egypt in 1798, but David refused, seemingly unwilling to give up the material comfort, safety, and peace of mind he had obtained through the years. Draftsman and engraver Dominique Vivant Denon went to Egypt instead, providing mostly documentary and archaeological work.

After Napoleon&#x27;s successful coup d&#x27;état in 1799, as First Consul he commissioned David to commemorate his daring crossing of the Alps. The crossing of the St. Bernard Pass had allowed the French to surprise the Austrian army and win victory at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800. Although Napoleon had crossed the Alps on a mule, he requested that he be portrayed &quot;calm upon a fiery steed&quot;. David complied with &quot;Napoleon Crossing the Saint-Bernard.&quot; After the proclamation of the Empire in 1804, David became the official court painter of the regime. During this period he took students, one of whom was the Belgian painter Pieter van Hanselaere.

One of the works David was commissioned for was &quot;The Coronation of Napoleon&quot; (1805–1807). David was permitted to watch the event. He had plans of Notre Dame delivered and participants in the coronation came to his studio to pose individually, though never the Emperor. (The only time David obtained a sitting from Napoleon had been in 1797.) David did manage to get a private sitting with the Empress Joséphine and Napoleon&#x27;s sister, Caroline Murat, through the intervention of erstwhile art patron Marshal Joachim Murat, the Emperor&#x27;s brother-in-law. For his background, David had the choir of Notre Dame act as his fill-in characters. Pope Pius VII came to sit for the painting, and actually blessed David. Napoleon came to see the painter, stared at the canvas for an hour and said &quot;David, I salute you.&quot; David had to redo several parts of the painting because of Napoleon&#x27;s various whims, and for this painting, he received twenty-four thousand Francs.

David was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1803. He was promoted to an Officier in 1808. And, in 1815, he was promoted to a Commandant (now Commandeur) de la Légion d&#x27;honneur.

==Exile and death==

On the Bourbons returning to power, David figured in the list of proscribed former revolutionaries and Bonapartists for having voted execution for the deposed King Louis XVI; and for participating in the death of Louis XVII, the deposed king&#x27;s son who was mistreated, starved and forced into a false confession of incest with his mother, Queen Marie Antoinette, which contributed to her death sentence.

The newly restored Bourbon King, Louis XVIII, however, granted amnesty to David and even offered him the position of court painter. David refused, preferring self-exile in Brussels. There, he trained and influenced Brussels artists such as François-Joseph Navez and Ignace Brice, painted &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; and quietly lived the remainder of his life with his wife (whom he had remarried). In that time, he painted smaller-scale mythological scenes, and portraits of citizens of Brussels and Napoleonic émigrés, such as the Baron Gerard.

David created his last great work, &quot;Mars Being Disarmed by Venus and the Three Graces&quot;, from 1822 to 1824. In December 1823, he wrote: &quot;This is the last picture I want to paint, but I want to surpass myself in it. I will put the date of my seventy-five years on it and afterwards I will never again pick up my brush.&quot; The finished painting—evoking painted porcelain because of its limpid coloration—was exhibited first in Brussels, then in Paris, where his former students flocked to view it.
The exhibition was profitable—13,000 francs, after deducting operating costs, thus, more than 10,000 people visited and viewed the painting. In his later years, David remained in full command of his artistic faculties, even after a stroke in the spring of 1825 disfigured his face and slurred his speech. In June 1825, he resolved to embark on an improved version of his &quot;The Anger of Achilles&quot; (also known as the &quot;Sacrifice of Iphigenie&quot;); the earlier version was completed in 1819 and is now in the collection of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. David remarked to his friends who visited his studio &quot;this [painting] is what is killing me&quot; such was his determination to complete the work, but by October it must have already been well advanced, as his former pupil Gros wrote to congratulate him, having heard reports of the painting&#x27;s merits. By the time David died, the painting had been completed and the commissioner Ambroise Firmin-Didot brought it back to Paris to include it in the exhibition &quot;Pour les grecs&quot; that he had organised and which opened in Paris in April 1826.

When David was leaving a theater, the driver of a carriage struck him, and he later died, on 29 December 1825. At his death, some portraits were auctioned in Paris, they sold for little; the famous &quot;Death of Marat&quot; was exhibited in a secluded room, to avoid outraging public sensibilities. Disallowed return to France for burial, for having been a regicide of King Louis XVI, the body of the painter Jacques-Louis David was buried in Brussels and moved in 1882 to Brussels Cemetery, while some say his heart was buried with his wife at Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.

==Freemasonry==
The theme of the oath found in several works such as &quot;The Oath of the Tennis Court&quot;, &quot;The Distribution of the Eagles&quot;, and &quot;Leonidas at Thermopylae&quot;, was perhaps inspired by the rituals of Freemasonry. In 1989 during the &quot;David against David&quot; conference Albert Boime presented evidence, a document dated in 1787, showing the painter&#x27;s membership in the &quot;La Moderation&quot; Masonic Lodge.

==Medical analysis of David&#x27;s face==

Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s facial abnormalities were traditionally reported to be a consequence of a deep facial sword wound after a fencing incident. These left him with a noticeable asymmetry during facial expression and resulted in his difficulty in eating or speaking. (He could not pronounce some consonants such as the letter &#x27;r&#x27;.) A sword scar wound on the left side of his face is present in his self-portrait and sculptures and corresponds to some of the buccal branches of the facial nerve. An injury to this nerve and its branches are likely to have resulted in the difficulties with his left facial movement.

Furthermore, as a result of this injury, he suffered from a growth on his face that biographers and art historians have defined as a benign tumor. These, however, may have been a granuloma, or even a post-traumatic neuroma. As historian Simon Schama has pointed out, witty banter and public speaking ability were key aspects of the social culture of 18th-century France, so David&#x27;s tumor could have been a heavy obstacle in his social life. David was sometimes referred to as &quot;David of the Tumor&quot;.

==Portraiture==
In addition to his history paintings, David completed a number of privately commissioned portraits. Warren Roberts, among others, has pointed out the contrast between David&#x27;s &quot;public style&quot; of painting, as shown in his history paintings, and his &quot;private style&quot;, as shown in his portraits. His portraits were characterized by a sense of truth and realism. He focused on defining his subjects&#x27; features and characters without idealizing them. This is different from the style seen in his historical paintings, in which he idealizes his figures&#x27; features and bodies to align with Greek and Roman ideals of beauty. He puts a great deal of detail into his portraits, defining smaller features such as hands and fabric. The compositions of his portraits remain simple with blank backgrounds that allow the viewer to focus on the details of the subject.

The portrait he did of his wife (1813) is an example of his typical portrait style. The background is dark and simple without any clues as to the setting, which forces the viewer to focus entirely on her. Her features are un-idealized and truthful to her appearance. There is a great amount of detail that can be seen in his attention to portraying the satin material of the dress she wears, the drapery of the scarf around her, and her hands which rest in her lap.
In the painting of Brutus (1789), the man and his wife are separated, both morally and physically. Paintings such as these, depicting the great strength of patriotic sacrifice, made David a popular hero of the revolution.

In the &quot;Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife&quot; (1788), the man and his wife are tied together in an intimate pose. She leans on his shoulder while he pauses from his work to look up at her. David casts them in a soft light, not in the sharp contrast of Brutus or of the Horatii. Also of interest—Lavoisier was a tax collector, as well as a famous chemist. Though he spent some of his money trying to clean up swamps and eradicate malaria, he was nonetheless sent to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror as an enemy of the people. David, then a powerful member of the National Assembly, stood idly by and watched.

Other portraits include paintings of his sister-in-law and her husband, Madame and Monsieur Seriziat. The picture of Monsieur Seriziat depicts a man of wealth, sitting comfortably with his horse-riding equipment. The picture of the Madame shows her wearing an unadorned white dress, holding her young child&#x27;s hand as they lean against a bed. David painted these portraits of Madame and Monsieur Seriziat out of gratitude for letting him stay with them after he was in jail.

Towards the end of David&#x27;s life, he painted a portrait of his old friend &quot;Abbé Sieyès&quot;. Both had been involved in the Revolution, both had survived the purging of political radicals that followed the reign of terror.

==Shift in attitude==
The shift in David&#x27;s perspective played an important role in the paintings of David&#x27;s later life, including this one of Sieyès. During the height of The Terror, David was an ardent supporter of radicals such as Robespierre and Marat, and twice offered up his life in their defense. He organized revolutionary festivals and painted portraits of martyrs of the revolution, such as Lepeletier, who was assassinated for voting for the death of the king. David was an impassioned speaker at times in the National Assembly. In speaking to the Assembly about the young boy named Bara, another martyr of the revolution, David said, &quot;O Bara! O Viala! The blood that you have spread still smokes; it rises toward Heaven and cries for vengeance.&quot;

After Robespierre was sent to the guillotine, however, David was imprisoned and changed the attitude of his rhetoric. During his imprisonment he wrote many letters, pleading his innocence. In one he wrote, &quot;I am prevented from returning to my atelier, which, alas, I should never have left. I believed that in accepting the most honorable position, but very difficult to fill, that of legislator, that a righteous heart would suffice, but I lacked the second quality, understanding.&quot;

Later, while explaining his developing &quot;Grecian style&quot; for paintings such as &quot;The Intervention of the Sabine Women&quot;, David further commented on a shift in attitude: &quot;In all human activity the violent and transitory develops first; repose and profundity appear last. The recognition of these latter qualities requires time; only great masters have them, while their pupils have access only to violent passions.&quot;

==Legacy==

Jacques-Louis David was, in his time, regarded as the leading painter in France, and arguably all of Western Europe; many of the painters honored by the restored Bourbons following the French Revolution had been David&#x27;s pupils. David&#x27;s student Antoine-Jean Gros for example, was made a Baron and honored by Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s court. Another pupil of David&#x27;s, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres became the most important artist of the restored Royal Academy and the figurehead of the Neoclassical school of art, engaging the increasingly popular Romantic school of art that was beginning to challenge Neoclassicism. David invested in the formation of young artists for the Rome Prize, which was also a way to pursue his old rivalry with other contemporary painters such as Joseph-Benoît Suvée, who had also started teaching classes. To be one of David&#x27;s students was considered prestigious and earned his students a lifetime reputation. He called on the more advanced students, such as Jérôme-Martin Langlois, to help him paint his large canvases. Musician and artist Therese Emilie Henriette Winkel; and painter Jean Baptiste Vermay also studied with David.

Despite David&#x27;s reputation, he was more fiercely criticized right after his death than at any point during his life. His style came under the most serious criticism for being static, rigid, and uniform throughout all his work. David&#x27;s art was also attacked for being cold and lacking warmth. David, however, made his career precisely by challenging what he saw as the earlier rigidity and conformity of the French Royal Academy&#x27;s approach to art. David&#x27;s later works also reflect his growth in the development of the Empire style, notable for its dynamism and warm colors. It is likely that much of the criticism of David following his death came from David&#x27;s opponents; during his lifetime David made a great many enemies with his competitive and arrogant personality as well as his role in the &quot;Terror.&quot; David sent many people to the guillotine and personally signed the death warrants for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. One significant episode in David&#x27;s political career that earned him a great deal of contempt was the execution of Emilie Chalgrin. A fellow painter Carle Vernet had approached David, requesting him to intervene on behalf of his sister, Chalgrin. She had been accused of crimes against the Republic, most notably possessing stolen items. David refused to intervene in her favor, and she was executed. Vernet allegedly blamed David for his sister&#x27;s death, although he was not a member of the Committee of Public Safety or Committee of General Security, the two primary Committees responsible for enacting laws within the National Convention.

In the last 50 years David has enjoyed a revival in popular favor and in 1948 his two-hundredth birthday was celebrated with an exhibition at the Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie in Paris and at Versailles showing his life&#x27;s works. Following World War II, Jacques-Louis David was increasingly regarded as a symbol of French national pride and identity, as well as a vital force in the development of European and French art in the modern era. The birth of Romanticism is traditionally credited to the paintings of eighteenth-century French artists such as Jacques-Louis David.

There are streets named after David in the French cities of Carcassonne and Montpellier.

==Filmography==
&quot;Danton&quot; (Andrzej Wajda, France, 1982) – Historical drama. Many scenes include David as a silent character watching and drawing. The film focuses on the period of the Terror.

&quot;Napoleon&quot; (Ridley Scott, 2023) - Historical drama. David appears during Napoleon&#x27;s coronation, sketching the scene for his painting of the event.

<text>A drum kit or drum set (also known as a trap set, or simply drums in popular music and jazz) is a collection of drums, cymbals, and sometimes other auxiliary percussion instruments set up to be played by one person. The drummer typically holds a pair of matching drumsticks or special wire or nylon brushes; and uses their feet to operate hi-hat and bass drum pedals. 

A standard kit usually consists of:
* A snare drum, mounted on a stand
* A bass drum, played with a beater moved by one or more foot-operated pedals
* One or more tom-toms, including rack toms and/or floor toms 
* One or more cymbals, including a ride cymbal and crash cymbal
* Hi-hat cymbals, a pair of cymbals that can be played with a foot-operated pedal

The drum kit is a part of the standard rhythm section and is used in many types of popular and traditional music styles, ranging from rock and pop to blues and jazz.

==History==

===Early development===
Before the development of the classic drum kit, drums and cymbals used in military and orchestral music settings were played separately by different percussionists. In the 1840s, percussionists began to experiment with foot pedals as a way to enable them to play more than one instrument, but these devices would not be mass-produced for another 75 years. By the 1860s, percussionists started combining multiple drums into a kit. The bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, and other percussion instruments were all struck with hand-held drumsticks. Drummers in musical theater appeared in stage shows, where the budget for pit orchestras was often limited due to an insufficient amount of money able to purchase a full percussionist team. This contributed to the creation of the drum kit by developing techniques and devices that would enable one person to replace multiple percussionists.

Double-drumming was developed to enable one person to play both bass and snare drums with sticks, while the cymbals could be played by tapping the foot on a &quot;low-boy&quot;. With this approach, the bass drum was usually played on beats one and three (in time). While the music was first designed to accompany marching soldiers, this simple and straightforward drumming approach led to the birth of ragtime music, when the simple marching beats became more syncopated. This resulted in a greater swing and dance feel. The drum kit was initially referred to as a &quot;trap set&quot;, and from the late 1800s to the 1930s, drummers were referred to as &quot;trap drummers&quot;. By the 1870s, drummers were using an overhang pedal. Most drummers in the 1870s preferred to do double-drumming without any pedal to play multiple drums, rather than use an overhang pedal. Companies patented their pedal systems, such as that of drummer Edward &quot;Dee Dee&quot; Chandler of New Orleans in 1904 or 1905. This led to the bass drum being played by percussionists standing and using their feet, hence the term &quot;kick drum&quot;. 

William F. Ludwig Sr. and his brother Theobald founded Ludwig &amp; Ludwig Co. in 1909 and patented the first commercially successful bass drum pedal system. 

In 1912, drummers replaced sticks with wire brushes and, later, metal fly swatters as the louder sounds made by using drumsticks could overpower other instruments.

===20th century===
By World War I, drum kits were often marching-band-style bass drums with many percussion items around them and suspended from them. Drum kits became a central part of jazz, especially Dixieland. The modern drum kit was developed in the vaudeville era, during the 1920s, in New Orleans.

Drummers such as Baby Dodds, Zutty Singleton, and Ray Bauduc took the idea of marching rhythms and combined the bass drum, snare drum, and &quot;traps&quot;a term used to refer to the percussion instruments associated with immigrant groups, which included miniature cymbals, tom toms, cowbells, and woodblocks. They started incorporating these elements into ragtime, which had been popular for a few decades, creating an approach that evolved into a jazz drumming style.

Budget constraints and space considerations in musical theater pit orchestras led bandleaders to pressure percussionists to cover more percussion parts. Metal consoles were developed to hold Chinese tom-toms, with swing-out stands for snare drums and cymbals. On top of the console was a &quot;contraption&quot; tray (shortened to &quot;trap&quot;), used to hold items like whistles, klaxons, and cowbells. These kits were dubbed &quot;trap kits&quot;. Hi-hat stands became available around 1926.

In 1918, Baby Dodds, playing on Mississippi River riverboats with Louis Armstrong, modified the military marching setup, experimenting with playing the drum rims instead of woodblocks, hitting cymbals with sticks (which was not yet common), and adding a side cymbal above the bass drum, which became known as the ride cymbal. William Ludwig developed the &quot;sock&quot; or early low-mounted hi-hat after observing Dodds&#x27; drumming. Dodds asked Ludwig to raise the newly produced low-hat cymbal nine inches to make them easier to play, thus creating the modern hi-hat cymbal. Dodds was one of the first drummers to play the broken-triplet beat that became the standard rhythm of modern ride cymbal playing. He also popularized the use of Chinese cymbals. Recording technology was crude, which meant loud sounds could distort the recording. To get around this, Dodds used woodblocks and drum rims as quieter alternatives to cymbals and drum skins.

In the 1920s, freelance drummers were hired to play at shows, concerts, theaters, and clubs to support dancers and musicians of various genres. Orchestras were hired to accompany silent films, and the drummer was responsible for providing the sound effects. Sheet music from the 1920s shows that the drummer&#x27;s sets were starting to evolve in size to support the various acts. However, by 1930, films with audio were more popular, and many were accompanied by pre-recorded soundtracks. This technological breakthrough put thousands of drummers who served as sound effects specialists out of work, with some drummers obtaining work as Foley artists for those motion-picture sound tracks.

==Playing==

===Grooves===
Kit drumming, whether accompanying voices and other instruments or performing a drum solo, consists of two elements:
* A groove that sets the basic time-feel and provides a rhythmic framework for the song (examples include a backbeat or shuffle). Grooves can set the mood of the song.
* Drum fills and other ornaments and variations that provide variety and add interest to the drum sound. Fills could include a sting at the end of a musical section or act as a drum showpiece.

===Fills===
A fill is a departure from the repetitive rhythm pattern in a song. A drum fill can be used to &quot;fill in&quot; the space between the end of one verse and the beginning of another verse or chorus. Fills vary from a simple few strokes on a tom or snare to a distinctive rhythm played on the hi-hat, to sequences several bars long that are short virtuosic drum solos. As well as adding interest and variation to the music, fills serve an important function in indicating significant changes of sections in songs as well as linking them together. A &quot;vocal cue&quot; is a short drum fill that introduces a singer&#x27;s entrance into the piece. A fill ending with a cymbal crash on beat one is often used to lead into a chorus or verse.

===Drum solos===
A drum solo is an instrumental section that highlights the drums. While other instrument solos are typically accompanied by the other rhythm section instruments (e.g., bass guitar and electric guitar), for most drum solos, the band members stop playing so that all focus will be on the drummer. In some drum solos, the other rhythm section instrumentalists may play &quot;punches&quot; at certain pointssudden, loud chords of short duration. Drum solos are common in jazz but are also used in several rock genres, such as heavy metal and progressive rock. During drum solos, drummers have a degree of creative freedom, allowing them to use complex polyrhythms that would otherwise be unsuitable with an ensemble. In live concerts, drummers may be given extended drum solos, even in genres where drum solos are rare on recordings.

===Grip===

Most drummers hold the drumsticks in one of two types of grip:
# The traditional grip, originally developed for playing side drum in marching ensembles where the sticks are most commonly held with an overhand grip for the right hand and an underhand grip for the left
# The matched grip, in which both sticks are held the same way, with the palms facing down. Matched grip is considerably more popular among modern drummers.

==Components==

===Drums===

====Bass drum====
The bass drum (also known as the &quot;kick drum&quot;) is the lowest-pitched drum and usually provides the beat or timing element with basic pulse patterns. Some drummers may use two or more bass drums or a double pedal on a single bass drum, which enables a drummer to play a double-bass-drum style with only one drum. This saves space in recording/performance areas and reduces time and effort during set-up, taking down, and transportation. Double bass drumming is a technique used in certain genres, including heavy metal and progressive rock.

====Snare drum====

The snare drum provides the backbeat. When applied in this fashion, it supplies strong regular accents played by the non-dominant hand and is the backbone for many fills. Its distinctive sound can be attributed to the bed of stiff metal wires held under tension against the bottom head (known as the snare head). When the top head (known as the batter head) is struck with a drumstick, the snare wires vibrate, creating a snappy, staccato buzzing sound, along with the sound of the stick striking the batter head.

====Toms====

Tom-tom drums, or toms for short, are drums without snares and played with sticks (or whatever tools the music style requires) and are the most numerous drums in most kits. They provide the bulk of most drum fills and solos.

They include:
* Traditional double-headed rack toms of varying diameters and depths
* Floor toms (generally the widest and largest toms, which also makes them the lowest-pitched toms)
* Single-headed concert toms
* Rototoms

The smallest and largest drums without snares (octobans and gong drums, respectively) are sometimes considered toms. The naming of common configurations (four-piece, five-piece, etc.) is largely a reflection of the number of toms, as conventionally only the drums are counted, and these configurations all contain one snare and one or more bass drums, (though not regularly any standardized use of two bass/kick drums) the balance usually being made up by toms.

====Other drums====
Octobans are smaller toms designed for use in a drum kit, extending the tom range upwards in pitch, primarily by their great depth and small diameter. They are also called rocket toms and tube toms.

Timbales are tuned much higher than a tom of the same diameter, typically have drum shells made of metal, and are normally played with very light, thin, non-tapered sticks. Timbales are more common in Latin music. They have thin heads and a very different tone than a tom but are used by some drummers/percussionists to extend the tom range upwards. Alternatively, they can be fitted with tom heads and tuned as shallow concert toms.

Attack timbales and mini timbales are reduced-diameter timbales designed for drum kit usage, the smaller diameter allowing for thicker heads providing the same pitch and head tension. They are recognizable in genres of the 2010s and more traditional forms of Latin, reggae, and numerous other styles.

Gong drums are a rare extension of a drum kit. This single-headed mountable drum appears similar to a bass drum (around 20–24 inches in diameter) but is played with sticks rather than a foot-operated pedal and therefore has the same purpose as a floor tom.

Most hand drums cannot be played with drumsticks without risking damage to the head and bearing edge, which is not protected by a metal drum rim. For use in a drum kit, they may be fitted with a metal drum head and played with sticks with care, or played by hand.

===Cymbals===
In most drum kits and drum/percussion kits, cymbals are as prominent as the drums themselves. The oldest idiophones in music are cymbals, a version of which were used throughout the ancient Near East very early in the Bronze Age period. Cymbals are mostly associated with Turkey and Turkish craftsmanship, where Zildjian has made them since 1623.

While most drummers purchase cymbals individually, beginner cymbal packs were brought to market to provide entry-level cymbals for the novice drummer. The kits normally contain four cymbals: one ride, one crash, and a pair of hi-hats. Some contain only three cymbals, using a crash/ride instead of the separate ride and crash. The sizes closely follow those given in Common configurations below. Most drummers extend the normal configuration by adding another crash, a splash, and/or a china/effects cymbal.

====Ride cymbal====
The ride cymbal is most often used for keeping a constant rhythm pattern, every beat or more often, as the music requires. Development of this ride technique is generally credited to jazz drummer Baby Dodds.

Most drummers have a single main ride, located near their dominant handwithin easy playing reach, as it is used regularlyoften a 20&quot;–22&quot; in diameter, but diameters of 16&quot;–26&quot; are not uncommon. It is usually a medium-heavy- to heavy-weight cymbal whose sound that cuts through other instrumental sounds. Some drummers use a swish cymbal, sizzle cymbal, or other exotic or lighter metal rides, as the main or only ride in their kit, particularly for jazz, gospel, or ballad/folk sounds. In the 1960s, Ringo Starr of the Beatles used a sizzle cymbal as a second ride, particularly during guitar solos.

====Hi-hats====

Hi-hat cymbals (nicknamed &quot;hats&quot;) consist of two cymbals mounted, one upside down, with their bottoms facing each other, on a hollow metal support cylinder with folding support legs that keep the support cylinder vertical. Like the bass drum, the hi-hat has a foot pedal. The bottom cymbal is fixed in place. The top cymbal is mounted on a thin rod, which is inserted into the hollow cymbal stand. The thin rod is connected to a foot pedal. When the foot pedal is pressed down, it causes the thin rod to move down, causing the upper cymbal to move and strike the lower. When the foot is lifted off the pedal, the upper cymbal rises, due to the pedal&#x27;s spring-loaded mechanism. The hi-hats can be sounded by striking the cymbals with one or two sticks or just by closing and opening the cymbals with the foot pedal. The ability to create rhythms on the hi-hats with the foot alone expands the drummer&#x27;s ability to create sounds, as the hands are freed up to play on the drums or other cymbals. Different sounds can be created by striking &quot;open hi-hats&quot; (without the pedal depressed, which creates a noisy sound nicknamed &quot;sloppy hats&quot;) or a crisp &quot;closed hi-hats&quot; sound (with the pedal pressed down). High hats can also be struck with the pedal partially depressed.

A unique effect can be created by striking an open hi-hat (where the two cymbals are apart) and then closing the cymbals with the foot pedal. This effect is widely used in disco and funk. The hi-hat has a similar function to the ride cymbal; the two are rarely played consistently for long periods at the same time, but one or the other is often used to keep what is known as the &quot;ride rhythm&quot; (e.g., eighth or sixteenth notes) in a song. The hi-hats are played by the right stick of a right-handed drummer. Changing between ride and hi-hat, or between either and a &quot;leaner&quot; sound with neither, is often used to mark a change from one song section to another.

====Crashes====
Crash cymbals are usually the strongest accent markers within the kit, marking crescendos and climaxes, vocal entries, and major changes of mood, swells, and effects. A crash cymbal is often accompanied by a strong kick on the bass drum pedal, both for musical effect and to support the stroke. It provides a fuller sound and is a commonly taught technique.

In jazz, using the smallest kits and at very high volumes, ride cymbals may be played with the technique and sound of a crash cymbal. Some hi-hats will also give a useful crash, particularly thinner hats or those with a severe taper. Alternatively, specialized crash/ride and ride/crash cymbals are designed to combine both functions.

====Other cymbals====

=====Effects cymbals=====
All cymbals, other than rides, hi-hats, and crashes/splashes, are usually called effects cymbals when used in a drum kit, though this is a non-classical or colloquial designation that has become standardized. Most extended kits include one or more splash cymbals and at least one china cymbal. Major cymbal makers produce cymbal extension packs consisting of one splash and one china, or more rarely a second crash, a splash, and a china, to match some of their starter packs of ride, crash, and hi-hats. However, any combination of options can be found in the marketplace.

Some cymbals may be considered effects in some kits but &quot;basic&quot; in another set of components. Likewise, Ozone crashes have the same purpose as a standard crash cymbal, but are considered to be effects cymbals due to their rarity, and the holes cut into them, which provide a darker, more resonant attack.

=====Accent cymbals=====
Cymbals, of any type, used to provide an accent, rather than a regular pattern or groove, are known as accent cymbals. While any cymbal can be used to provide an accent, the term is more narrowly applied to cymbals for which the main purpose is to provide an accent. Accent cymbals include chime cymbals, small-bell domed cymbals, and those cymbals with a clear sonorous/oriental chime to them, such as specialized crash, splash, and china cymbals.

=====Low-volume cymbals=====
Low-volume cymbals are a specialty type of cymbal, made to produce about 80% less volume than a typical cymbal. The entire surface of the cymbal is perforated by holes. Drummers use low-volume cymbals to play in small venues or as a way to practice without disturbing others.

===Other acoustic instruments===
Other instruments that have regularly been incorporated into drum kits include:
* Wood block and cowbell, especially in classic rock and other genres.
* Tambourine, particularly mounted on the hi-hat stand above the cymbals; an ordinary tambourine can be used, or a tambourine produced specially for drum kit use.
* Timbales can be used to extend the range of tom-toms, particularly when the drummer owns them for other musical settings; a traditional timbale is tuned far higher than a tom of the same diameter, so the result is not always the most ideal.
* Keyboard percussion instruments, such as tubular bells or a glockenspiel.
* Gongs.
* Triangles.
* Found objects, including spanners, brake drums, buckets, cardboard boxes, washboards, oil barrels, and jam and kerosene tins (anything ordinary that can be struck to produce sounds, patterns, and grooves).

See also Extended kits below.

===Electronic drums===


Electronic drums are used for many reasons. Some drummers use electronic drums for playing in small venues, such as coffeehouses or church services, where a very low volume for the band is desired. Since fully electronic drums do not create any acoustic sound (apart from the quiet sound of the stick hitting the sensor pads), all of the drum sounds come from a keyboard amplifier or PA system; as such, the volume of electronic drums can be much lower than an acoustic kit. Some use electronic drums as practice instruments because they can be listened to with headphones, which enable a drummer to practice without disturbing others. Others use electronic drums to take advantage of the huge range of sounds that modern drum modules can produce, which range from sampled sounds of real drums, cymbals, and percussion instruments such as gongs or tubular bells that would be impractical to take to a small gig, to electronic and synthesized sounds, including non-instrument sounds such as ocean waves.

A fully electronic kit is easier to soundcheck than acoustic drums, assuming that the electronic drum module has levels that the drummer has preset in their practice room; in contrast, when an acoustic kit is sound checked, most drums and cymbals need to be mic&#x27;d and each mic needs to be tested by the drummer so its level and tone equalization can be adjusted by the sound engineer. Also, even after all the individual drum and cymbal mics are sound checked, the engineer needs to listen to the drummer play a standard groove, to check that the balance between the kit instruments is right. Finally, the engineer needs to set up the monitor mix for the drummer, which the drummer uses to hear their instruments and the instruments and vocals of the rest of the band. With a fully electronic kit, many of these steps can be eliminated.

Drummers&#x27; usage of electronic drum equipment can range from adding a single electronic pad to an entire drum kit (e.g., to have access to an instrument that might otherwise be impractical, such as a large gong), to using a mix of acoustic drums/cymbals and electronic pads, to using an acoustic kit in which the drums and cymbals have triggers, which can be used to sound electronic drums and other sounds, to having an exclusively electronic kit, which is often set up with the rubber or mesh drum pads and rubber &quot;cymbals&quot; in the usual drum kit locations. A fully electronic kit weighs much less and takes up less space to transport than an acoustic kit and it can be set up more quickly. One of the disadvantages of a fully electronic kit is that it may not have the same &quot;feel&quot; as an acoustic kit, and the drum sounds, even if they are high-quality samples, may not sound the same as acoustic drums.

Electronic drum pads are the second most widely used type of MIDI performance controllers, after electronic keyboards. Drum controllers may be built into drum machines, they may be standalone control surfaces (e.g., rubber drum pads), or they may emulate the look and feel of acoustic percussion instruments. The pads built into drum machines are typically too small and fragile to be played with sticks, so they are usually played with fingers. Dedicated drum pads such as the Roland Octapad or the DrumKAT are playable with hands or sticks and are often built to resemble the general form of acoustic drums. There are also percussion controllers such as the vibraphone-style MalletKAT, and Don Buchla&#x27;s Marimba Lumina.

MIDI triggers can also be installed into acoustic drum and percussion instruments. Pads that trigger a MIDI device can be homemade from a piezoelectric sensor and a practice pad or other piece of foam rubber, which is possible in two ways:

* Triggers are sensors that can be attached to acoustic drum kit components. In this way, an electronic drum sound will be produced when the instrument is played/struck, as well as the original acoustic sound, if so desired.
* Trigger pads can be mounted alongside other kit components. These pads make no significant acoustic sound themselves (if not modified to do otherwise), but are used purely to trigger the electronic sounds from the &quot;drum brain&quot;. They are played with the same drum sticks as are used on other drum kit components.

In either case, an electronic control unit (sound module/&quot;brain&quot;) with suitable sampled/modeled or synthesized drum sounds, amplification equipment (a PA system, keyboard amp, etc.), and stage monitor speakers are required to hear the electronically produced sounds. See Triggered drum kit.

A trigger pad could contain up to four independent sensors, each of them capable of sending information describing the timing and dynamic intensity of a stroke to the drum module/brain. A circular drum pad may have only one sensor for triggering, but a 2016-era cymbal-shaped rubber pad/cymbal will often contain two; one for the body and one for the bell at the center of the cymbal, and perhaps a cymbal choke trigger, to allow drummers to produce this effect.

Trigger sensors are most commonly used to replace the acoustic drum sounds, but they can also be used effectively with an acoustic kit to augment or supplement an instrument&#x27;s sound for the needs of the session or show. For example, in a live performance in a difficult acoustical space, a trigger may be placed on each drum or cymbal and used to trigger a similar sound on a drum module. These sounds are then amplified through a PA system so the audience can hear them, and they can be amplified to any level without the risks of audio feedback or bleed problems associated with microphones and PAs in certain settings.

The sound of electronic drums and cymbals themselves is heard by the drummer and possibly other musicians in close proximity, but, even so, the foldback (audio monitor) system is usually fed from the electronic sounds rather than the live acoustic sounds. The drums can be heavily dampened (made to resonate less or have the sound subdued), and their tuning and quality is less critical in the latter scenario. In this way, much of the atmosphere of the live performance is retained in a large venue, but without some of the problems associated with purely microphone-amplified drums. Triggers and sensors can also be used in conjunction with conventional or built-in microphones. If some components of a kit prove more difficult to mic than others (e.g., an excessively &quot;boomy&quot; low tom), triggers may be used on only the more difficult instruments, balancing out a drummer&#x27;s/band&#x27;s sound in the mix.

Trigger pads and drums, on the other hand, when deployed in a conventional set-up, are most commonly used to produce sounds not possible with an acoustic kit, or at least not with what is available. Any sound that can be sampled/recorded can be played when the pad is struck, by assigning the recorded sounds to specific triggers. Recordings or samples of barking dogs, sirens, breaking glass, and stereo recordings of aircraft taking off and landing have all been used. Along with the more obvious electronically generated drums, there are other sounds that (depending on the device used) can also be played/triggered by electronic drums.

====Virtual drums====
Virtual drums are a type of audio software that simulates the sound of a drum kit using synthesized drum kit sounds or digital samples of acoustic drum sounds. Different drum software products offer a recording function, the ability to select from several acoustically distinctive drum kits (e.g., jazz, rock, metal), as well as the option to incorporate different songs into the session. Some computer software can turn any hard surface into a virtual drum kit using only one microphone.

===Hardware===
Hardware is the name given to the metal stands that support the drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments. Generally, the term also includes the hi-hat pedal and clutch, and bass drum pedal or pedals, and the drum stool.

Hardware is carried along with sticks and other accessories in the traps case, and includes:
* Cymbal stands
* Hi-hat stand
* Floor tom legs
* Tom-tom drum brackets or arms
* Snare drum stand
* Bass drum pedal or pedals
* Drum key
* Assorted accessories such as spare washers, cymbal sleeves, wire snare cords, washers for tension rods, etc.

Many or even all of the stands may be replaced by a drum rack, which is particularly useful for large drum kits.

Drummers often set up their own drum hardware onstage and adjust it to their comfort level. Major bands on tour will often have a drum tech who knows how to set up the drummer&#x27;s hardware and instruments in the desired location and with the desired configuration.

==Common configurations==
Drum kits are traditionally categorized by the number of drums, ignoring cymbals and other instruments. Snare, tom-tom, and bass drums are always counted; other drums, such as octobans, may or may not be counted.

Traditionally, in America and the United Kingdom, drum sizes are expressed as &quot;depth x diameter&quot;, both measured in inches. Many drum kit manufacturers have recently been expressing sizes as &quot;diameter x depth&quot;, still in inches. For example, a hanging tom 12 inches in diameter and 8 inches deep would be described by Tama as 8 inches × 12 inches, but by Pearl as 12 inches × 8 inches, and a standard diameter Ludwig snare drum 5 inches deep is a 5-inch × 14-inch instrument, while the UK&#x27;s Premier Manufacturer offers the same dimensions as a 14-inch × 5-inch snare. The sizes of drums and cymbals given below are typical. Many instruments differ slightly or radically from them. Where no size is given, it is because there is too much variety to give a typical size.

===Three-piece===
A conventional three-piece kit consists of a bass drum, snare drum (14&quot; diameter), hi-hat (12–14&quot;), hanging tom (12 x 8-9&quot; depth), and a suspended 14&quot;–18&quot; cymbal, the latter two mounted on the bass drum. These kits were most common in the 1950s and 1960s. 

It is a common configuration for children.

===Four-piece===
A four-piece kit adds a second mounted tom (a notable user is Chris Frantz of Talking Heads) which displaces the cymbal. It is 10&quot; diameter and 8&quot; deep for fusion, or 13&quot; diameter and one inch deeper than for the 12&quot; diameter tom. Otherwise, a 14&quot; diameter hanging tom is added to the 12&quot;, both being 8&quot; deep. In any case, both toms are most often mounted on the bass drum with the smaller of the two next to the hi-hats (which are to the left for a right-handed drummer). 

Typically another cymbal is added, so there are separate ride and crash, either on two stands, or with the ride mounted on the bass drum to the player&#x27;s right and the crash on a separate stand. The standard crash is a 16&quot; diameter, and 18&quot;–20&quot; ride (20&quot; being the most common).

These kits are particularly useful for smaller venues, where space is limited, such as coffeehouses, cafés, hotel lounges, and small pubs.
====Four piece with floor tom====
When a floor tom is added rather than a mounted tom to make a four-piece kit, the floor tom is usually 14&quot; for jazz, and 16&quot; otherwise. This configuration is common in jazz and rock. Notable users include Ringo Starr of The Beatles, Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, John Barbata of the Turtles, and numerous jazz drummers throughout the 20th century including Art Blakey, Buddy Rich, and Jo Jones. For jazz, which normally emphasizes the use of a ride cymbal for swing patterns, the lack of second hanging tom in a four-piece kit allows the cymbal to be positioned closer to the drummer, making it easier to play.

===Five-piece===
The five-piece kit is the full-size kit and is the most common configuration used across various genres and styles. It adds a third tom to the four-piece kit, making for three toms in all. A fusion kit will normally add a 14&quot; tom, either a floor tom or a hanging tom on a stand to the right of the bass drum; in either case, making the tom lineup 10&quot;, 12&quot; and 14&quot;. Having three toms enables drummers to have high-, middle-, and low-pitched toms, which gives them more options for fills and solos.

Other kits will normally have 12&quot; and 13&quot; hanging toms and either a 14&quot; hanging tom on a stand, a 14&quot; floor tom, or a 16&quot; floor tom. It is common to have 10&quot; and 12&quot; hanging toms, with a 16&quot; floor tom. This configuration is often called a hybrid setup. The bass drum is most commonly 22&quot; in diameter, but rock kits may use 24&quot;, fusion 20&quot;, jazz 18&quot;, and, in larger bands, up to 26&quot;. A second crash cymbal is common, typically an inch or two larger or smaller than the 16&quot; one, with the larger of the two to the right for a right-handed drummer. A big band drummer may use crashes up to 20&quot; and a ride up to 24&quot; or, very rarely, 26&quot;. A rock kit may also substitute a larger ride cymbal or larger hi-hats, typically 22&quot; for the ride and 15&quot; for the hats.

Most five-piece kits, except for entry-level, also have one or more effects cymbals. Adding cymbals beyond the basic ride, hi-hats, and one-crash configuration requires more stands, in addition to the standard drum hardware packs. Because of this, many higher-cost kits for professionals are sold with little or no hardware, to allow the drummer to choose the stands and bass drum pedal they prefer. At the other extreme, many inexpensive, entry-level kits are sold as a five-piece kit complete with two cymbal stands, most often one straight and one boom, and some even with a standard cymbal pack, a stool, and a pair of 5A drum sticks. In the 2010s, digital kits were often offered in a five-piece kit, usually with one plastic crash cymbal trigger and one ride cymbal trigger. Fully electronic drums do not produce any acoustic sound beyond the quiet tapping of sticks on the plastic or rubber heads. Their trigger-pads are wired up to a synth module or sampler.

===Small kits===
If the toms are omitted completely, or the bass drum is replaced by a pedal-operated beater on the bottom skin of a floor tom and the hanging toms omitted, the result is a two-piece cocktail drum kit, originally developed for cocktail lounge acts. Such kits are particularly favored in musical genres such as trad jazz, bebop, rockabilly, and jump blues. Some rockabilly kits and beginner kits for very young players omit the hi-hat stand. In rockabilly, this allows the drummer to play standing rather than seated. A very simple jazz kit for informal or amateur jam sessions consists of a bass drum, snare drum, and hi-hat, often with only a single cymbal (normally a ride, with or without sizzlers).

Although these kits may be small with respect to the number of drums used, the drums themselves are most often of normal size, or even larger in the case of the bass drum. Kits using smaller drums, in both smaller and larger configurations, are for particular uses, such as boutique kits designed to reduce the visual impact of a large kit, kits that need to fit into small spaces in coffeehouses, traveling kits to reduce luggage volume, and junior kits for very young players. Smaller drums also tend to be quieter, again suiting smaller venues, and many of these kits extend this with extra muffling, which allows for quiet or even silent practice.

===Extended kits===

Common extensions beyond the standard configurations include:
* Effects cymbals, particularly splash cymbals and china cymbals
* Double bass drums or a double bass pedal are standard for some genres, particularly heavy metal music
* Extra hanging or rack toms
* Extra crash cymbals
* A crash/ride cymbal, in addition to the main ride cymbal
* A second floor tom, either larger or smaller than the first
* One or more octobans, or a pair of timbales
* A second pair of hi-hats mounted as cable hats or x-hats
* Cymbal stacks
* Different types of gongs
* Multiple ride cymbals; a sizzle cymbal, thinner and larger than the main ride, was once common as a second ride or crash/ride, even in a four-piece kit, but is now less so (jazz drummers, however, may still have two or more ride cymbals, even as part of a small kit).
* An additional electronic sound module or sequencer

See also other acoustic instruments above. Another versatile extension becoming increasingly common is the use of some electronic drums in a mainly acoustic kit.

Less common extensions found particularly, but not exclusively, in very large kits, include:
* Multiple snare drums, usually in the form of side snares. A side snare is usually positioned to the left of the drummer (opposite the floor toms and to the left of the hi hat). Side snares are used, similarly to effects cymbals, when an additional and different sound is required. Generally only one side snare is used in a kit, if any at all.
* Multiple bass drums beyond the double bass drum setup
* Gong drums (single-headed bass drums, played with sticks or mallets)
* Sets of gongs, tuned or untuned
* Sound effects such as a thunder sheet
* One or more crotales
* Instruments &quot;borrowed&quot; from orchestral percussion, such as timpani
* Instruments &quot;borrowed&quot; from marching band percussion, such as the tuned bass drums used in the drumline

==Accessories==

===Sticks===

Sticks are traditionally made from wood (particularly maple, hickory, and oak), but more recently, metal, carbon fiber, and other materials have been used for sticks. The prototypical wooden drum stick was primarily designed for use with the snare drum, and optimized for playing snare rudiments. Sticks come in a variety of weights and tip designs; 7N is a common jazz stick with a nylon tip, while a 5B is a common wood tipped stick, heavier than a 7N but with a similar profile, and a common standard for beginners. Numbers range from 1 (heaviest) to 10 (lightest).

The meanings of both numbers and letters vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, and some sticks are not described using this system at all, just being known as &quot;Smooth Jazz&quot; (typically a 7N or 9N) or &quot;Speed Rock&quot; (typically a 2B or 3B) for example. Many famous drummers endorse sticks made to their particular preference and sold under their signature.

Besides drumsticks, drummers will also use brushes and Rutes in jazz and similar soft music. More rarely, other beaters such as cartwheel mallets (known to kit drummers as &quot;soft sticks&quot;) may be used. It is not uncommon for rock drummers to use the &quot;wrong&quot; (butt) end of a stick for a heavier sound; some makers produce tipless sticks with two butt ends.

A stick bag is the standard way for a drummer to bring drumsticks to a live performance. For easy access, the stick bag is commonly mounted on the side of the floor tom, just within reach of the drummer&#x27;s right hand, for a right-handed drummer.

===Muffles===
Drum muffles are types of mutes that can reduce the ring, boomy overtone frequencies, or overall volume on a snare, bass, or tom. Controlling the ring is useful in studio or live settings when unwanted frequencies can clash with other instruments in the mix. There are internal and external muffling devices which rest on the inside or outside of the drumhead, respectively. Common types of mufflers include muffling rings, gels and duct tape, and improvised methods, such as placing a wallet near the edge of the head. Some drummers muffle the sound of a drum by putting a cloth over the drumhead.

Snare drum and tom-tom
Typical ways to muffle a snare or tom include placing an object on the outer edge of the drumhead. A piece of cloth, a wallet, gel, or fitted rings made of mylar are common objects. Also used are external clip-on muffles. Internal mufflers that lie on the inside of the drumhead are often built into a drum, but are generally considered less effective than external muffles, as they stifle the initial tone, rather than simply reducing its sustain.

Bass drum
Muffling the bass can be achieved with the same muffling techniques as for the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly muffled by adding pillows, a sleeping bag, or other soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows the manipulation of internally placed muffling. The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.

Silencers/mutes
Another type of drum muffler is a piece of rubber that fits over the entire drumhead or cymbal. It interrupts contact between the stick and the head, which dampens the sound. They are typically used in practice settings.

Cymbals are usually muted with the fingers or hand, to reduce the length or volume of ringing (e.g., the cymbal choke technique which is a key part of heavy metal drumming). Cymbals can also be muted with special rubber rings or duct tape.

Historical uses
Muffled drums are often associated with funeral ceremonies as well, such as the funerals of Queen Victoria and John F. Kennedy. The use of muffled drums has been written about by such poets as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Mayne, and Theodore O&#x27;Hara. Drums have also been used for therapy and learning purposes, such as when an experienced player will sit with a number of students and by the end of the session have all of them relaxed and playing complex rhythms.

===Stick holder===
There are various types of stick holder accessories, including bags that can be attached to a drum and angled sheath-style stick holders, which can hold a single pair of sticks.

===Sizzlers===
A sizzler is a metal chain, or combination of chains, that is hung across a cymbal, creating a distinctive metallic sound when the cymbal is struck, similar to that of a sizzle cymbal. Using a sizzler is the non-destructive alternative to drilling holes in a cymbal and putting metal rivets in the holes. Another benefit of using a &quot;sizzler&quot; chain is that the chain is removable, with the cymbal being easily returned to its normal sound.

Some sizzlers feature pivoting arms that allow the chains to be quickly lowered onto, or raised from, the cymbal, allowing the effect to be used for some songs and removed for others.

===Cases===

Three types of protective covers are common for kit drums:
* Drum bags are made from robust cloth such as cordura or from cloth-backed vinyl. They give minimal protection from bumps and impacts, but they do protect drums and cymbals from precipitation. They are adequate for drums transported in private vehicles to local gigs and sessions. They are often the only option for young drummers who are just starting out.
* Mid-price hard cases are of similar construction to suitcases, commonly made of fiber composite. The offer more protection from bumps than cloth bags.
* Flight cases or road cases are standard for professional touring drummers.

As with all musical instruments, the best protection is provided by a combination of a hard-shelled case with interior padding, such as foam, next to the drums and cymbals.

===Microphones===
Microphones (&quot;mics&quot;) are used with drum kits to pick up the sound of the drums and cymbals for a sound recording and/or to pick up the sound of the drum kit so that it can be amplified through a PA system or sound reinforcement system. While most drummers use microphones and amplification in live shows, so that the sound engineer can adjust the levels of the drums and cymbals, some bands that play quieter genres of music and in small venues, such as coffeehouses, play acoustically, without mics or PA amplification. Small jazz groups, such as jazz quartets or organ trios that are playing in a small bar, will often just use acoustic drums. Of course, if the same small jazz groups play on the mainstage of a big jazz festival, the drums will be miced so that they can be adjusted in the sound system mix. A middle-ground approach is used by some bands that play in small venues: they do not mic every drum and cymbal, but only the instruments that the sound engineer wants to be able to control in the mix, such as the bass drum and the snare.

In miking a drum kit, dynamic microphones, which can handle high sound-pressure levels, are usually used to close-mic drums, which is predominantly the way to mic drums for live shows. Condenser microphones are used for overheads and room mics, an approach which is more common with sound recording applications. Close miking of drums may be done using stands or by mounting the microphones on the rims of the drums, or even using microphones built into the drum itself, which eliminates the need for stands for such microphones, reducing both clutter and set-up time, as well as better isolating them.

For some styles of music, drummers use electronic effects on drums, such as individual noise gates that mute the attached microphone when the signal is below a threshold volume. This allows the sound engineer to use a higher overall volume for the drum kit by reducing the number of &quot;active&quot; mics which could produce unwanted feedback at any one time. When a drum kit is entirely miked and amplified through the sound reinforcement system, the drummer or the sound engineer can add other electronic effects to the drum sound, such as reverb or digital delay.

Some drummers arrive at the venue with their drum kit and use the mics and mic stands provided by the venue&#x27;s sound engineer. Other drummers bring all their own mics, or selected mics (e.g., good-quality snare and bass drum mics), to ensure that they have good quality mics on hand. In bars and nightclubs, the microphones supplied by the venue can sometimes be in substandard condition, due to the heavy use they experience.

===Monitors===
Drummers using electronic drums, drum machines, or hybrid acoustic-electric kits (which blend traditional acoustic drums and cymbals with electronic pads) typically use a monitor speaker, keyboard amplifier, or even a small PA system to hear the electronic drum sounds. Even a drummer playing entirely acoustic drums may use a monitor speaker to hear the drums, especially if playing in a loud rock or metal band, where there is substantial onstage volume from large, powerful guitar stacks. Drummers are often given a large speaker cabinet with a 15&quot; subwoofer to help them monitor their bass drum sound (along with a full-range monitor speaker to hear the rest of their kit). Some sound engineers and drummers prefer to use an electronic vibration system, colloquially known as a &quot;butt shaker&quot; or &quot;throne thumper&quot; to monitor the bass drum, because this lowers the stage volume. With a &quot;butt shaker&quot;, the &quot;thump&quot; of each bass drum strike causes a vibration in the drum stool; this way the drummer &quot;feels&quot; their beat on the posterior, rather than hears it.

In-Ear Monitors are also popular among drummers since they also work as earplugs.

===Bass drum gear===
A number of accessories are designed for the bass drum. The bass drum can take advantage of the bass reflex speaker design, in which a tuned port (a hole and a carefully measured tube) are put in a speaker enclosure to improve the bass response at the lowest frequencies. Bass drumhead patches protect the drumhead from the impact of the felt beater. Bass drum pillows are fabric bags with filling or stuffing that can be used to alter the tone or resonance of the bass drum. A less expensive alternative to using a specialized bass drum pillow is to use an old sleeping bag.

===Gloves===
Some drummers wear special drummer&#x27;s gloves to improve their grip on the sticks when they play. Drumming gloves often have a textured grip surface made of a synthetic or rubber material and mesh or vents on the parts of the glove not used to hold sticks, to ventilate perspiration. Some drummers wear gloves to prevent blisters.

===Drum screen===
In some styles or settings—such as country music clubs or churches, small venues, or when a live recording is being made—the drummer may use a transparent Perspex or Plexiglas &quot;drum screen&quot; (also known as a &quot;drum shield&quot;) to dampen the onstage volume of the drums. A screen that completely surrounds the drum kit is known as a &quot;drum booth&quot;. In live sound applications, drum shields are used so that the audio engineer can have more control over the volume of drums that the audience hears through the PA system mix, or to reduce the overall volume of the drums, as a way to reduce the overall volume of the band. In some recording studios, foam and fabric baffles are used in addition to, or in place of, clear panels. The drawback with foam/cloth baffle panels is that the drummer cannot see well other performers, the record producer, or the audio engineer.

===Carpets===
Drummers often bring a carpet, mats, or rugs to venues to prevent the bass drum and hi-hat stand from &quot;crawling&quot; (moving away) on a slippery surface, which can be caused by the drum head striking the bass drum. The carpet also reduces short reverberations (which is generally but not always an advantage), and helps to prevent damage to the flooring or floor coverings. In shows where multiple drummers will bring their kits onstage over the night, it is common for drummers to mark the location of their stands and pedals with tape, to allow for quicker positioning of a kit to a drummer&#x27;s accustomed position. Bass drums and hi-hat stands commonly have retractable spikes, to help them grip surfaces such as carpet, or rubber feet, to remain stationary on hard surfaces.

===Practice equipment===
Drummers use a variety of accessories when practicing. Metronomes and beat counters are used to develop a sense of a steady beat. Drum muffling pads may be used to lessen the volume of drums during practicing. A practice pad, held on the lap, on a leg, or mounted on a stand, is used for near-silent practice with drumsticks. A set of practice pads mounted to simulate an entire drum kit is known as a practice kit. In the 2010s, these have largely been superseded by electronic drums, which can be listened to with headphones for quiet practice and by kits with non-sounding mesh heads.

===Tuning equipment===

Drummers use a drum key for tuning their drums and adjusting some drum hardware. Besides the basic type of drum key (a T-handled wrench) there are various tuning wrenches and tools. Basic drum keys are divided into three types which allows for tuning of three types of tuning screws on drums: square (most used), slotted, and hexagonal. Ratchet-type wrenches allow high-tension drums to be tuned easily. Spin keys (utilizing a ball joint) allow for rapid head changing. Torque-wrench keys are available, graphically revealing the torque given to each lug. Also, tension gauges, or meters, which are set on the head, aid drummers to achieve a consistent tuning. Drummers can tune drums &quot;by ear&quot; or use a digital drum tuner, which &quot;measures tympanic pressure&quot; on the drumhead to provide accurate tuning.

===Notation and improvisation===

Drum kit music is either written in music notation (called &quot;drum parts&quot;), learned and played by ear, improvised, or some combination of any of all three of these methods. Professional session musician drummers and big-band drummers are often required to read drum parts. Drum parts are most commonly written on a standard five-line staff. As of 2016, a special &quot;percussion clef&quot; is used, while previously the bass clef was used. However, even if the bass, or no, clef is used, each line and space is assigned an instrument in the kit, rather than a pitch. In jazz, traditional music, folk music, rock music, and pop music, drummers are expected to be able to learn songs by ear (from a recording or from another musician who is playing or singing the song) and improvise. The degree of improvisation differs among different styles. Jazz and jazz fusion drummers may have lengthy improvised solos in every song. In rock music and blues, there are also drum solos in some songs, although they tend to be shorter than those in jazz. Drummers in all popular music and traditional music styles are expected to be able to improvise accompaniment parts to songs, once they are told the genre or style (e.g., shuffle, ballad, blues).

===Recording===
On early recording media (until 1925), such as wax cylinders and discs carved with an engraving needle, sound balancing meant that musicians had to be moved back in the room. Drums were often put far from the horn (part of the mechanical transducer) to reduce sound distortion.

In the 2020s, drum parts in many popular music styles are often recorded apart from the other instruments and singers, using multitrack recording techniques. Once the drums are recorded, the other instruments (rhythm guitar, piano, etc.), and then vocals, are added. To ensure that the drum tempo is consistent at this type of recording, the drummer usually plays along with a click track (a type of digital metronome) in headphones. The ability to play accurately along with a click track has become an important skill for professional drummers.

<doc id="9080" wikidata="Q303490" url="?curid=9080" title="Dying Earth">
<text>Dying Earth is a speculative fiction series by the American author Jack Vance, comprising four books originally published from 1950 to 1984.
Some have been called picaresque. They vary from short story collections to a fix-up (novel created from older short stories), perhaps all the way to novel.

The first book in the series, &quot;The Dying Earth&quot;, was ranked number 16 of 33 &quot;All Time Best Fantasy Novels&quot; by &quot;Locus&quot; in 1987, based on a poll of subscribers, although it was marketed as a collection and the Internet Speculative Fiction Database (ISFDB) calls it a &quot;loosely connected series of stories&quot;.

The &quot;Dying Earth&quot; series has been described as a &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; series, as the plots of the various stories often revolve around picaresque exploits, swordplay, and magic.

==Setting==
The stories of the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; series are set in the distant future, at a point when the sun is almost exhausted and magic has asserted itself as a dominant force. The Moon has disappeared and the Sun is in danger of burning out at any time, often flickering as if about to go out, before shining again. The various civilizations of Earth have collapsed for the most part into decadence or religious fanaticism and its inhabitants overcome with a fatalistic outlook. The Earth is mostly barren and cold, and has become infested with various predatory monsters (possibly created by a magician in a former age).

Magic in the Dying Earth is performed by memorizing syllables, and the human brain can only accommodate a certain number at once. When a spell is used, the syllables vanish from the caster&#x27;s mind. Creatures called sandestins can be summoned and used to perform more complex actions, but are considered dangerous to rely upon. Magic has loose links to the science of old, and advanced mathematics is treated like arcane lore.

The Dying Earth exists alongside several Overworlds and Underworlds. These help add a sense of profound longing and entrapment to the series. While humans can, with relative ease, physically travel to the horrific Underworlds (as Cugel does on several occasions, to his dismay) the vast majority of the population are only capable of mentally visiting the wondrous Overworlds through rare artifacts (e.g. through the &quot;Eyes of the Overworld&quot;) or dangerous magic phenomena (such as the ship Cugel encounters in the deserts). Though they can look at the wonders and pretend they are really there, humans can never truly inhabit or escape to these utopias as their physical bodies remain stuck on the Dying Earth and will die with the sun regardless. These siren-like visions of paradise lead to the deaths, insanity, and suffering of many, especially during Cugel&#x27;s journeys.

While most remaining civilizations on the Dying Earth are utterly unique in their customs and cultures, there are some common threads. Because the moon is gone and wind is often weak (the sun no longer heats the earth as much) the oceans are largely placid bodies of water with no tide and tiny waves. To cross them, boats are propelled by giant sea-worms. These worms are cared for and controlled by &quot;Wormingers&quot;. In addition, the manses of magicians, protected by walls and spells and monsters, are relatively common sights in inhabited lands.

==Origins==

Vance wrote the stories of the first book while he served in the United States Merchant Marine during World War II. In the late 1940s several of his other stories were published in magazines.

Science fiction historian Brian Stableford has noted the influence of Clark Ashton Smith and his &quot;Zothique&quot; stories on the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; series. 
According to pulp editor Sam Merwin, Vance&#x27;s earliest magazine submissions in the 1940s were heavily influenced by the style of James Branch Cabell. Fantasy historian Lin Carter has noted several probable lasting influences of Cabell on Vance&#x27;s work, and suggests that the early &quot;pseudo-Cabell&quot; experiments bore fruit in &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; (1950).

==Series==

The series comprises four books by Vance and some sequels by other authors that may be or may not have been canonical.

* &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; — 1950 collection of original, related stories
* &quot;The Eyes of the Overworld&quot; — 1966 fix-up
* &quot;Cugel&#x27;s Saga&quot; — 1983 novel
* &quot;Rhialto the Marvellous&quot; — 1984 collection of related stories and one canonical essay

One 741-page omnibus edition has been issued as &quot;The Compleat Dying Earth&quot; (SF Book Club, 1999) and in both the US and UK as &quot;Tales of the Dying Earth&quot; (2000).

===Stories by Vance===

All four books were published with Tables of Contents, the first and fourth as collections. The second and third contained mostly material previously published in short story form but were marketed as novels, the second as a fix-up and the third without acknowledging any previous publication.

# &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; (the author&#x27;s preferred title is &quot;Mazirian the Magician&quot;) was openly a collection of six stories, all original, although written during Vance&#x27;s war service. ISFDB calls them &quot;slightly connected&quot; and catalogs the last as a novella (17,500 to 40,000 word count).
## &quot;Turjan of Miir&quot;
## &quot;Mazirian the Magician&quot;
## &quot;T&#x27;sais&quot;
## &quot;Liane the Wayfarer&quot; (also known as &quot;The Loom of Darkness&quot;)
## &quot;Ulan Dhor Ends a Dream&quot; (also known as &quot;Ulan Dhor&quot;)
## &quot;Guyal of Sfere&quot; (it mentions a &quot;Lost Book of Kells&quot;, but a later publishing changed the name as there is a Book of Kells)
# &quot;The Eyes of the Overworld&quot; (the author&#x27;s preferred title is &quot;Cugel the Clever&quot;) was a fix-up of six stories, presented as seven. All were novelettes by word count (7500 to 17,500). Five were previously published as noted here.
## &quot;The Overworld&quot;, from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; December 1965
## &quot;Cil&quot; (1966), the original component
## &quot;The Mountains of Magnatz&quot;, from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; February 1966
## &quot;The Sorcerer Pharesm&quot;, from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; April 1966
## &quot;The Pilgrims&quot;, from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; June 1966
## &quot;The Cave in the Forest&quot;, originally the first part of &quot;The Manse of Iucounu&quot;
## &quot;The Manse of Iucounu&quot;, from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; July 1966
# &quot;Cugel&#x27;s Saga&quot; (the author&#x27;s preferred title is &quot;Cugel: The Skybreak Spatterlight&quot;) was marketed as a novel. ISFDB calls it &quot;[t]wice as large and less episodic than &quot;The Eyes of the Overworld&quot;&quot; but qualifies that label. &quot;This is marketed as a novel, but there is a table of contents, and some of the parts were previously published (although none are acknowledged thus).&quot; It catalogs previous publication of three chapters without remark on the degree of revision.
## &quot;Flutic&quot;, the first part of the first chapter, published separately in the Italian anthology &quot;Fantasy&quot; (March 1996) and rereleased in English in &quot;Coup de Grace and Other Stories&quot;, a sampler of the Vance Integral Edition
## &quot;The Inn of Blue Lamps&quot;
## &quot;Aboard the Galante&quot;
## &quot;Lausicaa&quot;
## &quot;The Ocean of Sighs&quot;
## &quot;The Columns&quot;
## &quot;Faucelme&quot;
## &quot;On the Docks&quot;
## &quot;The Caravan&quot;
## &quot;The Seventeen Virgins&quot;, from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; October 1974
## &quot;The Bagful of Dreams&quot;, from &quot;Flashing Swords #4&quot;, ed. Lin Carter, May 1977
## &quot;The Four Wizards&quot;
## &quot;Spatterlight&quot;
# &quot;Rhialto the Marvellous&quot; was marketed as a collection, a Foreword and three stories, one previously published. The Foreword is non-narrative canonical fiction presenting the general state of the world in the 21st Aeon (a &quot;short story&quot; loosely).
## &quot;Foreword&quot;, with list of players
## &quot;The Murthe&quot;
## &quot;Fader&#x27;s Waft&quot;
## &quot;Morreion&quot;, from &quot;Flashing Swords! #1&quot;, ed. Lin Carter, April 1973

=== Sequels ===
Some sequels have been written by other authors, either with Vance&#x27;s authorization or as tributes to his work.

Michael Shea&#x27;s first publication, the novel &quot;A Quest for Simbilis&quot; (DAW Books, 1974, ), was an authorized sequel to &quot;Eyes&quot;. However, &quot;When Vance returned to the milieu, his &quot;Cugel&#x27;s Saga&quot; continued the events of &quot;The Eyes of the Overworld&quot; in a different direction.&quot;

The tribute anthology &quot;Songs of the Dying Earth&quot; (2009) contains short fiction set in the world of the Dying Earth by numerous writers alongside tributes to Vance&#x27;s work and influence.

In 2010 Shea wrote another authorized story belonging to the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; series and featuring Cugel as one of characters: &quot;Hew the Tintmaster&quot;, published in the anthology &quot;Swords &amp; Dark Magic: The New Sword and Sorcery&quot;, ed. Jonathan Strahan and Lou Anders (Eos, 2010, pp. 323–362).

=== Translations ===
WorldCat contributing libraries report holding all four books in French, Spanish, and (in omnibus edition) Hebrew translations; and report holding &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; in five other languages: Finnish, German, Japanese, Polish, and Russian.

The whole first volume (of six stories) has been translated also into Esperanto together with two Cugel stories and made available on-line as e-books by a long-time fan and Vance Integral Edition co-worker. Permission to translate and distribute (only into Esperanto) was obtained informally direct from the author and, since his death in 2013, continues with ongoing permission from the author&#x27;s estate. To date these are three: &quot;Mazirian the Magician&quot;, &quot;The Sorcerer Pharesm&quot;, and &quot;The Bagful of Dreams&quot; available for free download as EPub, Mobi and PDF.

The entire series has seen several Italian translations, and in Italy Vance remains one of the US scifi authors most often translated and published 

== Legacy ==
The Dying Earth subgenre of science fiction is named in recognition of Vance&#x27;s role in standardizing a setting, the entropically dying earth and sun. Its importance was recognized with the publication of &quot;Songs of the Dying Earth&quot;, a tribute anthology edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois (Subterranean, 2009). Each short story in the anthology is set on the Dying Earth, and concludes with a short acknowledgement by the author of Vance&#x27;s influence on them.

===Print===
Gene Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot; (1980–83) is set in a slightly similar world, and was written under Vance&#x27;s influence. Wolfe suggested in &quot;The Castle of the Otter&quot;, a collection of essays, that he inserted the book &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; into his fictional world under the title &quot;The Book of Gold&quot; (specifically, Wolfe wrote that the &quot;Book of Gold&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot; is different for each reader, but for him it was &quot;The Dying Earth&quot;). Wolfe has extended the series.

Michael Shea&#x27;s novel &quot;Nifft the Lean&quot; (1982), his second book eight years after &quot;A Quest for Simbilis&quot;, also owes much debt to Vance&#x27;s creation, since the protagonist of the story is a petty thief (not unlike Cugel the Clever), who travels and struggles in an exotic world. Shea returned to Nifft with 1997 and 2000 sequels.

The Archonate stories by Matthew Hughes — the 1994 novel &quot;Fools Errant&quot; and numerous works in this millennium —
take place in &quot;the penultimate age of Old Earth,&quot; a period of science and technology that is on the verge of transforming into the magical era of the time of the Dying Earth.
Booklist has called him Vance&#x27;s &quot;heir apparent.&quot; (Review by Carl Hays of The Gist Hunter and Other Stories, Booklist, August 2005)

===Role-playing===

The original creators of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games were fans of Jack Vance and incorporated many aspects of the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; series into the game. The magic system, in which a wizard is limited in the number of spells that can be simultaneously remembered and forgets them once they are cast, was based on the magic of Dying Earth. In role-playing game circles, this sort of magic system is called &quot;Vancian&quot; or &quot;Vancean&quot;. Some of the spells from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; are based on spells mentioned in the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; series, such as the &quot;prismatic spray&quot;. Magic items from the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; stories such as ioun stones also made their way into &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. One of the deities of magic in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is named Vecna, an anagram of &quot;Vance&quot;.

The &quot;Talislanta&quot; role-playing game designed by Stephan Michael Sechi and originally published in 1987 by Bard Games was inspired by the works of Jack Vance so much so that the first release, &quot;The Chronicles of Talislanta&quot;, is dedicated to the author.

There is an official &quot;Dying Earth&quot; role-playing game published by Pelgrane Press with an occasional magazine &quot;The Excellent Prismatic Spray&quot; (named after a magic spell). The game situates players in Vance&#x27;s world populated by desperately extravagant people. Many other role-playing settings pay homage to the series by including fantasy elements he invented such as the darkness-dwelling Grues.

Monte Cook identifies &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; as an inspiration for his game &quot;Numenera&quot;.

&quot;Goodman Games&quot; have announced the publication of the setting using their &quot;Dungeon Crawl Classics&quot; roleplaying game system, running a successful &quot;Kickstarter&quot; campaign for it. The game was released in 2023.

<doc id="9082" wikidata="Q5282696" url="?curid=9082" title="Dispute resolution">
<text>Dispute resolution or dispute settlement is the process of resolving disputes between parties. The term &quot;dispute resolution&quot; is &quot;conflict resolution&quot; through legal means. 

Prominent venues for dispute settlement in international law include the International Court of Justice (formerly the Permanent Court of International Justice); the United Nations Human Rights Committee (which operates under the ICCPR) and European Court of Human Rights; the Panels and Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization; and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Half of all international agreements include a dispute settlement mechanism.

States are also known to form their own arbitration tribunals to settle disputes. Prominent private international courts, which adjudicate disputes between commercial private entities, include the International Court of Arbitration (of the International Chamber of Commerce) and the London Court of International Arbitration.

==Methods==
Methods of dispute resolution include:
* lawsuits (litigation) (legislative) 
* arbitration
* collaborative law
* mediation
* conciliation
* negotiation
* facilitation
*avoidance

One could theoretically include violence or even war as part of this spectrum, but dispute resolution practitioners do not usually do so; violence rarely ends disputes effectively, and indeed, often only escalates them. Also, violence rarely causes the parties involved in the dispute to no longer disagree on the issue that caused the violence. For example, a country successfully winning a war to annex part of another country&#x27;s territory does not cause the former waring nations to no longer seriously disagree to whom the territory rightly belongs to and tensions may still remain high between the two nations. 

Dispute resolution processes fall into two major types:
# Adjudicative processes, such as litigation or arbitration, in which a judge, jury or arbitrator determines the outcome.
# Consensual processes, such as collaborative law, mediation, conciliation, or negotiation, in which the parties attempt to reach agreement.

Not all disputes, even those in which skilled intervention occurs, end in resolution. Such intractable disputes form a special area in dispute resolution studies.

Dispute resolution is an important requirement in international trade, including negotiation, mediation, arbitration and litigation.

==Legal dispute resolution==
The legal system provides resolutions for many different types of disputes. Some disputants will not reach agreement through a collaborative process. Some disputes need the coercive power of the state to enforce a resolution. Perhaps more importantly, many people want a professional advocate when they become involved in a dispute, particularly if the dispute involves perceived legal rights, legal wrongdoing, or threat of legal action against them.

The most common form of judicial dispute resolution is litigation. Litigation is initiated when one party files suit against another. In the United States, litigation is facilitated by the government within federal, state, and municipal courts. While litigation is often used to resolve disputes, it is strictly speaking a form of conflict adjudication and not a form of conflict resolution per se. This is because litigation only determines the legal rights and obligations of parties involved in a dispute and does not necessarily solve the disagreement between the parties involved in the dispute. For example, supreme court cases can rule on whether US states have the constitutional right to criminalize abortion but will not cause the parties involved in the case to no longer disagree on whether states do indeed have the constitutional authority to restrict access to abortion as one of the parties may disagree with the supreme courts reasoning and still disagree with the party that the supreme court sided with. Litigation proceedings are very formal and are governed by rules, such as rules of evidence and procedure, which are established by the legislature. Outcomes are decided by an impartial judge and/or jury, based on the factual questions of the case and the application law. The verdict of the court is binding, not advisory; however, both parties have the right to appeal the judgment to a higher court. Judicial dispute resolution is typically adversarial in nature, for example, involving antagonistic parties or opposing interests seeking an outcome most favorable to their position. 

Due to the antagonistic nature of litigation, collaborators frequently opt for solving disputes privately. 

Retired judges or private lawyers often become arbitrators or mediators; however, trained and qualified non-legal dispute resolution specialists form a growing body within the field of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). In the United States, many states now have mediation or other ADR programs annexed to the courts, to facilitate settlement of lawsuits.

==Extrajudicial dispute resolution==
Some use the term &quot;dispute resolution&quot; to refer only to alternative dispute resolution (ADR), that is, extrajudicial processes such as arbitration, collaborative law, and mediation used to resolve conflict and potential conflict between and among individuals, business entities, governmental agencies, and (in the public international law context) states. ADR generally depends on agreement by the parties to use ADR processes, either before or after a dispute has arisen. ADR has experienced steadily increasing acceptance and utilization because of a perception of greater flexibility, costs below those of traditional litigation, and speedy resolution of disputes, among other perceived advantages. However, some have criticized these methods as taking away the right to seek redress of grievances in the courts, suggesting that extrajudicial dispute resolution may not offer the fairest way for parties not in an equal bargaining relationship, for example in a dispute between a consumer and a large corporation. In addition, in some circumstances, arbitration and other ADR processes may become as expensive as litigation or more so.

<doc id="9087" wikidata="Q638328" url="?curid=9087" title="Dynamical system">
<text>In mathematics, a dynamical system is a system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in an ambient space, such as in a parametric curve. Examples include the mathematical models that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, the random motion of particles in the air, and the number of fish each springtime in a lake. The most general definition unifies several concepts in mathematics such as ordinary differential equations and ergodic theory by allowing different choices of the space and how time is measured. Time can be measured by integers, by real or complex numbers or can be a more general algebraic object, losing the memory of its physical origin, and the space may be a manifold or simply a set, without the need of a smooth space-time structure defined on it.

At any given time, a dynamical system has a state representing a point in an appropriate state space. This state is often given by a tuple of real numbers or by a vector in a geometrical manifold. The &quot;evolution rule&quot; of the dynamical system is a function that describes what future states follow from the current state. Often the function is deterministic, that is, for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state. However, some systems are stochastic, in that random events also affect the evolution of the state variables.

The study of dynamical systems is the focus of &quot;dynamical systems theory&quot;, which has applications to a wide variety of fields such as mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, economics, history, and medicine. Dynamical systems are a fundamental part of chaos theory, logistic map dynamics, bifurcation theory, the self-assembly and self-organization processes, and the edge of chaos concept.

==Overview==
The concept of a dynamical system has its origins in Newtonian mechanics. There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is an implicit relation that gives the state of the system for only a short time into the future. (The relation is either a differential equation, difference equation or other time scale.) To determine the state for all future times requires iterating the relation many times—each advancing time a small step. The iteration procedure is referred to as &quot;solving the system&quot; or &quot;integrating the system&quot;. If the system can be solved, then, given an initial point, it is possible to determine all its future positions, a collection of points known as a &quot;trajectory&quot; or &quot;orbit&quot;.

Before the advent of computers, finding an orbit required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could be accomplished only for a small class of dynamical systems. Numerical methods implemented on electronic computing machines have simplified the task of determining the orbits of a dynamical system.

For simple dynamical systems, knowing the trajectory is often sufficient, but most dynamical systems are too complicated to be understood in terms of individual trajectories. The difficulties arise because:
* The systems studied may only be known approximately—the parameters of the system may not be known precisely or terms may be missing from the equations. The approximations used bring into question the validity or relevance of numerical solutions. To address these questions several notions of stability have been introduced in the study of dynamical systems, such as Lyapunov stability or structural stability. The stability of the dynamical system implies that there is a class of models or initial conditions for which the trajectories would be equivalent. The operation for comparing orbits to establish their equivalence changes with the different notions of stability.
* The type of trajectory may be more important than one particular trajectory. Some trajectories may be periodic, whereas others may wander through many different states of the system. Applications often require enumerating these classes or maintaining the system within one class. Classifying all possible trajectories has led to the qualitative study of dynamical systems, that is, properties that do not change under coordinate changes. Linear dynamical systems and systems that have two numbers describing a state are examples of dynamical systems where the possible classes of orbits are understood.
* The behavior of trajectories as a function of a parameter may be what is needed for an application. As a parameter is varied, the dynamical systems may have bifurcation points where the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system changes. For example, it may go from having only periodic motions to apparently erratic behavior, as in the transition to turbulence of a fluid.
* The trajectories of the system may appear erratic, as if random. In these cases it may be necessary to compute averages using one very long trajectory or many different trajectories. The averages are well defined for ergodic systems and a more detailed understanding has been worked out for hyperbolic systems. Understanding the probabilistic aspects of dynamical systems has helped establish the foundations of statistical mechanics and of chaos.

==History==

Many people regard French mathematician Henri Poincaré as the founder of dynamical systems. Poincaré published two now classical monographs, &quot;New Methods of Celestial Mechanics&quot; (1892–1899) and &quot;Lectures on Celestial Mechanics&quot; (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). These papers included the Poincaré recurrence theorem, which states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state very close to the initial state.

Aleksandr Lyapunov developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamical system.

In 1913, George David Birkhoff proved Poincaré&#x27;s &quot;Last Geometric Theorem&quot;, a special case of the three-body problem, a result that made him world-famous. In 1927, he published his &quot;Dynamical Systems&quot;. Birkhoff&#x27;s most durable result has been his 1931 discovery of what is now called the ergodic theorem. Combining insights from physics on the ergodic hypothesis with measure theory, this theorem solved, at least in principle, a fundamental problem of statistical mechanics. The ergodic theorem has also had repercussions for dynamics.

Stephen Smale made significant advances as well. His first contribution was the Smale horseshoe that jumpstarted significant research in dynamical systems. He also outlined a research program carried out by many others.

Oleksandr Mykolaiovych Sharkovsky developed Sharkovsky&#x27;s theorem on the periods of discrete dynamical systems in 1964. One of the implications of the theorem is that if a discrete dynamical system on the real line has a periodic point of period 3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.

In the late 20th century the dynamical system perspective to partial differential equations started gaining popularity. Palestinian mechanical engineer Ali H. Nayfeh applied nonlinear dynamics in mechanical and engineering systems. His pioneering work in applied nonlinear dynamics has been influential in the construction and maintenance of machines and structures that are common in daily life, such as ships, cranes, bridges, buildings, skyscrapers, jet engines, rocket engines, aircraft and spacecraft.

== Formal definition ==
In the most general sense,
a dynamical system is a tuple (&quot;T&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, Φ) where &quot;T&quot; is a monoid, written additively, &quot;X&quot; is a non-empty set and Φ is a function
:formula_1
with
:formula_2 (where formula_3 is the 2nd projection map)
and for any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;:
:formula_4
:formula_5 
for formula_6 and formula_7, where we have defined the set formula_8 for any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;.

In particular, in the case that formula_9 we have for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; that formula_10 and thus that Φ defines a monoid action of &quot;T&quot; on &quot;X&quot;.

The function Φ(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;x&quot;) is called the evolution function of the dynamical system: it associates to every point &quot;x&quot; in the set &quot;X&quot; a unique image, depending on the variable &quot;t&quot;, called the evolution parameter. &quot;X&quot; is called phase space or state space, while the variable &quot;x&quot; represents an initial state of the system.

We often write 
:formula_11
:formula_12
if we take one of the variables as constant. The function 
:formula_13
is called the flow through &quot;x&quot; and its graph is called the trajectory through &quot;x&quot;. The set
:formula_14
is called the orbit through &quot;x&quot;.
The orbit through &quot;x&quot; is the image of the flow through &quot;x&quot;.
A subset &quot;S&quot; of the state space &quot;X&quot; is called Φ-invariant if for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot; and all &quot;t&quot; in &quot;T&quot;
:formula_15
Thus, in particular, if &quot;S&quot; is Φ-invariant, formula_16 for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. That is, the flow through &quot;x&quot; must be defined for all time for every element of &quot;S&quot;.

More commonly there are two classes of definitions for a dynamical system: one is motivated by ordinary differential equations and is geometrical in flavor; and the other is motivated by ergodic theory and is measure theoretical in flavor.

=== Geometrical definition ===
In the geometrical definition, a dynamical system is the tuple formula_17. formula_18 is the domain for time – there are many choices, usually the reals or the integers, possibly restricted to be non-negative. formula_19 is a manifold, i.e. locally a Banach space or Euclidean space, or in the discrete case a graph. &quot;f&quot; is an evolution rule &quot;t&quot; → &quot;f&quot; &quot;t&quot; (with formula_20) such that &quot;f t&quot; is a diffeomorphism of the manifold to itself. So, f is a &quot;smooth&quot; mapping of the time-domain formula_21 into the space of diffeomorphisms of the manifold to itself. In other terms, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a diffeomorphism, for every time &quot;t&quot; in the domain formula_21 .

A &quot;real dynamical system&quot;, &quot;real-time dynamical system&quot;, &quot;continuous time dynamical system&quot;, or &quot;flow&quot; is a tuple (&quot;T&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, Φ) with &quot;T&quot; an open interval in the real numbers R, &quot;M&quot; a manifold locally diffeomorphic to a Banach space, and Φ a continuous function. If Φ is continuously differentiable we say the system is a &quot;differentiable dynamical system&quot;. If the manifold &quot;M&quot; is locally diffeomorphic to R&quot;n&quot;, the dynamical system is &quot;finite-dimensional&quot;; if not, the dynamical system is &quot;infinite-dimensional&quot;. This does not assume a symplectic structure. When &quot;T&quot; is taken to be the reals, the dynamical system is called &quot;global&quot; or a &quot;flow&quot;; and if &quot;T&quot; is restricted to the non-negative reals, then the dynamical system is a &quot;semi-flow&quot;.

==== Discrete dynamical system ====
A &quot;discrete dynamical system&quot;, &quot;discrete-time dynamical system&quot; is a tuple (&quot;T&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, Φ), where &quot;M&quot; is a manifold locally diffeomorphic to a Banach space, and Φ is a function. When &quot;T&quot; is taken to be the integers, it is a &quot;cascade&quot; or a &quot;map&quot;. If &quot;T&quot; is restricted to the non-negative integers we call the system a &quot;semi-cascade&quot;.

==== Cellular automaton ====
A &quot;cellular automaton&quot; is a tuple (&quot;T&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, Φ), with &quot;T&quot; a lattice such as the integers or a higher-dimensional integer grid, &quot;M&quot; is a set of functions from an integer lattice (again, with one or more dimensions) to a finite set, and Φ a (locally defined) evolution function. As such cellular automata are dynamical systems. The lattice in &quot;M&quot; represents the &quot;space&quot; lattice, while the one in &quot;T&quot; represents the &quot;time&quot; lattice.

==== Multidimensional generalization ====
Dynamical systems are usually defined over a single independent variable, thought of as time. A more general class of systems are defined over multiple independent variables and are therefore called multidimensional systems. Such systems are useful for modeling, for example, image processing.

==== Compactification of a dynamical system ====
Given a global dynamical system (R, &quot;X&quot;, Φ) on a locally compact and Hausdorff topological space &quot;X&quot;, it is often useful to study the continuous extension Φ* of Φ to the one-point compactification &quot;X*&quot; of &quot;X&quot;. Although we lose the differential structure of the original system we can now use compactness arguments to analyze the new system (R, &quot;X*&quot;, Φ*).

In compact dynamical systems the limit set of any orbit is non-empty, compact and simply connected.

===Measure theoretical definition===
A dynamical system may be defined formally as a measure-preserving transformation of a measure space, the triplet (&quot;T&quot;, (&quot;X&quot;, Σ, &quot;μ&quot;), Φ). Here, &quot;T&quot; is a monoid (usually the non-negative integers), &quot;X&quot; is a set, and (&quot;X&quot;, Σ, &quot;μ&quot;) is a probability space, meaning that Σ is a sigma-algebra on &quot;X&quot; and μ is a finite measure on (&quot;X&quot;, Σ). A map Φ: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; is said to be Σ-measurable if and only if, for every σ in Σ, one has formula_23. A map Φ is said to preserve the measure if and only if, for every &quot;σ&quot; in Σ, one has formula_24. Combining the above, a map Φ is said to be a measure-preserving transformation of &quot;X&quot; , if it is a map from &quot;X&quot; to itself, it is Σ-measurable, and is measure-preserving. The triplet (&quot;T&quot;, (&quot;X&quot;, Σ, &quot;μ&quot;), Φ), for such a Φ, is then defined to be a dynamical system.

The map Φ embodies the time evolution of the dynamical system. Thus, for discrete dynamical systems the iterates formula_25 for every integer &quot;n&quot; are studied. For continuous dynamical systems, the map Φ is understood to be a finite time evolution map and the construction is more complicated.

====Relation to geometric definition====

The measure theoretical definition assumes the existence of a measure-preserving transformation. Many different invariant measures can be associated to any one evolution rule. If the dynamical system is given by a system of differential equations the appropriate measure must be determined. This makes it difficult to develop ergodic theory starting from differential equations, so it becomes convenient to have a dynamical systems-motivated definition within ergodic theory that side-steps the choice of measure and assumes the choice has been made. A simple construction (sometimes called the Krylov–Bogolyubov theorem) shows that for a large class of systems it is always possible to construct a measure so as to make the evolution rule of the dynamical system a measure-preserving transformation. In the construction a given measure of the state space is summed for all future points of a trajectory, assuring the invariance.

Some systems have a natural measure, such as the Liouville measure in Hamiltonian systems, chosen over other invariant measures, such as the measures supported on periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian system. For chaotic dissipative systems the choice of invariant measure is technically more challenging. The measure needs to be supported on the attractor, but attractors have zero Lebesgue measure and the invariant measures must be singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure. A small region of phase space shrinks under time evolution.

For hyperbolic dynamical systems, the Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen measures appear to be the natural choice. They are constructed on the geometrical structure of stable and unstable manifolds of the dynamical system; they behave physically under small perturbations; and they explain many of the observed statistics of hyperbolic systems.

== Construction of dynamical systems ==
The concept of &quot;evolution in time&quot; is central to the theory of dynamical systems as seen in the previous sections: the basic reason for this fact is that the starting motivation of the theory was the study of time behavior of classical mechanical systems. But a system of ordinary differential equations must be solved before it becomes a dynamic system. For example, consider an initial value problem such as the following:

:formula_26
:formula_27

where 
*formula_28 represents the velocity of the material point x 
*&quot;M&quot; is a finite dimensional manifold
*v: &quot;T&quot; × &quot;M&quot; → &quot;TM&quot; is a vector field in R&quot;n&quot; or C&quot;n&quot; and represents the change of velocity induced by the known forces acting on the given material point in the phase space &quot;M&quot;. The change is not a vector in the phase space &quot;M&quot;, but is instead in the tangent space &quot;TM&quot;.

There is no need for higher order derivatives in the equation, nor for the parameter &quot;t&quot; in &quot;v&quot;(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;x&quot;), because these can be eliminated by considering systems of higher dimensions.

Depending on the properties of this vector field, the mechanical system is called 
*autonomous, when v(&quot;t&quot;, x) = v(x)
*homogeneous when v(&quot;t&quot;, 0) = 0 for all &quot;t&quot;

The solution can be found using standard ODE techniques and is denoted as the evolution function already introduced above

:formula_29

The dynamical system is then (&quot;T&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, Φ).

Some formal manipulation of the system of differential equations shown above gives a more general form of equations a dynamical system must satisfy

:formula_30

where formula_31 is a functional from the set of evolution functions to the field of the complex numbers.

This equation is useful when modeling mechanical systems with complicated constraints.

Many of the concepts in dynamical systems can be extended to infinite-dimensional manifolds—those that are locally Banach spaces—in which case the differential equations are partial differential equations.

==Linear dynamical systems==
{{Main|Linear dynamical system}}
Linear dynamical systems can be solved in terms of simple functions and the behavior of all orbits classified. In a linear system the phase space is the &quot;N&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space, so any point in phase space can be represented by a vector with &quot;N&quot; numbers. The analysis of linear systems is possible because they satisfy a superposition principle: if &quot;u&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and &quot;w&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) satisfy the differential equation for the vector field (but not necessarily the initial condition), then so will &quot;u&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) + &quot;w&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).

===Flows===
For a flow, the vector field v(&quot;x&quot;) is an affine function of the position in the phase space, that is,
:formula_32
with &quot;A&quot; a matrix, &quot;b&quot; a vector of numbers and &quot;x&quot; the position vector. The solution to this system can be found by using the superposition principle (linearity).
The case &quot;b&quot; ≠ 0 with &quot;A&quot; = 0 is just a straight line in the direction of &quot;b&quot;:

: formula_33

When &quot;b&quot; is zero and &quot;A&quot; ≠ 0 the origin is an equilibrium (or singular) point of the flow, that is, if &quot;x&quot;0 = 0, then the orbit remains there.
For other initial conditions, the equation of motion is given by the exponential of a matrix: for an initial point &quot;x&quot;0,

: formula_34

When &quot;b&quot; = 0, the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; determine the structure of the phase space. From the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of &quot;A&quot; it is possible to determine if an initial point will converge or diverge to the equilibrium point at the origin.

The distance between two different initial conditions in the case &quot;A&quot; ≠ 0 will change exponentially in most cases, either converging exponentially fast towards a point, or diverging exponentially fast. Linear systems display sensitive dependence on initial conditions in the case of divergence. For nonlinear systems this is one of the (necessary but not sufficient) conditions for chaotic behavior.
{{Clear}}

===Maps===
A discrete-time, affine dynamical system has the form of a matrix difference equation:
: formula_35
with &quot;A&quot; a matrix and &quot;b&quot; a vector. As in the continuous case, the change of coordinates &quot;x&quot; → &quot;x&quot; + (1 − &quot;A&quot;) –1&quot;b&quot; removes the term &quot;b&quot; from the equation. In the new coordinate system, the origin is a fixed point of the map and the solutions are of the linear system &quot;A&quot; &quot;n&quot;&quot;x&quot;0.
The solutions for the map are no longer curves, but points that hop in the phase space. The orbits are organized in curves, or fibers, which are collections of points that map into themselves under the action of the map.

As in the continuous case, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of &quot;A&quot; determine the structure of phase space. For example, if &quot;u&quot;1 is an eigenvector of &quot;A&quot;, with a real eigenvalue smaller than one, then the straight lines given by the points along &quot;α&quot; &quot;u&quot;1, with &quot;α&quot; ∈ R, is an invariant curve of the map. Points in this straight line run into the fixed point.

There are also many other discrete dynamical systems.

==Local dynamics==
The qualitative properties of dynamical systems do not change under a smooth change of coordinates (this is sometimes taken as a definition of qualitative): a &quot;singular point&quot; of the vector field (a point where &quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0) will remain a singular point under smooth transformations; a &quot;periodic orbit&quot; is a loop in phase space and smooth deformations of the phase space cannot alter it being a loop. It is in the neighborhood of singular points and periodic orbits that the structure of a phase space of a dynamical system can be well understood. In the qualitative study of dynamical systems, the approach is to show that there is a change of coordinates (usually unspecified, but computable) that makes the dynamical system as simple as possible.

===Rectification===
A flow in most small patches of the phase space can be made very simple. If &quot;y&quot; is a point where the vector field &quot;v&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) ≠ 0, then there is a change of coordinates for a region around &quot;y&quot; where the vector field becomes a series of parallel vectors of the same magnitude. This is known as the rectification theorem.

The &quot;rectification theorem&quot; says that away from singular points the dynamics of a point in a small patch is a straight line. The patch can sometimes be enlarged by stitching several patches together, and when this works out in the whole phase space &quot;M&quot; the dynamical system is &quot;integrable&quot;. In most cases the patch cannot be extended to the entire phase space. There may be singular points in the vector field (where &quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0); or the patches may become smaller and smaller as some point is approached. The more subtle reason is a global constraint, where the trajectory starts out in a patch, and after visiting a series of other patches comes back to the original one. If the next time the orbit loops around phase space in a different way, then it is impossible to rectify the vector field in the whole series of patches.

===Near periodic orbits===
In general, in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit the rectification theorem cannot be used. Poincaré developed an approach that transforms the analysis near a periodic orbit to the analysis of a map. Pick a point &quot;x&quot;0 in the orbit γ and consider the points in phase space in that neighborhood that are perpendicular to &quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0). These points are a Poincaré section &quot;S&quot;(&quot;γ&quot;, &quot;x&quot;0), of the orbit. The flow now defines a map, the Poincaré map &quot;F&quot; : &quot;S&quot; → &quot;S&quot;, for points starting in &quot;S&quot; and returning to &quot;S&quot;. Not all these points will take the same amount of time to come back, but the times will be close to the time it takes &quot;x&quot;0.

The intersection of the periodic orbit with the Poincaré section is a fixed point of the Poincaré map &quot;F&quot;. By a translation, the point can be assumed to be at &quot;x&quot; = 0. The Taylor series of the map is &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;J&quot; · &quot;x&quot; + O(&quot;x&quot;2), so a change of coordinates &quot;h&quot; can only be expected to simplify &quot;F&quot; to its linear part

: formula_36

This is known as the conjugation equation. Finding conditions for this equation to hold has been one of the major tasks of research in dynamical systems. Poincaré first approached it assuming all functions to be analytic and in the process discovered the non-resonant condition. If &quot;λ&quot;1, ..., &quot;λ&quot;&quot;ν&quot; are the eigenvalues of &quot;J&quot; they will be resonant if one eigenvalue is an integer linear combination of two or more of the others. As terms of the form &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; – Σ (multiples of other eigenvalues) occurs in the denominator of the terms for the function &quot;h&quot;, the non-resonant condition is also known as the small divisor problem.

===Conjugation results===
The results on the existence of a solution to the conjugation equation depend on the eigenvalues of &quot;J&quot; and the degree of smoothness required from &quot;h&quot;. As &quot;J&quot; does not need to have any special symmetries, its eigenvalues will typically be complex numbers. When the eigenvalues of &quot;J&quot; are not in the unit circle, the dynamics near the fixed point &quot;x&quot;0 of &quot;F&quot; is called &quot;hyperbolic&quot; and when the eigenvalues are on the unit circle and complex, the dynamics is called &quot;elliptic&quot;.

In the hyperbolic case, the Hartman–Grobman theorem gives the conditions for the existence of a continuous function that maps the neighborhood of the fixed point of the map to the linear map &quot;J&quot; · &quot;x&quot;. The hyperbolic case is also &quot;structurally stable&quot;. Small changes in the vector field will only produce small changes in the Poincaré map and these small changes will reflect in small changes in the position of the eigenvalues of &quot;J&quot; in the complex plane, implying that the map is still hyperbolic.

The Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) theorem gives the behavior near an elliptic point.

==Bifurcation theory==
{{Main|Bifurcation theory}}
When the evolution map Φ&quot;t&quot; (or the vector field it is derived from) depends on a parameter μ, the structure of the phase space will also depend on this parameter. Small changes may produce no qualitative changes in the phase space until a special value &quot;μ&quot;0 is reached. At this point the phase space changes qualitatively and the dynamical system is said to have gone through a bifurcation.

Bifurcation theory considers a structure in phase space (typically a fixed point, a periodic orbit, or an invariant torus) and studies its behavior as a function of the parameter &quot;μ&quot;. At the bifurcation point the structure may change its stability, split into new structures, or merge with other structures. By using Taylor series approximations of the maps and an understanding of the differences that may be eliminated by a change of coordinates, it is possible to catalog the bifurcations of dynamical systems.

The bifurcations of a hyperbolic fixed point &quot;x&quot;0 of a system family &quot;Fμ&quot; can be characterized by the eigenvalues of the first derivative of the system &quot;DF&quot;&quot;μ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0) computed at the bifurcation point. For a map, the bifurcation will occur when there are eigenvalues of &quot;DFμ&quot; on the unit circle. For a flow, it will occur when there are eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. For more information, see the main article on Bifurcation theory.

Some bifurcations can lead to very complicated structures in phase space. For example, the Ruelle–Takens scenario describes how a periodic orbit bifurcates into a torus and the torus into a strange attractor. In another example, Feigenbaum period-doubling describes how a stable periodic orbit goes through a series of period-doubling bifurcations.

==Ergodic systems==
{{Main|Ergodic theory}}
In many dynamical systems, it is possible to choose the coordinates of the system so that the volume (really a ν-dimensional volume) in phase space is invariant. This happens for mechanical systems derived from Newton&#x27;s laws as long as the coordinates are the position and the momentum and the volume is measured in units of (position) × (momentum). The flow takes points of a subset &quot;A&quot; into the points Φ &quot;t&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) and invariance of the phase space means that
: formula_37
In the Hamiltonian formalism, given a coordinate it is possible to derive the appropriate (generalized) momentum such that the associated volume is preserved by the flow. The volume is said to be computed by the Liouville measure.

In a Hamiltonian system, not all possible configurations of position and momentum can be reached from an initial condition. Because of energy conservation, only the states with the same energy as the initial condition are accessible. The states with the same energy form an energy shell Ω, a sub-manifold of the phase space. The volume of the energy shell, computed using the Liouville measure, is preserved under evolution.

For systems where the volume is preserved by the flow, Poincaré discovered the recurrence theorem: Assume the phase space has a finite Liouville volume and let &quot;F&quot; be a phase space volume-preserving map and &quot;A&quot; a subset of the phase space. Then almost every point of &quot;A&quot; returns to &quot;A&quot; infinitely often. The Poincaré recurrence theorem was used by Zermelo to object to Boltzmann&#x27;s derivation of the increase in entropy in a dynamical system of colliding atoms.

One of the questions raised by Boltzmann&#x27;s work was the possible equality between time averages and space averages, what he called the ergodic hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the length of time a typical trajectory spends in a region &quot;A&quot; is vol(&quot;A&quot;)/vol(Ω).

The ergodic hypothesis turned out not to be the essential property needed for the development of statistical mechanics and a series of other ergodic-like properties were introduced to capture the relevant aspects of physical systems. Koopman approached the study of ergodic systems by the use of functional analysis. An observable &quot;a&quot; is a function that to each point of the phase space associates a number (say instantaneous pressure, or average height). The value of an observable can be computed at another time by using the evolution function φ t. This introduces an operator &quot;U&quot; &quot;t&quot;, the transfer operator,

: formula_38

By studying the spectral properties of the linear operator &quot;U&quot; it becomes possible to classify the ergodic properties of Φ &quot;t&quot;. In using the Koopman approach of considering the action of the flow on an observable function, the finite-dimensional nonlinear problem involving Φ &quot;t&quot; gets mapped into an infinite-dimensional linear problem involving &quot;U&quot;.

The Liouville measure restricted to the energy surface Ω is the basis for the averages computed in equilibrium statistical mechanics. An average in time along a trajectory is equivalent to an average in space computed with the Boltzmann factor exp(−β&quot;H&quot;). This idea has been generalized by Sinai, Bowen, and Ruelle (SRB) to a larger class of dynamical systems that includes dissipative systems. SRB measures replace the Boltzmann factor and they are defined on attractors of chaotic systems.

== Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos ==
{{Main|Chaos theory}}
Simple nonlinear dynamical systems, including piecewise linear systems, can exhibit strongly unpredictable behavior, which might seem to be random, despite the fact that they are fundamentally deterministic. This unpredictable behavior has been called &quot;chaos&quot;. Hyperbolic systems are precisely defined dynamical systems that exhibit the properties ascribed to chaotic systems. In hyperbolic systems the tangent spaces perpendicular to an orbit can be decomposed into a combination of two parts: one with the points that converge towards the orbit (the &quot;stable manifold&quot;) and another of the points that diverge from the orbit (the &quot;unstable manifold&quot;).

This branch of mathematics deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like &quot;Will the system settle down to a steady state in the long term, and if so, what are the possible attractors?&quot; or &quot;Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?&quot;

The chaotic behavior of complex systems is not the issue. Meteorology has been known for years to involve complex—even chaotic—behavior. Chaos theory has been so surprising because chaos can be found within almost trivial systems. The Pomeau–Manneville scenario of the logistic map and the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem arose with just second-degree polynomials; the horseshoe map is piecewise linear.

=== Solutions of finite duration ===

For non-linear autonomous ODEs it is possible under some conditions to develop solutions of finite duration, meaning here that in these solutions the system will reach the value zero at some time, called an ending time, and then stay there forever after. This can occur only when system trajectories are not uniquely determined forwards and backwards in time by the dynamics, thus solutions of finite duration imply a form of &quot;backwards-in-time unpredictability&quot; closely related to the forwards-in-time unpredictability of chaos. This behavior cannot happen for Lipschitz continuous differential equations according to the proof of the Picard-Lindelof theorem. These solutions are non-Lipschitz functions at their ending times and cannot be analytical functions on the whole real line.

As example, the equation:
:formula_39
Admits the finite duration solution:
:formula_40
that is zero for formula_41 and is not Lipschitz continuous at its ending time formula_42

<text>( &#x27;, , collectively &quot;/&quot; &quot;the people of the covenant&quot;) or&quot;&#x27; () is a historical term for non-Muslims living in an Islamic state with legal protection. The word literally means &quot;protected person&quot;, referring to the state&#x27;s obligation under &quot;sharia&quot; to protect the individual&#x27;s life, property, as well as freedom of religion, in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the &quot;jizya&quot; tax, in contrast to the &quot;zakat&quot;, or obligatory alms, paid by the Muslim subjects. &quot;Dhimmi&quot; were exempt from military service and other duties assigned specifically to Muslims if they paid the poll tax (&quot;jizya&quot;) but were otherwise equal under the laws of property, contract, and obligation. Dhimmis were subject to specific restrictions as well, which were codified in agreements like the &quot;Pact of ʿUmar&quot;. These included prohibitions on building new places of worship, repairing existing ones in areas where Muslims lived, teaching children the Qurʾān, and preventing relatives from converting to Islam. They were also required to wear distinctive clothing, refrain from carrying weapons, and avoid riding on saddles.

Historically, dhimmi status was originally applied to Jews, Christians, and Sabians, who are considered &quot;People of the Book&quot; in Islamic theology. Later, this status was also applied to Zoroastrians, Sikhs, Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. 
Jews, Christians and others were required to pay the &quot;jizyah&quot;, and forced conversions were forbidden.

During the rule of al-Mutawakkil, the tenth Abbasid Caliph, numerous restrictions reinforced the second-class citizen status of dhimmīs and forced their communities into ghettos. For instance, they were required to distinguish themselves from their Muslim neighbors by their dress. They were not permitted to build new churches or synagogues or repair old churches without Muslim consent according to the Pact of Umar.

Under &quot;Sharia&quot;, the &quot;dhimmi&quot; communities were usually governed by their own laws in place of some of the laws applicable to the Muslim community. For example, the Jewish community of Medina was allowed to have its own Halakhic courts, and the Ottoman millet system allowed its various dhimmi communities to rule themselves under separate legal courts. These courts did not cover cases that involved religious groups outside of their own communities, or capital offences. &quot;Dhimmi&quot; communities were also allowed to engage in certain practices that were usually forbidden for the Muslim community, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork.

Some Muslims reject the &quot;dhimma&quot; system by arguing that it is a system which is inappropriate in the age of nation-states and democracies. There is a range of opinions among 20th-century and contemporary Islamic theologians about whether the notion of &quot;dhimma&quot; is appropriate for modern times, and, if so, what form it should take in an Islamic state.

There are differences among the Islamic Madhhabs regarding which non-Muslims can pay jizya and have dhimmi status. The Hanafi and Maliki Madhabs generally allow non-Muslims to have dhimmi status. In contrast, the Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali Madhabs only allow Christians, Unitarians, Jews, Sabeans and Zoroastrians to have dhimmi status, and they maintain that all other non-Muslims must either convert to Islam or be fought.

==The &quot;Dhimma contract&quot;==
Based on Quranic verses and Islamic traditions, &quot;sharia&quot; law distinguishes between Muslims, followers of other Abrahamic religions, and Pagans or people belonging to other polytheistic religions. As monotheists, Jews and Christians have traditionally been considered &quot;People of the Book&quot;, and afforded a special legal status known as &quot;dhimmi&quot; derived from a theoretical contract—&quot;dhimma&quot; or &quot;residence in return for taxes&quot;. Islamic legal systems based on &quot;sharia&quot; law incorporated the religious laws and courts of Christians, Jews, and Hindus, as seen in the early caliphate, al-Andalus, Indian subcontinent, and the Ottoman Millet system.

In Yemenite Jewish sources, a treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as &quot;kitāb ḏimmat al-nabi&quot;, written in the 17th year of the Hijra (638 CE), which gave express liberty to the Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but required them to pay the &quot;jizya&quot; (poll-tax) annually for their protection. Muslim governments in the Indus basin readily extended the &quot;dhimmi&quot; status to the Hindus and Buddhists of India. Eventually, the largest school of Islamic jurisprudence applied this term to all Non-Muslims living in Muslim lands outside the sacred area surrounding Mecca, Arabia.

In medieval Islamic societies, the &quot;qadi&quot; (Islamic judge) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily chose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the &quot;dhimmi&quot; communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the &quot;sharia&quot; law, as with the Jews who would have their own rabbinical courts. These courts did not cover cases that involved other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order. By the 18th century, however, &quot;dhimmi&quot; frequently attended the Ottoman Muslim courts, where cases were taken against them by Muslims, or they took cases against Muslims or other &quot;dhimmi&quot;. Oaths sworn by &quot;dhimmi&quot; in these courts were tailored to their beliefs. Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in certain practices (such as the consumption of alcohol and pork) that were usually forbidden by Islamic law, in point of fact, any Muslim who pours away their wine or forcibly appropriates it is liable to pay compensation. Some Islamic theologians held that Zoroastrian &quot;self-marriages&quot;, considered incestuous under &quot;sharia&quot;, should also be tolerated. Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) opined that most scholars of the Hanbali school held that non-Muslims were entitled to such practices, as long as they were not presented to sharia courts and the religious minorities in question held them to be permissible. This ruling was based on the precedent that there were no records of the Islamic prophet Muhammad forbidding such self-marriages among Zoroastrians, despite coming into contact with Zoroastrians and knowing about this practice. Religious minorities were also free to do as they wished in their own homes, provided they did not publicly engage in illicit sexual activity in ways that could threaten public morals.

There are parallels for this in Roman and Jewish law. According to law professor H. Patrick Glenn of McGill University, &quot;[t]oday it is said that the dhimmi are &#x27;excluded from the specifically Muslim privileges, but on the other hand they are excluded from the specifically Muslim duties&#x27; while (and here there are clear parallels with western public and private law treatment of aliens—Fremdenrecht, la condition de estrangers), &#x27;[f]or the rest, the Muslim and the dhimmi are equal in practically the whole of the law of property and of contracts and obligations&#x27;.&quot; Quoting the Qur&#x27;anic statement, &quot;Let Christians judge according to what We have revealed in the Gospel&quot;, Muhammad Hamidullah writes that Islam decentralized and &quot;communalized&quot; law and justice. However, the classical &quot;dhimma&quot; contract is no longer enforced. Western influence over the Muslim world has been instrumental in eliminating the restrictions and protections of the &quot;dhimma&quot; contract.

===The Dhimma contract and Sharia law===

The &quot;dhimma&quot; contract is an integral part of traditional Islamic law. From the 9th century AD, the power to interpret and refine law in traditional Islamic societies was in the hands of the scholars (&quot;ulama&quot;). This separation of powers served to limit the range of actions available to the ruler, who could not easily decree or reinterpret law independently and expect the continued support of the community. Through succeeding centuries and empires, the balance between the ulema and the rulers shifted and reformed, but the balance of power was never decisively changed. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution introduced an era of European world hegemony that included the domination of most of the Muslim lands. At the end of the Second World War, the European powers found themselves too weakened to maintain their empires. The wide variety in forms of government, systems of law, attitudes toward modernity and interpretations of sharia are a result of the ensuing drives for independence and modernity in the Muslim world.

Muslim states, sects, schools of thought and individuals differ as to exactly what sharia law entails. In addition, Muslim states today utilize a spectrum of legal systems. Most states have a mixed system that implements certain aspects of sharia while acknowledging the supremacy of a constitution. A few, such as Turkey, have declared themselves secular. Local and customary laws may take precedence in certain matters, as well. Islamic law is therefore polynormative, and despite several cases of regression in recent years, the trend is towards liberalization. Questions of human rights and the status of minorities cannot be generalized with regards to the Muslim world. They must instead be examined on a case-by-case basis, within specific political and cultural contexts, using perspectives drawn from the historical framework.

===The end of the Dhimma contract===
The status of the &quot;dhimmi&quot; &quot;was for long accepted with resignation by the Christians and with gratitude by the Jews&quot; but the rising power of Christendom and the radical ideas of the French Revolution caused a wave of discontent among Christian dhimmis. The continuing and growing pressure from the European powers combined with pressure from Muslim reformers gradually relaxed the inequalities between Muslims and non-Muslims.

On 18 February 1856, the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856 () was issued, building upon the 1839 edict. It came about partly as a result of pressure from and the efforts of the ambassadors of France, Austria and the United Kingdom, whose respective countries were needed as allies in the Crimean War. It again proclaimed the principle of equality between Muslims and non-Muslims, and produced many specific reforms to this end. For example, the &quot;jizya&quot; tax was abolished and non-Muslims were allowed to join the army.

According to some scholars, discrimination against &quot;dhimmis&quot; did not end with the Edict of 1856, and they remained second-class citizens at least until the end of World War I. H.E.W. Young, the British Council in Mosul, wrote in 1909, &quot;The attitude of the Muslims toward the Christians and the Jews is that of a master towards slaves, whom he treats with a certain lordly tolerance so long as they keep their place. Any sign of pretension to equality is promptly repressed.&quot;

===Views of modern Islamic scholars on the status of non-Muslims in an Islamic society===
* The Iranian Shi&#x27;a Muslim Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini indicates in his book &quot;Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist&quot; that non-Muslims should be required to pay the poll tax, in return for which they would profit from the protection and services of the state; they would, however, be excluded from all participation in the political process. Bernard Lewis remarks about Khomeini that one of his main grievances against the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was that his legislation allowed the theoretical possibility of non-Muslims exercising political or judicial authority over Muslims.
* The Egyptian theologian Yusuf al-Qaradawi, chairman of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, has stated in his Al Jazeera program &quot;Sharia and Life&quot;, which has an estimated audience of 35 to 60 million viewers: &quot;When we say &quot;dhimmis&quot; (&quot;ahl al-dhimma&quot;) it means that [...] they are under the covenant of God and His Messenger and the Muslim community and their responsibility (&quot;ḍamān&quot;), and it is everyone&#x27;s duty to protect them, and this is what is intended by the word. At present many of our brethren are offended by the word &quot;dhimmis&quot;, and I have stated in what I wrote in my books that I don&#x27;t see anything to prevent contemporary Islamic ijtihad from discarding this word &quot;dhimmis&quot; and calling them non-Muslim citizens.&quot;
*Another Egyptian Islamist, Mohammad Salim al-Awa argued the concept of dhimmi must be re-interpreted in the context of Egyptian nationalism. Al-Awa and other Muslim scholars based this on the idea that while the previous &quot;dhimma&quot; condition result from the Islamic conquest, the modern Egyptian state results from a joint Muslim-Christian campaign to end the British occupation of Egypt. In modern-day Egypt, he argues, the constitution replaces the &quot;dhimma&quot; contract.
* Muhammad Husayn Tabataba&#x27;i, a 20th-century Shia scholar writes that dhimmis should be treated &quot;in a good and decent manner&quot;. He addresses the argument that good treatment of dhimmis was abrogated by Quranic verse 9:29 by stating that, in the literal sense, this verse is not in conflict with good treatment of dhimmis.
* Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, a Pakistani theologian, writes in &quot;Mizan&quot; that certain directives of the Quran were specific only to Muhammad against peoples of his times, besides other directives, the campaign involved asking the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for jizya and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for exemption from capital punishment and for military protection as the dhimmis of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam.
* The Iranian Shia jurist Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi states in &quot;Selection of the Tafsir Nemooneh&quot; that the main philosophy of jizya is that it is only a financial aid to those Muslims who are in the charge of safeguarding the security of the state and dhimmis&#x27; lives and properties on their behalf.
* Prominent Islamic thinkers like Fahmi Huwaidi and Tarek El-Bishry have based their justification for full citizenship of non-Muslims in an Islamic states on the precedent set by Muhammad in the Constitution of Medina. They argue that in this charter the People of Book, have the status of citizens (&quot;muwatinun&quot;) rather than dhimmis, sharing equal rights and duties with Muslims.
* Legal scholar L. Ali Khan also points to the Constitution of Medina as a way forward for Islamic states in his 2006 paper titled &quot;The Medina Constitution&quot;. He suggests this ancient document, which governed the status of religions and races in the first Islamic state, in which Jewish tribes are &quot;placed on an equal footing with [...] Muslims&quot; and granted &quot;the freedom of religion,&quot; can serve as a basis for the protection of minority rights, equality, and religious freedom in the modern Islamic state.
* Tariq Ramadan, Professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Oxford, advocates the inclusion of academic disciplines and Islamic society, along with traditional Islamic scholars, in an effort to reform Islamic law and address modern conditions. He speaks of remaining faithful to the higher objectives of sharia law. He posits universal rights of dignity, welfare, freedom, equality and justice in a religiously and culturally pluralistic Islamic (or other) society, and proposes a dialogue regarding the modern term &quot;citizenship,&quot; although it has no clear precedent in classical fiqh. He further includes the terms &quot;non-citizen&quot;, &quot;foreigner&quot;, &quot;resident&quot; and &quot;immigrant&quot; in this dialogue, and challenges not only Islam, but modern civilization as a whole, to come to terms with these concepts in a meaningful way with regards to problems of racism, discrimination and oppression.

==Dhimmi communities==

Jews and Christians living under early Muslim rule were considered dhimmis, a status that was later also extended to other non-Muslims like Hindus and Buddhists. They were allowed to &quot;freely practice their religion, and to enjoy a large measure of communal autonomy&quot; and guaranteed their personal safety and security of property, in return for paying tribute and acknowledging Muslim rule. Islamic law and custom prohibited the enslavement of free dhimmis within lands under Islamic rule. Taxation from the perspective of dhimmis who came under the Muslim rule, was &quot;a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes&quot; (but much lower under the Muslim rule). They were also exempted from the zakat tax paid by Muslims. The dhimmi communities living in Islamic states had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who had their own Halakhic courts. The dhimmi communities had their own leaders, courts, personal and religious laws, and &quot;generally speaking, Muslim tolerance of unbelievers was far better than anything available in Christendom, until the rise of secularism in the 17th century&quot;. &quot;Muslims guaranteed freedom of worship and livelihood, provided that they remained loyal to the Muslim state and paid a poll tax&quot;. &quot;Muslim governments appointed Christian and Jewish professionals to their bureaucracies&quot;, and thus, Christians and Jews &quot;contributed to the making of the Islamic civilization&quot;.

However, dhimmis faced social and symbolic restrictions, and a pattern of stricter, then more lax, enforcement developed over time. Marshall Hodgson, a historian of Islam, writes that during the era of the High Caliphate (7th–13th Centuries), zealous Shariah-minded Muslims gladly elaborated their code of symbolic restrictions on the dhimmis.

From an Islamic legal perspective, the pledge of protection granted dhimmis the freedom to practice their religion and spared them forced conversions. The dhimmis also served a variety of useful purposes, mostly economic, which was another point of concern to jurists. Religious minorities were free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, but could not &quot;publicly engage in illicit sex in ways that threaten public morals&quot;. In some cases, religious practices that Muslims found repugnant were allowed. One example was the Zoroastrian practice of incestuous &quot;self-marriage&quot; where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion. This ruling was based on the precedent that Muhammad did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming in contact with them and having knowledge of their practices.

The Arabs generally established garrisons outside towns in the conquered territories, and had little interaction with the local dhimmi populations for purposes other than the collection of taxes. The conquered Christian, Jewish, Mazdean and Buddhist communities were otherwise left to lead their lives as before.

===Christians===
According to historians Lewis and Stillman, local Christians in Syria, Iraq, and Egypt were non-Chalcedonians and many may have felt better off under early Muslim rule than under that of the Byzantine Orthodox of Constantinople. In 1095, Pope Urban II urged western European Christians to come to the aid of the Christians of Palestine. The subsequent Crusades brought Roman Catholic Christians into contact with Orthodox Christians whose beliefs they discovered to differ from their own perhaps more than they had realized, and whose position under the rule of the Muslim Fatimid Caliphate was less uncomfortable than had been supposed. Consequently, the Eastern Christians provided perhaps less support to the Crusaders than had been expected. When the Arab East came under Ottoman rule in the 16th century, Christian populations and fortunes rebounded significantly. The Ottomans had long experience dealing with Christian and Jewish minorities, and were more tolerant towards religious minorities than the former Muslim rulers, the Mamluks of Egypt.

However, Christians living under Islamic rule have suffered certain legal disadvantages and at times persecution. In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the &quot;dhimmi&quot; system implemented in Muslim countries, they, like all other Christians and also Jews, were accorded certain freedoms. The dhimmi system in the Ottoman Empire was largely based upon the Pact of Umar. The client status established the rights of the non-Muslims to property, livelihood and freedom of worship but they were in essence treated as second-class citizens in the empire and referred to in Turkish as &quot;gavours&quot;, a pejorative word meaning &quot;infidel&quot; or &quot;unbeliever&quot;. The clause of the Pact of Umar which prohibited non-Muslims from building new places of worship was historically imposed on some communities of the Ottoman Empire and ignored in other cases, at discretion of the local authorities. Although there were no laws mandating religious ghettos, this led to non-Muslim communities being clustered around existing houses of worship.

In addition to other legal limitations, dhimmis, including the Christians among them, were not considered equals to Muslims and several prohibitions were placed on them. Their testimony against Muslims was inadmissible in courts of law wherein a Muslim could be punished; this meant that their testimony could only be considered in commercial cases. They were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses and camels. Their houses could not overlook those of Muslims; and their religious practices were severely circumscribed (e.g., the ringing of church bells was strictly forbidden).

===Jews===
Because the early Islamic conquests initially preserved much of the existing administrative machinery and culture, in many territories they amounted to little more than a change of rulers for the subject populations, which &quot;brought peace to peoples demoralized and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the years of Byzantine-Persian warfare&quot;.

María Rosa Menocal, argues that the Jewish dhimmis living under the caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to al-Andalus, where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practice faith and trade were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on proselytization.

Bernard Lewis states:

Professor of Jewish medieval history at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Hayim Hillel Ben-Sasson, notes:

According to the French historian Claude Cahen, Islam has &quot;shown more toleration than Europe towards the Jews who remained in Muslim lands.&quot;

Comparing the treatment of Jews in the medieval Islamic world and medieval Christian Europe, Mark R. Cohen notes that, in contrast to Jews in Christian Europe, the &quot;Jews in Islam were well integrated into the economic life of the larger society&quot;, and that they were allowed to practice their religion more freely than they could do in Christian Europe.

According to the scholar Mordechai Zaken, tribal chieftains (also known as aghas) in tribal Muslim societies such as the Kurdish society in Kurdistan would tax their Jewish subjects. The Jews were in fact civilians protected by their chieftains in and around their communities; in return they paid part of their harvest as dues, and contributed their skills and services to their patron chieftain.

===Hindus and Buddhists===
By the 10th century, the Turks of Central Asia had invaded the Indic plains, and spread Islam in Northwestern parts of India. At the end of the 12th century, the Muslims advanced quickly into the Ganges Plain. In one decade, a Muslim army led by Turkic slaves consolidated resistance around Lahore and brought northern India, as far as Bengal, under Muslim rule. From these Turkic slaves would come sultans, including the founder of the sultanate of Delhi. By the 15th century, major parts of Northern India was ruled by Muslim rulers, mostly descended from invaders. In the 16th century, India came under the influence of the Mughals. Babur, the first ruler of the Mughal empire, established a foothold in the north which paved the way for further expansion by his successors. Although the Mughal emperor Akbar has been described as a universalist, most Mughal emperors were oppressive of native Hindu, Buddhist and later Sikh populations. Aurangzeb specifically was inclined towards a highly fundamentalist approach.

==Restrictions==
There were a number of restrictions on dhimmis. In a modern sense the dhimmis would be described as second-class citizens. According to historian Marshall Hodgson, from very early times Muslim rulers would very often humiliate and punish dhimmis (usually Christians or Jews that refused to convert to Islam). It was official policy that dhimmis should “feel inferior and to know ‘their place&quot;.

Although &quot;dhimmis&quot; were allowed to perform their religious rituals, they were obliged to do so in a manner not conspicuous to Muslims. Loud prayers were forbidden, as were the ringing of church bells and the blowing of the shofar. They were also not allowed to build or repair churches and synagogues without Muslim consent. Moreover, dhimmis were not allowed to seek converts among Muslims. In the Mamluk Egypt, where non-Mamluk Muslims were not allowed to ride horses and camels, dhimmis were prohibited even from riding donkeys inside cities. Sometimes, Muslim rulers issued regulations requiring dhimmis to attach distinctive signs to their houses.

Most of the restrictions were social and symbolic in nature, and a pattern of stricter, then more lax, enforcement developed over time. The major financial disabilities of the dhimmi were the jizya poll tax and the fact dhimmis and Muslims could not inherit from each other. That would create an incentive to convert if someone from the family had already converted. Ira M. Lapidus states that the &quot;payment of the poll tax seems to have been regular, but other obligations were inconsistently enforced and did not prevent many non-Muslims from being important political, business, and scholarly figures. In the late ninth and early tenth centuries, Jewish bankers and financiers were important at the &#x27;Abbasid court.&quot; The jurists and scholars of Islamic sharia law called for humane treatment of the dhimmis.

A Muslim man may marry a Jewish or Christian dhimmī woman, who may keep her own religion (though her children were automatically considered Muslims and had to be raised as such), but a Muslim woman cannot marry a dhimmī man unless he converts to Islam. Dhimmīs are prohibited from converting Muslims under severe penalties, while Muslims are encouraged to convert dhimmīs. 

===Jizya tax===

Payment of the &quot;jizya&quot; obligated Muslim authorities to protect dhimmis in civil and military matters. Sura 9 (At-Tawba), verse 29 stipulates that &quot;jizya&quot; be exacted from non-Muslims as a condition required for jihad to cease. Islamic jurists required adult, free, healthy males among the dhimma community to pay the jizya, while exempting women, children, the elderly, slaves, those affected by mental or physical handicaps, and travelers who did not settle in Muslim lands. According to Abu Yusuf dhimmi should be imprisoned until they pay the jizya in full. Other jurists specified that dhimmis who don&#x27;t pay jizya should have their heads shaved and made to wear a dress distinctive from those dhimmis who paid the jizya and Muslims.

Lewis states there are varying opinions among scholars as to how much of a burden jizya was. According to Norman Stillman: &quot;&quot;jizya&quot; and &quot;kharaj&quot; were a &quot;crushing burden for the non-Muslim peasantry who eked out a bare living in a subsistence economy.&quot; Both agree that ultimately, the additional taxation on non-Muslims was a critical factor that drove many dhimmis to leave their religion and accept Islam. However, in some regions the jizya on populations was significantly lower than the zakat, meaning dhimmi populations maintained an economic advantage. According to Cohen, taxation, from the perspective of dhimmis who came under Muslim rule, was &quot;a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes&quot;. Lewis observes that the change from Byzantine to Arab rule was welcomed by many among the dhimmis who found the new yoke far lighter than the old, both in taxation and in other matters, and that some, even among the Christians of Syria and Egypt, preferred the rule of Islam to that of Byzantines. Montgomery Watt states, &quot;the Christians were probably better off as dhimmis under Muslim-Arab rulers than they had been under the Byzantine Greeks.&quot; In some places, for example Egypt, the jizya was a tax incentive for Christians to convert to Islam.

Some scholars have tried compute the relative taxation on Muslims vs non-Muslims in the early Abbasid period. According to one estimate, Muslims had an average tax rate of 17–20 dirhams per person, which rose to 30 dirhams per person when in kind levies are included. Non-Muslims paid either 12, 24 or 48 dirhams per person, depending on their taxation category, though most probably paid 12.

The importance of dhimmis as a source of revenue for the Rashidun Caliphate is illustrated in a letter ascribed to Umar I and cited by Abu Yusuf: &quot;if we take dhimmis and share them out, what will be left for the Muslims who come after us? By God, Muslims would not find a man to talk to and profit from his labors.&quot;

The early Islamic scholars took a relatively humane and practical attitude towards the collection of &quot;jizya&quot;, compared to the 11th century commentators writing when Islam was under threat both at home and abroad.

The jurist Abu Yusuf, the chief judge of the caliph Harun al-Rashid, rules as follows regarding the manner of collecting the jizya

In the border provinces, dhimmis were sometimes recruited for military operations. In such cases, they were exempted from jizya for the year of service.

===Administration of law===
Religious pluralism existed in medieval Islamic law and ethics. The religious laws and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as exemplified in the Caliphate, Al-Andalus, Ottoman Empire and Indian subcontinent. In medieval Islamic societies, the qadi (Islamic judge) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily chose to be judged according to Islamic law. The dhimmi communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who had their own Halakha courts.

Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems. However, dhimmis frequently attended the Muslim courts in order to record property and business transactions within their own communities. Cases were taken out against Muslims, against other dhimmis and even against members of the dhimmi&#x27;s own family. Dhimmis often took cases relating to marriage, divorce or inheritance to the Muslim courts so these cases would be decided under sharia law. Oaths sworn by dhimmis in the Muslim courts were sometimes the same as the oaths taken by Muslims, sometimes tailored to the dhimmis&#x27; beliefs.

Muslim men could generally marry dhimmi women who are considered People of the Book, however Islamic jurists rejected the possibility any non-Muslim man might marry a Muslim woman. Bernard Lewis notes that &quot;similar position existed under the laws of Byzantine Empire, according to which a Christian could marry a Jewish woman, but a Jew could not marry a Christian woman under pain of death&quot;.

==Relevant texts==

===Quranic verses as a basis for Islamic policies toward dhimmis===
Lewis states
* Al-Baqara 256 &quot;Let there be no compulsion in religion: ...&quot;, means non-Muslims should not be forced to adopt Islam 
* The phrase &quot;Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion.&quot;, from has been used as a &quot;proof-text for pluralism and coexistence&quot;.
* has served to justify the tolerated position accorded to the followers of Christianity, Judaism, and Sabianism under Muslim rule.

===Hadith===

A hadith by Muhammad, &quot;Whoever killed a (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling).&quot;, is cited as a foundation for the right of non-Muslim citizens to live peacefully and undisturbed in an Islamic state. Anwar Shah Kashmiri writes in his commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari &quot;Fayd al-Bari&quot; on this hadith: &quot;You know the gravity of sin for killing a Muslim, for its odiousness has reached the point of disbelief, and it necessitates that [the killer abides in Hell] forever. As for killing a non-Muslim citizen [], it is similarly no small matter, for the one who does it will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.&quot;

A similar hadith in regard to the status of the dhimmis: &quot;Whoever wrongs one with whom a compact (treaty) has been made &quot;[i.e., a dhimmi]&quot; and lays on him a burden beyond his strength, I will be his accuser.&quot;

===Constitution of Medina===

The Constitution of Medina, a formal agreement between Muhammad and all the significant tribes and families of Medina (including Muslims, Jews and pagans), declared that non-Muslims in the Ummah had the following rights:
# The security (&quot;dhimma&quot;) of God is equal for all groups,
# Non-Muslim members have equal political and cultural rights as Muslims. They will have autonomy and freedom of religion.
# Non-Muslims will take up arms against the enemy of the Ummah and share the cost of war. There is to be no treachery between the two.
# Non-Muslims will not be obliged to take part in religious wars of the Muslims.

===Khaybar agreement===

A precedent for the dhimma contract was established with the agreement between Muhammad and the Jews after the Battle of Khaybar, an oasis near Medina. Khaybar was the first territory attacked and conquered by Muslims. When the Jews of Khaybar surrendered to Muhammad after a siege, Muhammad allowed them to remain in Khaybar in return for handing over to the Muslims one half their annual produce.

===Pact of Umar===

The Pact of Umar, traditionally believed to be between caliph Umar and the conquered Jerusalem Christians in the seventh century, was another source of regulations pertaining to dhimmis. However, Western orientalists doubt the authenticity of the pact, arguing it is usually the victors and not the vanquished who impose rather than propose, the terms of peace, and that it is highly unlikely that the people who spoke no Arabic and knew nothing of Islam could draft such a document. Academic historians believe the Pact of Umar in the form it is known today was a product of later jurists who attributed it to Umar in order to lend greater authority to their own opinions. The similarities between the Pact of Umar and the Theodosian and Justinian Codes of the Eastern Roman Empire suggest that perhaps much of the Pact of Umar was borrowed from these earlier codes by later Islamic jurists. At least some of the clauses of the pact mirror the measures first introduced by the Umayyad caliph Umar II or by the early Abbasid caliphs.

==Cultural interactions and cultural differences==
During the Middle Ages, local associations known as &quot;futuwwa&quot; clubs developed across the Islamic lands. There were usually several futuwwah in each town. These clubs catered to varying interests, primarily sports, and might involve distinctive manners of dress and custom. They were known for their hospitality, idealism and loyalty to the group. They often had a militaristic aspect, purportedly for the mutual protection of the membership. These clubs commonly crossed social strata, including among their membership local notables, dhimmi and slaves – to the exclusion of those associated with the local ruler, or amir.

Muslims and Jews were sometimes partners in trade, with the Muslim taking days off on Fridays and Jews taking off on Saturdays.

Andrew Wheatcroft describes how some social customs such as different conceptions of dirt and cleanliness made it difficult for the religious communities to live close to each other, either under Muslim or under Christian rule.

== In modern times ==

The dhimma and the jizya poll tax are no longer imposed in Muslim majority countries. In the 21st century, jizya is widely regarded as being at odds with contemporary secular conceptions of citizens&#x27; civil rights and equality before the law, although there have been occasional reports of religious minorities in conflict zones and areas subject to political instability being forced to pay jizya.

In 2009 it was claimed that a group of militants that referred to themselves as the Taliban imposed the &quot;jizya&quot; on Pakistan&#x27;s minority Sikh community after occupying some of their homes and kidnapping a Sikh leader.

In 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt occupied the town of Dalga immediately following the overthrow of Mohammed Morsi on 3 July, and reportedly imposed &quot;jizya&quot; on the 15,000 Christian Copts living there. However, in autumn of that same year Egyptian authorities were able to retake control of the town following two prior failed attempts.

In February 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) announced that it intended to extract jizya from Christians in the city of Raqqa, Syria, which it controlled at the time. Christians who refused to accept the dhimma contract and pay the tax were to have to either convert to Islam, leave or be executed. Wealthy Christians would have to pay half an ounce of gold, the equivalent of $664 twice a year; middle-class Christians were to have to pay half that amount and poorer ones were to be charged one-fourth that amount. In June 2014 the Institute for the Study of War reported that ISIL claims to have collected jizya and fay. On 18 July 2014 ISIL ordered the Christians in Mosul to accept the dhimma contract and pay the jizya or convert to Islam. If they refused to accept either of the options they would be killed.

<text>The Doctor V64 (also referred to simply as the V64) is a development and backup device made by Bung Enterprises Ltd that is used in conjunction with the Nintendo 64. The Doctor V64 also had the ability to play video CDs and audio CDs. Additionally, it could apply stereo 3D effects to the audio.

== History ==

The V64 was released in 1996 and was priced around US$450. It was the one of the first commercially available backup devices for the Nintendo 64, appearing not long after the console&#x27;s international release. The Partner N64 development kit, which was manufactured by Silicon Graphics and sold officially by Nintendo, was a comparatively expensive development machine. The V64 served as a lower-cost development machine, though its unofficial status would later lead to conflict with Nintendo. Some third-party developers used a number of V64s in their development process, with games such as utilizing the device during development.

=== Specifications ===
The CPU of the V64 is a 6502, and the operating system is contained in a BIOS.

The V64 unit contains a CD-ROM drive which sits underneath the Nintendo 64 and plugs into the expansion slot on the underside of the Nintendo 64. The expansion slot is essentially a mirror image of the cartridge slot on the top of the unit, with the same electrical connections; thus, the Nintendo 64 reads data from the Doctor V64 in the same manner as it would from a cartridge plugged into the normal slot.

== Usage ==

=== Game booting ===
In order to get around Nintendo&#x27;s lockout chip, when using the V64, a game cartridge is plugged into the Nintendo 64 through an adapter which connects only the lockout chip. The game cart used for the operation had to contain the same lockout chip used by the game back up.

=== Saving game progress ===
The second problem concerned saving progress. Most N64 games are saved to the cart itself instead of external memory cards. If the player wanted to keep their progress, then the cartridge used had to have the same type of non-volatile memory hardware. Alternatively, Bung produced the &quot;DX256&quot; and &quot;DS1&quot; add-ons to allow (EEPROM and SRAM respectively) saves to be made without using the inserted cartridge. These devices were inserted into the top-slot of the N64 with the game cartridge being then inserted into the top of them to just provide the security bypass. Save slots on the DX256 were selected using an alpha and numeric encoder knobs on the front of the device.

=== Uploading game images ===
The Doctor V64 could be used to read the data from a game cartridge and transfer the data to a PC via the parallel port. This allowed developers and homebrew programmers to upload their game images to the Doctor V64 without having to create a CD backup each time. It also allowed users to upload game images taken from the Internet.

== Doctor V64 Jr. ==
Following the Doctor V64&#x27;s success, Bung released the Doctor V64 Jr. in December 1998. This was a condensed, cost-efficient version of the original V64. The Doctor V64 Jr. has no CD drive and plugs into the normal cartridge slot on the top of the Nintendo 64. Data is loaded into the Doctor V64 Jr.&#x27;s battery-backed RAM from a PC via a parallel port connection. The Doctor V64 Jr. has up to 512 megabits (64 MB) of memory storage. This was done to provide for future Nintendo 64 carts that employed larger memory storage, but the high costs associated with ordering large storage carts kept this occurrence at a minimum. Only a handful of 512-megabit games were released for the Nintendo 64 system.

== Promotions ==

In 1998 and 1999, there was a homebrew competition known as &quot;Presence of Mind&quot; (POM), an N64 demo competition led by dextrose.com. The contest consisted of submitting a user-developed N64 program, game, or utility. Bung Enterprises promoted the event and supplied prizes (usually Doctor V64 related accessories). Though a contest was planned for 2000, the interest in the N64 was already fading, and so did the event. POM contest demo entries can still be found on the Internet.

== Legal issues ==

=== Role in piracy ===
The Doctor V64 unit was the first commercially available backup device for the Nintendo 64 unit. Though the unit was sold as a development machine, it could be modified to enable the creation and use of commercial game backups. Unlike official development units, the purchase of V64s was not restricted to software companies only. For this reason, the unit became a popular choice among those looking to proliferate unlicensed copies of games.

Original Doctor V64 units sold by Bung did not allow the playing of backups. A person would have to modify the unit by themselves in order to make it backup friendly. This usually required a user to download and install a modified Doctor V64 BIOS. Additionally, the cartridge adapter had to be opened and soldered in order to allow for the operational procedure. Though Bung never sold backup enabled V64s, many re-sellers would modify the units themselves.

=== Conflicts with Nintendo ===
During the N64&#x27;s lifetime, Nintendo revised the N64&#x27;s model, making the serial port area smaller. This slight change in the N64&#x27;s plastic casing made the connection to the Doctor V64 difficult to achieve without user modification. This revision may have been a direct reaction from Nintendo to discourage the use of V64 devices, and may also explain why Bung decided to discontinue the use of this port in the later Doctor V64 Jr. models.

Nintendo made many legal efforts worldwide in order to stop the sale of Doctor V64 units. They sued Bung directly as well as specific store retailers in Europe and North America for copyright infringement. Eventually, Nintendo managed to have the courts prohibit the sale of Doctor V64 units in the United States.

== Main menu ==
The Doctor V64 implemented text-based menu-driven screens. The menus consisted of white text superimposed over a black background. Utilizing the buttons on the V64 unit, a user would navigate the menus and issue commands. Though the menu was mainly designed for game developers, it is possible to back up cartridges with it (through the use of an unofficial V64 BIOS). Some of the menu items related to game backups were removed from the V64&#x27;s BIOS near the end of its life due to pressure from Nintendo. These items are only available by obtaining a patched V64 BIOS.

== Detailed specifications ==

=== CD-ROM access speed ===
Most early V64 models shipped with a standard IDE 8X CD-ROM . During the manufacturing lifetime of the device, latter V64 models shipped with 16X and eventually 20X drives. V64 units could be purchased without a CD-ROM drive. It is possible to replace the unit with a faster IDE CD-ROM unit (such as the 52X model in the image on this page).

Many Doctor V64s shipped internationally were ordered without an installed CD-ROM drive, to save on shipping costs associated with weight, to avoid import duty on the drive, and to allow users to customize the units in response to the ever-increasing speeds of drives available. The variance in the power draw of different manufacturers drives at different speeds caused issues with disc spin-ups exceeding the wattage rating of the included Bung PSU. This led to users swapping out the Bung PSU for a more powerful model, or selecting low draw drives (mainly Panasonic drives sometimes badged as Creative).

=== CD-Media ===
V64s can read CD-Rs and CD-RWs (provided the installed CD-ROM unit supports rewritable media). Supported media has to be recorded in Mode 1, ISO 9660 format. Doctor V64s only support the 8.3 DOS naming convention. As such, Joliet file system is not supported.

=== RAM ===
Depending on the model, V64s came with either 128 megabits (16 MB) or 256 megabits (32 MB) of RAM. Original V64 units shipped with 128 megabits of RAM. V64 units started shipping with 256 megabits when developers started using bigger sized memory carts for their games. Users had the option of buying a memory upgrade from Bung and other re-sellers.

=== Power supply ===
The Doctor V64 uses a 4 Pin MiniDIN jack (as used for S-Video) for connecting the power supply cord. Power supplies included with Doctor V64s were very unreliable. Bung replaced the power supply with a sturdier version in later V64 units. Replacing broken power supplies became one of the most common maintenance problems with the V64. It is possible to modify an AT PC power supply for V64 use. Only 4 cables have to be connected to the V64 for it to function.

== Additional information ==

* The ROM extensions &quot;.v64&quot; and &quot;.z64&quot; started out as the preferred naming conventions by Doctor V64 and Z64 users, respectively. It would also imply the file&#x27;s &quot;endianness&quot; as those units employed little endian (V64) and big endian (Z64) byte alignment. &quot;.n64&quot; was used as well but not as much (it became more popular as N64 emulators began to appear). The terms &quot;.v64&quot; and &quot;.z64&quot; are still widely used today by the emulation community.
* Acclaim Entertainment subsidiary Iguana Entertainment used Doctor V64 units as their development hardware of choice during the N64 era. They were best known for developing the &quot;&quot;, &quot;NBA Jam&quot;, &quot;NFL Quarterback Club&quot;, and &quot;South Park&quot; video games.

<text>The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito is a British twin-engined, multirole combat aircraft, introduced during the Second World War. Unusual in that its airframe was constructed mostly of wood, it was nicknamed the &quot;Wooden Wonder&quot;, or &quot;Mossie&quot;. In 1941, it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world.

Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber, the Mosquito&#x27;s use evolved during the war into many roles, including low- to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber, high-altitude night bomber, pathfinder, day or night fighter, fighter-bomber, intruder, maritime strike, and photo-reconnaissance aircraft. It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation as a fast transport to carry small, high-value cargo to and from neutral countries through enemy-controlled airspace. The crew of two, pilot and navigator, sat side by side. A single passenger could ride in the aircraft&#x27;s bomb bay when necessary.

The Mosquito FB Mk. VI was often flown in special raids, such as Operation Jericho (an attack on Amiens Prison in early 1944), and precision attacks against military intelligence, security, and police facilities (such as Gestapo headquarters). On 30 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of Hitler being made chancellor and the Nazis gaining power, a morning Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while Hermann Göring was speaking, taking his speech off the air.
The Mosquito flew with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and other air forces in the European, Mediterranean, and Italian theatres. The Mosquito was also operated by the RAF in the Southeast Asian theatre and by the Royal Australian Air Force based in the Moluccas and Borneo during the Pacific War. During the 1950s, the RAF replaced the Mosquito with the jet-powered English Electric Canberra.

==Development==

By the early to mid-1930s, de Havilland had built a reputation for innovative high-speed aircraft with the DH.88 Comet racer. Later, the DH.91 Albatross airliner pioneered the composite wood construction used for the Mosquito. The 22-passenger Albatross could cruise at at , faster than the Handley Page H.P.42 and other biplanes it was replacing. The wooden monocoque construction not only saved weight and compensated for the low power of the de Havilland Gipsy Twelve engines used by this aircraft, but also simplified production and reduced construction time.

===Air Ministry bomber requirements and concepts===
On 8 September 1936, the British Air Ministry issued Specification P.13/36, which called for a twin-engined medium bomber capable of carrying a bomb load of for with a maximum speed of at ; a maximum bomb load of carried over shorter ranges was also required. Aviation firms entered heavy designs with new high-powered engines and multiple defensive turrets, leading to the production of the Avro Manchester and Handley Page Halifax.

In May 1937, as a comparison to P.13/36, George Volkert, the chief designer of Handley Page, put forward the concept of a fast, unarmed bomber. In 20 pages, Volkert planned an aerodynamically clean, medium bomber to carry of bombs at a cruising speed of . Support existed in the RAF and Air Ministry; Captain R. N. Liptrot, Research Director Aircraft 3, appraised Volkert&#x27;s design, calculating that its top speed would exceed that of the new Supermarine Spitfire, but counter-arguments held that although such a design had merit, it would not necessarily be faster than enemy fighters for long. The ministry was also considering using non-strategic materials for aircraft production, which, in 1938, had led to specification B.9/38 and the Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle medium bomber, largely constructed from spruce and plywood attached to a steel-tube frame. The idea of a small, fast bomber gained support at a much earlier stage than is sometimes acknowledged, though the Air Ministry likely envisaged it using light alloy components.

===Inception of the de Havilland fast bomber===

Based on his experience with the Albatross, Geoffrey de Havilland believed that a bomber with a good aerodynamic design and smooth, minimal skin area, would exceed the P.13/36 specification. Furthermore, adapting the Albatross principles could save time. In April 1938, performance estimates were produced for a twin Rolls-Royce Merlin-powered DH.91, with the Bristol Hercules (radial engine) and Napier Sabre (H-engine) as alternatives. On 7 July 1938, de Havilland wrote to Air Marshal Wilfrid Freeman, the Air Council&#x27;s member for Research and Development, discussing the specification and arguing that in war, shortages of aluminium and steel would occur, but supplies of wood-based products were &quot;adequate.&quot; Although inferior in tension, the strength-to-weight ratio of wood is equal to or better than light alloys or steel, hence this approach was feasible. Lord Beaverbrook, Minister of Aircraft Production, nicknamed it &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Folly&quot;, alluding to Air Chief Marshal Sir Wilfrid Freeman, who defended Geoffrey de Havilland and his design concept against orders to scrap the project.

A follow-up letter to Freeman on 27 July said that the P.13/36 specification could not be met by a twin Merlin-powered aircraft and either the top speed or load capacity would be compromised, depending on which was paramount. For example, a larger, slower, turret-armed aircraft would have a range of carrying a 4,000 lb bomb load, with a maximum of at , and a cruising speed of at . De Havilland believed that a compromise, including eliminating surplus equipment, would improve matters. On 4 October 1938, de Havilland projected the performance of another design based on the Albatross, powered by two Merlin Xs, with a three-man crew and six or eight forward-firing guns, plus one or two manually operated guns and a tail turret. Based on a total loaded weight of , it would have a top speed of and cruising speed of at .

Still believing this could be improved, and after examining more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal DH.95 Flamingo, de Havilland settled on designing a new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, wooden, and powered by the Merlin, which offered substantial future development. The new design would be faster than foreseeable enemy fighter aircraft, and could dispense with defensive armament which would slow it and make interception or losses to antiaircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and good manoeuvrability would make evading fighters and ground fire easier. The lack of turrets simplified production, reduced drag, and reduced production time, with a delivery rate far in advance of competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and navigator. Whereas contemporary RAF design philosophy favoured well-armed heavy bombers, this mode of design was more akin to the German philosophy of the &quot;Schnellbomber&quot;. At a meeting in early October 1938 with Geoffrey de Havilland and Charles Walker (de Havilland&#x27;s chief engineer), the Air Ministry showed little interest, and instead asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a subcontractor.

By September 1939, de Havilland had produced preliminary estimates for single- and twin-engined variations of light-bomber designs using different engines, speculating on the effects of defensive armament on their designs. One design, completed on 6 September, was for an aircraft powered by a single Napier Sabre, with a wingspan of and capable of carrying a bomb load . On 20 September, in another letter to Wilfrid Freeman, de Havilland wrote &quot;...we believe that we could produce a twin-engine bomber which would have a performance so outstanding that little defensive equipment would be needed.&quot; By 4 October, work had progressed to a twin-engined light bomber with a wingspan of and powered by Merlin or Griffon engines, the Merlin favoured because of availability. On 7 October 1939, a month into the war, the nucleus of a design team under Eric Bishop moved to the security and secrecy of Salisbury Hall to work on what was later known as the DH.98. For more versatility, Bishop made provision for four 20 mm cannon in the forward half of the bomb bay, under the cockpit, firing via blast tubes and troughs under the fuselage.

The DH.98 was too radical for the ministry, which wanted a heavily armed, multirole aircraft, combining medium bomber, reconnaissance, and general-purpose roles, that was also capable of carrying torpedoes. With the outbreak of war, the ministry became more receptive, but was still sceptical about an unarmed bomber. They thought the Germans would produce fighters that were faster than had been expected. and suggested the incorporation of two forward- and two rear-firing machine guns for defence. The ministry also opposed a two-man bomber, wanting at least a third crewman to reduce the work of the others on long flights. The Air Council added further requirements such as remotely controlled guns, a top speed of at 15,000 ft on two-thirds engine power, and a range of with a 4,000-lb bomb load. To appease the ministry, de Havilland built mock-ups with a gun turret just aft of the cockpit, but apart from this compromise, de Havilland made no changes.

On 12 November, at a meeting considering fast-bomber ideas put forward by de Havilland, Blackburn, and Bristol, Air Marshal Freeman directed de Havilland to produce a fast aircraft, powered initially by Merlin engines, with options of using progressively more powerful engines, including the Rolls-Royce Griffon and the Napier Sabre. Although estimates were presented for a slightly larger Griffon-powered aircraft, armed with a four-gun tail turret, Freeman got the requirement for defensive weapons dropped, and a draft requirement was raised calling for a high-speed, light-reconnaissance bomber capable of at 18,000 ft.

On 12 December, the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, Director General of Research and Development, and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief (AOC-in-C) of RAF Bomber Command met to finalise the design and decide how to fit it into the RAF&#x27;s aims. The AOC-in-C would not accept an unarmed bomber, but insisted on its suitability for reconnaissance missions with F8 or F24 cameras. After company representatives, the ministry, and the RAF&#x27;s operational commands examined a full-scale mock-up at Hatfield on 29 December 1939, the project received backing. This was confirmed on 1 January 1940, when Freeman chaired a meeting with Geoffrey de Havilland, John Buchanan (Deputy of Aircraft Production), and John Connolly (Buchanan&#x27;s chief of staff). De Havilland claimed the DH.98 was the &quot;fastest bomber in the world ... it must be useful&quot;. Freeman supported it for RAF service, ordering a single prototype for an unarmed bomber to specification B.1/40/dh, which called for a light bomber/reconnaissance aircraft powered by two Rolls-Royce RM3SM (an early designation for the Merlin 21) with ducted radiators, capable of carrying a bomb load. The aircraft was to have a speed of at and a cruising speed of at with a range of at on full tanks. Maximum service ceiling was to be .

On 1 March 1940, Air Marshal Roderic Hill issued a contract under Specification B.1/40, for 50 bomber-reconnaissance variants of the DH.98; this contract included the prototype, which was given the factory serial &quot;E-0234&quot;. In May 1940, specification F.21/40 was issued, calling for a long-range fighter armed with four 20 mm cannon and four .303 machine guns in the nose, after which de Havilland was authorised to build a prototype of a fighter version of the DH.98. After debate, it was decided that this prototype, given the military serial number &quot;W4052&quot;, was to carry aircraft interception (AI) Mk IV radar equipment as both a day fighter and night fighter. By June 1940, the DH.98 had been named &quot;Mosquito&quot;. Having the fighter variant kept the Mosquito project alive, as doubts remained within the government and Air Ministry regarding the usefulness of an unarmed bomber, even after the prototype had shown its capabilities.

===Project Mosquito===

With design of the DH.98 started, mock-ups were built, the most detailed at Salisbury Hall, where &quot;E-0234&quot; was later constructed. Initially, the concept was for the crew to be enclosed in the fuselage behind a transparent nose (similar to the Bristol Blenheim or Heinkel He 111H), but this was quickly altered to a more solid nose with a conventional canopy.

Work was cancelled again after the evacuation of the British Army from France, when Lord Beaverbrook, as Minister of Aircraft Production, concentrating production on aircraft types for the defence of the UK decided no production capacity remained for aircraft like the DH.98, which was not expected to be in service until early 1942. Beaverbrook told Air Vice-Marshal Freeman that work on the project should stop, but he did not issue a specific instruction, and Freeman ignored the request. In June 1940, however, Lord Beaverbrook and the Air Staff ordered that production should concentrate on five existing types, namely the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane fighter, Vickers Wellington, Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley, and Bristol Blenheim bombers. Work on the DH.98 prototype stopped. Apparently, the project shut down when the design team were denied materials for the prototype.

The Mosquito was only reinstated as a priority in July 1940, after de Havilland&#x27;s general manager, L.C.L. Murray, promised Lord Beaverbrook 50 Mosquitoes by December 1941. This was only after Beaverbrook was satisfied that Mosquito production would not hinder de Havilland&#x27;s primary work of producing Tiger Moth and Airspeed Oxford trainers, repairing Hurricanes, and manufacturing Merlin engines under licence. In promising Beaverbrook such a number by the end of 1941, de Havilland was taking a gamble, because they were unlikely to be built in such a limited time. As it transpired, only 20 aircraft were built in 1941, but the other 30 were delivered by mid-March 1942. During the Battle of Britain, interruptions to production due to air raid warnings caused nearly a third of de Havilland&#x27;s factory time to be lost. Nevertheless, work on the prototype went ahead quickly at Salisbury Hall since &quot;E-0234&quot; was completed by November 1940.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Britain, the original order was changed to 20 bomber variants and 30 fighters. Whether the fighter version should have dual or single controls, or should carry a turret, was still uncertain, so three prototypes were built: &quot;W4052&quot;, &quot;W4053&quot;, and &quot;W4073&quot;. The second and third, both turret armed, were later disarmed, to become the prototypes for the T.III trainer. This caused some delays, since half-built wing components had to be strengthened for the required higher combat loading. The nose sections also had to be changed from a design with a clear perspex bomb-aimer&#x27;s position, to one with a solid nose housing four .303 machine guns and their ammunition.

===Prototypes and test flights===
On 3 November 1940, the prototype aircraft, painted in &quot;prototype yellow&quot; and still coded &quot;E-0234&quot;, was dismantled, transported by road to Hatfield and placed in a small, blast-proof assembly building. Two Merlin 21 two-speed, single-stage supercharged engines were installed, driving three-bladed de Havilland Hydromatic constant-speed controllable-pitch propellers. Engine runs were made on 19 November. On 24 November, taxiing trials were carried out by Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., the de Havilland test pilot. On 25 November, the aircraft made its first flight, piloted by de Havilland Jr., accompanied by John E. Walker, the chief engine installation designer.

For this maiden flight, &quot;E-0234&quot;, weighing , took off from the grass airstrip at Hatfield. The takeoff was reported as &quot;straightforward and easy&quot; and the undercarriage was not retracted until a considerable altitude was attained. The aircraft reached , with the only problem being the undercarriage doors, which were operated by bungee cords attached to the main undercarriage legs, and remained open by some at that speed. This problem persisted for some time. The left wing of &quot;E-0234&quot; also had a tendency to drag slightly to port, so a slight change in the angle of the wing was carried out before further flights.
On 5 December 1940, the prototype, with the military serial number &quot;W4050&quot;, experienced tail buffeting at speeds between . The pilot noticed this most in the control column, with handling becoming more difficult. During testing on 10 December, wool tufts were attached to suspect areas to investigate the direction of airflow. The conclusion was that the airflow separating from the rear section of the inner engine nacelles was disturbed, leading to a localised stall and the disturbed airflow was striking the tailplane, causing buffeting. To smooth the air flow and deflect it from forcefully striking the tailplane, nonretractable slots fitted to the inner engine nacelles and to the leading edge of the tailplane were tested. These slots and wing-root fairings fitted to the forward fuselage and leading edge of the radiator intakes stopped some of the vibration experienced, but did not cure the tailplane buffeting.

In February 1941, buffeting was eliminated by incorporating triangular fillets on the trailing edge of the wings and lengthening the nacelles, the trailing edge of which curved up to fair into the fillet some behind the wing&#x27;s trailing edge; this meant the flaps had to be divided into inboard and outboard sections. With the buffeting problems largely resolved, John Cunningham flew &quot;W4050&quot; on 9 February 1941. He was greatly impressed by the &quot;lightness of the controls and generally pleasant handling characteristics&quot;. Cunningham concluded that when the type was fitted with AI equipment, it might replace the Bristol Beaufighter night fighter.

During its trials on 16 January 1941, &quot;W4050&quot; outpaced a Spitfire at . The original estimates were that as the Mosquito prototype had twice the surface area and over twice the weight of the Spitfire Mk.II, but also had twice its power, the Mosquito would be faster. Over the next few months, &quot;W4050&quot; surpassed this estimate, easily beating the Spitfire Mk.II in tests at RAF Boscombe Down in February 1941, reaching a top speed of at , compared to a top speed of at for the Spitfire.

On 19 February, official trials began at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (AAEE) based at Boscombe Down, although the de Havilland representative was surprised by a delay in starting the tests. On 24 February, as &quot;W4050&quot; taxied across the rough airfield, the tailwheel jammed leading to the fuselage fracturing. Repairs were made by early March, using part of the fuselage of the photo-reconnaissance prototype &quot;W4051&quot;. In spite of this setback, the &quot;Initial Handling Report 767&quot; issued by the AAEE stated, &quot;The aeroplane is pleasant to fly ... aileron control light and effective...&quot; The maximum speed reached was at , with an estimated maximum ceiling of and a maximum rate of climb of at .

&quot;W4050&quot; continued to be used for various test programmes, as the experimental &quot;workhorse&quot; for the Mosquito family. In late October 1941, it returned to the factory to be fitted with Merlin 61s, the first production Merlins fitted with a two-speed, two-stage supercharger. The first flight with the new engines was on 20 June 1942. &quot;W4050&quot; recorded a maximum speed of at (fitted with straight-through air intakes with snow guards, engines in full supercharger gear) and at without snow guards. In October 1942, in connection with development work on the NF Mk.XV, &quot;W4050&quot; was fitted with extended wingtips, increasing the span to , first flying in this configuration on 8 December. Fitted with high-altitude-rated, two-stage, two-speed Merlin 77s, it reached in December 1943. Soon after these flights, &quot;W4050&quot; was grounded and scheduled to be scrapped, but instead served as an instructional airframe at Hatfield. In September 1958, &quot;W4050&quot; was returned to the Salisbury Hall hangar where it was built, restored to its original configuration, and became one of the primary exhibits of the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre.
&quot;W4051&quot;, which was designed from the outset to be the prototype for the photo-reconnaissance versions of the Mosquito, was slated to make its first flight in early 1941. However, the fuselage fracture in &quot;W4050&quot; meant that &quot;W4051&#x27;s&quot; fuselage was used as a replacement; &quot;W4051&quot; was then rebuilt using a production standard fuselage and first flew on 10 June 1941. This prototype continued to use the short engine nacelles, single-piece trailing-edge flaps, and the &quot;No. 1&quot; tailplane used by &quot;W4050&quot;, but had production-standard wings and became the only Mosquito prototype to fly operationally.

Construction of the fighter prototype, &quot;W4052&quot;, was also carried out at Salisbury Hall. It was powered by Merlin 21s, and had an altered canopy structure with a flat, bullet-proof windscreen; the solid nose had mounted four .303 British Browning machine guns and their ammunition boxes, accessible by a large, sideways hinged panel. Four 20-mm Hispano Mk.II cannon were housed in a compartment under the cockpit floor with the breeches projecting into the bomb bay and the automatic bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors, which incorporated cartridge ejector chutes.

As a day and night fighter, prototype &quot;W4052&quot; was equipped with AI Mk IV equipment, complete with an &quot;arrowhead&quot; transmission aerial mounted between the central Brownings and receiving aerials through the outer wing tips, and it was painted in black RDM2a &quot;Special Night&quot; finish. It was also the first prototype constructed with the extended engine nacelles. &quot;W4052&quot; was later tested with other modifications, including bomb racks, drop tanks, barrage balloon cable cutters in the leading edge of the wings, Hamilton airscrews and braking propellers, and drooping aileron systems that enabled steep approaches and a larger rudder tab. It continued to serve as a test machine until it was scrapped on 28 January 1946. &quot;4055&quot; flew the first operational Mosquito flight on 17 September 1941.

During flight testing, the Mosquito prototypes were modified to test a number of configurations. &quot;W4050&quot; was fitted with a turret behind the cockpit for drag tests, after which the idea was abandoned in July 1941. &quot;W4052&quot; had the first version of the Youngman Frill airbrake fitted to the fighter prototype. The frill was mounted around the fuselage behind the wing and was opened by bellows and venturi effect to provide rapid deceleration during interceptions and was tested between January and August 1942, but was also abandoned when lowering the undercarriage was found to have the same effect with less buffeting.
===Production plans and American interest===
The Air Ministry authorised mass production plans on 21 June 1941, by which time the Mosquito had become one of the world&#x27;s fastest operational aircraft. It ordered 19 photo-reconnaissance (PR) models and 176 fighters. A further 50 were unspecified; in July 1941, these were confirmed to be unarmed fast bombers. By the end of January 1942, contracts had been awarded for 1,378 Mosquitoes of all variants, including 20 T.III trainers and 334 FB.VI bombers. Another 400 were to be built by de Havilland Canada.

On 20 April 1941, &quot;W4050&quot; was demonstrated to Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Aircraft Production. The Mosquito made a series of flights, including one rolling climb on one engine. Also present were US General Henry H. Arnold and his aide Major Elwood Quesada, who wrote &quot;I ... recall the first time I saw the Mosquito as being impressed by its performance, which we were aware of. We were impressed by the appearance of the airplane that looks fast usually is fast, and the Mosquito was, by the standards of the time, an extremely well-streamlined airplane, and it was highly regarded, highly respected.&quot;

The trials set up future production plans between Britain, Australia, and Canada. Six days later, Arnold returned to America with a full set of manufacturer&#x27;s drawings. As a result of his report, five companies (Beech, Curtiss-Wright, Fairchild, Fleetwings, and Hughes) were asked to evaluate the de Havilland data. The report by Beech Aircraft summed up the general view: &quot;It appears as though this airplane has sacrificed serviceability, structural strength, ease of construction and flying characteristics in an attempt to use construction material which is not suitable for the manufacture of efficient airplanes.&quot; The Americans did not pursue the proposal for licensed production, the consensus arguing that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning could fulfill the same duties. However, Arnold urged the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) to evaluate the design even if they would not adopt it. On 12 December 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USAAF requested one airframe for this purpose.

==Design and manufacture==
===Overview===

While timber construction for aircraft was considered outmoded by some, de Havilland claimed that their successes with techniques used for the DH 91 Albatross could lead to a fast, light bomber using monocoque-sandwich shell construction. Arguments in favour of this included speed of prototyping, rapid development, minimisation of jig-building time, and employment of a separate category of workforce; many production facilities and skilled carpenters that previously manufactured furniture were repurposed to create components for the Mosquito, leveraging an existing workforce whose expertise was generally not being utilised during the war effort.

The ply-balsa-ply monocoque fuselage and one-piece wings with doped fabric covering would give excellent aerodynamic performance and low weight, combined with strength and stiffness. At the same time, the design team had to fight conservative Air Ministry views on defensive armament. Guns and gun turrets, favoured by the ministry, would impair the aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamic properties and reduce speed and manoeuvrability, in the opinion of the designers. Whilst submitting these arguments, Geoffrey de Havilland funded his private venture until a very late stage. The project was a success beyond all expectations.

As a multi-role warplane, the Mosquito came in multiple versions: photo-reconnaissance (PR), bomber (B), fighter (F), night fighter (NF), fighter-bomber (FB), torpedo bomber (TR) with fold-up wings to fit more on a carrier, and trainer (T), each with varying modifications and weapon loadouts. Typical gun armament was four .303 caliber Browning machine guns and four 20 mm Hispano autocannons. Bomb load could be up to 4,000 lb (1,800 kg), allowing the Mosquito to carry a single &quot;Cookie&quot; blockbuster bomb, or a number of smaller ones.

The most-produced variant, designated the FB Mk. VI (Fighter-bomber Mark 6), was powered by two Merlin Mk.23 or Mk.25 engines driving three-bladed de Havilland hydromatic propellers. The typical fixed armament for an FB Mk. VI was four Browning .303 machine guns and four 20-mm Hispano cannons, while the offensive load consisted of up to of bombs, or eight RP-3 unguided rockets.

===Performance===
The design was noted for light and effective control surfaces that provided good manoeuvrability, but required that the rudder not be used aggressively at high speeds. Poor aileron control at low speeds when landing and taking off was also a problem for inexperienced crews. For flying at low speeds, the flaps had to be set at 15°, speed reduced to , and rpm set to 2,650. The speed could be reduced to an acceptable for low-speed flying. For cruising, the optimum speed for obtaining maximum range was at weight.

The Mosquito had a high stalling speed of with undercarriage and flaps raised. When both were lowered, the stalling speed decreased from . Stall speed at normal approach angle and conditions was . Warning of the stall was given by buffeting and would occur before stall was reached. The conditions and impact of the stall were not severe. The wing did not drop unless the control column was pulled back. The nose drooped gently and recovery was easy.

Early on in the Mosquito&#x27;s operational life, the intake shrouds that were to cool the exhausts on production aircraft overheated. Flame dampers prevented exhaust glow on night operations, but they had an effect on performance. Multiple ejector and open-ended exhaust stubs helped solve the problem and were used in the PR.VIII, B.IX, and B.XVI variants. This increased speed performance in the B.IX alone by .

===Fuselage===
The oval-section fuselage was a frameless monocoque shell built in two vertically separate halves formed over a mahogany or concrete mould. Pressure was applied with band clamps. Some of the 1/2—3/4&quot; shell sandwich skins comprised 3/32&quot; birch three-ply outers, with 7/16&quot; cores of Ecuadorean balsa. In many generally smaller but vital areas, such as around apertures and attachment zones, stronger timbers, including aircraft-quality spruce, replaced the balsa core. The main areas of the sandwich skin were only thick. Together with various forms of wood reinforcement, often of laminated construction, the sandwich skin gave great stiffness and torsional resistance. The separate fuselage halves speeded construction, permitting access by personnel working in parallel with others, as the work progressed.

Work on the separate half-fuselages included installation of control mechanisms and cabling. Screwed inserts into the inner skins that would be under stress in service were reinforced using round shear plates made from a fabric-Bakelite composite.
Transverse bulkheads were also compositely built-up with several species of timber, plywood, and balsa. Seven vertically halved bulkheads were installed within each moulded fuselage shell before the main &quot;boxing up&quot; operation. Bulkhead number seven was especially strongly built, since it carried the fitments and transmitted the aerodynamic loadings for the tailplane and rudder. The fuselage had a large ventral section cut-out, strongly reinforced, that allowed the fuselage to be lowered onto the wing centre-section at a later stage of assembly.

For early production aircraft, the structural assembly adhesive was casein-based. At a later stage, this was replaced by &quot;Aerolite&quot;, a synthetic urea-formaldehyde type, which was more durable. To provide for the edge joints for the fuselage halves, zones near the outer edges of the shells had their balsa sandwich cores replaced by much stronger inner laminations of birch plywood. For the bonding together of the two halves (&quot;boxing up&quot;), a longitudinal cut was machined into these edges. The profile of this cut was a form of V-groove. Part of the edge bonding process also included adding further longitudinal plywood lap strips on the outside of the shells. The half bulkheads of each shell were bonded to their corresponding pair in a similar way. Two laminated wooden clamps were used in the after portion of the fuselage to provide supports during this complex gluing work. The resulting large structural components had to be kept completely still and held in the correct environment until the glue cured.

For finishing, a covering of doped madapollam (a fine, plain-woven cotton) fabric was stretched tightly over the shell and several coats of red, followed by silver dope, were added, followed by the final camouflage paint.

===Wing===

The all-wood wing pairs formed a single structural unit throughout the wingspan, with no central longitudinal joint. Instead, the spars ran from wingtip to wingtip. There was a single continuous main spar and another continuous rear spar. Because of the combination of dihedral with the forward sweep of the trailing edges of the wings, this rear spar was one of the most complex units to laminate and to finish machining after the bonding and curing. It had to produce the correct 3D tilt in each of two planes. Also, it was designed and made to taper from the wing roots towards the wingtips. Both principal spars were of ply box construction, using in general 0.25-in plywood webs with laminated spruce flanges, plus a number of additional reinforcements and special details.

Spruce and plywood ribs were connected with gusset joints. Some heavy-duty ribs contained pieces of ash and walnut, as well as the special five ply that included veneers laid up at 45°. The upper skin construction was in two layers of 0.25-in five-ply birch, separated by Douglas fir stringers running in the span-wise direction. The wings were covered with madapollam fabric and doped in a similar manner to the fuselage. The wing was installed into the roots by means of four large attachment points. The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater.

The wing contained metal-framed and -skinned ailerons, but the flaps were made of wood and were hydraulically controlled. The nacelles were mostly wood, although for strength, the engine mounts were all metal, as were the undercarriage parts. Engine mounts of welded steel tube were added, along with simple landing gear oleos filled with rubber blocks. Wood was used to carry only in-plane loads, with metal fittings used for all triaxially loaded components such as landing gear, engine mounts, control-surface mounting brackets, and the wing-to-fuselage junction. The outer leading wing edge had to be brought further forward to accommodate this design. The main tail unit was all wood built. The control surfaces, the rudder, and elevator were aluminium-framed and fabric-covered. The total weight of metal castings and forgings used in the aircraft was only .
In November 1944, several crashes occurred in the Far East. At first, these were thought to be a result of wing-structure failures. The casein glue, it was said, cracked when exposed to extreme heat and/or monsoon conditions. This caused the upper surfaces to lift from the main spar. An investigating team led by Major Hereward de Havilland travelled to India and produced a report in early December 1944 stating, &quot;the accidents were not caused by the deterioration of the glue, but by shrinkage of the airframe during the wet monsoon season&quot;. However, a later inquiry by Cabot &amp; Myers firmly attributed the accidents to faulty manufacture and this was confirmed by a further investigation team by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at Defford, which found faults in six Mosquito marks (all built at de Havilland&#x27;s Hatfield and Leavesden plants). The defects were similar, and none of the aircraft had been exposed to monsoon conditions or termite attack.

The investigators concluded that construction defects occurred at the two plants. They found that the &quot;...standard of glueing ... left much to be desired.&quot; Records at the time showed that accidents caused by &quot;loss of control&quot; were three times more frequent on Mosquitoes than on any other type of aircraft. The Air Ministry forestalled any loss of confidence in the Mosquito by holding to Major de Havilland&#x27;s initial investigation in India that the accidents were caused &quot;largely by climate&quot; To solve the problem of seepage into the interior, a strip of plywood was set along the span of the wing to seal the entire length of the skin joint.

===Systems===
The fuel systems gave the Mosquito good range and endurance, using up to nine fuel tanks. Two outer wing tanks each contained of fuel. These were complemented by two inner wing fuel tanks, each containing , located between the wing root and engine nacelle. In the central fuselage were twin fuel tanks mounted between bulkhead number two and three aft of the cockpit. In the FB.VI, these tanks contained each, while in the B.IV and other unarmed Mosquitoes each of the two centre tanks contained . Both the inner wing, and fuselage tanks are listed as the &quot;main tanks&quot; and the total internal fuel load of was initially deemed appropriate for the type. In addition, the FB Mk. VI could have larger fuselage tanks, increasing the capacity to . Drop tanks of or could be mounted under each wing, increasing the total fuel load to .

The design of the Mk.VI allowed for a provisional long-range fuel tank to increase range for action over enemy territory, for the installation of bomb release equipment specific to depth charges for strikes against enemy shipping, or for the simultaneous use of rocket projectiles along with a drop tank under each wing supplementing the main fuel cells. The FB.VI had a wingspan of , a length (over guns) of . It had a maximum speed of at . Maximum take-off weight was and the range of the aircraft was with a service ceiling of .

To reduce fuel vaporisation at the high altitudes of photographic reconnaissance variants, the central and inner wing tanks were pressurised. The pressure venting cock located behind the pilot&#x27;s seat controlled the pressure valve. As the altitude increased, the valve increased the volume applied by a pump. This system was extended to include field modifications of the fuel tank system.

The engine oil tanks were in the engine nacelles. Each nacelle contained a oil tank, including a air space. The oil tanks themselves had no separate coolant controlling systems. The coolant header tank was in the forward nacelle, behind the propeller. The remaining coolant systems were controlled by the coolant radiators shutters in the forward inner wing compartment, between the nacelle and the fuselage and behind the main engine cooling radiators, which were fitted in the leading edge. Electric-pneumatic operated radiator shutters directed and controlled airflow through the ducts and into the coolant valves, to predetermined temperatures.

Electrical power came from a 24 volt DC generator on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine, which also supplied AC power for radios. The radiator shutters, supercharger gear change, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release and all the other crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 V battery. The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically in the event of a crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.

The main landing gear, housed in the nacelles behind the engines, were raised and lowered hydraulically. The main landing gear shock absorbers were de Havilland manufactured and used a system of rubber in compression, rather than hydraulic oleos, with twin pneumatic brakes for each wheel. The Dunlop-Marstrand anti-shimmy tailwheel was also retractable.

==Operational history==
The de Havilland Mosquito operated in many roles, performing medium bomber, reconnaissance, tactical strike, anti-submarine warfare, shipping attacks and night fighter duties, until the end of the war. On the 13th of July 1941, the first production PR Mosquito &quot;W4051&quot; (a production fuselage combined with some prototype flying surfaces – see Prototypes and test flights) was sent to No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU), at RAF Benson. The secret reconnaissance flights of this aircraft were the first operational missions of the Mosquito. In 1944, the journal &quot;Flight&quot; gave 19 September 1941 as date of the first PR mission, at an altitude &quot;of some 20,000 ft&quot;.

On 15 November 1941, 105 Squadron, RAF, took delivery at RAF Swanton Morley, Norfolk, of the first operational Mosquito Mk. B.IV bomber, serial no. &quot;W4064&quot;. Throughout 1942, 105 Squadron, based next at RAF Horsham St. Faith, then from 29 September, RAF Marham, undertook daylight low-level and shallow dive attacks. Apart from the Oslo and Berlin raids, the strikes were mainly on industrial and infrastructure targets in occupied Netherlands and Norway, France and northern and western Germany. The crews faced deadly flak and fighters, particularly Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, which they called &quot;snappers&quot;. Germany still controlled continental airspace and the Fw 190s were often already airborne and at an advantageous altitude. Collisions within the formations also caused casualties. It was the Mosquito&#x27;s excellent handling capabilities, rather than pure speed, that facilitated successful evasions.

The Mosquito was first announced publicly on 26 September 1942 after the Oslo Mosquito raid of 25 September. It was featured in &quot;The Times&quot; on 28 September and the next day the newspaper published two captioned photographs illustrating the bomb strikes and damage. On 6 December 1942, Mosquitoes from Nos. 105 and 139 Squadrons made up part of the bomber force used in Operation Oyster, the large No. 2 Group raid against the Philips works at Eindhoven.

From mid-1942 to mid-1943, Mosquito bombers flew high-speed, medium and low-altitude daylight missions against factories, railways and other pinpoint targets in Germany and German-occupied Europe. From June 1943, Mosquito bombers were formed into the Light Night Striking Force to guide RAF Bomber Command heavy bomber raids and as &quot;nuisance&quot; bombers, dropping Blockbuster bombs – &quot;cookies&quot; – in high-altitude, high-speed raids that German night fighters were almost powerless to intercept.

As a night fighter from mid-1942, the Mosquito intercepted &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; raids on Britain, notably those of Operation Steinbock in 1944. Starting in July 1942, Mosquito night-fighter units raided &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; airfields. As part of 100 Group, it was flown as a night fighter and as an intruder supporting Bomber Command heavy bombers that reduced losses during 1944 and 1945.

The Mosquito fighter-bomber served as a strike aircraft in the Second Tactical Air Force (2TAF) from its inception on 1 June 1943. The main objective was to prepare for the invasion of occupied Europe a year later. In Operation Overlord three Mosquito FB Mk. VI wings flew close air support for the Allied armies in co-operation with other RAF units equipped with the North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber. In the months between the foundation of 2TAF and its duties from D day onwards, vital training was interspersed with attacks on V-1 flying bomb launch sites.

In another example of the daylight precision raids carried out by the Mosquitoes of Nos. 105 and 139 Squadrons, on 30 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of the Nazis&#x27; seizure of power, a morning Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Chief Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring was speaking, putting his speech off the air. A second sortie in the afternoon inconvenienced another speech, by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. Lecturing a group of German aircraft manufacturers, Göring said:

During this daylight-raiding phase, Nos. 105 and 139 Squadrons flew 139 combat operations and aircrew losses were high. Even the losses incurred in the squadrons&#x27; dangerous Blenheim era were exceeded in percentage terms. The Roll of Honour shows 51 aircrew deaths from the end of May 1942 to April 1943. In the corresponding period, crews gained three Mentions in Despatches, two DFMs and three DFCs. The low-level daylight attacks finished on 27 May 1943 with strikes on the Schott glass and Zeiss instrument works, both in Jena. Subsequently, when low-level precision attacks required Mosquitoes, they were allotted to squadrons operating the FB.IV version. Examples include the Aarhus air raid and Operation Jericho.

Since the beginning of the year, the German fighter force had become seriously overstretched. In April 1943, in response to &quot;political humiliation&quot; caused by the Mosquito, Göring ordered the formation of special &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; units (&quot;Jagdgeschwader 25&quot;, commanded by &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; Herbert Ihlefeld and &quot;Jagdgeschwader 50&quot;, under &quot;Major&quot; Hermann Graf) to combat the Mosquito attacks, though these units, which were &quot;little more than glorified squadrons&quot;, were unsuccessful against the elusive RAF aircraft. Post-war German histories also indicate that there was a belief within the Luftwaffe that Mosquito aircraft &quot;gave only a weak radar signal.&quot;.

The first Mosquito Squadron to be equipped with the Oboe bomb aiming system was No. 109, based at RAF Wyton, after working as an experimental unit at RAF Boscombe Down. They used Oboe operationally for the first time on 31 December 1942 and 1 January 1943, target marking for a force of heavy bombers attacking Düsseldorf.. On 1 June, the two pioneering Squadrons joined No. 109 Squadron in the re-formed No. 8 Group RAF (Bomber Command). Initially they were engaged in moderately high altitude (about ) night bombing, with 67 trips during that summer, mainly to Berlin. Soon after, Nos. 105 and 139 Squadron bombers were widely used by the RAF Pathfinder Force, marking targets for the main night-time strategic bombing force.

In what were, initially, diversionary &quot;nuisance raids,&quot; Mosquito bombers dropped 4,000 lb Blockbuster bombs or &quot;Cookies.&quot; Particularly after the introduction of H2S (radar) in some Mosquitoes, these raids carrying larger bombs succeeded to the extent that they provided a significant additional form of attack to the large formations of &quot;heavies.&quot; Latterly in the war, there were a significant number of all-Mosquito raids on big German cities involving up to 100 or more aircraft. On the night of 20/21 February 1945, for example, Mosquitoes of No. 8 Group mounted the first of 36 consecutive night raids on Berlin.

From 1943, Mosquitoes with RAF Coastal Command attacked &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; U-boats and intercepted transport ship concentrations. After Operation Overlord, the U-boat threat in the Western Approaches decreased fairly quickly, but correspondingly the Norwegian and Danish waters posed greater dangers. Hence the RAF Coastal Command Mosquitoes were moved to Scotland to counter this threat. The Strike Wing at Banff stood up in September 1944 and comprised Mosquito aircraft of No&#x27;s 143, 144, 235 and 248 Squadrons Royal Air Force and No.333 Squadron Royal Norwegian Air Force. Despite an initially high loss rate, the Mosquito bomber variants ended the war with the lowest losses of any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command service.

The Mosquito also proved a very capable night fighter. Some of the most successful RAF pilots flew these variants. For example, Wing Commander Branse Burbridge claimed 21 kills.

Mosquitoes of No. 100 Group RAF acted as night intruders operating at high level in support of the Bomber Command &quot;heavies&quot;, to counter the enemy tactic of merging into the bomber stream, which, towards the end of 1943, was causing serious allied losses. These RCM (radio countermeasures) aircraft were fitted with a device called &quot;Serrate&quot; to allow them to track down German night fighters from their &quot;Lichtenstein B/C&quot; (low-UHF-band) and &quot;Lichtenstein SN-2&quot; (lower end of the VHF FM broadcast band) radar emissions, as well as a device named &quot;Perfectos&quot; that tracked German IFF signals. These methods were responsible for the destruction of 257 German aircraft from December 1943 to April 1945. Mosquito fighters from all units accounted for 487 German aircraft during the war, the vast majority of which were night fighters.

Night fighter Mosquitos were often tasked with attacking German planes landing at airfields. In 1943, the Germans became acquainted with &quot;Moskitoschreck&quot;, &quot;Mosquito terror,&quot; the constant fear of an unexpected Mosquito attack during a nighttime landing.

One Mosquito is listed as belonging to German secret operations unit &quot;Kampfgeschwader 200&quot;, which tested, evaluated and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during the war. The aircraft was listed on the order of battle of &quot;Versuchsverband OKL&quot;″s, &quot;2 Staffel&quot;, &quot;Stab Gruppe&quot; on 10 November and 31 December 1944. However, on both lists, the Mosquito is listed as unserviceable.

The Mosquito flew its last official European war mission on 21 May 1945, when Mosquitoes of 143 Squadron and 248 Squadron RAF were ordered to continue to hunt German submarines that might be tempted to continue the fight; instead of submarines all the Mosquitoes encountered were passive E-boats.

The last operational RAF Mosquitoes were the Mosquito TT.35&#x27;s, which were finally retired from No. 3 Civilian Anti-Aircraft Co-Operation Unit (CAACU) in May 1963.

In 1947–49, up to 180 Canadian surplus Mosquitoes flew many operations for the Nationalist Chinese under Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war against Communist forces. Pilots from three squadrons of Mosquitoes claimed to have sunk or damaged 500 ships during one invasion attempt. As the Communists assumed control, the remaining aircraft were evacuated to Formosa, where they flew missions against shipping.

==Variants==
Until the end of 1942 the RAF always used Roman numerals (I, II, ...) for mark numbers; 1943–1948 was a transition period during which new aircraft entering service were given Arabic numerals (1, 2, ...) for mark numbers, but older aircraft retained their Roman numerals. From 1948 onwards, Arabic numerals were used exclusively.
===Prototypes===
Three prototypes were built, each with a different configuration. The first to fly was &quot;W4050&quot; on 25 November 1940, followed by the fighter &quot;W4052&quot; on 15 May 1941 and the photo-reconnaissance prototype &quot;W4051&quot; on 10 June 1941. &quot;W4051&quot; later flew operationally with 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (1 PRU).

===Photo-reconnaissance===

A total of 10 Mosquito PR Mk.Is were built, four of them &quot;long range&quot; versions equipped with a overload fuel tank in the fuselage. The contract called for 10 of the PR Mk.I airframes to be converted to B Mk.IV Series 1s. All of the PR Mk.Is, and the B Mk.IV Series 1s, had the original short engine nacelles and short span (19 ft 5.5 in) tailplanes. Their engine cowlings incorporated the original pattern of integrated exhaust manifolds, which, after relatively brief flight time, had a troublesome habit of burning and blistering the cowling panels. The first operational sortie by a Mosquito was made by a PR Mk.I, W4055, on 17 September 1941; during this sortie the unarmed Mosquito PR.I evaded three Messerschmitt Bf 109s at . Powered by two Merlin 21s, the PR Mk.I had a maximum speed of , a cruise speed of , a ceiling of , a range of , and a climb rate of per minute.

Over 30 Mosquito B Mk.IV bombers were converted into the PR Mk.IV photo-reconnaissance aircraft. The first operational flight by a PR Mk.IV was made by &quot;DK284&quot; in April 1942.

The Mosquito PR Mk.VIII, built as a stopgap pending the introduction of the refined PR Mk.IX, was the next photo-reconnaissance version. The five VIIIs were converted from B Mk.IVs and became the first operational Mosquito version to be powered by two-stage, two-speed supercharged engines, using Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 engines in place of Merlin 21/22s. The first PR Mk.VIII, &quot;DK324&quot; first flew on 20 October 1942. The PR Mk.VIII had a maximum speed of , an economical cruise speed of at 20,000 ft, and at 30,000 ft, a ceiling of , a range of , and a climb rate of 2,500 ft per minute (760 m).

The Mosquito PR Mk.IX, 90 of which were built, was the first Mosquito variant with two-stage, two-speed engines to be produced in quantity; the first of these, &quot;LR405&quot;, first flew in April 1943. The PR Mk.IX was based on the Mosquito B Mk.IX bomber and was powered by two Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 engines. It could carry either two , two or two droppable fuel tanks.

The Mosquito PR Mk.XVI had a pressurised cockpit and, like the Mk.IX, was powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 piston engines. This version was equipped with three overload fuel tanks, totalling in the bomb bay, and could also carry two or drop tanks. A total of 435 of the PR Mk.XVI were built. The PR Mk.XVI had a maximum speed of , a cruise speed of , ceiling of , a range of , and a climb rate of 2,900 feet per minute (884 m).
The Mosquito PR Mk.32 was a long-range, high-altitude, pressurised photo-reconnaissance version. It was powered by a pair of two-stage supercharged Rolls-Royce Merlin 113 and Merlin 114 piston engines, the Merlin 113 on the starboard side and the Merlin 114 on the port. First flown in August 1944, only five were built and all were conversions from PR.XVIs.

The Mosquito PR Mk.34 and PR Mk.34A was a very long-range unarmed high altitude photo-reconnaissance version. The fuel tank and cockpit protection armour were removed. Additional fuel was carried in a bulged bomb bay: 1,192 gallons—the equivalent of . A further two 200-gallon (910-litre) drop tanks under the outer wings gave a range of cruising at . Powered by two Merlin 114s first used in the PR.32. The port Merlin 114 drove a Marshal cabin supercharger. A total of 181 were built, including 50 built by Percival Aircraft Company at Luton. The PR.34&#x27;s maximum speed (TAS) was at sea level, at and at .
All PR.34s were installed with four split F52 vertical cameras, two forward, two aft of the fuselage tank and one F24 oblique camera. Sometimes a K-17 camera was used for air surveys. In August 1945, the PR.34A was the final photo-reconnaissance variant with one Merlin 113A and 114A each delivering .

Colonel Roy M. Stanley II, USAF (RET) wrote: &quot;I consider the Mosquito the best photo-reconnaissance aircraft of the war&quot;.

After the end of World War II Spartan Air Services used ten ex-RAF Mosquitoes, mostly B.35s plus one of only six PR.35s built, for high-altitude photographic survey work in Canada.

===Bombers===
On 21 June 1941 the Air Ministry ordered that the last 10 Mosquitoes, ordered as photo-reconnaissance aircraft, should be converted to bombers. These 10 aircraft were part of the original 1 March 1940 production order and became the B Mk.IV Series 1. &quot;W4052&quot; was to be the prototype and flew for the first time on 8 September 1941.

The bomber prototype led to the B Mk.IV, of which 273 were built: apart from the 10 Series 1s, all of the rest were built as Series 2s with extended nacelles, revised exhaust manifolds, with integrated flame dampers, and larger tailplanes. Series 2 bombers also differed from the Series 1 in having an increased payload of four bombs, instead of the four bombs of Series 1. This was made possible by &quot;cropping&quot;, or shortening the tail of the bomb so that these four heavier weapons could be carried (or a 2,000 lb (920 kg) total load). The B Mk.IV entered service in May 1942 with 105 Squadron.

In April 1943 it was decided to convert a B Mk.IV to carry a Blockbuster bomb (nicknamed a Cookie). The conversion, including modified bomb bay suspension arrangements, bulged bomb bay doors and fairings, was relatively straightforward and 54 B.IVs were modified and distributed to squadrons of the Light Night Striking Force. 27 B Mk.IVs were later converted for special operations with the Highball anti-shipping weapon, and were used by 618 Squadron, formed in April 1943 specifically to use this weapon. A B Mk.IV, &quot;DK290&quot; was initially used as a trials aircraft for the bomb, followed by &quot;DZ471,530 and 533&quot;. The B Mk.IV had a maximum speed of , a cruising speed of , ceiling of , a range of , and a climb rate of 2,500 ft per minute (12.7 m/s).
Other bomber variants of the Mosquito included the Merlin 21 powered B Mk.V high-altitude version. Trials with this configuration were made with &quot;W4057&quot;, which had strengthened wings and two additional fuel tanks, or alternatively, two bombs. This design was not produced in Britain, but formed the basic design of the Canadian-built B.VII. Only &quot;W4057&quot; was built in prototype form. The Merlin 31 powered B Mk.VII was built by de Havilland Canada and first flown on 24 September 1942. It only saw service in Canada, 25 were built. Six were handed over to the United States Army Air Forces.

B Mk.IX (54 built) was powered by the Merlin 72,73, 76 or 77. The two-stage Merlin variant was based on the PR.IX. The prototype &quot;DK 324&quot; was converted from a PR.VIII and first flew on 24 March 1943. In October 1943 it was decided that all B Mk.IVs and all B Mk.IXs then in service would be converted to carry the &quot;Cookie&quot;, and all B Mk.IXs built after that date were designed to allow them to be converted to carry the weapon. The B Mk.IX had a maximum speed of , an economical cruise speed of at 20,000 ft, and at 30,000 ft, ceiling of , a range of , and a climb rate of 2,850 feet per minute (14.5 m/s). The IX could carry a maximum load of of bombs. A Mosquito B Mk.IX holds the record for the most combat operations flown by an Allied bomber in the Second World War. &quot;LR503&quot;, known as &quot;F for Freddie&quot; (from its squadron code letters, GB*F), first served with No. 109 and subsequently, No. 105 RAF squadrons. It flew 213 sorties during the war, only to crash at Calgary airport during the Eighth Victory Loan Bond Drive on 10 May 1945, two days after Victory in Europe Day, killing both the pilot, Flt. Lt. Maurice Briggs, DSO, DFC, DFM and navigator Fl. Off. John Baker, DFC and Bar.

The B Mk.XVI was powered by the same variations as the B.IX. All B Mk.XVIs were capable of being converted to carry the &quot;Cookie&quot;. The two-stage powerplants were added along with a pressurised cabin. &quot;DZ540&quot; first flew on 1 January 1944. The prototype was converted from a IV (402 built). The next variant, the B Mk.XX, was powered by Packard Merlins 31 and 33s. It was the Canadian version of the IV. Altogether, 245 were built. The B Mk.XVI had a maximum speed of , an economical cruise speed of at 20,000 ft, and at 30,000 ft, ceiling of , a range of , and a climb rate of 2,800 ft per minute (14 m/s). The type could carry of bombs.

The B.35 was powered by Merlin 113 and 114As. Some were converted to TT.35s (Target Tugs) and others were used as PR.35s (photo-reconnaissance). The B.35 had a maximum speed of , a cruising speed of , ceiling of , a range of , and a climb rate of 2,700 ft per minute (13.7 m/s). A total of 174 B.35s were delivered up to the end of 1945. A further 100 were delivered from 1946 for a grand total of 274, 65 of which were built by Airspeed Ltd.

===Fighters===

Developed during 1940, the first prototype of the Mosquito F Mk.II was completed on 15 May 1941. These Mosquitoes were fitted with four Hispano cannon in the fuselage belly and four .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns mounted in the nose. On production Mk.IIs the machine guns and ammunition tanks were accessed via two centrally hinged, sideways opening doors in the upper nose section. To arm and service the cannon the bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors: the F and NF Mk.IIs could not carry bombs. The type was also fitted with a gun camera in a compartment above the machine guns in the nose and was fitted with exhaust flame dampers to reduce the glare from the Merlin XXs.

In the summer of 1942, Britain experienced day-time incursions of the high-altitude reconnaissance bomber, the Junkers Ju 86P. Although the Ju 86P only carried a light bomb load, it overflew sensitive areas, including Bristol, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. Bombs were dropped on Luton and elsewhere, and this particular aircraft was seen from the main de Havilland offices and factory at Hatfield. An attempt to intercept it with a Spitfire from RAF Manston was unsuccessful. As a result of the potential threat, a decision was quickly taken to develop a high-altitude Mosquito interceptor, using the &quot;MP469&quot; prototype.

&quot;MP469&quot; entered the experimental shop on 7 September and made its initial flight on 14 September, piloted by John de Havilland. The bomber nose was altered using a normal fighter nose, armed with four standard .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns. The low pressure cabin retained a bomber canopy structure and a two-piece windscreen. The control wheel was replaced with a fighter control stick. The wingspan was increased to . The airframe was lightened by removing armour plating, some fuel tanks and other fitments. Smaller-diameter main wheels were fitted after the first few flights. At a loaded weight of this HA Mk.XV was lighter than a standard Mk.II. For this first conversion, the engines were a pair of Merlin 61s. On 15 September, John de Havilland reached an altitude of in this version. The aircraft was delivered to a High Altitude Flight which had been formed at RAF Northolt. However, the high-level German daylight intruders were no longer to be seen. It was subsequently revealed that only five Ju 86P aircraft had been built and they had only flown 12 sorties. Nevertheless, the general need for high altitude interceptors was recognised – but now the emphasis was to be upon night fighters.

The A&amp;AEE tested the climb and speed of night fighter conversion of MP469 in January 1943 for the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Wingspan had been increased to , the Brownings had been moved to a fairing below the fuselage. According to Birtles, an AI radar was mounted in the nose and the Merlins were upgraded to Mk76 type, although Boscombe Down reported Merlin 61s. In addition to MP469, four more B Mk.IVs were converted into NF MK XVs. The Fighter Interception Unit at RAF Ford carried out service trials, March 1943, and then these five aircraft went to 85 Squadron, Hunsdon, where they were flown from April until August of that year. The greatest height reached in service was .

Apart from the F Mk.XV, all Mosquito fighters and fighter bombers featured a modified canopy structure incorporating a flat, single piece armoured windscreen, and the crew entry/exit door was moved from the bottom of the forward fuselage to the right side of the nose, just forward of the wing leading edge.

===Night fighters===
At the end of 1940, the Air Staff&#x27;s preferred turret-equipped night fighter design to Operational Requirement O.R. 95 was the Gloster F.18/40 (derived from their F.9/37). However, although in agreement as to the quality of the Gloster company&#x27;s design, the Ministry of Aircraft Production was concerned that Gloster would not be able to work on the F.18/40 and also the jet fighter design, considered the greater priority. Consequently, in mid-1941 the Air Staff and MAP agreed that the Gloster aircraft would be dropped and the Mosquito, when fitted with a turret would be considered for the night fighter requirement.

The first production night fighter Mosquitoes – minus turrets – were designated NF Mk.II. A total of 466 were built with the first entering service with No. 157 Squadron in January 1942, replacing the Douglas Havoc. These aircraft were similar to the F Mk.II, but were fitted with the AI Mk.IV metric wavelength radar. The herring-bone transmitting antenna was mounted on the nose and the dipole receiving antennae were carried under the outer wings. A number of NF IIs had their radar equipment removed and additional fuel tanks installed in the bay behind the cannon for use as night intruders. These aircraft, designated NF II (Special) were first used by 23 Squadron in operations over Europe in 1942. 23 Squadron was then deployed to Malta on 20 December 1942, and operated against targets in Italy.

Ninety-seven NF Mk.IIs were upgraded with 3.3 GHz frequency, low-SHF-band AI Mk.VIII radar and these were designated NF Mk.XII. The NF Mk.XIII, of which 270 were built, was the production equivalent of the Mk.XII conversions. These &quot;centimetric&quot; radar sets were mounted in a solid &quot;thimble&quot; (Mk.XII / XIII) or universal &quot;bull nose&quot; (Mk.XVII / XIX) radome, which required the machine guns to be dispensed with.
Four F Mk.XVs were converted to the NF Mk.XV. These were fitted with AI Mk.VIII in a &quot;thimble&quot; radome, and the .303 Brownings were moved into a gun pack fitted under the forward fuselage.

 NF Mk.XVII was the designation for 99 NF Mk.II conversions, with single-stage Merlin 21, 22, or 23 engines, but British AI.X (US SCR-720) radar.

The NF Mk.XIX was an improved version of the NF XIII. It could be fitted with American or British AI radars; 220 were built.

The NF Mk.30 was the final wartime variant and was a high-altitude version, powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 76s. The NF Mk.30 had a maximum speed of at . It also carried early electronic countermeasures equipment. 526 were built.

Other Mosquito night fighter variants planned but never built included the NF Mk.X and NF Mk.XIV (the latter based on the NF Mk.XIII), both of which were to have two-stage Merlins. The NF Mk.31 was a variant of the NF Mk.30, but powered by Packard Merlins.

After the war, two more night fighter versions were developed:
The NF Mk.36 was similar to the Mosquito NF Mk.30, but fitted with the American-built AI.Mk.X radar. Powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 113/114 piston engines; 266 built. Max level speeds (TAS) with flame dampers fitted were at sea level, at , and at .

The NF Mk.38, 101 of which were built, was also similar to the Mosquito NF Mk.30, but fitted with the British-built AI Mk.IX radar. This variant suffered from stability problems and did not enter RAF service: 60 were eventually sold to Yugoslavia. According to the Pilot&#x27;s Notes and Air Ministry &#x27;Special Flying Instruction TF/487&#x27;, which posted limits on the Mosquito&#x27;s maximum speeds, the NF Mk.38 had a VNE of 370 knots (425 mph), without under-wing stores, and within the altitude range of sea level to . However, from 10,000 to the maximum speed was 348 knots (400 mph). As the height increased other recorded speeds were; 15,000 to 320 knots (368 mph); 20,000 to , 295 knots (339 mph); 25,000 to , 260 knots (299 mph); 30,000 to , 235 knots (270 mph). With two added 100-gallon fuel tanks this performance fell; between sea level and 15,000 feet 330 knots (379 mph); between 15,000 and 320 knots (368 mph); 20,000 to , 295 knots (339 mph); 25,000 to , 260 knots (299 mph); 30,000 to , 235 knots (270 mph). Little difference was noted above .

===Strike (&quot;fighter-bomber&quot;) variants ===

The FB Mk. VI, which first flew on 1 June 1942, was powered by two, single-stage two-speed, Merlin 21s or Merlin 25s, and introduced a re-stressed and reinforced &quot;basic&quot; wing structure capable of carrying single bombs on racks housed in streamlined fairings under each wing, or up to eight RP-3 25lb or 60 lb rockets. In addition fuel lines were added to the wings to enable single or drop tanks to be carried under each wing. The usual fixed armament was four 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannon and four .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns, while two bombs could be carried in the bomb bay.

Unlike the F Mk.II, the ventral bay doors were split into two pairs, with the forward pair being used to access the cannon, while the rear pair acted as bomb bay doors. The maximum fuel load was distributed between internal fuel tanks, plus two overload tanks, each of capacity, which could be fitted in the bomb bay, and two drop tanks. All-out level speed is often given as , although this speed applies to aircraft fitted with saxophone exhausts. The test aircraft (&quot;HJ679&quot;) fitted with stub exhausts was found to be performing below expectations. It was returned to de Havilland at Hatfield where it was serviced. Its top speed was then tested and found to be , in line with expectations. 2,298 FB Mk. VIs were built, nearly one-third of Mosquito production. Two were converted to TR.33 carrier-borne, maritime strike prototypes.

The FB Mk. VI proved capable of holding its own against fighter aircraft, in addition to strike/bombing roles. For example, on 15 January 1945 Mosquito FB Mk. VIs of 143 Squadron were engaged by 30 Focke-Wulf Fw 190s from &quot;Jagdgeschwader 5&quot;: the Mosquitoes sank an armed trawler and two merchant ships, but five Mosquitoes were lost (two reportedly to flak), while shooting down five Fw 190s.

Another fighter-bomber variant was the Mosquito FB Mk. XVIII (sometimes known as the &quot;Tsetse&quot;) of which one was converted from a FB Mk. VI to serve as prototype and 17 were purpose-built. The Mk.XVIII was armed with a Molins &quot;6-pounder Class M&quot; cannon: this was a modified QF 6-pounder (57 mm) anti-tank gun fitted with an auto-loader to allow both semi- or fully automatic fire. 25 rounds were carried, with the entire installation weighing . In addition, of armour was added within the engine cowlings, around the nose and under the cockpit floor to protect the engines and crew from heavily armed U-boats, the intended primary target of the Mk.XVIII. Two or four .303 (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns were retained in the nose and were used to &quot;sight&quot; the main weapon onto the target.

The Air Ministry initially suspected that this variant would not work, but tests proved otherwise. Although the gun provided the Mosquito with yet more anti-shipping firepower for use against U-boats, it required a steady approach run to aim and fire the gun, making its wooden construction an even greater liability, in the face of intense anti-aircraft fire. The gun had a muzzle velocity of and an excellent range of some . It was sensitive to sidewards movement; an attack required a dive from at a 30° angle with the turn and bank indicator on centre. A move during the dive could jam the gun. The prototype &quot;HJ732&quot; was converted from a FB.VI and was first flown on 8 June 1943.

The effect of the new weapon was demonstrated on 10 March 1944 when Mk.XVIIIs from 248 Squadron (escorted by four Mk.VIs) engaged a German convoy of one U-boat and four destroyers, protected by 10 Ju 88s. Three of the Ju 88s were shot down. Pilot Tony Phillips destroyed one Ju 88 with four shells, one of which tore an engine off the Ju 88. The U-boat was damaged. On 25 March, was sunk by Molins-equipped Mosquitoes. On 10 June, was abandoned in the face of intense air attack from No. 248 Squadron, and was later sunk by a Liberator of No. 206 Squadron. On 5 April 1945 Mosquitoes with Molins attacked five German surface ships in the Kattegat and again demonstrated their value by setting them all on fire and sinking them. A German &quot;Sperrbrecher&quot; (&quot;minefield breaker&quot;) was lost with all hands, with some 200 bodies being recovered by Swedish vessels. Some 900 German soldiers died in total. On 9 April, German U-boats , and were spotted in formation heading for Norway. All were sunk with rockets. and followed on 19 April and 2 May 1945, also sunk by rockets.
Despite the preference for rockets, a further development of the large gun idea was carried out using the even larger, 96 mm calibre QF 32-pounder, a gun based on the QF 3.7-inch AA gun designed for tank use, the airborne version using a novel form of muzzle brake. Developed to prove the feasibility of using such a large weapon in the Mosquito, this installation was not completed until after the war, when it was flown and fired in a single aircraft without problems, then scrapped.

Designs based on the Mk.VI were the FB Mk. 26, built in Canada, and the FB Mk.40, built in Australia, powered by Packard Merlins. The FB.26 improved from the FB.21 using single stage Packard Merlin 225s. Some 300 were built and another 37 converted to T.29 standard. 212 FB.40s were built by de Havilland Australia. Six were converted to PR.40; 28 to PR.41s, one to FB.42 and 22 to T.43 trainers. Most were powered by Packard-built Merlin 31 or 33s.

===Trainers===
The Mosquito was also built as the Mosquito T Mk.III two-seat trainer. This version, powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 21s, was unarmed and had a modified cockpit fitted with dual control arrangements. A total of 348 of the T Mk.III were built for the RAF and Fleet Air Arm. de Havilland Australia built 11 T Mk.43 trainers, similar to the Mk.III.

===Torpedo-bombers===
To meet specification N.15/44 for a navalised Mosquito for Royal Navy use as a torpedo bomber, de Havilland produced a carrier-borne variant. A Mosquito FB.VI was modified as a prototype designated Sea Mosquito TR Mk.33 with folding wings, arrester hook, thimble nose radome, Merlin 25 engines with four-bladed propellers and a new oleo-pneumatic landing gear rather than the standard rubber-in-compression gear. Initial carrier tests of the Sea Mosquito were carried out by Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown aboard HMS &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, the first landing-on taking place on 25 March 1944. An order for 100 TR.33s was placed although only 50 were built at Leavesden. Armament was four 20 mm cannon, two 500 lb bombs in the bomb bay (another two could be fitted under the wings), eight 60 lb rockets (four under each wing) and a standard torpedo under the fuselage. The first production TR.33 flew on 10 November 1945. This series was followed by six Sea Mosquito TR Mk.37s, which were built at Chester (Broughton) and differed in having ASV Mk.XIII radar instead of the TR.33&#x27;s AN/APS-6.

===Target tugs===

The RAF&#x27;s target tug version was the Mosquito TT Mk.35, which were the last aircraft to remain in operational service with No 3 CAACU at Exeter, being finally retired in 1963. These aircraft were then featured in the film 633 Squadron.
A number of B Mk.XVIs bombers were converted into TT Mk.39 target tug aircraft. The Royal Navy also operated the Mosquito TT Mk.39 for target towing.
Two ex-RAF FB.6s were converted to TT.6 standard at Manchester (Ringway) Airport by Fairey Aviation in 1953–1954, and delivered to the Belgian Air Force for use as towing aircraft from the Sylt firing ranges.

===Canadian-built===

A total of 1,032 (wartime 
+ 2 afterwards) Mosquitoes were built by De Havilland Canada at Downsview Airfield in Downsview Ontario (now Downsview Park in Toronto Ontario).
* Mosquito B Mk.VII : Canadian version based on the Mosquito B Mk.V bomber aircraft. Powered by two Packard Merlin 31 piston engines; 25 built.

* Mosquito T Mk.43 : Two-seat training version for the RAAF. A total of 11 FB Mk.40s were converted into Mosquito T Mk.43s.

===Highball===
A number of Mosquito IVs were modified by Vickers-Armstrongs to carry Highball &quot;bouncing bombs&quot; and were allocated Vickers Type numbers:
* Type 463 – Prototype Highball conversion of Mosquito IV &quot;DZ741&quot;.
* Type 465 – Conversion of 33 Mosquito IVs to carry Highball.

==Production==

About 5,000 of the total of 7,781 Mosquitoes built had major structural components fabricated from wood in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England. Fuselages, wings and tailplanes were made at furniture companies such as Ronson, E. Gomme, Parker Knoll, Parslow Furniture, Austinsuite and Styles &amp; Mealing. Wing spars were made by J. B. Heath and Dancer &amp; Hearne. Many of the other parts, including flaps, flap shrouds, fins, leading edge assemblies and bomb doors were also produced in the Buckinghamshire town. Dancer &amp; Hearne processed much of the wood from start to finish, receiving timber and transforming it into finished wing spars at their factory in Penn Street on the outskirts of High Wycombe.

Initially much of the specialised yellow birch wood veneer and finished plywood used for the prototypes and early production aircraft was shipped from firms in Wisconsin, US. Prominent in this role were Roddis Plywood and Veneer Manufacturing in Marshfield. In conjunction with the USDA Forest Products Laboratory, Hamilton Roddis had developed new plywood adhesives and hot pressing technology. Later on, paper birch was logged in large quantities from the interior of British Columbia along the Fraser and Quesnel Rivers and processed in Quesnel and New Westminster by the Pacific Veneer Company. According to the Quesnel archives, BC paper birch supplied ½ of the wartime British Empire birch used for Mosquitoes and other aircraft.

As the supply of Ecuadorean balsa was threatened by the U-boats in the Atlantic Ocean, the Ministry of Aircraft Production approved a research effort to supplant the balsa with calcium alginate foam, made from local brown algae. By 1944 the foam was ready, but the U-boat threat had been reduced, the larger B-25 bombers were in sufficient supply to handle most of the bombing raids, and the foam was not used in Mosquito production.

===Canada===

In July 1941, it was decided that DH Canada would build Mosquitoes at Downsview, Ontario. This was to continue even if Germany invaded Great Britain. Packard Merlin engines produced under licence were bench-tested by August and the first two aircraft were built in September. Production was to increase to fifty per month by early 1942. Initially, the Canadian production was for bomber variants; later, fighters, fighter-bombers and training aircraft were also made. DH Chief Production Engineer, Harry Povey, was sent first, then W. D. Hunter followed on an extended stay, to liaise with materials and parts suppliers. As was the case with initial UK production, Tego-bonded plywood and birch veneer was obtained from firms in Wisconsin, principally Roddis Plywood and Veneer Manufacturing, Marshfield. Enemy action delayed the shipping of jigs and moulds and it was decided to build these locally. During 1942, production improved to over 80 machines per month, as sub-contractors and suppliers became established. A mechanised production line based in part on car building methods started in 1944. As the war progressed, Canadian Mosquitoes may have utilized paper birch supplied by the Pacific Veneer Company of New Westminster using birch logs from the Cariboo, although records only say this birch was shipped to England for production there. When flight testing could no longer keep up, this was moved to the Central Aircraft Company airfield, London, Ontario, where the approved Mosquitoes left for commissioning and subsequent ferry transfer to Europe.

Ferrying Mosquitoes and many other types of WWII aircraft from Canada to Europe was dangerous, resulting in losses of lives and machines, but in the exigencies of war it was regarded as the best option for twin-engine and multi-engine aircraft. In the parlance of the day, among RAF personnel, &quot;it was no piece of cake.&quot; Considerable efforts were made by de Havilland Canada to resolve problems with engine and oil systems and an additional five hours of flight testing were introduced before the ferry flight, but the actual cause of some of the losses was unknown. Nevertheless, by the end of the war, nearly 500 Mosquito bombers and fighter-bombers had been ferried successfully by the Canadian operation.

After DH Canada had been established for the Mosquito, further manufacturing was set up at DH Australia, in Sydney. One of the DH staff who travelled there was the distinguished test pilot, Pat Fillingham. These production lines added totals of 1,133 aircraft of varying types from Canada plus 212 aircraft from Australia.

===Exports===
In total, both during the war and after, de Havilland exported 46 FB.VIs and 29 PR. XVIs to Australia; two FB.VI and 18 NF.30s to Belgium; approximately 250 FB.26, T.29 and T.27s from Canada to Nationalist China. A significant number never went into service due to deterioration on the voyage and to crashes during Chinese pilot training; however, five were captured by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army during the Chinese Civil War; 19 FB.VIs to Czechoslovakia in 1948; 6 FB.VIs to Dominica; a few B.IVs, 57 FB.VIs, 29 PR.XVIs and 23 NF.30s to France. Some T.IIIs were exported to Israel along with 60 FB.VIs, and at least five PR.XVIs and 14 naval versions. Four T.IIIs, 76 FB.VIs, one FB.40 and four T.43s were exported to New Zealand. Three T.IIIs were exported to Norway, and 18 FB.VIs, which were later converted to night fighter standard. South Africa received two F.II and 14 PR.XVI/XIs and Sweden received 60 NF.XIXs. Turkey received 96 FB.VIs and several T.IIIs, and Yugoslavia had 60 NF.38s, 80 FB.VIs and three T.IIIs delivered. At least a single de Havilland Mosquito was delivered to the Soviet Union marked &#x27;DK 296&#x27;.

===Sites===
Total Mosquito production was 7,781, of which 6,710 were built during the war.


==Civilian accidents and incidents==
A number of Mosquitoes were lost in civilian airline service, mostly with British Overseas Airways Corporation during the Second World War.
* On 17 August 1943, G-AGGF crashed near Glenshee, Perthshire.
* On 25 October 1943, G-AGGG crashed near RAF Leuchars.
* On 3 January 1944, G-AGGD stalled on landing at Såtenäs, Sweden, and was written off.
* On 19 August 1944, G-AGKP crashed into the North Sea off Leuchars, Fife. All three people on board were killed.
* On 29 August 1944, G-AGKR disappeared on a flight from Gothenburg, Sweden, to RAF Leuchars with the loss of both crew members.

On 21 July 1996, Mosquito G-ASKH, wearing the markings of RR299, crashed 1 mile west of Manchester Barton Airport. Pilot Kevin Moorhouse and engineer Steve Watson were both killed in the crash. At the time, this was the last airworthy Mosquito, a T.III.

== Surviving aircraft ==


There are approximately 30 non-flying Mosquitoes around the world with five airworthy examples: three in the United States; one in Canada; and one in New Zealand. The largest collection of Mosquitoes is at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum in the United Kingdom, which owns three aircraft, including the first prototype, &quot;W4050&quot;, the only initial prototype of a Second World War British aircraft design still in existence in the 21st century.

<text>Rex David Thomas (July 2, 1932 – January 8, 2002) was an American businessman, philanthropist, and fast-food tycoon who was the founder and chief executive officer of Wendy&#x27;s, a fast-food restaurant chain specializing in hamburgers. In this role, Thomas appeared in more than 800 commercial advertisements for the chain from 1989 to 2002, more than any other company founder in television history.

==Early life==
Rex David Thomas was born July 2, 1932, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. His biological father&#x27;s name was Sam and his biological mother&#x27;s name was Molly. Thomas was adopted between six weeks and six months later by Rex and Auleva Thomas, and as an adult became a well-known advocate for adoption, founding the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. After his adoptive mother&#x27;s death when he was five, his father moved around the country seeking work. Thomas spent some of his early childhood near Kalamazoo, Michigan, with his grandmother, Minnie Sinclair, whom he credited with teaching him the importance of service and treating others well and with respect, lessons that helped him in his future business life.

At age 12, Thomas had his first job at Regas Restaurant, a fine dining restaurant in downtown Knoxville, Tennessee, then lost it in a dispute with his boss. He vowed never to lose another job. Decades later, Regas Restaurant installed a large autographed poster of Thomas just inside their entrance, which remained until the business closed in 2010. By 15, he was moving with his father and working at the Hobby House Restaurant in Fort Wayne, Indiana. When his father prepared to move again, Thomas decided to stay in Fort Wayne, dropping out of high school to work full-time at the restaurant. Thomas, who considered ending his schooling the greatest mistake of his life, did not graduate from high school until 1993, when he obtained a GED.

He subsequently became an education advocate and founded the Dave Thomas Education Center in Coconut Creek, Florida, which offers GED classes to young adults.

==Career==
===U.S. Army===
At the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, rather than waiting for the draft, he volunteered for the U.S. Army at age 18 to have some choice in assignments. Having food production and service experience, Thomas requested the Cook&#x27;s and Baker&#x27;s School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was sent to West Germany as a mess sergeant and was responsible for the daily meals of 2,000 soldiers, rising to the rank of staff sergeant. After his discharge in 1953, Thomas returned to Fort Wayne and the Hobby House.

===Fast food career===
====Kentucky Fried Chicken====
In the mid-1950s, Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Col. Harland Sanders came to Fort Wayne, hoping to find restaurateurs with established businesses to whom he could try to sell KFC franchises. At first, Thomas – who was the head cook at a restaurant – and the Clauss family declined Sanders&#x27; offer, but Sanders persisted, and the Clauss family franchised their restaurant with KFC; they also later owned many other KFC franchises in the Midwest. During this time, Thomas worked with Sanders on many projects to make KFC more profitable and give it brand recognition. Among other ideas for improvements, Thomas suggested that KFC reduce the number of items on its menu and instead focus on a signature dish; he also proposed that KFC make commercials in which Sanders would personally appear. Thomas was sent by the Clauss family in the mid-1960s to help turn around four of their failing KFC stores in Columbus, Ohio.

By 1968, Thomas had increased sales in the four fried chicken restaurants so much that he sold his share in them back to Sanders for more than $1.5 million. This experience would prove invaluable to Thomas when he began Wendy&#x27;s about a year later.

====Arthur Treacher&#x27;s====
After serving as a regional director for Kentucky Fried Chicken, Thomas became part of the investor group which founded Arthur Treacher&#x27;s. His involvement with the new restaurant lasted less than a year before he went on to found Wendy&#x27;s.

====Wendy&#x27;s====
Thomas opened his first Wendy&#x27;s in Columbus, Ohio, November 15, 1969. This original restaurant remained operational until March 2, 2007, when it was closed due to lagging sales. Thomas named the restaurant after his eight-year-old daughter Melinda Lou, whose nickname was &quot;Wendy&quot;, stemming from the child&#x27;s inability to say her own name at a young age. According to &quot;Bio TV&quot;, Dave claims that people nicknamed his daughter &quot;Wenda. Not Wendy, but Wenda. &#x27;I&#x27;m going to call it Wendy&#x27;s Old Fashioned Hamburgers&#x27;.&quot; Before his death in 2002, Thomas admitted regret for naming the franchise after his daughter, saying &quot;I should&#x27;ve just named it after myself, because it put a lot of pressure on [her].&quot;

In 1982, Thomas resigned from his day-to-day operations at Wendy&#x27;s. However, by 1985, several company business decisions, including an awkward new breakfast menu and loss in brand awareness due to fizzled marketing efforts, led the company&#x27;s new president to urge Thomas back into a more active role with Wendy&#x27;s. Thomas began to visit franchises and espouse his hardworking, so-called &quot;mop-bucket attitude&quot;. In 1989, he took on a significant role as the TV spokesperson in a series of commercials for the brand. Thomas was not a natural actor, and initially, his performances were criticized as stiff and ineffective by advertising critics.

By 1990, after efforts by Wendy&#x27;s advertising agency, Backer Spielvolgel Bates, to get humor into the campaign, a decision was made to portray Thomas in a more self-deprecating and folksy manner, which proved much more popular with test audiences. Consumer brand awareness of Wendy&#x27;s eventually regained levels it had not achieved since octogenarian Clara Peller&#x27;s highly popular &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot; campaign of 1984.

With his natural self-effacing style and his relaxed manner, Thomas quickly became a household name. A company survey during the 1990s, a decade during which Thomas starred in every Wendy&#x27;s commercial that aired, found that 90% of Americans knew who Thomas was. After more than 800 commercials, it was clear that Thomas played a major role in Wendy&#x27;s&#x27; status as the third most popular burger restaurant in the U.S.

====The Wellington School====

In 1982, Thomas and a consortium of entrepreneurs created and launched The Wellington School in Upper Arlington, Ohio. The group of entrepreneurs spent three years refining plans, raising money, finding a property, and recruiting teachers and students.

The school opened with 137 students and 19 employees as the first co-ed independent school in the greater Columbus metropolitan area. The first graduating class was in 1989 with 32 students. In 2010, a new building opened. In 2012, the Little Jags preschool program for 3-year-olds began.

==Personal life==
Thomas was a Christian. He was married for 47 years to Lorraine Thomas and started his family with her in Upper Arlington, Ohio. In addition to Melinda, they had three more daughters – Pam, Lori, and Molly – and a son, Kenny. After Kenny died in 2013, his sisters still continued to own and run multiple Wendy&#x27;s locations. Thomas founded the chain Sisters Chicken and Biscuits in 1978, named in reference to his other three daughters.

===Death===
He had been afflicted with a carcinoid neuroendocrine tumor for a decade, before it metastasized to his liver. Thomas died at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on January 8, 2002, at the age of 69. He was buried in Union Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio. At the time of his death, there were more than 6,000 Wendy&#x27;s restaurants operating in North America.

==Honors and memberships==
In 1979, Thomas received the Horatio Alger Award for his success with his restaurant chain Wendy&#x27;s, which had reached annual sales of US$1 billion with franchises then.

In 1980, Thomas received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Thomas, realizing that his success as a high school dropout might convince other teenagers to quit school (something he later claimed was a mistake), became a student at Coconut Creek High School. He earned a GED in 1993. Thomas was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1999.

Thomas was an honorary Kentucky colonel, as was former boss Harland Sanders.

Thomas was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2003.

Thomas was raised a Master Mason in Sol. D. Bayless Lodge No. 359 of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and became a 32° Mason, N.M.J., on November 16, 1961, in the Scottish Rite Bodies of Fort Wayne. He was unanimously elected to the Scottish Rite&#x27;s highest honor, the Grand Cross, by The Supreme Council, 33°, in Executive Session on October 3, 1997, in Washington, D.C.

A small triangular block and the surrounding streets and traffic pattern in the Northeast quadrant of Washington, D.C., is unofficially known in the D.C. area as Dave Thomas Circle, due to the longtime presence of a Wendy&#x27;s franchise and its parking lot on that block.

<doc id="9101" wikidata="Q1033951" url="?curid=9101" title="Device driver">
<text>In the context of an operating system, a device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer or automaton. A driver provides a software interface to hardware devices, enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise details about the hardware being used.

A driver communicates with the device through the computer bus or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects. When a calling program invokes a routine in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device (drives it). Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program.

Drivers are hardware dependent and operating-system-specific. They usually provide the interrupt handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface.

==Purpose==
The main purpose of device drivers is to provide abstraction by acting as a translator between a hardware device and the applications or operating systems that use it. Programmers can write higher-level application code independently of whatever specific hardware the end-user is using.
For example, a high-level application for interacting with a serial port may simply have two functions for &quot;send data&quot; and &quot;receive data&quot;. At a lower level, a device driver implementing these functions would communicate to the particular serial port controller installed on a user&#x27;s computer. The commands needed to control a 16550 UART are much different from the commands needed to control an FTDI serial port converter, but each hardware-specific device driver abstracts these details into the same (or similar) software interface.

==Development==
Writing a device driver requires an in-depth understanding of how the hardware and the software works for a given platform function. Because drivers require low-level access to hardware functions in order to operate, drivers typically operate in a highly privileged environment and can cause system operational issues if something goes wrong. In contrast, most user-level software on modern operating systems can be stopped without greatly affecting the rest of the system. Even drivers executing in user mode can crash a system if the device is erroneously programmed. These factors make it more difficult and dangerous to diagnose problems.

The task of writing drivers thus usually falls to software engineers or computer engineers who work for hardware-development companies. This is because they have better information than most outsiders about the design of their hardware. Moreover, it was traditionally considered in the hardware manufacturer&#x27;s interest to guarantee that their clients can use their hardware in an optimal way. Typically, the Logical Device Driver (LDD) is written by the operating system vendor, while the Physical Device Driver (PDD) is implemented by the device vendor. However, in recent years, non-vendors have written numerous device drivers for proprietary devices, mainly for use with free and open source operating systems. In such cases, it is important that the hardware manufacturer provide information on how the device communicates. Although this information can instead be learned by reverse engineering, this is much more difficult with hardware than it is with software.

Microsoft has attempted to reduce system instability due to poorly written device drivers by creating a new framework for driver development, called Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF). This includes User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) that encourages development of certain types of drivers—primarily those that implement a message-based protocol for communicating with their devices—as user-mode drivers. If such drivers malfunction, they do not cause system instability. The Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) model continues to allow development of kernel-mode device drivers but attempts to provide standard implementations of functions that are known to cause problems, including cancellation of I/O operations, power management, and plug-and-play device support.

Apple has an open-source framework for developing drivers on macOS, called I/O Kit.

In Linux environments, programmers can build device drivers as parts of the kernel, separately as loadable modules, or as user-mode drivers (for certain types of devices where kernel interfaces exist, such as for USB devices). Makedev includes a list of the devices in Linux, including ttyS (terminal), lp (parallel port), hd (disk), loop, and sound (these include mixer, sequencer, dsp, and audio).

Microsoft Windows .sys files and Linux .ko files can contain loadable device drivers. The advantage of loadable device drivers is that they can be loaded only when necessary and then unloaded, thus saving kernel memory.

==Privilege levels==
Depending on the operating system, device drivers may be permitted to run at various different privilege levels. The choice of which level of privilege the drivers are in is largely decided by the type of kernel an operating system uses. An operating system that uses a monolithic kernel, such as the Linux kernel, will typically run device drivers with the same privilege as all other kernel objects. By contrast, a system designed around microkernel, such as Minix, will place drivers as processes independent from the kernel but that use it for essential input-output functionalities and to pass messages between user programs and each other.
On Windows NT, a system with a hybrid kernel, it is common for device drivers to run in either kernel-mode or user-mode.

The most common mechanism for segregating memory into various privilege levels is via protection rings. On many systems, such as those with x86 and ARM processors, switching between rings imposes a performance penalty, a factor that operating system developers and embedded software engineers consider when creating drivers for devices which are preferred to be run with low latency, such as network interface cards. The primary benefit of running a driver in user mode is improved stability since a poorly written user-mode device driver cannot crash the system by overwriting kernel memory.

==Applications==
Because of the diversity of hardware and operating systems, drivers operate in many different environments. Drivers may interface with:

* Printers
* Video adapters
* Network cards
* Sound cards
* PC chipsets
* Power and battery management
* Local buses of various sorts—in particular, for bus mastering on modern systems
* Low-bandwidth I/O buses of various sorts (for pointing devices such as mice, keyboards, etc.)
* Computer storage devices such as hard disk, CD-ROM, and floppy disk buses (ATA, SATA, SCSI, SAS)
* Implementing support for different file systems
* Image scanners
* Digital cameras
* Digital terrestrial television tuners
* Radio frequency communication transceiver adapters for wireless personal area networks as used for short-distance and low-rate wireless communication in home automation, (such as example Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Thread, Zigbee, and Z-Wave).
* IrDA adapters

Common levels of abstraction for device drivers include:
* For hardware:
** Interfacing directly
** Writing to or reading from a device control register
** Using some higher-level interface (e.g. Video BIOS)
** Using another lower-level device driver (e.g. file system drivers using disk drivers)
** Simulating work with hardware, while doing something entirely different
* For software:
** Allowing the operating system direct access to hardware resources
** Implementing only primitives
** Implementing an interface for non-driver software (e.g. TWAIN)
** Implementing a language, sometimes quite high-level (e.g. PostScript)

So choosing and installing the correct device drivers for given hardware is often a key component of computer system configuration.

==Virtual device drivers==
Virtual device drivers represent a particular variant of device drivers. They are used to emulate a hardware device, particularly in virtualization environments, for example when a DOS program is run on a Microsoft Windows computer or when a guest operating system is run on, for example, a Xen host. Instead of enabling the guest operating system to dialog with hardware, virtual device drivers take the opposite role and emulates a piece of hardware, so that the guest operating system and its drivers running inside a virtual machine can have the illusion of accessing real hardware. Attempts by the guest operating system to access the hardware are routed to the virtual device driver in the host operating system as e.g., function calls. The virtual device driver can also send simulated processor-level events like interrupts into the virtual machine.

Virtual devices may also operate in a non-virtualized environment. For example, a virtual network adapter is used with a virtual private network, while a virtual disk device is used with iSCSI. A good example for virtual device drivers can be Daemon Tools.

There are several variants of virtual device drivers, such as VxDs, VLMs, and VDDs.

* sf: soc+ or social Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (FCAL)
* soc: SPARC Storage Array (SSA) controllers and the control device
* social: Serial optical controllers for FCAL (soc+)

==APIs==
* Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) – the graphic display driver architecture for Windows Vista and later.
* Unified Audio Model (UAM)
* Windows Driver Foundation (WDF)
* Declarative Componentized Hardware (DCH) - Universal Windows Platform driver
* Windows Driver Model (WDM)
* Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) – a standard network card driver API
* Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) – the standard Linux sound-driver interface
* Scanner Access Now Easy (SANE) – a public-domain interface to raster-image scanner-hardware
* Installable File System (IFS) – a filesystem API for IBM OS/2 and Microsoft Windows NT
* Open Data-Link Interface (ODI) – network card API similar to NDIS
* Uniform Driver Interface (UDI) – a cross-platform driver interface project
* Dynax Driver Framework (dxd) – C++ open source cross-platform driver framework for KMDF and IOKit

==Identifiers==
A device on the PCI bus or USB is identified by two IDs which consist of two bytes each. The vendor ID identifies the vendor of the device. The device ID identifies a specific device from that manufacturer/vendor.

A PCI device has often an ID pair for the main chip of the device, and also a subsystem ID pair that identifies the vendor, which may be different from the chip manufacturer.

==Security==
Computers often have many diverse and customized device drivers running in their operating system (OS) kernel which often contain various bugs and vulnerabilities, making them a target for exploits. A &quot;Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver&quot; (BYOVD) attacker installs any signed, old third-party driver with known vulnerabilities that allow malicious code to be inserted into the kernel.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica/microsoft-blunder&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Drivers that may be vulnerable include those for WiFi and Bluetooth, gaming/graphics drivers, and drivers for printers.

There is a lack of effective kernel vulnerability detection tools, especially for closed-source OSes such as Microsoft Windows where the source code of the device drivers is mostly proprietary and not available to examine, and drivers often have many privileges.

A group of security researchers considers the lack of isolation as one of the main factors undermining kernel security, and published an isolation framework to protect operating system kernels, primarily the monolithic Linux kernel whose drivers they say get ~80,000 commits per year.

<text>Dimona (, ) is an Israeli city in the Negev desert, to the south-east of Beersheba and west of the Dead Sea above the Arava valley in the Southern District of Israel. In , its population was . The Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center, colloquially known as the Dimona Reactor, is located southeast of the city.

==Etymology==
The Negev Naming Committee chose the name based upon that of a biblical town, mentioned in Joshua 15:21-22, on the basis that &quot;the sound of this name had been preserved in the Arabic name Harabat Umm Dumna.&quot;

==History==
Dimona was one of the development towns created in the 1950s under the leadership of Israel&#x27;s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion. Dimona itself was conceived in 1953. The location chosen was close to the Dead Sea Works. It was established in 1955. The first residents were Jewish immigrants from North Africa, with an initial 36 families being the first to settle there. Its population in 1955 was about 300. The North African immigrants also constructed the city&#x27;s houses. The population was composed mainly of North African, particularly Moroccan immigrants, though immigrants from Yemen and Eastern Europe also arrived, as did Bene Israel immigrants from India.

When the Israeli nuclear program began in 1958, a location not far from the city was chosen for the Negev Nuclear Research Center due to its relative isolation in the desert and availability of housing. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, immigrants from Eastern Europe arrived. A textile factory was opened in 1958. That same year, Dimona became a local council. In 1961, it had a population of 5,000. The emblem of Dimona (as a local council), adopted 2 March 1961, appeared on a stamp issued on 24 March 1965. Dimona was declared a city in 1969. In 1971, it had a population of 23,700.

In spite of a gradual decrease during the 1980s, the city&#x27;s population began to grow once again in the 1990s when it took in immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia. Currently, Dimona is the third largest city in the Negev, with the population of almost 34,000. Due to projected rapid population growth in the Negev, the city is expected to triple in size by 2025.

==Demography==
Dimona is described as &quot;mini-India&quot; by many for its 7,500-strong Indian Jewish community. It is also home to Israel&#x27;s Black Hebrew community, formerly governed by its founder and spiritual leader, Ben Ammi Ben-Israel, now deceased. The Black Hebrews number about 3,000 in Dimona, with additional families in Arad, Mitzpe Ramon and the Tiberias area. Their official status in Israel was an ongoing issue for many years, but in May 1990, the issue was resolved with the issuing of first B/1 visas, and a year later, issuing of temporary residency. Status was extended to August 2003, when the Israeli Ministry of Interior granted permanent residency.

==Economy==
In the early 1980s, textile plants, such as Dimona Textiles Ltd., dominated the industrial landscape. Many plants have since closed. Dimona Silica Industries Ltd. manufactures precipitated silica and calcium carbonate fillers. About a third of the city&#x27;s population works in industrial workplaces (chemical plants near the Dead Sea like the Dead Sea Works, high-tech companies and textile shops), and another third in the area of services. Due to the introduction of new technologies, many workers have been made redundant in the recent years, creating a total unemployment rate of about 10%. Dimona has taken part of Israel&#x27;s solar transformation. The Rotem Industrial Complex outside of the city has dozens of solar mirrors that focus the sun&#x27;s rays on a tower that in turn heats a water boiler to create steam, turning a turbine to create electricity. Luz II, Ltd. plans to use the solar array to test new technology for the three new solar plants to be built in California for Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

==Geography and climate==
Dimona is located in the Negev Desert. The city stands at an elevation of around above sea level.

===Climate===
Dimona has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;). The average annual temperature is , and around of precipitation falls annually.
==Transportation==

In the early 1950s, an extension to Dimona and south was constructed from the Railway to Beersheba, designed for freight traffic. A passenger service began in 2005, after pressure from Dimona&#x27;s municipality. Dimona Railway Station is located in the southwestern part of the city. The main bus terminal is the Dimona Central Bus Station, with lines to Beersheba, Tel Aviv, Eilat, and nearby towns.

<text>DC Comics, Inc. (later simply known as DC) is an American comic book publisher, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. DC is an initialism for &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, an American comic book series first published in 1937.

DC Comics is one of the largest and oldest American comic book companies, the first comic under the DC banner being published in 1937. The majority of its publications are set in the fictional DC Universe and feature numerous culturally iconic heroic characters, such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Flash, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, and Cyborg; as well as famous fictional teams, including the Justice League, the Justice Society of America, the Teen Titans, and the Suicide Squad. The universe contains an assortment of well-known supervillains, such as the Joker, Lex Luthor, the Cheetah, Deathstroke, the Reverse-Flash, Black Manta, Brainiac, and Darkseid. The company has published non-DC Universe-related material, including &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, &quot;Fables&quot;, and many other titles, under the alternative imprint Vertigo and DC Black Label.

Originally at 432 Fourth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, the company offices have been located at 480 and later 575 Lexington Avenue, 909 Third Avenue, 75 Rockefeller Plaza, 666 Fifth Avenue, and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC Comics was located at 1700 Broadway in Midtown Manhattan until April 2015, when DC Entertainment transferred its headquarters to Burbank, California.

DC Comics books are distributed to the bookstore market by Penguin Random House Publisher Services. The comics shop direct market was supplied by Diamond Comic Distributors until June 2020, when Lunar Distribution and UCS Comic Distributors (who were by then dominating direct market distribution on account of the disruption to Diamond caused by the COVID-19 pandemic) replaced Diamond as the direct market distributor.

In 2017, approximately 70% of the American comic book market was shared by DC Comics and its long-time major competitor Marvel Comics (acquired in 2009 by Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s main competitor, The Walt Disney Company), though this figure may be distorted by the fact that sales of graphic novels are excluded. When all book sales are included, DC is the second largest publisher of comic books, after Viz Media; and Marvel is third.

== History ==

=== National Allied Publications ===
==== Golden Age ====

In 1935, entrepreneur Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson founded National Allied Publications, intended as an American comic book publishing company. Its debut publication was the tabloid-sized &quot;New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine&quot; #1 (the first of a comic series later called &quot;More Fun Comics&quot;) with a February 1935 cover date. An anthology title, essentially for original stories not reprinted from newspaper strips, it was unlike many comic book series before it. While DC Comics is now primarily associated with superhero comics, the genres in the first anthology titles consisted of funnies, Western comics, and adventure-related stories. The character Doctor Occult—created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in December 1935 and included in issue No.6 of &quot;New Fun Comics&quot;—is considered to be the earliest recurring superhero created by DC that is still being used. The company created a second recurring title called &quot;New Comics&quot;, first released in December 1935, which was the start of the long-running &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; series that also featured many anthology titles. By 1936, the group had become Nicholson Publishing.

Wheeler-Nicholson&#x27;s next and final title, &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, was advertised with a cover illustration dated December 1936 but eventually premiered three months late with a March 1937 cover date. The themed anthology that revolved originally around fictional detective stories became in modern times the longest-running ongoing comic series. A notable debut in the first issue was Slam Bradley, created in a collaboration between Wheeler-Nicholson, Siegel and Shuster. In 1937, in debt to printing-plant owner and magazine distributor Harry Donenfeld—who also published pulp magazines and operated as a principal in the magazine distributorship Independent News—Wheeler-Nicholson had to enter into partnership with Donenfeld to publish &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No.1, and Detective Comics, Inc. (which helped inspire the abbreviation DC) was formed, with Wheeler-Nicholson and Donenfeld&#x27;s accountant Jack S. Liebowitz listed as owners. As the company continued to experience cash-flow problems, Wheeler-Nicholson was forced out after the first year. Shortly afterwards, Detective Comics, Inc. purchased the remains of National Allied (also known as Nicholson Publishing) at a bankruptcy auction and absorbed it.

Meanwhile, Max Gaines formed the sister company All-American Publications in 1939. Detective Comics, Inc. soon launched a new anthology title called &quot;Action Comics&quot;; the first issue, cover dated June 1938, featured new characters such as Superman by Siegel and Shuster, Zatara by Fred Guardineer, and Tex Thompson by Ken Finch and Bernard Baily. Considered as the first comic book to feature the character archetype later known as the &quot;superhero&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot; was a sales hit that brought to life a new age of comic books, now affectionately termed the &quot;Golden Age&quot;. &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 is credited as featuring the first appearance of Superman, both on the cover illustration and inside the issue, and is now one of the most valuable and sought-after comic book issues of all time. The first Superman tale included a superhero origin story with the reveal of an unnamed planet, later known as Krypton, where he is said to have originated. The issue also contained the first essential supporting character and one of the earliest female characters in any comic, with Lois Lane as Superman&#x27;s first depicted romantic interest. The Green Hornet-inspired character known as the Crimson Avenger by Jim Chamber was featured in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No.20 (October 1938). This character is known to be the first masked vigilante published by DC. An unnamed &quot;office boy&quot;, retconned as Jimmy Olsen&#x27;s first appearance, was revealed in a Superman story by Siegel and Shuster in &quot;Action Comics&quot; No.6 (November 1938).

Starting in 1939, Siegel and Shuster&#x27;s Superman was the first comic-derived character to appear in other formats, later featuring in his own newspaper comic strip, which first introduced his biological parents Jor-El and Lara. All-American Publications&#x27; debut comic series, &quot;All-American Comics&quot;, was first published in April 1939. The series &quot;Detective Comics&quot; made history as being the first to feature Batman—a Bob Kane and Bill Finger creation—in issue No.27 (March 1939) with the request of more superhero titles. Batman was depicted as a masked vigilante who wore a caped suit known as the Batsuit and drove a car that was later referred to as the Batmobile. The Batman story also included a supporting character called James Gordon, the police commissioner of what would later become Gotham City Police Department. Despite being a parody, All-American Publications introduced the earliest female character who became the female superhero Red Tornado (though disguised as a male) in Ma Hunkel who first appeared in the &quot;Scribbly&quot; stories in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; No.3 (June 1939). Another important Batman debut was the introduction of the fictional mansion known as Wayne Manor first seen in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No.28 (June 1939). The series &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; followed in the footsteps of &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; by featuring a new recurring superhero called Sandman who first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; No.40 (July 1939). &quot;Action Comics&quot; No.13 (June 1939) introduced the first recurring Superman enemy referred to as the Ultra-Humanite; created by Siegel and Shuster, this is commonly cited as one of the earliest supervillains in comic books. The Superman character had another breakthrough when he was given his own comic book series, which was previously unheard of. The first issue, published in June 1939, helped directly introduce Superman&#x27;s adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, also created by Siegel and Shuster. &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No.29 (July 1939) included the first mention of Batman&#x27;s utility belt by Gardner Fox. Outside of DC&#x27;s publishing, a character later integrated as DC was introduced by Fox Feature Syndicate named the Blue Beetle released in August 1939. Fictional cities were a common theme of DC; the first revealed city was Superman&#x27;s home city of Metropolis, originally named in &quot;Action Comics&quot; No.16 (September 1939). &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No.31 (September 1939) by Gardner Fox, Bob Kane and Sheldon Moldoff introduced a romantic interest for Batman named Julie Madison, as well as the Batarang weapon that Batman commonly uses, and the fictional aircraft called the Batplane. The story of Batman&#x27;s origin was first shown in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; No.33 (November 1939), which depicted the death of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne by a mugger. The origin story remained crucial for the fictional character after its inception.
The &quot;Daily Planet&quot; (a common setting of Superman) was first named in a Superman newspaper strip around November 1939. Doll Man was the first superhero to be produced by Quality Comics, which DC now owns. Fawcett Comics was formed around 1939 and became DC&#x27;s original competitor company over the next decade. At the end of 1944, All-American titles began using its own logo to distinguish it from the National comics.

All-American Publications, an affiliate concern co-owned by Gaines and Liebowitz, merged with Detective Comics, Inc. on September 30, 1946, forming National Comics Publications. The previous year, in June 1945, Gaines had allowed Liebowitz to buy him out and had retained only &quot;Picture Stories from the Bible&quot; as the foundation of his own new company, EC Comics. At that point, &quot;Liebowitz promptly orchestrated the merger of All-American and Detective Comics into National Comics... Next he took charge of organizing National Comics, [the self-distributorship] Independent News, and their affiliated firms into a single corporate entity, National Periodical Publications&quot;. National Periodical Publications became publicly traded on the stock market in 1961. Despite the official names &quot;National Comics&quot; and &quot;National Periodical Publications&quot;, the company began branding itself as &quot;Superman-DC&quot; as early as 1940 and became known colloquially as DC Comics for years before the official adoption of that name in 1977.

DC Comics began to move aggressively against what it saw as copyright-violating imitations from other companies, such as Fox Comics&#x27; Wonder Man, which (according to court testimony) Fox started as a copy of Superman. This extended to DC suing Fawcett Comics over Captain Marvel, who was at the time the top-selling comic character (see &quot;National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.&quot;). Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost the lawsuit, Fawcett capitulated in 1953 and ceased publishing comics. Years later, Fawcett sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC Comics, and in 1972 the character was revived in DC&#x27;s new title &quot;Shazam!&quot;, which featured artwork by Captain Marvel&#x27;s creator C. C. Beck. In the meantime, the abandoned &#x27;Marvel&#x27; trademark had been seized by Marvel Comics in 1967, with the creation of their Captain Marvel, preventing DC from using the name in the title of their own comic series. While DC&#x27;s Captain Marvel failed to recapture his earlier popularity, he later appeared in a Saturday morning live action TV adaptation and gained a prominent position in the mainstream continuity of the DC Universe.

As the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s, DC Comics focused on such genres as science fiction, Westerns, humor, and romance. The company also published crime and horror titles, although relatively tame contributions that avoided the mid-1950s backlash against such comic genres. A handful of the most popular superhero titles continued publication, including &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, the medium&#x27;s two longest-running titles.

==== Silver Age ====
In the mid-1950s, editorial director Irwin Donenfeld and publisher Liebowitz directed editor Julius Schwartz (whose roots lay in the science-fiction book market) to produce a one-shot Flash story in the try-out title &quot;Showcase&quot;. Instead of reviving the old character, Schwartz had writers Robert Kanigher and John Broome, penciler Carmine Infantino, and inker Joe Kubert create an entirely new super-speedster, updating and modernizing the Flash&#x27;s civilian identity, costume, and origin with a science-fiction bent. The Flash&#x27;s reimagining in &quot;Showcase&quot; No.4 (October 1956) proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the Green Lantern character, the introduction of the modern all-star team Justice League of America (JLA), and many more superheroes, heralding what historians and fans call the Silver Age of Comic Books.

National radically overhauled its continuing characters—primarily Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman—rather than just reimagining them. The Superman family of titles, under editor Mort Weisinger, introduced such enduring characters as Supergirl, Bizarro, and Brainiac. The Batman titles, under editor Jack Schiff, introduced the successful Batwoman, Bat-Girl, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite in an attempt to modernize the strip with non-science-fiction elements. Schwartz and Infantino then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the &quot;New Look&quot;, with relatively down-to-earth stories re-emphasizing Batman as a detective. Meanwhile, editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythical realm.

Since the 1940s, when Superman, Batman, and many of the company&#x27;s other heroes began appearing in stories together, DC&#x27;s characters have inhabited a shared continuity that was later dubbed the &quot;DC Universe&quot; by fans. With the story &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot;, in &quot;Flash&quot; No.123 (September 1961), editor Schwartz (with writer Gardner Fox and artists Infantino and Joe Giella) presented a conceptual mechanism for slotting the 1930s and 1940s Golden Age heroes into this continuity using the explanation that they inhabited an other-dimensional &quot;Earth 2&quot;, whilst the modern heroes exist on &quot;Earth 1&quot;, consequently laying the foundations of what was later called the DC Multiverse.

=== National Periodical Publications ===
DC&#x27;s introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by their competitors. In 1961, with DC&#x27;s JLA as the specific inducement, Marvel Comics&#x27; writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby ushered in the sub-Silver Age &quot;Marvel Age&quot; of comics with the debut issue of &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;. Reportedly, DC dismissed the initial success of Marvel&#x27;s editorial change until its consistently strengthening sales—albeit also benefiting DC&#x27;s parent company Independent News, as Marvel&#x27;s distributor—made it impossible to ignore. This commercial situation was highlighted by Marvel&#x27;s superior sell-through percentage numbers which were typically 70% to DC&#x27;s roughly 50%, meaning that DC&#x27;s publications were barely making a profit after returns from the distributors were factored in, while Marvel was making a healthy profit by comparison. Also in 1961, both DC and Marvel increased their cover price from ten cents to twelve cents, while the rival publisher Dell Comics was charging fifteen cents.

At this time, the senior DC staff were reportedly unable to explain how this small publishing house was achieving its increasingly threatening commercial strength. For instance, when Marvel&#x27;s product was examined in a meeting, the emphasis on more sophisticated character-based narrative and artist-driven visual storytelling was apparently overlooked. Instead, superficial reasons were put forward to account for the brand&#x27;s popularity, like the presence of the color red or word balloons on the cover, or that the perceived crudeness of the interior art was somehow more appealing to readers. When Lee learned about DC&#x27;s subsequent experimental attempts to imitate these perceived details, he amused himself by arranging direct defiance of those assumptions in Marvel&#x27;s publications as sales strengthened further to frustrate the competition.

However, this ignorance of Marvel&#x27;s true appeal did not extend to some of the writing talent during this period, and attempts were made to emulate Marvel&#x27;s narrative approach. For instance, there was the &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; series by Arnold Drake (who had previously warned DC&#x27;s management about Marvel&#x27;s strength), a superhero team of outsiders who resented their freakish powers, which Drake later speculated was plagiarized by Stan Lee to create &quot;The X-Men&quot;. There was also the young Jim Shooter who purposely emulated Marvel&#x27;s writing when he wrote for DC after studying both companies&#x27; styles, such as for the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; feature. In 1966, National Periodical Publications established its own television arm, led by Allen Ducovny, to develop and produce TV projects, with Superman TV Corporation handling the distribution of NPP&#x27;s shows.

A 1966 Batman TV show on the ABC network sparked a temporary spike in comic book sales and a brief fad for superheroes in Saturday morning animation (Filmation produced most of DC&#x27;s initial cartoons) and other media. DC significantly lightened the tone of many of its comics—particularly &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;—to better complement the &quot;camp&quot; tone of the TV series. This change in tone coincided with the prominent &quot;Go-Go Checks&quot; cover-dress that featured a black-and-white checkered strip at the top of each DC comic (all cover dates between February 1966 and August 1967), a misguided attempt by then-managing editor Irwin Donenfeld to make DC&#x27;s output &quot;stand out on the newsracks&quot;. In particular, DC artist Carmine Infantino complained that the distinctive cover made it easier for readers to spot DC&#x27;s titles and avoid them in favor of Marvel&#x27;s titles.

In 1967, Infantino (who had designed popular Silver Age characters Batgirl and the Phantom Stranger) rose from art director to become DC&#x27;s editorial director. With the growing popularity of upstart rival Marvel Comics threatening to topple DC from its longtime number-one position in the comics industry, he tried to direct DC&#x27;s focus towards marketing new and existing titles and characters with more adult sensibilities, aimed at an emerging older age group of superhero comic book fans; this was in response to Marvel&#x27;s efforts to market their superhero line to college-aged adults. Infantino also recruited major talents such as ex-Marvel artist and Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko, and promising newcomers Neal Adams and Denny O&#x27;Neil, and he replaced some existing DC editors with artist-editors, including Joe Kubert and Dick Giordano, to give DC&#x27;s output a more artistic critical eye.

=== Kinney National / Warner Communications (1967–1990) ===
In 1967, National Periodical Publications was purchased by Kinney National Company, which purchased Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in 1969. Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as National Kinney Corporation) and changed its name to Warner Communications Inc.

In 1970, Jack Kirby moved from Marvel Comics to DC, at the end of the Silver Age of Comics, in which Kirby&#x27;s contributions to Marvel played a large, integral role.

As artist Gil Kane described:

Jack was the single most influential figure in the turnaround in Marvel&#x27;s fortunes from the time he rejoined the company ... It wasn&#x27;t merely that Jack conceived most of the characters that are being done, but ... Jack&#x27;s point of view and philosophy of drawing became the governing philosophy of the entire publishing company and, beyond the publishing company, of the entire field ... [Marvel took] Jack and use[d] him as a primer. They would get artists ... and they taught them the ABCs, which amounted to learning Jack Kirby ... Jack was like the Holy Scripture and they simply had to follow him without deviation. That&#x27;s what was told to me ... It was how they taught everyone to reconcile all those opposing attitudes to one single master point of view.

Given &quot;carte blanche&quot; to write and illustrate his own stories, he created a handful of thematically-linked series he called collectively &quot;The Fourth World&quot;. In the existing series &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; and in his own, newly-launched series &quot;New Gods&quot;, &quot;Mister Miracle&quot;, and &quot;The Forever People&quot;, Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as arch-villain Darkseid and the other-dimensional realm Apokolips. Furthermore, Kirby intended their stories to be reprinted in collected editions, in a publishing format that was later called the trade paperback, which became a standard industry practice decades later. While sales were respectable, they did not meet DC management&#x27;s initially high expectations, and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino. By 1973 the &quot;Fourth World&quot; was all cancelled, although Kirby&#x27;s conceptions soon became integral to the broadening of the DC Universe, especially after the major toy-company, Kenner Products, judged them ideal for their action-figure adaptation of the DC Universe, the Super Powers Collection. Obligated by his contract, Kirby created other unrelated series for DC, including &quot;Kamandi&quot;, &quot;The Demon&quot;, and &quot;OMAC&quot;, before ultimately returning to Marvel Comics in 1976.

==== Bronze Age ====
Following the science-fiction innovations of the Silver Age, the comics of the 1970s and 1980s became known as the Bronze Age, as fantasy gave way to more naturalistic and sometimes darker themes. Illegal drug use, banned by the Comics Code Authority, explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics&#x27; story &quot;Green Goblin Reborn!&quot; in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; No.96 (May 1971), and after the Code&#x27;s updating in response, DC offered a drug-fueled storyline in writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist Neal Adams&#x27; &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, beginning with the story &quot;Snowbirds Don&#x27;t Fly&quot; in the retitled &quot;Green Lantern / Green Arrow&quot; No.85 (September 1971), which depicted Speedy, the teen sidekick of superhero archer Green Arrow, as having become a heroin addict.

Jenette Kahn, a former children&#x27;s magazine publisher, replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976. As it happened, her first task even before being formally hired, was to convince Bill Sarnoff, the head of Warner Publishing, to keep DC as a publishing concern, as opposed to simply managing their licensing of their properties. With that established, DC had attempted to compete with the now-surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it. This included launching series featuring such new characters as &quot;Firestorm&quot; and &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot;, as well as an increasing array of non-superhero titles, in an attempt to recapture the pre-Wertham days of post-War comicdom.

=== DC Comics ===
In 1977, the company officially changed its name to DC Comics. It had used the brand &quot;Superman-DC&quot; since the 1950s, and was colloquially known as DC Comics for years.

In June 1978, five months before the release of the first Superman film, Kahn expanded the line further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents. Most series received eight-page back-up features while some had full-length twenty-five-page stories. This was a move the company called the &quot;DC Explosion&quot;. The move was not successful, however, and corporate parent Warner dramatically cut back on these largely unsuccessful titles, firing many staffers in what industry watchers dubbed &quot;the DC Implosion&quot;. In September 1978, the line was dramatically reduced and standard-size books returned to 17-page stories but for a still increased 40 cents. By 1980, the books returned to 50 cents with a 25-page story count but the story pages replaced house ads in the books.

Seeking new ways to boost market share, the new team of publisher Kahn, vice president Paul Levitz, and managing editor Giordano addressed the issue of talent instability. To that end—and following the example of Atlas/Seaboard Comics and such independent companies as Eclipse Comics—DC began to offer royalties in place of the industry-standard work-for-hire agreement in which creators worked for a flat fee and signed away all rights, giving talent a financial incentive tied to the success of their work. As it happened, the implementation of these incentives proved opportune considering Marvel Comics&#x27; Editor-in-Chief, Jim Shooter, was alienating much of his company&#x27;s creative staff with his authoritarian manner and major talents there went to DC like Roy Thomas, Gene Colan, Marv Wolfman, and George Pérez.

In addition, emulating the era&#x27;s new television form, the miniseries while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start, DC created the industry concept of the comic book limited series. This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable open-ended commitments. The first such title was &quot;World of Krypton&quot; in 1979, and its positive results led to subsequent similar titles and later more ambitious productions like &quot;Camelot 3000&quot; for the direct market in 1982.

These changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;, by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez, two popular talents with a history of success. Their superhero-team comic, superficially similar to Marvel&#x27;s ensemble series &quot;X-Men&quot;, but rooted in DC history, earned significant sales in part due to the stability of the creative team, who both continued with the title for six full years. In addition, Wolfman and Pérez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a spin-off title, &quot;Tales of the New Teen Titans&quot;, to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title.

==== Modern Age ====
This successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans led DC&#x27;s editors to seek the same for the wider DC Universe. The result, the Wolfman/Pérez 12-issue limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the characters&#x27; complicated backstory and continuity discrepancies. A companion publication, two volumes entitled &quot;The History of the DC Universe&quot;, set out the revised history of the major DC characters. &quot;Crisis&quot; featured many key deaths that shaped the DC Universe for the following decades, and it separated the timeline of DC publications into pre- and post-&quot;Crisis&quot;.

Meanwhile, a parallel update had started in the non-superhero and horror titles. Since early 1984, the work of British writer Alan Moore had revitalized the horror series &quot;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot;, and soon numerous British writers, including Neil Gaiman and Grant Morrison, began freelancing for the company. The resulting influx of sophisticated horror-fantasy material led to DC in 1993 establishing the Vertigo mature-readers imprint, which did not subscribe to the Comics Code Authority.

Two DC limited series, &quot;&quot; by Frank Miller and &quot;Watchmen&quot; by Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, drew attention in the mainstream press for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero. These titles helped pave the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary-criticism circles and to make inroads into the book industry, with collected editions of these series as commercially successful trade paperbacks.

The mid-1980s also saw the end of many long-running DC war comics, including series that had been in print since the 1960s. These titles, all with over 100 issues, included &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot;, &quot;G.I. Combat&quot;, &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, and &quot;Weird War Tales&quot;.

=== Time Warner / Time Warner Entertainment / AOL Time Warner (1990–2018) ===

In March 1989, Warner Communications merged with Time Inc., making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner. In June, the first Tim Burton-directed Batman film was released, and DC began publishing its hardcover series of DC Archive Editions; these were collections of many of their early, key comics series, featuring rare and expensive stories previously unseen by the majority of modern fans. Much of the restoration work was handled by Rick Keene, with colour restoration performed by DC&#x27;s long-time resident colourist Bob LeRose. The Archive Editions attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked for DC without receiving much recognition during the early age of comic books when individual credits were rare.

The comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s, thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing—mass purchase of the books as collectible items, with the intention to resell at a higher value (as the rising value of older issues was thought to imply that &quot;all&quot; comics would rise dramatically in price)—and several storylines gaining attention from the mainstream media. DC&#x27;s extended storylines in which Superman was killed, , and Green Lantern turned into the supervillain Parallax, resulted in dramatically increased sales. However, the increases were temporary, and sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump, while manufactured &quot;collectables&quot; numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves.

DC&#x27;s Piranha Press and other imprints (including the mature readers&#x27; line Vertigo, and Helix, a short-lived science fiction imprint) were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines. They increased the use of non-traditional contractual arrangements, including the dramatic rise of creator-owned projects, leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work (much of it for Vertigo) and the licensing of material from other companies. DC also increased publication of book-store friendly formats, including trade paperback collections of individual serial comics, as well as original graphic novels.

One of the other imprints was Impact Comics from 1991 to 1992 in which the Archie Comics superheroes were licensed and revamped. The stories in the line were part of its own shared universe.

DC entered into a publishing agreement with Milestone Media that gave DC a line of comics featuring a culturally and racially diverse range of superhero characters. Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few years, it yielded the popular animated series &quot;Static Shock&quot;. DC established Paradox Press to publish material such as the large-format &quot;Big Book of...&quot; series of multi-artist interpretations on individual themes, and such crime fiction as the graphic novel &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;. In 1998, DC purchased WildStorm Comics, Jim Lee&#x27;s imprint under the Image Comics banner, continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint (and fictional universe) with its own unique style and audience. As part of this purchase, DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub-imprint America&#x27;s Best Comics (ABC), a series of titles created by Alan Moore which included &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Tom Strong&quot;, and &quot;Promethea&quot;. Moore strongly opposed this move, and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC.

In March 2003, DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long-running fantasy series &quot;Elfquest&quot;, previously self-published by creators Wendy and Richard Pini under their WaRP Graphics publication banner. This series then followed another non-DC title, Tower Comics&#x27; series T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, in collection into DC Archive Editions. In 2004, DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers 2000 AD and Humanoids. It also rebranded its younger-audience titles with the mascot Johnny DC and established the CMX imprint to reprint translated manga. In 2006, CMX took over from Dark Horse Comics&#x27; publication of the webcomic &quot;Megatokyo&quot; in print form. DC also took advantage of the demise of Kitchen Sink Press and acquired the rights to much of the work of Will Eisner, such as his &quot;The Spirit&quot; series and his graphic novels.

In 2004, DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity-reshuffling sequel to &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, promising substantial changes to the DC Universe (and side-stepping the 1994 &quot;Zero Hour&quot; event which similarly tried to ret-con the history of the DCU). In 2005, the critically lauded &quot;Batman Begins&quot; film was released; also, the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalating conflicts among DC&#x27;s heroes, with events climaxing in the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; limited series. Immediately after this event, DC&#x27;s ongoing series jumped forward a full year in their in-story continuity, as DC launched a weekly series, &quot;52&quot;, to gradually fill in the missing time. Concurrently, DC lost the copyright to &quot;Superboy&quot; (while retaining the trademark) when the heirs of Jerry Siegel used a provision of the 1976 revision to the copyright law to regain ownership.

In 2005, DC launched its &quot;All-Star&quot; line (evoking the title of the 1940s publication), designed to feature some of the company&#x27;s best-known characters in stories that eschewed the long and convoluted continuity of the DC Universe. The line began with &quot;All-Star Batman &amp; Robin the Boy Wonder&quot; and &quot;All-Star Superman&quot;, and &quot;All-Star Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;All-Star Batgirl&quot; was announced in 2006, but neither of these stories had been released or scheduled as of the end of 2009.

By 2007, DC was licensing characters from the Archie Comics imprint Red Circle Comics. They appeared in the Red Circle line, based in the DC Universe, with a series of one-shots followed by a miniseries that led into two ongoing titles that each lasted for ten issues.

=== DC Entertainment ===
In 2011, DC rebooted all of its running titles following the Flashpoint storyline. The reboot called The New 52 gave new origin stories and costume designs to many of DC&#x27;s characters.

DC licensed pulp characters including Doc Savage and the Spirit which it then used, along with some DC heroes, as part of the First Wave comics line launched in 2010 and lasting through fall 2011.

In May 2011, DC announced it would begin releasing digital versions of their comics on the same day as paper versions.

On June 1, 2011, DC announced that it would end all ongoing series set in the DC Universe in August and relaunch its comic line with 52 issue #1s, starting with &quot;Justice League&quot; on August 31 (written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jim Lee), with the rest to follow later on in September.

On June 4, 2013, DC unveiled two new digital comic innovations to enhance interactivity: &quot;DC2&quot; and &quot;DC2 Multiverse&quot;. &quot;DC2&quot; layers dynamic artwork onto digital comic panels, adding a new level of dimension to digital storytelling, while &quot;DC2 Multiverse&quot; allows readers to determine a specific story outcome by selecting individual characters, storylines and plot developments while reading the comic, meaning one digital comic has multiple outcomes. &quot;DC2&quot; appeared in the digital-first title, &quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot;, based on the 1960s television series and &quot;DC2 Multiverse&quot; appeared in &quot;&quot;, a digital-first title based on the .

In 2014, DC announced an eight-issue miniseries titled &quot;Convergence&quot; which began in April 2015.

In 2016, DC announced a line-wide relaunch titled DC Rebirth. The new line would launch with an 80-page one-shot titled DC Universe: Rebirth, written by Geoff Johns, with art from Gary Frank, Ethan Van Sciver, and more. After that, many new series would launch with a twice-monthly release schedule and new creative teams for nearly every title. The relaunch was meant to bring back the legacy and heart many felt had been missing from DC characters since the launch of the New 52. Rebirth brought huge success, both financially and critically.

=== WarnerMedia / Warner Bros. Discovery unit (2018–present) ===
On February 21, 2020, the Co-Publisher of DC Comics, Dan DiDio stepped down after 10 years at that position. The company did not give a reason for the move, nor did it indicate whether it was his decision or the company&#x27;s. The leadership change was the latest event in the company restructuring which began the previous month, as several top executives were laid off from the company. However, Bleeding Cool reported that he was fired.

In June 2020, Warner Bros. announced a separate DC-themed online-only convention. Known as DC FanDome, the free &quot;immersive virtual fan experience&quot; was a 24-hour-long event held on August 22, 2020. The main presentation, entitled &quot;DC FanDome: Hall of Heroes&quot;, was held as scheduled on August 22. The remaining programming was provided through a one-day video on demand experience, &quot;DC FanDome: Explore the Multiverse&quot;, on September 12.

As Warner Bros. and DC&#x27;s response to San Diego Comic-Con&#x27;s cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the convention featured information about DC-based content including the DC Extended Universe film franchise, the Arrowverse television franchise, comic books, and video games. The convention also returned for the virtual premiere of &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; and returned once again on October 16, 2021.

In August 2020, roughly one-third of DC&#x27;s editorial ranks were laid off, including the editor-in-chief, senior story editor, executive editor, and several senior VPs.

In March 2021, DC relaunched their entire line once again under the banner of Infinite Frontier. After the events of the Dark Nights: Death Metal storyline, the DC Multiverse was expanded into a larger &quot;Omniverse&quot; where everything is canon, effectively reversing the changes The New 52 introduced a decade prior.

Furthermore, AT&amp;T spun off WarnerMedia to Discovery, forming Warner Bros. Discovery. This merger was completed on April 8, 2022.

In January 2023, DC relaunched their line under the banner of Dawn of DC following the conclusion of Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths and Lazarus Planet. Later that year, Jim Lee was promoted to President of DC in May.

== Logo ==
* The November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This was almost twice the size of the previous version and the first with a white background. The name &quot;Superman&quot; was added to &quot;A DC Publication&quot;, effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, which is where the logo has generally resided ever since. The company began to refer to itself in its advertising as &quot;Superman-DC&quot;.
* When Jenette Kahn became DC&#x27;s publisher in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer Milton Glaser to design a new company logo. Popularly referred to as the &quot;DC bullet&quot;, this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and colour, was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, and was briefly rotated by 4degrees, the logo remained essentially unchanged for almost three decades. Despite the various logo changes since 2005, the old &quot;DC bullet&quot; continues to be used only on the DC Archive Editions series.
* On May 8, 2005, a new logo (dubbed the &quot;DC spin&quot;) was unveiled, debuting on DC titles in June 2005 with &quot;DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy&quot; No.1 and the rest of the titles the following week. As well as being used for comics, the new logo was designed for DC properties in other media, including films since &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (with &quot;Superman Returns&quot; showing the logo&#x27;s normal variant), the TV series &quot;Smallville&quot;, the animated series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; and others, as well as for collectibles and other merchandise. The &quot;DC Spin&quot; logo was designed by Josh Beatman of Brainchild Studios and DC executive Richard Bruning.
* In March 2012, DC unveiled a new logo designed by Landor Associates, which consists of a letter &quot;D&quot; peeling back to reveal the letter &quot;C&quot;. The logo was intended to signify the concept of superheroes having &quot;dual&quot; identities and was adaptable across different mediums.
* In May 2016, in conjunction with the DC Rebirth, DC replaced the &quot;peel&quot; logo with a circular logo reminiscent of the 1972 logo.
* In July 2024, an updated version of Glaser&#x27;s 1977 &quot;Bullet&quot; logo was unveiled during San Diego Comic-Con, as well as an accompanying intro sequence featuring Superman for DC Studios.

<text>In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is an equation, typically a polynomial equation in two or more unknowns with integer coefficients, for which only integer solutions are of interest. A linear Diophantine equation equates the sum of two or more unknowns, with coefficients, to a constant. An exponential Diophantine equation is one in which unknowns can appear in exponents.

Diophantine problems have fewer equations than unknowns and involve finding integers that solve simultaneously all equations. Because such systems of equations define algebraic curves, algebraic surfaces, or, more generally, algebraic sets, their study is a part of algebraic geometry that is called &quot;Diophantine geometry&quot;.

The word &quot;Diophantine&quot; refers to the Hellenistic mathematician of the 3rd century, Diophantus of Alexandria, who made a study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce symbolism into algebra. The mathematical study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now called Diophantine analysis.

While individual equations present a kind of puzzle and have been considered throughout history, the formulation of general theories of Diophantine equations, beyond the case of linear and quadratic equations, was an achievement of the twentieth century.

==Examples==
In the following Diophantine equations, , and are the unknowns and the other letters are given constants:
==Linear Diophantine equations==

===One equation===
The simplest linear Diophantine equation takes the form 
formula_1 
where , and are given integers. The solutions are described by the following theorem:
:&quot;This Diophantine equation has a solution&quot; (where and are integers) &quot;if and only if&quot; &quot;is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of&quot; &quot;and&quot; . &quot;Moreover, if&quot; &quot;is a solution, then the other solutions have the form&quot; , &quot;where&quot; &quot;is an arbitrary integer, and&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;are the quotients of&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;(respectively) by the greatest common divisor of&quot; &quot;and&quot; .

Proof: If is this greatest common divisor, Bézout&#x27;s identity asserts the existence of integers and such that . If is a multiple of , then for some integer , and is a solution. On the other hand, for every pair of integers and , the greatest common divisor of and divides . Thus, if the equation has a solution, then must be a multiple of . If and , then for every solution , we have 
formula_2 
showing that is another solution. Finally, given two solutions such that 
formula_3 
one deduces that formula_4 
As and are coprime, Euclid&#x27;s lemma shows that divides , and thus that there exists an integer such that both 
formula_5 
Therefore, 
formula_6
which completes the proof.

===Chinese remainder theorem===

The Chinese remainder theorem describes an important class of linear Diophantine systems of equations: let formula_7 be pairwise coprime integers greater than one, formula_8 be arbitrary integers, and be the product formula_9 The Chinese remainder theorem asserts that the following linear Diophantine system has exactly one solution formula_10 such that , and that the other solutions are obtained by adding to a multiple of :
formula_11

=== System of linear Diophantine equations===
More generally, every system of linear Diophantine equations may be solved by computing the Smith normal form of its matrix, in a way that is similar to the use of the reduced row echelon form to solve a system of linear equations over a field. Using matrix notation every system of linear Diophantine equations may be written
formula_12
where is an matrix of integers, is an column matrix of unknowns and is an column matrix of integers.

The computation of the Smith normal form of provides two unimodular matrices (that is matrices that are invertible over the integers and have ±1 as determinant) and of respective dimensions and , such that the matrix
formula_13
is such that is not zero for not greater than some integer , and all the other entries are zero. The system to be solved may thus be rewritten as
formula_14
Calling the entries of and those of , this leads to the system
formula_15

This system is equivalent to the given one in the following sense: A column matrix of integers is a solution of the given system if and only if for some column matrix of integers such that .

It follows that the system has a solution if and only if divides for and for . If this condition is fulfilled, the solutions of the given system are
formula_16
where are arbitrary integers.

Hermite normal form may also be used for solving systems of linear Diophantine equations. However, Hermite normal form does not directly provide the solutions; to get the solutions from the Hermite normal form, one has to successively solve several linear equations. Nevertheless, Richard Zippel wrote that the Smith normal form &quot;is somewhat more than is actually needed to solve linear diophantine equations. Instead of reducing the equation to diagonal form, we only need to make it triangular, which is called the Hermite normal form. The Hermite normal form is substantially easier to compute than the Smith normal form.&quot;

Integer linear programming amounts to finding some integer solutions (optimal in some sense) of linear systems that include also inequations. Thus systems of linear Diophantine equations are basic in this context, and textbooks on integer programming usually have a treatment of systems of linear Diophantine equations.

==Homogeneous equations==
A homogeneous Diophantine equation is a Diophantine equation that is defined by a homogeneous polynomial. A typical such equation is the equation of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem
:formula_17

As a homogeneous polynomial in indeterminates defines a hypersurface in the projective space of dimension , solving a homogeneous Diophantine equation is the same as finding the rational points of a projective hypersurface.

Solving a homogeneous Diophantine equation is generally a very difficult problem, even in the simplest non-trivial case of three indeterminates (in the case of two indeterminates the problem is equivalent with testing if a rational number is the th power of another rational number). A witness of the difficulty of the problem is Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem (for , there is no integer solution of the above equation), which needed more than three centuries of mathematicians&#x27; efforts before being solved.

For degrees higher than three, most known results are theorems asserting that there are no solutions (for example Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem) or that the number of solutions is finite (for example Falting&#x27;s theorem). 

For the degree three, there are general solving methods, which work on almost all equations that are encountered in practice, but no algorithm is known that works for every cubic equation.

===Degree two===
Homogeneous Diophantine equations of degree two are easier to solve. The standard solving method proceeds in two steps. One has first to find one solution, or to prove that there is no solution. When a solution has been found, all solutions are then deduced.

For proving that there is no solution, one may reduce the equation modulo. For example, the Diophantine equation
:formula_18
does not have any other solution than the trivial solution . In fact, by dividing , and by their greatest common divisor, one may suppose that they are coprime. The squares modulo 4 are congruent to 0 and 1. Thus the left-hand side of the equation is congruent to 0, 1, or 2, and the right-hand side is congruent to 0 or 3. Thus the equality may be obtained only if , and are all even, and are thus not coprime. Thus the only solution is the trivial solution . This shows that there is no rational point on a circle of radius formula_19, centered at the origin.

More generally, the Hasse principle allows deciding whether a homogeneous Diophantine equation of degree two has an integer solution, and computing a solution if there exist. 

If a non-trivial integer solution is known, one may produce all other solutions in the following way.

====Geometric interpretation====
Let 
:formula_20
be a homogeneous Diophantine equation, where formula_21 is a quadratic form (that is, a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2), with integer coefficients. The &quot;trivial solution&quot; is the solution where all formula_22 are zero. If formula_23 is a non-trivial integer solution of this equation, then formula_24 are the homogeneous coordinates of a rational point of the hypersurface defined by . Conversely, if formula_25 are homogeneous coordinates of a rational point of this hypersurface, where formula_26 are integers, then formula_27 is an integer solution of the Diophantine equation. Moreover, the integer solutions that define a given rational point are all sequences of the form 
:formula_28
where is any integer, and is the greatest common divisor of the formula_29

It follows that solving the Diophantine equation formula_20 is completely reduced to finding the rational points of the corresponding projective hypersurface.

====Parameterization====

Let now formula_31 be an integer solution of the equation formula_32 As is a polynomial of degree two, a line passing through crosses the hypersurface at a single other point, which is rational if and only if the line is rational (that is, if the line is defined by rational parameters). This allows parameterizing the hypersurface by the lines passing through , and the rational points are those that are obtained from rational lines, that is, those that correspond to rational values of the parameters.

More precisely, one may proceed as follows. 

By permuting the indices, one may suppose, without loss of generality that formula_33 Then one may pass to the affine case by considering the affine hypersurface defined by 
:formula_34
which has the rational point
:formula_35

If this rational point is a singular point, that is if all partial derivatives are zero at , all lines passing through are contained in the hypersurface, and one has a cone. The change of variables 
:formula_36
does not change the rational points, and transforms into a homogeneous polynomial in variables. In this case, the problem may thus be solved by applying the method to an equation with fewer variables.

If the polynomial is a product of linear polynomials (possibly with non-rational coefficients), then it defines two hyperplanes. The intersection of these hyperplanes is a rational flat, and contains rational singular points. This case is thus a special instance of the preceding case.

In the general case, consider the parametric equation of a line passing through :
:formula_37
Substituting this in , one gets a polynomial of degree two in , that is zero for . It is thus divisible by . The quotient is linear in , and may be solved for expressing as a quotient of two polynomials of degree at most two in formula_38 with integer coefficients:
:formula_39
Substituting this in the expressions for formula_40 one gets, for ,
:formula_41
where formula_42 are polynomials of degree at most two with integer coefficients.

Then, one can return to the homogeneous case. Let, for , 
:formula_43
be the homogenization of formula_44 These quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients form a parameterization of the projective hypersurface defined by :
:formula_45

A point of the projective hypersurface defined by is rational if and only if it may be obtained from rational values of formula_46 As formula_47 are homogeneous polynomials, the point is not changed if all are multiplied by the same rational number. Thus, one may suppose that formula_48 are coprime integers. It follows that the integer solutions of the Diophantine equation are exactly the sequences formula_49 where, for ,
:formula_50
where is an integer, formula_48 are coprime integers, and is the greatest common divisor of the integers formula_52

One could hope that the coprimality of the , could imply that . Unfortunately this is not the case, as shown in the next section.

====Example of Pythagorean triples====
The equation 
:formula_53
is probably the first homogeneous Diophantine equation of degree two that has been studied. Its solutions are the Pythagorean triples. This is also the homogeneous equation of the unit circle. In this section, we show how the above method allows retrieving Euclid&#x27;s formula for generating Pythagorean triples.

For retrieving exactly Euclid&#x27;s formula, we start from the solution , corresponding to the point of the unit circle. A line passing through this point may be parameterized by its slope:
:formula_54
Putting this in the circle equation 
:formula_55
one gets 
:formula_56
Dividing by , results in
:formula_57
which is easy to solve in :
:formula_58
It follows
:formula_59
Homogenizing as described above one gets all solutions as 
:formula_60
where is any integer, and are coprime integers, and is the greatest common divisor of the three numerators. In fact, if and are both odd, and if one is odd and the other is even.

The &quot;primitive triples&quot; are the solutions where and .

This description of the solutions differs slightly from Euclid&#x27;s formula because Euclid&#x27;s formula considers only the solutions such that , and are all positive, and does not distinguish between two triples that differ by the exchange of and ,

==Diophantine analysis==

=== Typical questions ===

The questions asked in Diophantine analysis include:

#Are there any solutions?
#Are there any solutions beyond some that are easily found by inspection?
#Are there finitely or infinitely many solutions?
#Can all solutions be found in theory?
#Can one in practice compute a full list of solutions?

These traditional problems often lay unsolved for centuries, and mathematicians gradually came to understand their depth (in some cases), rather than treat them as puzzles.

=== Typical problem ===
The given information is that a father&#x27;s age is 1 less than twice that of his son, and that the digits making up the father&#x27;s age are reversed in the son&#x27;s age (i.e. ). This leads to the equation , thus . Inspection gives the result , , and thus equals 73 years and equals 37 years. One may easily show that there is not any other solution with and positive integers less than 10.

Many well known puzzles in the field of recreational mathematics lead to diophantine equations. Examples include the cannonball problem, Archimedes&#x27;s cattle problem and the monkey and the coconuts.

===17th and 18th centuries===
In 1637, Pierre de Fermat scribbled on the margin of his copy of &quot;Arithmetica&quot;: &quot;It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any power higher than the second into two like powers.&quot; Stated in more modern language, &quot;The equation has no solutions for any higher than 2.&quot; Following this, he wrote: &quot;I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this proposition, which this margin is too narrow to contain.&quot; Such a proof eluded mathematicians for centuries, however, and as such his statement became famous as Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. It was not until 1995 that it was proven by the British mathematician Andrew Wiles.

In 1657, Fermat attempted to solve the Diophantine equation (solved by Brahmagupta over 1000 years earlier). The equation was eventually solved by Euler in the early 18th century, who also solved a number of other Diophantine equations. The smallest solution of this equation in positive integers is , (see Chakravala method).

===Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem===

In 1900, David Hilbert proposed the solvability of all Diophantine equations as the tenth of his fundamental problems. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich solved it negatively, building on work of Julia Robinson, Martin Davis, and Hilary Putnam to prove that a general algorithm for solving all Diophantine equations cannot exist.

===Diophantine geometry===
Diophantine geometry, is the application of techniques from algebraic geometry which considers equations that also have a geometric meaning. The central idea of Diophantine geometry is that of a rational point, namely a solution to a polynomial equation or a system of polynomial equations, which is a vector in a prescribed field , when is &quot;not&quot; algebraically closed.

===Modern research===
The oldest general method for solving a Diophantine equationor for proving that there is no solution is the method of infinite descent, which was introduced by Pierre de Fermat. Another general method is the Hasse principle that uses modular arithmetic modulo all prime numbers for finding the solutions. Despite many improvements these methods cannot solve most Diophantine equations.

The difficulty of solving Diophantine equations is illustrated by Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem, which was set in 1900 by David Hilbert; it was to find an algorithm to determine whether a given polynomial Diophantine equation with integer coefficients has an integer solution. Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem implies that such an algorithm cannot exist.

During the 20th century, a new approach has been deeply explored, consisting of using algebraic geometry. In fact, a Diophantine equation can be viewed as the equation of an hypersurface, and the solutions of the equation are the points of the hypersurface that have integer coordinates.

This approach led eventually to the proof by Andrew Wiles in 1994 of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, stated without proof around 1637. This is another illustration of the difficulty of solving Diophantine equations.

===Infinite Diophantine equations===
An example of an infinite Diophantine equation is:
formula_61
which can be expressed as &quot;How many ways can a given integer be written as the sum of a square plus twice a square plus thrice a square and so on?&quot; The number of ways this can be done for each forms an integer sequence. Infinite Diophantine equations are related to theta functions and infinite dimensional lattices. This equation always has a solution for any positive . Compare this to:
formula_62
which does not always have a solution for positive .

==Exponential Diophantine equations==
If a Diophantine equation has as an additional variable or variables occurring as exponents, it is an exponential Diophantine equation. Examples include:

* the Ramanujan–Nagell equation, 
* the equation of the Fermat–Catalan conjecture and Beal&#x27;s conjecture, with inequality restrictions on the exponents
* the Erdős–Moser equation, 

A general theory for such equations is not available; particular cases such as Catalan&#x27;s conjecture and Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem have been tackled. However, the majority are solved via ad-hoc methods such as Størmer&#x27;s theorem or even trial and error.

<doc id="9110" wikidata="Q178217" url="?curid=9110" title="Diophantus">
<text>Diophantus of Alexandria (; born ; died ) was a Greek mathematician, who was the author of two main works: &quot;On Polygonal Numbers&quot;, which survives incomplete, and the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; in thirteen books, most of it extant, made up of arithmetical problems that are solved through algebraic equations. He has been referred to as &quot;the father of algebra&quot;. 

Although not the earliest, the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; has the best-known use of algebraic notation to solve arithmetical problems coming from Greek antiquity. It was translated into Arabic in the 9th century AD and had influence in the development of later algebra: Diophantus&#x27; method of solution matches medieval Arabic algebra in its concepts and overall procedure, and some problems from the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; have inspired modern work in both abstract algebra and number theory.

Diophantus was among the first to recognized positive rational numbers as numbers, by allowing fractions for coefficients and solutions. He coined the term παρισότης (&quot;parisotēs&quot;) to refer to an approximate equality. This term was rendered as &quot;adaequalitas&quot; in Latin, and became the technique of adequality developed by Pierre de Fermat to find maxima for functions and tangent lines to curves. 

In modern use, Diophantine equations are algebraic equations with integer coefficients for which integer solutions are sought. Diophantine geometry and Diophantine approximations are two other subareas of number theory that are named after him.

==Biography==

Diophantus was born into a Greek family and is known to have lived in Alexandria, Egypt, during the Roman era, between AD 200 and 214 to 284 or 298. Much of our knowledge of the life of Diophantus is derived from a 5th-century Greek anthology of number games and puzzles created by Metrodorus. One of the problems (sometimes called his epitaph) states:Here lies Diophantus, the wonder behold. Through art algebraic, the stone tells how old: &#x27;God gave him his boyhood one-sixth of his life, One twelfth more as youth while whiskers grew rife; And then yet one-seventh ere marriage begun; In five years there came a bouncing new son. Alas, the dear child of master and sage After attaining half the measure of his father&#x27;s life chill fate took him. After consoling his fate by the science of numbers for four years, he ended his life.&#x27;This puzzle implies that Diophantus&#x27; age can be expressed as

which gives a value of 84 years. However, the accuracy of the information cannot be confirmed.

In popular culture, this puzzle was the Puzzle No.142 in &quot;Professor Layton and Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; as one of the hardest solving puzzles in the game, which needed to be unlocked by solving other puzzles first.

==&quot;Arithmetica&quot; ==
&quot;Arithmetica&quot; is the major work of Diophantus and the most prominent work on premodern algebra in Greek mathematics. It is a collection of problems giving numerical solutions of both determinate and indeterminate equations. Of the original thirteen books of which &quot;Arithmetica&quot; consisted only six have survived, though there are some who believe that four Arabic books discovered in 1968 are also by Diophantus. Some Diophantine problems from &quot;Arithmetica&quot; have been found in Arabic sources.

It should be mentioned here that Diophantus never used general methods in his solutions. Hermann Hankel, renowned German mathematician made the following remark regarding Diophantus:Our author (Diophantos) not the slightest trace of a general, comprehensive method is discernible; each problem calls for some special method which refuses to work even for the most closely related problems. For this reason it is difficult for the modern scholar to solve the 101st problem even after having studied 100 of Diophantos&#x27;s solutions.

===History===
Like many other Greek mathematical treatises, Diophantus was forgotten in Western Europe during the Dark Ages, since the study of ancient Greek, and literacy in general, had greatly declined. The portion of the Greek &quot;Arithmetica&quot; that survived, however, was, like all ancient Greek texts transmitted to the early modern world, copied by, and thus known to, medieval Byzantine scholars. Scholia on Diophantus by the Byzantine Greek scholar John Chortasmenos (1370–1437) are preserved together with a comprehensive commentary written by the earlier Greek scholar Maximos Planudes (1260 – 1305), who produced an edition of Diophantus within the library of the Chora Monastery in Byzantine Constantinople. In addition, some portion of the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; probably survived in the Arab tradition (see above). In 1463 German mathematician Regiomontanus wrote:No one has yet translated from the Greek into Latin the thirteen books of Diophantus, in which the very flower of the whole of arithmetic lies hidden.&quot;Arithmetica&quot; was first translated from Greek into Latin by Bombelli in 1570, but the translation was never published. However, Bombelli borrowed many of the problems for his own book &quot;Algebra&quot;. The &quot;editio princeps&quot; of &quot;Arithmetica&quot; was published in 1575 by Xylander. The Latin translation of &quot;Arithmetica&quot; by Bachet in 1621 became the first Latin edition that was widely available. Pierre de Fermat owned a copy, studied it and made notes in the margins. A later 1895 Latin translation by Paul Tannery was said to be an improvement by Thomas L. Heath, who used it in the 1910 second edition of his English translation.

===Margin-writing by Fermat and Chortasmenos===
The 1621 edition of &quot;Arithmetica&quot; by Bachet gained fame after Pierre de Fermat wrote his famous &quot;Last Theorem&quot; in the margins of his copy: If an integer is greater than 2, then has no solutions in non-zero integers , , and . I have a truly marvelous proof of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.Fermat&#x27;s proof was never found, and the problem of finding a proof for the theorem went unsolved for centuries. A proof was finally found in 1994 by Andrew Wiles after working on it for seven years. It is believed that Fermat did not actually have the proof he claimed to have. Although the original copy in which Fermat wrote this is lost today, Fermat&#x27;s son edited the next edition of Diophantus, published in 1670. Even though the text is otherwise inferior to the 1621 edition, Fermat&#x27;s annotations—including the &quot;Last Theorem&quot;—were printed in this version.

Fermat was not the first mathematician so moved to write in his own marginal notes to Diophantus; the Byzantine scholar John Chortasmenos (1370–1437) had written &quot;Thy soul, Diophantus, be with Satan because of the difficulty of your other theorems and particularly of the present theorem&quot; next to the same problem.

==Other works==

Diophantus wrote several other books besides &quot;Arithmetica&quot;, but only a few of them have survived.

===The &quot;Porisms&quot;===
Diophantus himself refers to a work which consists of a collection of lemmas called &quot;The Porisms&quot; (or &quot;Porismata&quot;), but this book is entirely lost.

Although &quot;The Porisms&quot; is lost, we know three lemmas contained there, since Diophantus refers to them in the &quot;Arithmetica&quot;. One lemma states that the difference of the cubes of two rational numbers is equal to the sum of the cubes of two other rational numbers, i.e. given any and , with , there exist , all positive and rational, such that

===Polygonal numbers and geometric elements===
Diophantus is also known to have written on polygonal numbers, a topic of great interest to Pythagoras and Pythagoreans. Fragments of a book dealing with polygonal numbers are extant.

A book called &quot;Preliminaries to the Geometric Elements&quot; has been traditionally attributed to Hero of Alexandria. It has been studied recently by Wilbur Knorr, who suggested that the attribution to Hero is incorrect, and that the true author is Diophantus.

==Influence==

Diophantus&#x27; work has had a large influence in history. Editions of &quot;Arithmetica&quot; exerted a profound influence on the development of algebra in Europe in the late sixteenth and through the 17th and 18th centuries. Diophantus and his works also influenced Arab mathematics and were of great fame among Arab mathematicians. Diophantus&#x27; work created a foundation for work on algebra and in fact much of advanced mathematics is based on algebra. How much he affected India is a matter of debate.

Diophantus has been considered &quot;the father of algebra&quot; because of his contributions to number theory, mathematical notations and the earliest known use of syncopated notation in his book series &quot;Arithmetica&quot;. However this is usually debated, because Al-Khwarizmi was also given the title as &quot;the father of algebra&quot;, nevertheless both mathematicians were responsible for paving the way for algebra today.

==Diophantine analysis==
Today, Diophantine analysis is the area of study where integer (whole-number) solutions are sought for equations, and Diophantine equations are polynomial equations with integer coefficients to which only integer solutions are sought. It is usually rather difficult to tell whether a given Diophantine equation is solvable. Most of the problems in &quot;Arithmetica&quot; lead to quadratic equations. Diophantus looked at 3 different types of quadratic equations: , , and . The reason why there were three cases to Diophantus, while today we have only one case, is that he did not have any notion for zero and he avoided negative coefficients by considering the given numbers , , to all be positive in each of the three cases above. Diophantus was always satisfied with a rational solution and did not require a whole number which means he accepted fractions as solutions to his problems. Diophantus considered negative or irrational square root solutions &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;meaningless&quot;, and even &quot;absurd&quot;. To give one specific example, he calls the equation &#x27;absurd&#x27; because it would lead to a negative value for . One solution was all he looked for in a quadratic equation. There is no evidence that suggests Diophantus even realized that there could be two solutions to a quadratic equation. He also considered simultaneous quadratic equations.

==Mathematical notation==
Diophantus made important advances in mathematical notation, becoming the first person known to use algebraic notation and symbolism. Before him everyone wrote out equations completely. Diophantus introduced an algebraic symbolism that used an abridged notation for frequently occurring operations, and an abbreviation for the unknown and for the powers of the unknown. Mathematical historian Kurt Vogel states:The symbolism that Diophantus introduced for the first time, and undoubtedly devised himself, provided a short and readily comprehensible means of expressing an equation... Since an abbreviation is also employed for the word &#x27;equals&#x27;, Diophantus took a fundamental step from verbal algebra towards symbolic algebra.Although Diophantus made important advances in symbolism, he still lacked the necessary notation to express more general methods. This caused his work to be more concerned with particular problems rather than general situations. Some of the limitations of Diophantus&#x27; notation are that he only had notation for one unknown and, when problems involved more than a single unknown, Diophantus was reduced to expressing &quot;first unknown&quot;, &quot;second unknown&quot;, etc. in words. He also lacked a symbol for a general number . Where we would write , Diophantus has to resort to constructions like: &quot;... a sixfold number increased by twelve, which is divided by the difference by which the square of the number exceeds three&quot;. Algebra still had a long way to go before very general problems could be written down and solved succinctly.

<doc id="9118" wikidata="Q123688" url="?curid=9118" title="Duke Kahanamoku">
<text>Duke Paoa Kahinu Mokoe Hulikohola Kahanamoku (August 24, 1890 – January 22, 1968) was a Hawaiian competition swimmer, lifeguard, and popularizer of the sport of surfing. A Native Hawaiian, he was born three years before the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. He lived to see the territory&#x27;s admission as a state and became a United States citizen. He was a five-time Olympic medalist in swimming, winning medals in 1912, 1920 and 1924.

Kahanamoku joined fraternal organizations: he was a Scottish Rite Freemason in the Honolulu lodge, and a Shriner. He worked as a law enforcement officer, an actor, a beach volleyball player, and a businessman.

==Family background==
According to Kahanamoku, he was born in Honolulu at Haleʻākala, the home of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, which was later converted into the Arlington Hotel.

He was born into a family of Native Hawaiians headed by Duke Halapu Kahanamoku and Julia Paʻakonia Lonokahikina Paoa. He had five brothers, and three sisters. His brothers were Sargent, Samuel, David, William and Louis, all of whom participated in competitive aquatic sports. His sisters were Bernice, Kapiolani and Maria.

&quot;Duke&quot; was not a title or a nickname, but a given name. He was named after his father, Duke Halapu Kahanamoku, who was christened by Bernice Pauahi Bishop in honor of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who was visiting Hawaii at the time. His father was a policeman. His mother Julia Paakonia Lonokahikina Paoa was a deeply religious woman with a strong sense of family ancestry.

His parents were from prominent Hawaiian &quot;ohana&quot; (families). The Kahanamoku and the Paoa ohana were considered to be lower-ranking nobles, who were in service to the &quot;aliʻi nui&quot;, or royalty. His paternal grandfather was Kahanamoku and his grandmother, Kapiolani Kaoeha (sometimes spelled &quot;Kahoea&quot;), a descendant of Alapainui. They were &quot;kahu&quot;, retainers and trusted advisors of the Kamehamehas, to whom they were related. His maternal grandparents Paoa, son of Paoa Hoolae and Hiikaalani, and Mele Uliama, were also of aliʻi descent.

In 1893, his family moved to Kālia, Waikiki (near the present site of Hilton Hawaiian Village), to be closer to his mother&#x27;s parents and family. Kahanamoku grew up with his siblings and 31 Paoa cousins. He attended the Waikiki Grammar School, Kaahumanu School, and the Kamehameha Schools, although he never graduated because he had to quit to help support the family.

==Early years==

Growing up on the outskirts of Waikiki, Kahanamoku spent much of his youth at the beach, where he developed his surfing and swimming skills. In his youth, Kahanamoku preferred a traditional surf board, which he called his &quot;papa nui&quot;, constructed after the fashion of ancient Hawaiian olo boards. Made from the wood of a koa tree, it was long and weighed . The board was without a skeg, which had yet to be invented. In his later surfing career, he would often use smaller boards but always preferred those made of wood.

Kahanamoku was a powerful swimmer. On August 11, 1911, he was timed at 55.4 seconds in the freestyle, beating the existing world record by 4.6 seconds, in the salt water of Honolulu Harbor. He broke the record in the and equaled it in the . But the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), in disbelief, would not recognize these feats until many years later. The AAU initially claimed that the judges must have been using alarm clocks rather than stopwatches and later claimed that ocean currents aided Kahanamoku.

==Career==
Kahanamoku easily qualified for the U.S. Olympic swimming team in 1912. At the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, he won a gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle, and a silver medal with the second-place U.S. team in the men&#x27;s 4×200-meter freestyle relay.

During the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, Kahanamoku won gold medals in both the 100 meters (bettering fellow Hawaiian Pua Kealoha) and in the relay. He finished the 100 meters with a silver medal during the 1924 Olympics in Paris, with the gold going to Johnny Weissmuller and the bronze to Kahanamoku&#x27;s brother, Samuel. By then age 34, Kahanamoku won no more Olympic medals. But he served as an alternate for the U.S. water polo team at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

=== Post-Olympic career ===

Between Olympic competitions, and after retiring from the Olympics, Kahanamoku traveled internationally to give swimming exhibitions. It was during this period that he popularized the sport of surfing, previously known only in Hawaii, by incorporating surfing exhibitions into his touring exhibitions as well. He attracted people to surfing in mainland America first in 1912 while in Southern California. He trained and loaned equipment to new surfers, such as Dorothy Becker.

His surfing exhibition at Sydney, Australia&#x27;s Freshwater Beach on December 24, 1914, is widely regarded as a seminal event in the development of surfing in Australia. The board that Kahanamoku built from a piece of pine from a local hardware store is retained by the Freshwater Surf Life Saving Club. A statue of Kahanamoku was erected in his honor on the Northern headland of Freshwater Lake, New South Wales.

During his time living in Southern California, Kahanamoku performed in Hollywood as a background actor and a character actor in several films. He made connections in this way with people who could further publicize the sport of surfing. Kahanamoku was involved with the Los Angeles Athletic Club, acting as a lifeguard and competing in both swimming and water polo teams.

While living in Newport Beach, California, on June 14, 1925, Kahanamoku rescued eight men from a fishing vessel that capsized in heavy surf while it was attempting to enter the city&#x27;s harbor. Using his surfboard, Kahanamoku made repeated trips from shore to the capsized ship, and helped rescue several people. Two other surfers saved four more fishermen, while five succumbed to the seas before they could be rescued. At the time the Newport Beach police chief called Kahanamoku&#x27;s efforts &quot;The most superhuman surfboard rescue act the world has ever seen.&quot; The widespread publicity surrounding the rescue influenced lifeguards across the US to begin the use of surfboards as standard equipment for water rescues.

Kahanamoku was the first person to be inducted into both the Swimming Hall of Fame and the Surfing Hall of Fame. The Duke Kahanamoku Invitational Surfing Championships in Hawaii, the first major professional surfing contest event ever held in the huge surf on the North Shore of Oahu, was named in his honor. He is a member of the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame.

Later Kahanamoku was elected to serve as the Sheriff of Honolulu, Hawaii from 1932 to 1961, completing 13 consecutive terms. During World War II, he served as a military police officer for the United States; Hawai&#x27;i was not yet a state and was administered.

In the postwar period, Kahanamoku appeared in a number of television programs and films, including &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; (1955). He was well-liked throughout the Hollywood community.

Kahanamoku became a friend and surfing companion of heiress Doris Duke. She built a home (now a museum) on Oahu named Shangri-la. Kahanamoku gave private surfing lessons to Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. and John Aspinwall Roosevelt, the children of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

== &quot;Duncan v. Kahanamoku&quot; ==

In 1946, Kahanamoku was the &quot;pro forma&quot; defendant in the landmark Supreme Court case &quot;Duncan v. Kahanamoku&quot;. While Kahanamoku was a military police officer during World War II, he arrested Duncan, a civilian shipfitter, for public intoxication.

At the time, Hawaii, not yet a state, was being administered by the United States under the Hawaiian Organic Act. This effectively instituted martial law on the island. After Duncan was tried by a military tribunal, he appealed to the Supreme Court. In a &quot;post hoc&quot; ruling, the court ruled that trial by military tribunal for the civilian was, in this case, unconstitutional.

==Personal life==

On August 2, 1940, Kahanamoku married dance instructor Nadine Alexander, who had relocated to Hawaii from Cleveland, Ohio, after she had been hired to teach at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. Duke was 50 years old, Nadine was 35.

He was initiated, passed and raised to the degree of Master Mason in Hawaiian Lodge Masonic Lodge No 21
 and was also a Noble (member) of the Shriners fraternal organization. He was a Republican.

== Death and legacy ==

Kahanamoku died of a heart attack on January 22, 1968, at age 77. For his burial at sea, a long motorcade of mourners, accompanied by a 30-man police escort, traveled in procession across town to Waikiki Beach. Reverend Abraham Akaka, the pastor of Kawaiahao Church, performed the service. A group of beach boys sang Hawaiian songs, including &quot;Aloha Oe&quot;, and Kahanamoku&#x27;s ashes were scattered into the ocean.

=== Statues and monuments ===

In 1994, a statue of Kahanamoku by Barry Donohoo was inaugurated in Freshwater, NSW, Australia. It is the showpiece of the Australian Surfers Walk of Fame.

On February 28, 2015, a monument featuring a replica of Kahanamoku&#x27;s surfboard was unveiled at New Brighton beach, Christchurch, New Zealand in honor of the 100th anniversary of Kahanamoku&#x27;s visit to New Brighton.

A statue of Kahanamoku was installed in Huntington Beach, California. A nearby restaurant is named for him and is close to Huntington Beach pier. The City of Huntington Beach identifies with the legacy of surfing, and a museum dedicated to that sport is located here.

In April 2022, NSW Heritage announced that Kahanamoku would be included in the first batch of Blue Plaques to be issued, to recognize his contribution to recreation and surfing.

A sculpture of Kahanamoku flanked by a male knee paddler and a female prone paddler commemorating the Catalina Classic Paddleboard Race was installed on the Manhattan Beach Pier in 2023.

=== Additional tributes ===
Hawaii music promoter Kimo Wilder McVay capitalized on Kahanamoku&#x27;s popularity by naming his Waikiki showroom &quot;Duke Kahanamoku&#x27;s&quot; at the International Market Place and giving Kahanamoku a financial interest in the showroom in exchange for the use of his name. It was a major Waikiki showroom in the 1960s and is remembered as the home of Don Ho &amp; The Aliis from 1964 through 1969. The showroom continued to be known as Duke Kahanamoku&#x27;s until Hawaii showman Jack Cione bought it in the mid-1970s and renamed it Le Boom Boom.

The Duke Kahanamoku Aquatic Complex (DKAC) serves as the home for the University of Hawai‘i&#x27;s swimming and diving and women&#x27;s water polo teams. The facility, located on the university&#x27;s lower campus, includes a 50-meter training pool and a separate 25-yard competition and diving pool. The long course pool is four feet at both ends, seven feet in the middle, and an average depth of six feet.

Kahanamoku&#x27;s name is also used by Duke&#x27;s Canoe Club &amp; Barefoot Bar, known as Duke&#x27;s Waikiki, a beachfront bar and restaurant in the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach Hotel. There is a chain of restaurants named after him in California, Florida and Hawaii called Duke&#x27;s.

On August 24, 2002, the 112th anniversary of Kahanamoku&#x27;s birth, the U.S. Postal Service issued a first-class commemorative stamp with Duke&#x27;s picture on it. The First Day Ceremony was held at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki and was attended by thousands. At this ceremony, attendees could attach the Duke stamp to an envelope and get it canceled with a First Day of Issue postmark. These first day covers are very collectible.

On August 24, 2015, a Google Doodle honored the 125th anniversary of Duke Kahanamoku&#x27;s birthday.

In 2021, a 88-minute feature film was made about Kahanamoku&#x27;s life.

 It was later broadcast by PBS as part of their American Masters series.

<doc id="9119" wikidata="Q1774648" url="?curid=9119" title="Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)">
<text>The Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) is a military decoration of the United States Army that is presented to soldiers who have distinguished themselves by exceptionally meritorious service to the government in a duty of great responsibility. The performance must be such as to merit recognition for service that is clearly exceptional. The exceptional performance of normal duty will not alone justify an award of this decoration.

The Army&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal is equivalent to the Naval Service&#x27;s Navy Distinguished Service Medal, Air and Space Forces&#x27; Distinguished Service Medal, and the Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal. Prior to the creation of the Air Force&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal in 1960, United States Air Force airmen were awarded the Army&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal.

==Description==
*The coat of arms of the United States in Gold surrounded by a circle of Dark Blue enamel, 1 ½ inches in diameter, bearing the inscription &quot;FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MCMXVIII&quot;.
*On the reverse is a scroll for the name of the recipient (which is to be engraved) upon a trophy of flags and weapons. The medal is suspended by a bar attached to the ribbon.

===Ribbon===
*The ribbon is wide and consists of the following stripes:
# Scarlet 67111;
# Ultramarine Blue 67118;
# White 67101;
# Ultramarine Blue;
# Scarlet.

*Additional awards of the Distinguished Service Medal are denoted by oak leaf clusters.

==Criteria==
The Distinguished Service Medal is awarded to any person - effectively, general officers - who, while serving in any capacity with the United States Army, has distinguished themselves by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility.

The performance must be such as to merit recognition for service which is clearly exceptional. Exceptional performance of normal duty will not alone justify an award of this decoration. For service not related to actual war, the term &quot;duty of a great responsibility&quot; applies to a narrower range of positions than in time of war and requires evidence of a conspicuously significant achievement. However, justification of the award may accrue by virtue of exceptionally meritorious service in a succession of high positions of great importance. Awards may be made to persons other than members of the Armed Forces of the United States for wartime services only, and only then under exceptional circumstances with the express approval of the president in each case.

==Components==
*The following are authorized components of the Distinguished Service Medal and applicable specifications:
#Decoration (regular size): MIL-D-3943/7.
##NSN for decoration set: 8455-00-444-0007.
##NSN for replacement medal is 8455-00-246-3830.
#Decoration (miniature size): MIL-D-3943/7. NSN 8455-00-996-5008.
#Ribbon: MIL-R-11589/52. NSN 8455-00-252-9922.
#Lapel Button (metal replica of ribbon bar): MIL-L-11484/4. NSN 8455-00-253-0809.

==History of the Distinguished Service Medal==
The Distinguished Service Medal was authorized by Presidential Order dated January 2, 1918, and confirmed by Congress on July 9, 1918. It was announced by War Department General Order No. 6, 1918-01-12, with the following information concerning the medal: &quot;A bronze medal of appropriate design and a ribbon to be worn in lieu thereof, to be awarded by the President to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Army shall hereafter distinguish himself or herself, or who, since 04-06-1917, has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility in time of war or in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United States.&quot; The Act of Congress on July 9, 1918, recognized the need for different types and degrees of heroism and meritorious service and included such provisions for award criteria. The current statutory authorization for the Distinguished Service Medal is Title 10, United States Code, Section 3743.

==Recipients==

*Among the first awards of the Distinguished Service Medal for service in World War I, were those to the Commanding Officers of the Allied Armies:
#Marshal Ferdinand Foch
#Marshal Joseph Joffre
#General Philippe Petain of France
#General Louis Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey of France
#General Sir Arthur Currie of Canada
#General Sir John Monash of Australia
#Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig of Britain
#General Armando Diaz of Italy
#General Cyriaque Gillain of Belgium
#General John Joseph Pershing of the United States
#Field Marshal Živojin Mišić of Serbia

More than 2,000 awards were made during World War I, and by the time the United States entered World War II, approximately 2,800 awards had been made. From July 1, 1941, to June 6, 1969, when the Department of the Army stopped publishing awards of the DSM in Department of the Army General Orders, over 2,800 further awards were made.

Prior to World War II the DSM was the only decoration for non-combat service in the U.S. Army. As a result, before World War II the DSM was awarded to a wider range of recipients than during and after World War II. During World War I awards of the DSM to officers below the rank of brigadier general were fairly common but became rare once the Legion of Merit was established in 1942.

Until the first award of the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal in 1965, United States Air Force personnel received this award as well, as was the case with several other Department of the Army decorations until the Department of the Air Force fully established its own system of decorations.

===Notable recipients===
Because the Army Distinguished Service Medal is principally awarded to general officers, a list of notable recipients would include nearly every general, and some admirals, since 1918, many of whom received multiple awards, as well as a few civilians and sergeants major prominent for their contributions to national defense.

General Martin Dempsey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, holds the record for receiving the greatest number of awards of the Army Distinguished Service Medal, at six. He also received three awards of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal as well as one award each of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, and the Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal, for a total of twelve Distinguished Service Medals.

Generals of the Army Douglas MacArthur and Dwight Eisenhower are tied with five awards each received of the Army Distinguished Service Medal. They also each received one award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, for a total of six DSMs each.

General Lucius D. Clay (Four Star) received three Army DSM awards for his service that included Commanding General, U.S. Army Forces (European Theater) and Military Governor of Germany. During his tenure, Gen. Clay solved his greatest challenge: the Soviet Blockade of Berlin, which was imposed in June 1948. Gen. Clay triggered the Berlin Airlift, which served the city residents during the harsh winter of 1948–1949. He is also a recipient of the Legion of Merit.

General Norman Schwarzkopf received two awards of the Army DSM and one award each of the Defense DSM, Navy DSM, the Air Force DSM and the Coast Guard DSM, for a total of six DSMs.

General Lloyd Austin received four awards of the Army DSM and five awards of the Defense DSM for a total of nine DSMs.

Among notable recipients below flag rank are: X-1 test pilot Chuck Yeager and X-15 test pilot Robert M. White, who both received the DSM as U.S. Air Force majors; director Frank Capra, decorated in 1945 as an army colonel; actor James Stewart, decorated in 1945 as an Army Air Forces colonel (later Air Force Brigadier General); Colonel Wendell Fertig, who led Filipino guerrillas behind Japanese lines; Colonel (later Major General) John K. Singlaub, who led partisan forces in the Korean War; and Major Maude C. Davison, who led the &quot;Angels of Bataan and Corregidor&quot; during their imprisonment by the Japanese, and Colonel William S. Taylor, Program Manager Multiple Launch Rocket System. Among notable civilian recipients are Harry L. Hopkins, Robert S. McNamara and Henry L. Stimson.

Samuel W. Koster received a DSM, but this was rescinded due to his involvement in covering up the My Lai massacre

<text>The Defense Distinguished Service Medal is a military decoration of the United States Department of Defense, which is presented to United States Armed Forces service members for exceptionally distinguished performance of duty contributing to the national security or defense of the United States. The medal was created on July 9, 1970, by President Richard Nixon in . President Nixon awarded the first medal, on the day the Executive Order was signed, to General Earle Wheeler, who was retiring from the US Army after serving as Chief of Staff of the United States Army and then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

It is equivalent to the United States Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Homeland Security Distinguished Service Medal.

==Criteria==
The Defense Distinguished Service Medal is the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s highest non-combat related military award and it is the highest joint service decoration. The Defense Distinguished Service Medal is awarded only while assigned to a joint activity. Normally, such responsibilities deserving of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal are held by the most senior officers such as the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chiefs and vice chiefs of the military services, and commanders and deputy commanders of the Combatant Commands, the Director of the Joint Staff, and others whose duties bring them frequently into direct contact with the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and other senior government officials. In addition, the medal may also be awarded to other service members whose direct and individual contributions to national security or national defense are recognized as being so exceptional in scope and value as to be equivalent to contributions normally associated with positions encompassing broader responsibilities.

This decoration takes precedence over the Distinguished Service Medals of the services and is not to be awarded to any individual for a period of service for which an Army, Navy, Air Force or Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal is awarded.

==Appearance==

The medal is gold in color and on the obverse it features a medium blue enameled pentagon (point up). Superimposed on this is an American bald eagle with wings outspread facing left grasping three crossed arrows in its talons and on its breast is a shield of the United States. The pentagon and eagle are enclosed within a gold pieced circle consisting, in the upper half of 13 five-pointed stars and in the lower half, a wreath of laurel on the left and olive on the right. At the top is a suspender of five graduated gold rays. The reverse of the medal has the inscription &quot;For Distinguished Service&quot; at the top in raised letters, and within the pentagon the inscription &quot;FROM THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TO&quot;, all in raised letters.

Additional awards of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal are denoted by oak leaf clusters.

<text>Dacoity is a term used for &quot;banditry&quot; in the Indian subcontinent. The spelling is the anglicised version of the Hindi word डाकू (ḍākū); &quot;dacoit&quot; is a colloquial Indian English word with this meaning. It appears in the &quot;Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases&quot; (1903). Banditry is a criminal activity involving robbery by groups of armed bandits. The East India Company established the Thuggee and Dacoity Department in 1830, and the Thuggee and Dacoity Suppression Acts, 1836–1848 were enacted in British India under East India Company rule. Areas with ravines or forests, such as Chambal and Chilapata Forests, were once known for dacoits.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;dacoity&quot; is an anglicized version of the Hindi word &quot;ḍakaitī&quot; (historically transliterated &quot;dakaitee&quot;). Hindi डकैती comes from &quot;ḍākū&quot; (historically transliterated &quot;dakoo&quot;, Hindi: डाकू, meaning &quot;armed robber&quot;).

The term dacoit (Hindi: डकैत &quot;ḍakait&quot;) means &quot;a bandit&quot; according to the &quot;OED&quot; (&quot;A member of a class of robbers in India and Burma, who plunder in armed bands&quot;).

==History==
=== Bandits of Bhind-Morena of Chambal ===
The dacoity have had a large impact in the Bhind and Morena of Chambal regions in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in north-central India. The exact reasons for the emergence of dacoity in the Chambal valley have been disputed. Most explanations have suggested feudal exploitation as the cause that provoked many people in this region to take arms. The area was also underdeveloped and poor, so banditry posed great economic incentives. However, the fact that many gangs operating in this valley were composed of higher castes and wealthy people appears to suggest that feudalism may only be a partial explanation of dacoity in Chambal Valley (Bhaduri, 1972; Khan, 1981; Jatar, 1980; Katare, 1972). Furthermore, traditional honour codes and blood feuds would drive some into criminality.

In Chambal, India, organized crime controlled much of the countryside from the time of the British Raj up to the early 2000s, with the police offering high rewards for the most notorious bandit chiefs. The criminals regularly targeted local businesses, though they preferred to kidnap wealthy people and demand ransom from their relatives – cutting off fingers, noses, and ears to pressure them into paying high sums. Many dacoity also posed as social bandits toward the local poor, paying medical bills and funding weddings. One ex-dacoit described his criminal past by claiming that &quot;I was a rebel. I fought injustice.&quot; Following intense anti-banditry campaigns by the Indian Police, highway robbery was almost completely eradicated in the early 2000s. Nevertheless, Chambal is still popularly believed to be unsafe and bandit-infested by many Indians. One police officer noted that the fading of dacoity was also due to social changes, as few young people were any longer willing to endure the harsh life of highway robbers in the countryside. Instead, they prefer to join crime groups in the city, where life is easier.

=== Dacoits in Bengal ===
While thugs and dacoits operating in northern and central India are more popularly known and referenced in books, films, and academic journals, a significant number of accounts also come from Bengal. Writing about the dacoits of Bengal, the colonial official CH Keighly mentions the “great difference between gangs of hereditary dacoits or thugs in other parts of India and the dacoits of Bengal”. It is notable that, unlike the rest of India, dacoits in Bengal did not come from a particular social class, caste, or creed.

==== The Gangs of Nadia and Hooghly ====
Dacoit gangs in Nadia and Hooghly were mainly known for their ceremonial practices before the night of dacoity. Before setting off for their mission, the members would assemble to perform “kalipuja” led by the Sirdar (leader). The dacoits would form a straight line, and a pot of liquor, torches, and weapons to be used in the dacoity would be laid down in a clear space. The Sirdar would then dip his finger in oil and touch the forehead of all the dacoits, making them promise never to confess. Even during the raid, when dacoits opened chests and discovered a good fortune, they would shout “Kali, Jai Kali”.

==== Dacoits of Birbhum ====
Dacoity was prevalent in 19th century West Bengal. One of the gangs, led by a charismatic leader named Bhabani Pathak, was known for its loyalty to their leader. After the British captured Bhabani, the inner workings and social factors that led to the construction of this gang were revealed. Leaders such as Bhabani were known as Sirdars and had a symbiotic relationship with their followers. Among other benefits, a Sirdar would lend loans to members and provide them protection. This allowed for the formation of a special bond between Sirdar and his followers, which meant that cases of desertion and exiting the gang were virtually unheard of.

==== Tales of Burdwan ====
In Burdwan, dacoities were heavily planned, and considerable thought was put into their seamless execution. Sirdars in Burdwan employed several informants who kept them updated about prospective targets. When a target was finalized, the Sirdar and relevant gang members were constantly made aware of his whereabouts. The informants were always on the lookout for wealthy business people and kept a close watch on those who exchanged bank notes of considerable value or received a shipment of merchandise they would store in their houses.

=== Other dacoity ===
The term is also applied, according to the &quot;OED&quot;, to &quot;pirates who formerly infested the Ganges between Calcutta and Burhampore&quot;.

Dacoits existed in Burma as well—Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s fictional Private Mulvaney hunted Burmese dacoits in &quot;The Taking of Lungtungpen.&quot; Sax Rohmer &#x27;s criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu also employed Burmese dacoits as his henchmen.

Indian police forces use &quot;Known Dacoit&quot; (K.D.) as a label to classify criminals.

=== Thuggee and Dacoity Suppression Acts ===

Introduced in 1836, the Thuggee and Dacoity Suppression Acts brought about several legislative measures, including establishing special courts, authorization for using rewards for informants, and the power to arrest suspects. These acts were primarily intended to counter the activities of the thuggee, groups of criminals who allegedly moved along the highways of India murdering and robbing unaware travellers. According to academic Mark Brown, the prevalence of the thuggee across India during the early 19th century and the East India Company&#x27;s response to it &quot;might best be viewed in light of anxieties in both British ruling and Indian subordinate groups produced by the rapid and far-reaching [British] colonial expansion&quot; across South Asia.

==Notable dacoits==
Notable dacoits include:
* Chavviram Singh Yadav
* Gabbar Singh Gujjar – inspired the famous 1975 film &quot;Sholay&quot;, based on his life
* Man Singh was a notorious Dacoit of the Rathore clan of Rajputs. He was also known as the Lion of Chambal.
* Malkhan Singh Rajpoot, a notorious bandit known as the &quot;Bandit King&quot; or &quot;King of Dacoits.&quot; He also had political aspirations in MP.
* Malangi
* Kallu Yadav (Kalua), also known as Katri King
* Mohar Singh Gurjar
* Nirbhay Singh Gujjar
* Nizam Lohar, a dacoit born into a Punjabi Muslim family during the Sikh Empire. He is known for his rebellion and freedom struggle against the British colonial government.
* Paan Singh Tomar, a former soldier in the Indian Army, an athlete that represented India in the Asian Games, who later resorted to becoming a Baaghi due to the injustices he faced. Also inspired the Bollywood film &quot;Paan Singh Tomar&quot;, in which he was played by Irrfan Khan.
* Phoolan Devi, known as Bandit Queen (even a movie with the same name was made), a lady bandit who initially rebelled against her rape and injustice her community she was subjected to.
* Rambabu Gadariya – Regarded as the last notorious dacoit of Chambal
* Shiv Kumar Patel (Dadua)
* Ramashish Koeri was active in Rohtas Plateau of Bihar in 1980s. He was the leader of a group of bandits, who were supported by the people from lower strata of society. This dacoit group was known for challenging the hagemony of upper caste landlords in the region, who were exploitative.
* Jagat Singh Sidhu (Jagga Jatt)
* Koose Munusamy Veerappan, a notorious dacoit, poacher, and smuggler in South India. He was responsible for poaching approximately 500 of the 2000 elephants killed in the peninsular region where he was active and for smuggling ivory worth US$2.6 million (₹16 crore) and about 65 tons of sandalwood worth approximately US$22 million (₹143 crore).

==Protection measures==
In Madhya Pradesh, women belonging to a village defence group have been issued firearm permits to fend off dacoity. The Chief minister of the state, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, recognised the role the women had played in defending their villages without guns. He stated that he wanted to enable these women to better defend both themselves and their villages, and issued the gun permits to advance this goal.

==In popular culture==
===Dacoit films===
As the dacoits flourished through the 1940s–1970s, they were the subject of various Hindi films made during this era, leading to the emergence of the dacoit film genre in Hindi Film Industry. The genre began with Mehboob Khan&#x27;s &quot;Aurat&quot; (1940), which he remade as &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957). &quot;Mother India&quot; received an Academy Award nomination, and defined the dacoit film genre, along with Dilip Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; (1961). Other popular films in this genre included Raj Kapoor’s &quot;Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai&quot; (1961) and Moni Bhattacharjee&#x27;s &quot;Mujhe Jeene Do&quot; (1963).

Pakistani actor Akmal Khan had two dacoit films, &quot;Malangi&quot; (1965) and &quot;Imam Din Gohavia&quot; (1967). Other films in this genre included &quot;Khote Sikkay&quot; (1973), &quot;Mera Gaon Mera Desh&quot; (1971), and &quot;Kuchhe Dhaage&quot; (1973) both by Raj Khosla.

The most famous dacoit film is &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975), written by Salim–Javed, and starring Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, and Amjad Khan as the dacoit character Gabbar Singh. It was a masala film that combined the dacoit film conventions of &quot;Mother India&quot; and &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; with that of Spaghetti Westerns, spawning the &quot;Dacoit Western&quot; genre, also known as the &quot;Curry Western&quot; genre. The film also borrowed elements from Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. &quot;Sholay&quot; became a classic in the genre, and its success led to a surge of films in this genre, including &quot;Ganga Ki Saugandh&quot; (1978), once again starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amjad Khan.

An internationally acclaimed example of the genre is &quot;Bandit Queen&quot; (1994).

The Tamil movie starring Karthi, &quot;Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru&quot; (2017) deals elaborately with bandits. The film reveals the real dacoity incidents which held in Tamil Nadu between 1995 and 2005. Director Vinoth did a two-year research about bandits to develop the script.

A related genre of crime films are Mumbai underworld films.

<text>Davis is the most populous city in Yolo County, California, United States. Located in the Sacramento Valley region of Northern California, the city had a population of 66,850 in 2020, not including the on-campus population of the University of California, Davis, which was over 9,400 (not including students&#x27; families) in 2016. there were 40,850 students enrolled at the university, and is known as the biking capital of America.

== History ==
Davis sits on land that was historically inhabited by Indigenous people associated with the Clovis culture. At a later point, the Patwin, a southern branch of Wintun people, displaced existing Indigenous tribes. The Patwin were killed or forced from their lands by the 1830s as part of the California genocide through a combination of mass murders, smallpox and other diseases, and both Mexican and American systems of Indigenous slavery. Patwin burial grounds have been found across Davis, including on the site of the UC Davis Mondavi Center. After the killing and expulsion of the Patwin, territory that eventually became Davis emerged from one of California&#x27;s most complicated ranchos, Laguna de Santos Callé. The 1852 Land Commission concurred with US Attorneys who argued that the grant was &quot;fraudulent in all its parts,&quot; and in his 1860 District Court ruling Justice Ogden Hoffman observed that &quot;It is impossible to contemplate without disgust the series of perjuries which compose the record&quot; of the land grant. Nevertheless, Jerome C. Davis, a prominent farmer and one of the early claimants to land in Laguna de Santos Callé, lobbied all the way to the United States Congress in order to retain the land that eventually became Davis. Davis became a depot on the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1868, when it was named Davisville after Jerome C. Davis. The post office at Davisville shortened the town name to &quot;Davis&quot; in 1907. The name stuck, and the city of Davis was incorporated on March 28, 1917.

From its inception as a farming community, Davis is known primarily for its contributions to agricultural policy along with veterinary care and animal husbandry. Following the passage of the University Farm Bill in 1905 by the California State Legislature, Governor George Pardee selected Davis out of 50 other sites as the future home to the University of California&#x27;s University Farm, officially opening to students in 1908. The farm, later renamed the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture in 1922, was upgraded to become the seventh UC general campus, the University of California, Davis, in 1959.

==Geography and environment==

===Location===
Davis is located in Yolo County, California, west of Sacramento, northeast of San Francisco, north of Los Angeles, at the intersection of Interstate 80 and State Route 113. Neighboring towns include Dixon, Winters, Woodland, and West Sacramento.

Davis lies in the Sacramento Valley, the northern portion of the Central Valley, in Northern California, at an elevation of about above sea level.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it, or 0.19%, is water.

The topography is flat, which has helped Davis to become known as a haven for bicyclists.

=== Climate ===
The Davis climate resembles that of nearby Sacramento and is typical of California&#x27;s Central Valley Mediterranean climate region: warm and dry in the spring, summer and autumn, and cool and wet in the winter. It is classified as a Köppen &quot;Csa&quot; climate. Summer days are hot, ranging from , but the nights turn pleasantly cool, almost always dropping below . The Delta Breeze, a flow of cool marine air originating from the Pacific Ocean via San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, frequently provides relief in the evening. Winter temperatures generally reach between in the afternoon; nights average at about , but occasionally fall below freezing.

Average temperatures range from in December and January to in July and August. Thick ground fog called tule fog settles into Davis during late fall and winter. This fog can be dense, with near zero visibility. As in other areas of Northern California, the tule fog is a leading cause of road accidents in the winter season.

Mean rainfall per annum is about . The bulk of the rainfall occurs between about mid-November to mid-March, with typically no precipitation falling from mid-June to mid-September.

Record temperatures range from a high of on July 17, 1925, to a low of on December 11, 1932.

===Neighborhoods===

Davis is internally divided by two freeways (Interstate 80 and State Route 113), a north–south railroad (California Northern), an east–west mainline (Union Pacific) and several major streets. The city is unofficially divided into six main districts made up of smaller neighborhoods (often originally named as housing subdivisions):
* Central Davis, north of Fifth Street and Russell Boulevard, south of Covell Blvd., east of SR 113, and west of the railroad tracks running along G Street. Within these boundaries is the officially denoted neighborhood of Old North Davis, which is sometimes also considered part of Downtown.
* Downtown Davis, roughly the numbered-and-lettered grid north of I-80, south of Fifth Street, east of A Street, and west of the railroad tracks, including the Aggie Village and Olive Drive areas.
* East Davis, north of I-80, south of Covell Blvd., and east of the railroad tracks. It includes the older, &#x27;inner&#x27; East Davis of lettered streets and neighborhoods such as Davis Manor, Chestnut, and Rancho Yolo, as well as more distinctly identified (in some cases walled-in) subdivisions such as Mace Ranch, Lake Alhambra Estates, and Wildhorse.
* North Davis, north of Covell Blvd. North Davis includes Covell Park, Senda Nueva, Northstar, and North Davis Farms.
* South Davis, south of I-80, and includes Willowbank. El Macero, California, although outside the city limits, is sometimes considered part of South Davis; El Macero is part of the Davis Joint Unified School District, and El Macero children who attend public schools attend Davis&#x27; public schools.
* West Davis, north of I-80 and west of SR 113. West Davis includes Westwood, Evergreen, Aspen, Stonegate (west of Lake Boulevard and including Stonegate Lake and the Stonegate Country Club) and the eco-friendly Village Homes development, known for its solar-powered houses.

The University of California, Davis is located south of Russell Boulevard and west of A Street and then south of 1st Street. The land occupied by the university is not incorporated within the boundaries of the city of Davis and lies within both Yolo and Solano Counties.

=== Environment ===
Local energy planning began in Davis after the energy crisis of 1973. A new building code promoted energy efficiency. Energy use in buildings decreased dramatically and in 1981 Davis citizens won a $100,000 prize from utility PG&amp;E, for cutting electricity use during the summer peak.

On November 14, 1984, the Davis City Council declared the city to be a nuclear-free zone. In 1998, the City passed a &quot;Dark Skies&quot; ordinance in an effort to reduce light pollution in the night sky.

In 2013, Davis became part of the state Cool Roof Initiative with the &quot;CoolDavis&quot; campaign, requiring all new roofing projects to meet Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) requirements, including the installation of light-colored roofs. The aim is to reflect more sunlight back into space via the albedo effect, and reduce the amount of heat absorbed in hopes of limiting climate change.

==Bicycling==

Bicycling has been one of the most popular modes of transportation in Davis for decades, particularly among school-age children and UC Davis students. In 2010, Davis became the new home of the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame.

Bicycle infrastructure became a political issue in the 1960s, culminating in the election of a pro-bicycle majority to the City Council in 1966. By the early 1970s, Davis had become a pioneer in the implementation of cycling facilities. As the city expands, new facilities are usually mandated. As a result, Davis residents today enjoy an extensive network of bike lanes, bike paths, and grade-separated bicycle crossings. The flat terrain and temperate climate are also conducive to bicycling.

In 2005, the Bicycle-Friendly Community program of the League of American Bicyclists recognized Davis as the first Platinum Level city in the US Bicycling appears to be declining among Davis residents: from 1990 to 2000, the US Census Bureau reported a decline in the fraction of commuters traveling by bicycle, from 22 percent to 15 percent. This resulted in the reestablishment of the city&#x27;s Bicycle Advisory Commission and creation of advocate groups such as &quot;Davis Bicycles!&quot;. In 2016, Fifth Street, a main road in Davis, was converted from four lanes to two lanes to allow for bicycle lanes and encourage more bicycling.

In 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2009, the UC Davis &quot;Cal Aggie Cycling&quot; Team won the national road cycling competition. The team also competes off-road and on the track, and has competed in the national competitions of these disciplines. In 2007, UC Davis also organized a record-breaking bicycle parade numbering 822 bicycles.

== Sights and culture ==
=== Whole Earth Festival ===
A continuous stream of bands, speakers and various workshops occurs throughout Mother&#x27;s Day weekend on each of Whole Earth Festival&#x27;s (WEF) three stages and other specialty areas. The WEF is organized entirely by UC Davis students, in association with the Associated Students of UC Davis and the university.

=== Celebrate Davis ===
Celebrate Davis is the annual free festival held by the Davis Chamber of Commerce. It features booths by Davis businesses, live music, food vendors, live animals, activities like rock climbing and zip-lining. It concludes with fireworks after dark. Parking is problematic, so most people ride their bikes and use the free valet parking.

=== Picnic Day ===
Picnic Day is an annual event at the University of California, Davis and is always held on the third Saturday in April. It is the largest student-run event in the US. Picnic Day starts off with a parade, which features the UC Davis California Aggie Marching Band-uh!, and runs through campus and around downtown Davis and ends with the Battle of the Bands, which lasts until the last band stops playing (sometimes until 2 am). There are over 150 free events and over 50,000 attend every year. Other highlights include: the Dachshund races, a.k.a. the Doxie Derby, held in the Pavilion; the Davis Rock Challenge, the Chemistry Magic Show, and the sheep dog trials. Many departments have exhibits and demonstrations, such as the Cole Facility, which until recently showed a fistulated cow (a cow that has been fitted with a plastic portal (a &quot;fistula&quot;) into its digestive system to observe digestion processes). Its name was &quot;Hole-y Cow&quot;.

=== Davis Transmedia Art Walk ===
The Davis Transmedia Art Walk is a free—self-guided—public art tour includes 23 public murals, 16 sculptures, and 15 galleries and museums all in downtown Davis and the University of Davis campus. A free Davis Art Walk map serves as a detailed guide to the entire collection. The art pieces are all within walking distance of each other. The walk is a roughly circuitous path that can be completed within an hour or two. Every piece of art on the Art Walk has been embedded with an RFID chip. Using a cellphone that supports this technology, you access multimedia files that relate to each work. You can even leave a comment or &quot;burn your own message&quot; for other visitors to see. Artist hosted tours are held on the weekend by appointment only. To pick up a copy of the Davis Art Walk map, visit the Yolo County Visitors Bureau (132 E St., Suite 200; (530) 297–1900) or the John Natsoulas Center for the Arts (521 1st St.; (530) 756–3938).

=== Manetti Shrem Museum of Art ===
The Manetti Shrem Museum of Art, located on the UC Davis campus, opened on November 13, 2016, and carries on the legacy of the university&#x27;s world-renowned first generation art faculty, which contributed to innovations in conceptual, performance and video art in the 1960s and 70s. The museum has generated nationwide attention with exhibits by artists such as Wayne Thiebaud, Bruce Nauman, John Cage, and Robert Arneson as well as its striking architecture, featuring a 50,000 square-foot “Grand Canopy” of perforated aluminum triangular beams, supported by 40 steel columns. Every year the museum exhibits works by graduating art students. The museum is free and hosts lecture series and events throughout the year, as well as weekend art studio activities for all ages.

=== Mondavi Center ===
The Mondavi Center, located on the UC Davis campus, is one of the biggest non-seasonal attractions in Davis. The Mondavi Center is a theater which hosts many world-class touring acts, including star performers such as Yo-Yo Ma, Yitzhak Perlman and Wynton Marsalis, and draws a large audience from Sacramento.

=== UC Davis Arboretum ===
The UC Davis Arboretum is an arboretum and botanical garden. Plants from all over the world grow in different sections of the park. There are notable oak and native plant collections and a small redwood grove. A small waterway spans the arboretum along the bed of the old North Fork of Putah Creek. Occasionally herons, kingfishers, and cormorants can be seen around the waterways, as well as the ever-present ducks. Tours of the arboretum led by volunteer naturalists are often held for grade-school children.

=== The Domes ===
The Domes (AKA Baggins End Innovative Housing) is an on-campus cooperative housing community designed by project manager Ron Swenson and future student-residents in 1972. Consisting of 14 polyurethane foam-insulated fiberglass domes and located in the Sustainable Research Area at the western end of Orchard Road, it is governed by its 26 UCD student residents. It is one of the few student co-housing cooperative communities in the US, and is an early example of the modern-day growing tiny house movement. The community has successfully resisted several threats to its continuation over the years.

===Farmers Market===
The Davis Farmers Market is held every Wednesday evening and Saturday morning. Participants sell a range of fruits and vegetables, baked goods, dairy and meat products (often from certified organic farms), crafts, and plants and flowers. From April to October, the market hosts &quot;Picnic in the Park&quot;, with musical events and food sold from restaurant stands.

===Media===
Davis has one newspaper, &quot;The Davis Enterprise&quot;, a thrice-weekly newspaper founded in 1897. UC Davis also has a weekly newspaper called &quot;The California Aggie&quot; that covers campus, local and national news. Davis Media Access, a community media center, is the umbrella organization of television station DCTV. There are also numerous commercial stations broadcasting from nearby Sacramento. Davis has two community radio stations: KDVS 90.3 FM, on the University of California campus, and KDRT 95.7 FM, a subsidiary of Davis Media Access and one of the first low-power FM radio stations in the United States. Davis has the world&#x27;s largest English-language local wiki, DavisWiki. In 2006, &quot;The People&#x27;s Vanguard of Davis&quot; began news reporting about the city of Davis, the Davis Joint Unified School District, the county of Yolo, and the Sacramento area.

=== Toad Tunnel ===

Davis&#x27; Toad Tunnel is a wildlife crossing that was constructed in 1995 and has drawn much attention over the years, including a mention on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. Due to the construction of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads traveled from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass which crosses Interstate 80. The project cost $14,000, . The tunnel is wide and high.

==Education==
===University of California===
The University of California, Davis, or UC Davis, a campus of the University of California, had a 2019 Fall enrollment of 38,369 students. UC Davis has a dominant influence on the social and cultural life of the town.

===Other colleges===
An off-campus branch of Sacramento City College is located in Davis. The satellite is located in West Village, an area built by UC Davis to house students and others affiliated with the university.

===Public schools===
Davis&#x27; public school system is administrated by the Davis Joint Unified School District.

The city has nine public elementary schools (North Davis, Birch Lane, Pioneer Elementary, Patwin, Cesar Chavez, Robert E. Willett, Marguerite Montgomery, Fred T. Korematsu at Mace Ranch, and Fairfield Elementary (which is outside the city limits but opened in 1866 and is Davis Joint Unified School District&#x27;s oldest public school)). Davis has one school for independent study (Davis School for Independent Study), four public junior high schools (Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Frances Harper, and Leonardo da Vinci Junior High), one main high school (Davis Senior High School), one alternative high school (Martin Luther King High School), and a small project based high school (Leonardo da Vinci High School). Cesar Chavez is a Spanish immersion school, with no English integration until the third grade. The junior high schools contain grades 7 through 9. Due to a decline in the school-age population in Davis, two of the elementary schools in south Davis may have their district boundaries changed, or magnet programs may be moved to equalize enrollment. Valley Oak was closed after the 2007–08 school year, and their campus was granted to Da Vinci High (which had formerly been located in the back of Davis Senior High&#x27;s campus) and a special-ed preschool. On average, class size is about 25 students for every teacher.

At one time, Chavez and Willett were incorporated together to provide elementary education K–6 to both English-speaking and Spanish immersion students in West Davis. César Chávez served grades K–3 and was called West Davis Elementary, and Robert E. Willett (named for a long-time teacher at the school, now deceased) served grades 4–6 and was known as West Davis Intermediate. Willett now serves K–6 English-speaking students, and Chavez supports the Spanish immersion program for K–6.

<doc id="9128" wikidata="Q714880" url="?curid=9128" title="Damon Runyon">
<text>Alfred Damon Runyon (October 4, 1880 – December 10, 1946) was an American journalist and short-story writer.

He was best known for his short stories celebrating the world of Broadway in New York City that grew out of the Prohibition era. To New Yorkers of his generation, a &quot;Damon Runyon character&quot; evoked a distinctive social type from Brooklyn or Midtown Manhattan. The adjective &quot;Runyonesque&quot; refers to this type of character and the type of situations and dialog that Runyon depicts. He spun humorous and sentimental tales of gamblers, hustlers, actors, and gangsters, few of whom go by &quot;square&quot; names, preferring instead colorful monikers such as &quot;Nathan Detroit&quot;, &quot;Benny Southstreet&quot;, &quot;Big Jule&quot;, &quot;Harry the Horse&quot;, &quot;Good Time Charley&quot;, &quot;Dave the Dude&quot;, or &quot;The Seldom Seen Kid&quot;.

His distinctive vernacular style is known as &quot;Runyonese&quot;: a mixture of formal speech and colorful slang, almost always in the present tense, and always devoid of contractions. He is credited with coining the phrase &quot;Hooray Henry&quot;, a term now used in British English to describe the upper-class version of a loud-mouthed, arrogant twit.

Runyon&#x27;s fictional world is also known to the general public through the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; based on two of his stories, &quot;The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown&quot; and &quot;Blood Pressure&quot;. The musical additionally borrows characters and story elements from a few other Runyon stories, most notably &quot;Pick The Winner&quot;. The film &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; (and its three remakes, &quot;Sorrowful Jones&quot;, &quot;40 Pounds of Trouble&quot; and the 1980 &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot;) grew from his short story of the same name.

Runyon was also a newspaper reporter, covering sports and general news for decades for various publications and syndicates owned by William Randolph Hearst. Already known for his fiction, he wrote a noted &quot;present tense&quot; article on Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s Presidential inauguration in 1933 for the Universal Service, a Hearst syndicate, which was merged with the co-owned International News Service in 1937.

==Early life==

Damon Runyon was born Alfred Damon Runyan to Alfred Lee and Elizabeth (Damon) Runyan. His relatives in his birthplace of Manhattan, Kansas, included several newspapermen. His grandfather was a newspaper printer from New Jersey who had relocated to Manhattan, Kansas, in 1855, and his father was the editor of his newspaper in the town. In 1882 Runyon&#x27;s father was forced to sell his newspaper, and the family moved westward. The family eventually settled in Pueblo, Colorado, in 1887, where Runyon spent the rest of his youth. By most accounts, he attended school only through the fourth grade. He began to work in the newspaper trade under his father in Pueblo. In present-day Pueblo, Runyon Field, the Damon Runyon Repertory Theater Company, and Runyon Lake are named in his honor.

==Enlistment in the military==

In 1898, when still in his teens, Runyon enlisted in the US Army to fight in the Spanish–American War. While in the service, he was assigned to write for the &quot;Manila Freedom&quot; and &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Letter&quot;.

==Newspaper reporter==
After military service, he worked for Colorado newspapers, beginning in Pueblo. His first job as a reporter was in September 1900, when he was hired by the &quot;Pueblo Star&quot;; he then worked in the Rocky Mountain area during the first decade of the 1900s: at the &quot;Denver Daily News&quot;, he served as &quot;sporting editor&quot; (today a &quot;sports editor&quot;) and then as a staff writer. His expertise was in covering the semi-professional teams in Colorado. He briefly managed a semi-pro team in Trinidad, Colorado. At one of the newspapers where he worked, the spelling of his last name was changed from &quot;Runyan&quot; to &quot;Runyon&quot;, a change he let stand.

After failing in an attempt to organize a Colorado minor baseball league, which lasted less than a week, Runyon moved to New York City in 1910. In his first New York byline, the &quot;American&quot; editor dropped the &quot;Alfred&quot; and the name &quot;Damon Runyon&quot; appeared for the first time. For the next ten years, he covered the New York Giants and professional boxing for the &quot;New York American&quot;.

He was the Hearst newspapers&#x27; baseball columnist for many years, beginning in 1911, and his knack for spotting the eccentric and the unusual, on the field or in the stands, is credited with revolutionizing the way baseball was covered. Perhaps as confirmation, Runyon was voted 1967 J. G. Taylor Spink Award by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA), for which he was honored at ceremonies at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in July 1968. He is also a member of the International Boxing Hall Of Fame and is known for dubbing heavyweight champion James J. Braddock the &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;. Runyon frequently contributed sports poems to the &quot;American&quot; on boxing and baseball themes and wrote numerous short stories and essays. 
==Gambling==
Gambling, particularly on craps or horse races, was a common theme of Runyon&#x27;s works, and he was a notorious gambler. One of his paraphrases from a line in Ecclesiastes ran: &quot;The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but that&#x27;s how the smart money bets.&quot;

A heavy drinker as a young man, he seems to have quit drinking soon after arriving in New York, after his drinking nearly cost him the courtship of the woman who became his first wife, Ellen Egan. He remained a heavy smoker.

His best friend was mobster accountant Otto Berman, and he incorporated Berman into several of his stories under the alias &quot;Regret, the horse player&quot;. When Berman was killed in a hit on Berman&#x27;s boss, Dutch Schultz, Runyon quickly assumed the role of damage control for his deceased friend, mostly by correcting erroneous press releases, including one that stated Berman was one of Schultz&#x27;s gunmen, to which Runyon replied, &quot;Otto would have been as effective a bodyguard as a two-year-old.&quot;

==Personal life==
While in New York City, Runyon courted and eventually married Ellen Egan. Their marriage produced two children, Mary and Damon Jr. A modern writer remarks that &quot;by contemporary standards, Runyon was a marginal husband and father.&quot; In 1928, Egan separated from Runyon permanently and moved to Bronxville with their children after hearing persistent rumors about her husband&#x27;s infidelities. As it became subsequently known, Runyon, in 1916, was covering the border raids of Mexican bandit Pancho Villa as a reporter for the &quot;American&quot; newspaper owned by William Randolph Hearst. He had first met Villa in Texas while covering spring training of the state&#x27;s teams. While in Mexico, Runyon visited one afternoon the Ciudad Juárez racetrack where Villa was present and placed a bet through a young messenger girl in Villa&#x27;s entourage. The 14-year-old girl, whose name was Patrice Amati del Grande, erroneously placed Runyon&#x27;s bet on a different horse that nonetheless won the race. She confided to the lucky bettor that she wanted to be a dancer when she grew up and Runyon told her that if, instead, she would attend school, for which he would pay, she could come after her graduation to see him in New York and he would get her a dancing job in the city; Runyon did indeed pay for her enrollment in the local convent school.

In 1925, 19-year-old Grande came to New York City looking for Runyon and found him through the &quot;American&quot;″s receptionist. The two became lovers and he found her work at local speakeasies. In 1928, after the separation between Runyon and Ellen Egan turned into a divorce, Runyon and Grande were married by his friend, city mayor Jimmy Walker. His former wife became an alcoholic and died in 1931 from a heart attack. In 1946, some time after Grande began an affair with a younger man, the couple got divorced.

==Death==

In late 1946, the same year he and his second wife were divorced, Runyon died, at age 66, in New York City from the throat cancer that had been diagnosed two years earlier, in 1944, when he underwent an unsuccessful operation that left him practically unable to speak. 

His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered from a DC-3 airplane over Broadway in Manhattan by Eddie Rickenbacker on December 18, 1946. This was an infringement of the law but widely approved. The family plot of Damon Runyon is located at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York.

Runyon, in his will, left to his former second wife his house in Florida, his racing stables, and the money from his insurance. He split in half the royalties from his works to his children and Grande. His daughter Mary was eventually institutionalized for alcoholism while his son Damon Jr., after working as a journalist in Washington, D.C., died by suicide in 1968.

==Legacy==
* After Runyon&#x27;s death, his friend and fellow journalist Walter Winchell went on his radio program and appealed for contributions to help fight cancer, eventually establishing the Damon Runyon Cancer Memorial Fund to support scientific research into causes of, and prevention of, cancer.
* The first-ever telethon was hosted by Milton Berle in 1949 to raise funds for the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation.
* Each year the Denver Press Club assigns the Damon Runyon Award to a prominent journalist. Past winners include Jimmy Breslin, Mike Royko, George Will and Bob Costas.
* Damon Runyon Elementary school in Littleton, Colorado is named after him.
* The Damon Runyon Stakes is a thoroughbred horse race run every December at Aqueduct Race Track. Runyon loved horse racing and ran a small stable of his own.
* In the mid-1930s, Runyon persuaded promoter Leo Seltzer to formally change his Roller Derby spectacle from a marathon roller-skating race into a full-contact team sport, an innovation that was eventually revived in a DIY spirit seven decades later.
* One block of West 45th Street (between 8th and 9th Avenues) in Manhattan&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Kitchen is named Runyon&#x27;s Way.
* The house in Manhattan, Kansas, where Runyon was born, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
* In 2008, The Library of America selected &quot;The Eternal Blonde&quot;, Runyon&#x27;s account of a 1927 murder trial, for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American Crime Writing.
* Until January 1944, the 515th B-24 bomber squadron &quot;Satan&#x27;s Kids&quot;, of the 376th Bomber Group named their bombers after Runyon &quot;Gangster&quot; characters,

==Literary style – the &quot;Broadway&quot; stories==
The English comedy writer Frank Muir comments that Runyon&#x27;s plots were, in the manner of O. Henry, neatly constructed with professionally wrought endings, but their distinction lay in the manner of their telling, as the author invented a peculiar argot for his characters to speak. Runyon almost totally avoids the past tense (English humorist E. C. Bentley thought there was only one instance and was willing to &quot;lay plenty of 6 to 5 that it is nothing but a misprint&quot;), and makes little use of the future tense, using the present for both. He also avoided the conditional, using instead the future indicative in situations that would normally require conditional. An example: &quot;Now most any doll on Broadway will be very glad indeed to have Handsome Jack Madigan give her a tumble&quot; (&quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Social error&quot;). Bentley comments that &quot;there is a sort of ungrammatical purity about it [Runyon&#x27;s resolute avoidance of the past tense], an almost religious exactitude.&quot; There is an homage to Runyon that makes use of this peculiarity (&quot;Chronic Offender&quot; by Spider Robinson), which involves a time machine and a man going by the name &quot;Harry the Horse&quot;.

He uses many slang terms (which go unexplained in his stories), such as:

* pineapple = pineapple grenade
* roscoe/john roscoe/the old equalizer/that thing = gun
* shiv = knife
* noggin = head
* snoot = nose

There are many recurring composite phrases such as:

* ever-loving wife (occasionally &quot;ever-loving doll&quot;)
* more than somewhat (or &quot;no little, and quite some&quot;); this phrase was so typical that it was used as the title of one of his short story collections
* loathe and despise
* one and all

Bentley notes that Runyon&#x27;s &quot;telling use of the recurrent phrase and fixed epithet&quot; demonstrates a debt to Homer.

Runyon&#x27;s stories also employ occasional rhyming slang, similar to the cockney variety but native to New York (e.g.: &quot;Miss Missouri Martin makes the following crack one night to her: &#x27;Well, I do not see any Simple Simon on your lean and linger.&#x27; This is Miss Missouri Martin&#x27;s way of saying she sees no diamond on Miss Billy Perry&#x27;s finger.&quot; (from &quot;Romance in the Roaring Forties&quot;)).

The comic effect of his style results partly from the juxtaposition of broad slang with mock pomposity. Women, when not &quot;dolls&quot;, &quot;Judies&quot;, &quot;pancakes&quot;, &quot;tomatoes&quot;, or &quot;broads&quot;, may be &quot;characters of a female nature&quot;, for example. He typically avoided contractions such as &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; in the example above, which also contributes significantly to the humorously pompous effect. In one sequence, a gangster tells another character to do as he is told, or else &quot;find another world in which to live&quot;.

In a contemporary introduction to &quot;The Damon Runyon Omnibus&quot;, the journalist Heywood Broun says that Runyon&#x27;s prose style is based on a real dialect spoken in 1930s New York City: &quot;He has caught with a high degree of insight the actual tone and phrase of the gangsters and racketeers of the town. Their talk is put down almost literally... Runyon has exercised the privilege of selectivity. But he has not heightened or burlesqued the speech of the people who come alive in his short stories.&quot;

Runyon&#x27;s short stories are told in the first person by a protagonist who is never named and whose role is unclear; he knows many gangsters and does not appear to have a job, but he does not admit to any criminal involvement, and seems to be largely a bystander. He describes himself as &quot;being known to one and all as a guy who is just around&quot;. The radio program &quot;The Damon Runyon Theatre&quot; dramatized 52 of Runyon&#x27;s works in 1949, and for these the protagonist was given the name &quot;Broadway&quot;, although it was admitted that this was not his real name, much in the way &quot;Harry the Horse&quot; and &quot;Sorrowful Jones&quot; are aliases.

===Stories===
There are many collections of Runyon&#x27;s stories, in particular &quot;Runyon on Broadway&quot; and &quot;Runyon from First to Last&quot;. A publisher&#x27;s note in the latter claims that collection contains all of Runyon&#x27;s short stories not included in &quot;Runyon on Broadway&quot;, but two Broadway stories originally published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; are not in either collection: &quot;Maybe a Queen&quot; and &quot;Leopard&#x27;s Spots&quot;, both collected in &quot;More Guys And Dolls&quot; (1950). The radio show, in addition, has a story, &quot;Joe Terrace&quot;, that appears in &#x27;More Guys and Dolls&#x27; and the August 29, 1936, issue of &quot;Colliers&quot;. It is one of his &quot;Our Town&quot; stories that does not appear in the &quot;In Our Town&quot; book, and the only episode of the show which is not a Broadway&#x27; story, however, the action is changed in the show from Our Town to Broadway.

The &quot;Our Town&quot; stories are short vignettes of life in a small town, largely based on Runyon&#x27;s experiences. They are written in a simple, descriptive style and contain twists and odd endings based on the personalities of the people involved. Each story&#x27;s title is the name of the principal character. Twenty-seven of them were published in the 1946 book &quot;In Our Town&quot;.

===Film===

Twenty of his stories became motion pictures.
*&quot;Lady for a Day&quot; (1933) – Adapted by Robert Riskin, who suggested the name change from Runyon&#x27;s title &quot;Madame La Gimp&quot;. The film garnered Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actress (May Robson), and Best Adaptation for the Screen (Riskin). It was remade by Capra as &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; in 1961, with Bette Davis in the Apple Annie role (fused with the &quot;raggedy doll&quot; from Runyon&#x27;s short story &quot;The Brain Goes Home&quot;); Frank Sinatra recorded the upbeat title song (his rendition is not used in the film). The film received Oscar nominations for composers Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen and for co-star Peter Falk (Best Supporting Actor). In 1989, Jackie Chan adapted the story yet again for the Hong Kong action film &quot;Miracles&quot;, adding several of his trademark stunt sequences.
*&quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; (1934) – The film that made Shirley Temple a star, launched her career, and pushed her past Greta Garbo as the nation&#x27;s biggest film draw of the year. Also starred Charles Bickford. Subsequent remakes include &quot;Sorrowful Jones&quot; (1949) with Bob Hope and Lucille Ball; &quot;40 Pounds of Trouble&quot; (1962) with Tony Curtis, and &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; (1980) with Walter Matthau, Julie Andrews, Bob Newhart and Curtis.
*&quot;The Lemon Drop Kid&quot; (1934) – Starring Lee Tracy, remade in 1951 with Bob Hope (and &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; co-star William Frawley appearing in both adaptations); the latter version introduced the Christmas song &quot;Silver Bells&quot;.
*&quot;Princess O&#x27;Hara&quot; (1935) – Starring Jean Parker, remade in 1943 as &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Hay&quot; with Abbott and Costello and Patsy O&#x27;Connor
*&quot;Professional Soldier&quot; (1935) – an adventure story starring Victor McLaglen and Freddie Bartholomew
*&quot;A Slight Case of Murder&quot; (1938) with Edward G. Robinson – remade in 1953 as &quot;Stop, You&#x27;re Killing Me&quot; with Broderick Crawford and Claire Trevor
*&quot;Joe and Ethel Turp Call on the President&quot; (1939) with Ann Sothern, Lewis Stone and Walter Brennan.
*&quot;The Big Street&quot; (1942) – Henry Fonda, Lucille Ball (adapted from Runyon&#x27;s story &quot;Little Pinks&quot;)
*&quot;Butch Minds the Baby&quot; (1942) – Broderick Crawford, Shemp Howard
*&quot;Johnny One-Eye&quot; – (1950) Starring Pat O&#x27;Brien, Wayne Morris, Delores Moran, and Gayle Reed
*&quot;Money from Home&quot; (1953) – Starring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis
*&quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955) – Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, Frank Sinatra, Vivian Blaine, and Stubby Kaye. Blaine and Kaye reprised their roles from the 1950 Broadway production. Adapted from the story &quot;The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown&quot;. The big craps game is adapted from the story &quot;Blood Pressure&quot;.
*&quot;Bloodhounds of Broadway&quot; (1952) – Musical comedy starring Mitzi Gaynor and directed by Harmon Jones
*&quot;Bloodhounds of Broadway&quot; (1989) – Ensemble cast starring Matt Dillon, Jennifer Grey, Madonna, and Julie Hagerty, among others. The film combines elements from four stories into one large one: &quot;A Very Honorable Guy&quot;, &quot;The Brain Goes Home&quot;, &quot;Social Error&quot;, and &quot;The Bloodhounds of Broadway&quot;.

In 1938, his unproduced play &quot;Saratoga Chips&quot; became the basis of The Ritz Brothers film &quot;Straight, Place and Show&quot;.

===Plays and musicals===
*&quot;A Slight Case of Murder&quot; (1935) co-written for Broadway with Howard Lindsay
*&quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1950) starring Robert Alda (Sky Masterson), Vivian Blaine (Miss Adelaide), Sam Levene (Nathan Detroit), Isabel Bigley (Sarah Brown), Pat Rooney Sr., B.S. Pully, Stubby Kaye, Johnny Silver, Tom Pedi. Adapted from Runyon&#x27;s stories &quot;The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown&quot; and &quot;Blood Pressure&quot;.

===Radio===
&quot;The Damon Runyon Theater&quot; radio series dramatized 52 of Runyon&#x27;s short stories in weekly broadcasts running from October 1948 to September 1949 (with reruns until 1951). The series was produced by Alan Ladd&#x27;s Mayfair Transcription Company for syndication to local radio stations. John Brown played the character &quot;Broadway&quot;, who doubled as host and narrator. The cast also comprised Alan Reed, Luis Van Rooten, Joseph Du Val, Gerald Mohr, Frank Lovejoy, Herb Vigran, Sheldon Leonard, William Conrad, Jeff Chandler, Lionel Stander, Sidney Miller, Olive Deering and Joe De Santis. Pat O&#x27;Brien was initially engaged for the role of &quot;Broadway&quot;. The original stories were adapted for the radio by Russell Hughes.

&quot;Broadway&#x27;s New York had a crisis each week, though the streets had a rose-tinged aura&quot;, wrote radio historian John Dunning. &quot;The sad shows then were all the sadder; plays like &quot;For a Pal&quot; had a special poignance. The bulk of Runyon&#x27;s work had been untapped by radio, and the well was deep.&quot;

===Television===
&quot;Damon Runyon Theatre&quot; aired on CBS-TV from 1955 to 1956.

Mike McShane told Runyon stories as monologues on British TV in 1994, and an accompanying book was released, both titled &quot;Broadway Stories&quot;.

&quot;Three Wise Guys&quot; was a 2005 TV movie.

Encyclopædia Britannica said &quot;few of his admirers know that many characters and incidents in Runyon&#x27;s stories were suggested by Pueblo people and experiences.&quot;</text><links>

<text>Devo is an American new wave band from Akron, Ohio, formed in 1973. Their classic line-up consisted of two sets of brothers, the Mothersbaughs (Mark and Bob) and the Casales (Gerald and Bob), along with Alan Myers. The band had a No. 14 &quot;Billboard&quot; chart hit in 1980 with the single &quot;Whip It&quot;, the song that gave the band mainstream popularity.

Devo&#x27;s music and visual presentation (including stage shows and costumes) mingle kitsch science fiction themes, deadpan surrealist humor and mordantly satirical social commentary. The band&#x27;s namesake, the tongue-in-cheek social theory of &quot;de-evolution&quot;, was an integral concept in their early work, which was marked by experimental and dissonant art punk that merged rock music with electronics. Their output in the 1980s embraced synth-pop and a more mainstream, less conceptual style, though the band&#x27;s satirical and quirky humor remained intact. Their music has proven influential on subsequent movements, particularly on new wave, industrial, and alternative rock artists. Devo (most enthusiastically Gerald Casale) was also a pioneer of the music video format.

== History ==
=== 1973–1978: Formation ===
The name &quot;Devo&quot; comes from the concept of &quot;de-evolution&quot; and the band&#x27;s related idea that instead of continuing to evolve, mankind had begun to regress, as evidenced by the dysfunction and herd mentality of American society. In the late 1960s, this idea was developed as a joke by Kent State University art students Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis, who created a number of satirical art pieces in a devolution vein. At this time, Casale had also performed with the local band 15-60-75 (The Numbers Band). They met Mark Mothersbaugh around 1970, a talented keyboardist who had been playing with the band Flossy Bobbitt. Mothersbaugh brought a more humorous feel to the band, introducing them to material like the pamphlet &quot;Jocko Homo Heavenbound&quot;, which includes an illustration of a winged devil labelled &quot;D-EVOLUTION&quot; and would later inspire the song &quot;Jocko Homo&quot;. The &quot;joke&quot; about de-evolution became serious following the Kent State massacre of May 4, 1970. This event would be cited multiple times as the impetus for forming the band Devo. Throughout the band&#x27;s career, they have often been considered a &quot;joke band&quot; by the music press.

The first form of Devo was the &quot;Sextet Devo&quot; which performed at the 1973 Kent State performing arts festival. It included Casale, Lewis and Mothersbaugh, as well as Gerald&#x27;s brother Bob Casale on guitar, and friends Rod Reisman and Fred Weber on drums and vocals, respectively. This performance was filmed and an excerpt was later included on the home video release &quot;The Complete Truth About De-Evolution&quot;. This lineup performed only once. Devo returned to perform in the Student Governance Center (featured prominently in the film) at the 1974 Creative Arts Festival with a lineup including the Casale brothers, Bob Lewis, Mark Mothersbaugh, and Jim Mothersbaugh on drums.
The band continued to perform, generally as a quartet, but with a fluid lineup including Mark&#x27;s brothers Bob Mothersbaugh and Jim Mothersbaugh. Bob played electric guitar, and Jim provided percussion using a set of home-made electronic drums. Their first two music videos, &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot; and &quot;Jocko Homo&quot;, which both appeared in &quot;The Truth About De-Evolution&quot;, were filmed in Akron, and Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the hometown of most members. This lineup of Devo lasted until late 1975 when Jim left the band. Lewis would sometimes play guitar during this period, but mainly stayed in a managerial role. In concert, Devo would often perform in the guise of theatrical characters, such as Booji Boy and the Chinaman. A recording of an early Devo performance from 1975 with the quartet lineup appears on &quot;Devo Live: The Mongoloid Years&quot; (1992), ending with the promoters unplugging Devo&#x27;s equipment.

Following Jim Mothersbaugh&#x27;s departure, Bob Mothersbaugh found a new drummer, Alan Myers, who played on a conventional, acoustic drum kit. Casale re-recruited his brother Bob Casale, and the lineup of Devo remained the same for nearly ten years.

Devo gained some fame in 1976 when their short film &quot;The Truth About De-Evolution&quot;, directed by Chuck Statler, won a prize at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. This attracted the attention of David Bowie, who began work to get the band a recording contract with Warner Music Group. In 1977, Devo were asked by Neil Young to participate in the making of his film &quot;Human Highway&quot;. Released in 1982, the film featured the band as &quot;nuclear garbagemen&quot;. The band members were asked to write their own parts and Mark Mothersbaugh scored and recorded much of the soundtrack, his first of many.

In March 1977, Devo released their first single, &quot;Mongoloid&quot; backed with &quot;Jocko Homo&quot;, the B-side of which came from the soundtrack to &quot;The Truth About De-Evolution&quot;, on their independent label Booji Boy. This was followed by a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;.

In 1978, the &quot;B Stiff&quot; EP was released by British independent label Stiff, which included the single &quot;Be Stiff&quot; plus two previous Booji Boy releases. &quot;Mechanical Man&quot;, a 4-track 7-inch extended play (EP) of demos, an apparent bootleg, but actually put out by the band, was also released that year.

=== 1978–1980: Recording contract, &quot;Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!&quot;, and &quot;Duty Now for the Future&quot; ===

Recommendations from David Bowie and Iggy Pop enabled Devo to secure a recording contract with Warner Bros. in 1978. After Bowie backed out of the business deal due to previous commitments, their first album, &quot;Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!&quot;, was produced by Brian Eno and featured rerecordings of their previous singles &quot;Mongoloid&quot; and &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;. On October 14, 1978, Devo gained national exposure with an appearance on the late-night show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a week after the Rolling Stones, performing &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; and &quot;Jocko Homo&quot;.

The band followed up with &quot;Duty Now for the Future&quot; in 1979, which moved the band more towards electronic instrumentation. While not as successful as their first album, it did produce some fan favorites with the songs &quot;Blockhead&quot; and &quot;The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize&quot; , as well as a cover of the Johnny Rivers hit &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot;. &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot; had been recorded first in 1974 for Devo&#x27;s first film and performed live as early as 1976. In 1979, Devo traveled to Japan for the first time, and a live show from this tour was partially recorded. Devo appeared on &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot; in 1979, performing &quot;Blockhead&quot;, &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot;, &quot;Uncontrollable Urge&quot;, and &quot;Mongoloid&quot;. Also in 1979, Rhino, in conjunction with the Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, released &quot;Devotees&quot;, a tribute album. It contained a set of covers of Devo songs interspersed with renditions of popular songs in Devo&#x27;s style.

Devo actively embraced the parody religion Church of the SubGenius. In concert, Devo sometimes performed as their own opening act, pretending to be a Christian soft rock band called &quot;Dove (the Band of Love)&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;Devo&quot;. They appeared as Dove in the 1980 televangelism spoof film &quot;Pray TV&quot;.

=== 1980–1982: Mainstream breakthrough, &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;, and &quot;New Traditionalists&quot; ===
Devo gained a new level of visibility with 1980&#x27;s &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;. This album included their best-known hit, &quot;Whip It&quot;, which quickly became a Top 40 hit. The album moved to an almost completely electronic sound, with the exception of acoustic drums and Bob Mothersbaugh&#x27;s guitar. The tour for &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; was ambitious for the band, including dates in Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Canada. The band used a minimalist set including large custom light boxes which could be laid on their back to form a second, smaller stage during the second half of the set. Other popular songs from &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; were &quot;Girl U Want&quot;, the title-track, and &quot;Gates of Steel&quot;. The band released popular music videos for &quot;Whip It&quot; and &quot;Girl U Want&quot;. Devo made three appearances on the TV show &quot;Fridays&quot; in 1980 and 1981, as well as on &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, and other shows. The band members often wore red, terraced energy dome hats as part of its stage outfit. The dome was first worn during the band&#x27;s &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; campaign of 1980. It reappeared in the 1981, 1982, and 1988 tours, as well as in most of their performances since 1997. Devo also recorded two albums of their own songs as elevator music for their fan club, Club Devo, released on cassette in 1981 and 1984. These were later re-released on the album &quot;E-Z Listening Disc&quot; (1987), with all but two of the original Club Devo songs. These songs were often played as house music before Devo concerts.

In August 1981, the band&#x27;s &quot;DEV-O Live&quot; EP spent three weeks at the top of the Australian charts. In 1982, they toured Australia and appeared on the TV show &quot;Countdown&quot;. Devo enjoyed continued popularity in Australia, where the nationally broadcast 1970s–1980s pop TV show &quot;Countdown&quot; was one of the first programs in the world to broadcast their video clips. They were given consistent radio support by Sydney-based non-commercial rock station Double Jay (2JJ) and Brisbane-based independent community station Triple Zed (4ZZZ), two of the first rock stations outside America to play their recordings. The late-night music program &quot;Nightmoves&quot; aired &quot;The Truth About De-Evolution&quot;.

In 1981, Devo contributed a cover of &quot;Working in the Coal Mine&quot;, recorded during the &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; sessions, to the film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. They offered the song to be used in the film when Warner Bros. refused to include it on the album. Warner then included it as an independent bonus single accompanying their 1981 release, &quot;New Traditionalists&quot;. For this album Devo wore self-described &quot;Utopian Boy Scout uniforms&quot; topped with a &quot;New Traditionalist Pomp&quot;—a plastic half-wig modeled on the hairstyle of John F. Kennedy. Among the singles from the album was &quot;Through Being Cool&quot;, written as a reaction to their new-found fame from &quot;Whip It&quot; and seen as a response to new fans who had misinterpreted the message behind the hit song. The album&#x27;s accompanying tour featured the band performing an intensely physical show with treadmills and a large Greek temple set. That same year they served as Toni Basil&#x27;s backing band on &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;, her debut album, which included versions of three Devo songs, recorded with Basil singing lead.

=== 1982–1987: &quot;Oh, No! It&#x27;s Devo&quot;, &quot;Shout&quot;, and Myers&#x27; departure ===
&quot;Oh, No! It&#x27;s Devo&quot; followed in 1982. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker, the album featured a more synth-pop-oriented sound than its predecessors. According to Gerald Casale, the album&#x27;s sound was inspired by reviewers alternately describing them as both &quot;fascists&quot; and &quot;clowns&quot;. The album&#x27;s tour featured the band performing seven songs in front of a 12-foot high rear-projection screen with synchronized video, an image recreated using blue screen effects in the album&#x27;s accompanying music videos. Devo also contributed two songs, &quot;Theme from Doctor Detroit&quot; and &quot;Luv-Luv&quot;, to the 1983 Dan Aykroyd film &quot;Doctor Detroit&quot;, and produced a music video for &quot;Theme from Doctor Detroit&quot; featuring clips from the film interspersed with live-action segments.

The band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Shout&quot; (1984), which featured extensive use of the Fairlight CMI digital sampling synthesizer, was received poorly, and the expensive music video they&#x27;d produced for their cover of the Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; was criticized by some as being &quot;disrespectful&quot;, all of which caused Warner Bros. to buy out the remainder of Devo&#x27;s contract. Shortly thereafter, Myers left the band, citing creative unfulfillment.

In the interim, Mark Mothersbaugh began composing music for the TV show &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; and released an elaborately packaged solo cassette, &quot;Musik for Insomniaks&quot;, which was later expanded and released as two CDs in 1988.

=== 1987–1991: &quot;Total Devo&quot;, &quot;Smooth Noodle Maps&quot;, and breakup ===
In 1987, Devo re-formed with former Sparks drummer David Kendrick to replace Myers. Their first project was a soundtrack for the horror film &quot;Slaughterhouse Rock&quot; (1988), starring Toni Basil. The band released the album &quot;Total Devo&quot; in 1988, on Enigma Records. This album included two songs used in the &quot;Slaughterhouse Rock&quot; soundtrack. The song &quot;Baby Doll&quot; was used that same year in the comedy film &quot;Tapeheads&quot;, with newly recorded Swedish lyrics, and was credited to (and shown in a music video by) a fictitious Swedish band called Cube-Squared. Devo followed this up with a world tour, and released the live album &quot;Now It Can Be Told: Devo at the Palace&quot; in 1989. However, &quot;Total Devo&quot; was not a commercial success and received poor critical reviews.

In 1989, members of Devo were involved in the project Visiting Kids, releasing a self-titled EP on the New Rose label in 1990. The band featured Mark&#x27;s then-wife Nancye Ferguson, as well as David Kendrick, Bob Mothersbaugh, and Bob&#x27;s daughter Alex Mothersbaugh. Their record was produced by Bob Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh, and Mark also co-wrote some of the songs. Visiting Kids appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Rockula&quot;, as well as on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. A promotional video was filmed for the song &quot;Trilobites&quot;.

In 1990, &quot;Smooth Noodle Maps&quot;, Devo&#x27;s last album for twenty years, was released. It too was a critical and commercial failure which, along with its two singles &quot;Stuck in a Loop&quot; and &quot;Post Post-Modern Man&quot;, were Devo&#x27;s worst-selling efforts; all failed to appear on the U.S. charts. Devo launched a concert tour in support of the album, but poor ticket sales and the bankruptcy and dissolution of Enigma Records, which was responsible for organizing and financing the tour, caused it to be cancelled part way through.

In 1990, the members of Devo, bar Bob Mothersbaugh, appeared in the film &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;. Two albums of demo recordings from 1974 to 1977, namely &quot;Hardcore Devo: Volume One&quot; (1990) and &quot;Hardcore Devo: Volume Two&quot; (1991), were released on Rykodisc, as well as an album of early live recordings, &quot;Devo Live: The Mongoloid Years&quot; (1992).

The band played one final show in March 1991 before breaking up. In an interview with Mark Mothersbaugh concerning their 1996 computer game &quot;Devo Presents Adventures of the Smart Patrol&quot;, he explained, &quot;Around &#x27;88, &#x27;89, &#x27;90 maybe, we did our last tour in Europe, and it was kind of at that point, We were watching &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; on the bus and said, &#x27;Oh my God, that&#x27;s our life.&#x27; And we just said, &#x27;Things have to change.&#x27; So we kind of agreed from there that we wouldn&#x27;t do live shows anymore.&quot;

=== 1991–1996: Hiatus ===
Following the split, Mark Mothersbaugh established Mutato Muzika, a commercial music production studio, along with Bob Mothersbaugh and Bob Casale. Mothersbaugh meant to further a career as a composer, and the latter worked as an audio engineer. Mothersbaugh has had considerable success writing and producing music for television programs, including &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; and &quot;Rugrats&quot;, video games, cartoons, and films, where he worked alongside director Wes Anderson. David Kendrick also worked at Mutato for a period during the early 1990s. Gerald Casale began a career as a director of music videos and commercials, working with bands including Rush, Soundgarden, Silverchair and the Foo Fighters. In the wake of Devo&#x27;s dissolution, Bob Mothersbaugh attempted to start a solo career with The Bob I Band, recording an album that was never released. The tapes for this are now lost, though a bootleg recording of the band in concert exists and can be obtained through the bootleg aggregator Booji Boy&#x27;s Basement.

While they did not release any studio albums during this period, Devo sporadically reconvened to record a number of songs for various films and compilations, including a new recording of &quot;Girl U Want&quot; on the soundtrack to the 1995 film &quot;Tank Girl&quot; and a cover of the Nine Inch Nails hit &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; for the 1996 North American version of the film &quot;Supercop&quot;.

=== 1996–2007: Reunion ===
In January 1996, Devo performed a reunion concert at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The band performed on part of the 1996 Lollapalooza tour in the rotating Mystery Spot. On these tours and most subsequent tours, Devo performed a set-list mostly composed of material from between 1978 and 1982, ignoring their Enigma Records-era material. Also in 1996, Devo released a multimedia CD-ROM adventure game, &quot;Adventures of the Smart Patrol&quot; with Inscape. The game was not a success, but the Lollapalooza tour was received well enough to allow Devo to return in 1997 as a headliner. Devo performed sporadically from 1997 onwards.

In 1999, the &quot;Oh, No! It&#x27;s Devo&quot; era outtakes &quot;Faster and Faster&quot; and &quot;One Dumb Thing&quot;, as well as the &quot;Shout&quot; era outtake &quot;Modern Life&quot;, were restored, completed and used in the video game &quot;Interstate &#x27;82&quot;, developed by Activision and released. Also that year, Mothersbaugh started the Devo side-project The Wipeouters, after their band in junior high, featuring himself (keyboards, organ), Bob Mothersbaugh (guitar), Bob Casale (guitar), and Mutato Muzika composer Josh Mancell (drums). The Wipeouters performed the theme song to the Nickelodeon animated series &quot;Rocket Power&quot;, and in 2001 they released an album of surf rock material, titled &quot;P&#x27;Twaaang!!!&quot;.

Around this same time, Devo&#x27;s online fandom continued to grow, leading to &#x27;Devotional&#x27;, a Devo fan convention held annually in Cleveland, Ohio. The festival was most recently held in September 2022.

In 2005, Devo recorded a new version of &quot;Whip It&quot; to be used in Swiffer television commercials, a decision they have said they regretted. During an interview with the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot;, Gerald Casale said, &quot;It&#x27;s just aesthetically offensive. It&#x27;s got everything a commercial that turns people off has.&quot; The song &quot;Beautiful World&quot; was also used in a re-recorded form for an advertisement for Target stores. Due to rights issues with their back catalog, Devo has re-recorded songs for films and advertisements.

In 2005, Gerald Casale announced his &quot;solo&quot; project, Jihad Jerry &amp; the Evildoers (the Evildoers, including the other members of Devo), and released the first EP, &quot;Army Girls Gone Wild&quot; in 2006. A full-length album, &quot;Mine Is Not a Holy War&quot;, was released on September 12, 2006, after a several-month delay. It featured mostly new material, plus re-recordings of four obscure Devo songs: &quot;I Need a Chick&quot; and &quot;I Been Refused&quot; (from &quot;Hardcore Devo: Volume Two&quot;), &quot;Find Out&quot; (which appeared on the single and EP of &quot;Peek-a-Boo!&quot; in 1982), and &quot;Beehive&quot; (which was recorded by the band in 1974, whereupon it was apparently abandoned, with the exception of one appearance at a special show in 2001). Devo continued to tour actively in 2005 and 2006, unveiling a new stage show at appearances in October 2006, with the Jihad Jerry character performing &quot;Beautiful World&quot; as an encore.

Also in 2006, Devo worked on a project with Disney known as Devo 2.0. A band of child performers was assembled and re-recorded Devo songs. A quote from the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; stated, &quot;Devo recently finished a new project in cahoots with Disney called Devo 2.0, which features the band playing old songs and two new ones with vocals provided by children. Their debut album, a two disc CD/DVD combo entitled &quot;DEV2.0&quot;, was released on March 14, 2006. The lyrics of some of the songs were changed for family-friendly airplay, which has been claimed by the band to be a play on irony of the messages of their classic hits.&quot;
In an April 2007 interview, Gerald Casale mentioned a tentative project for a biographical film about Devo&#x27;s early days. According to Casale, a script was supposedly in development, called &quot;The Beginning Was the End&quot;. Devo played their first European tour since 1990 in the summer of 2007, including a performance at Festival Internacional de Benicàssim.

=== 2007–2013: &quot;Something for Everybody&quot; ===
In December 2007, Devo released their first new single since 1990, &quot;Watch Us Work It&quot;, which was featured in a commercial for Dell. The song features a sampled drum track from the &quot;New Traditionalists&quot; song &quot;The Super Thing&quot;. Casale said that the song was chosen from a batch that the band was working on, and that it was the closest the band had been to releasing a new album.
Devo performed at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in March 2009, unveiling a new stage show with synchronized video backdrops (similar to the 1982 tour), new costumes, and three new songs: &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot, I&#x27;m a Man!&quot;, &quot;What We Do&quot;, and &quot;Fresh&quot;. On September 16, Warner Bros. and Devo announced rereleases of &quot;Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!&quot; and &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;, as well as a subsequent tour, where they would perform both albums in their entirety.

A new album, &quot;Something for Everybody&quot;, was eventually released on June 15, 2010, preceded by a 12-inch single of &quot;Fresh&quot;/&quot;What We Do&quot; on June 10. Devo was awarded the first Moog Innovator Award on October 29, during Moogfest 2010 in Asheville, North Carolina. The Moog Innovator Award has been said to celebrate &quot;pioneering artists whose genre-defying work exemplifies the bold, innovative spirit of Bob Moog&quot;. Devo was scheduled to perform at Moogfest, but Bob Mothersbaugh severely injured his hand three days prior, and the band was forced to cancel. Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale collaborated with Austin-based band the Octopus Project to perform &quot;Girl U Want&quot; and &quot;Beautiful World&quot; at the event instead.

The band split from Warner Bros in 2012 and launched a new &quot;post-Warner Brothers&quot; website that would offer &quot;new protective gear&quot; and &quot;unreleased material from the archives in vinyl disc format&quot;. In August of that year, the band released a single called &quot;Don&#x27;t Roof Rack Me, Bro (Seamus Unleashed)&quot;, dedicated to the Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney&#x27;s former pet dog Seamus. The title refers to the Mitt Romney dog incident of 1983, when Romney travelled twelve hours with the dog in a crate on his car&#x27;s roof rack.

On June 24, 2013, the group&#x27;s former drummer Alan Myers died of stomach cancer in Los Angeles, California. He was 58. News reports at the time of his death incorrectly cited brain cancer as the cause. One month later, Devo released their &quot;Something Else for Everybody&quot; album, which collected &quot;Unreleased Demos and Focus Group Rejects&quot; from 2006–2009. Gerald Casale had earlier teased the album in a 2012 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

=== 2014: Hardcore Devo Tour, Bob Casale&#x27;s death ===
On February 17, 2014, founding member Bob Casale died of heart failure at age 61. Shortly afterwards, the group, a quartet for the first time in 38 years, embarked on their Hardcore Devo Tour, a ten-show tour across the US and Canada between June 18 and July 2, 2014. The tour focused on material the group had written before the release of their first album, which was largely written when the group were a quartet. Partial proceeds for the ten shows went to support Bob Casale&#x27;s family after his sudden death. The show featured the group performing material written during 1974–1977. The June 28 Oakland show was filmed and later released as the concert film &quot;Hardcore Devo Live!&quot;, released on Blu-ray, DVD, and Video on Demand on February 10, 2015, accompanied by CD and double-vinyl audio releases.

=== 2014–present: Current activities ===
Immediately following from the Hardcore tour, Devo continued to tour a &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; style show. Josh Hager joined the band at this time, playing guitar and keyboards. On April 29, 2016, Devo performed at Will Ferrell and Chad Smith&#x27;s Red Hot Benefit.

On May 22, Robert Mothersbaugh Sr., father of Mark, Bob, and Jim Mothersbaugh, died. Robert portrayed General Boy in various Devo films.

In 2017, the official Twitter account for the &quot;Are We Not Men?&quot; documentary film, which had been in production since 2009, stated that &quot;the film was finished years ago&quot; and that &quot;mm [Mark Mothersbaugh] is blocking its release&quot;. Jeff Winner, who was consulting producer for the Devo documentary, went on to state that he and director Tony Pemberton had &quot;delivered the film that was contracted, and on schedule. It&#x27;s now in the hands of the band to decide when/how it&#x27;s released/distributed.&quot;

Devo headlined the Burger Boogaloo festival in Oakland, California, on June 30, 2018, with comedian and former Trenchmouth drummer Fred Armisen on drums. On October 12, 2020, Devo performed at the Desert Daze festival, with Jeff Friedl on drums.

In January 2021, Funko released two Devo Funko Pops inspired by the group&#x27;s &quot;Whip It&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot; music videos. One month later, the band starred in &quot;Devolution: A Devo Theory&quot;, a television documentary based entirely on their theory of devolution, which had been completed in 2020. In September, Devo performed a short three-date tour of the USA, including a show at Riot Fest. These performances marked the return of Josh Freese on drums, who had not played live with Devo in over five years.

Shortly afterwards, Gerald Casale announced the release of an official Devo potato-based vodka through the Trust Me Vodka brand. The packaging for the drink was themed around Devo imagery and featured original artwork. It was signed by the group&#x27;s co-founders Gerald Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh, as well as Bob Mothersbaugh.

On October 24, 2021, John Hinckley Jr posted on Twitter that he had not received any royalties for Devo&#x27;s song &quot;I Desire&quot; in 35 years. &quot;I Desire&quot; had been written by Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale for their 1982 album &quot;Oh, No! It&#x27;s Devo&quot;, inspired by a poem written by Hinckley that was published in a tabloid newspaper, following his attempt to assassinate then-current president Ronald Reagan. Hinckley had been adequately credited for his contributions through a co-writing credit on all releases. Casale claimed that Devo were not at fault, as it was the publishing company&#x27;s duty to pay him, not the band&#x27;s.

Devotional 2021, an annual convention for Devo fans, was held on November 5–6, with the annual 5KDEVO race taking place on the 7th. On November 15, it was announced that Devo would perform a one-off show at the Rooftop at Pier 17 on May 18, 2022, in order to make up for their cancelled Radio City Music Hall gig in September 2021. Tickets went on sale on the 18th.

In December, it was announced that rare images of Devo would feature in a book of rock photography from 1977–1980 titled &quot;HARD + FAST&quot;, to be released on February 1, 2022. The book will also include a 7-inch single of live recordings from the band, which were also released on SoundCloud prior to the book&#x27;s release. The recordings were dated 1977, but the performances are identical to those found on an audience bootleg recorded on October 10, 1978.

Devo were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, 2021 and 2022.

On May 14 and 15, 2022, Devo performed at the Cruel World Festival at the Rose Bowl&#x27;s Brookside golf course in Pasadena, California, followed three days later by their performance at The Rooftop at Pier 17.

In a February 20, 2023, article by the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; promoting the film &quot;Cocaine Bear&quot;, Mothersbaugh announced that the group would celebrate the year as their 50th anniversary, and that he had plans for Devo to remain active for 50 more years. He also stated that he, Gerald Casale and Bob Mothersbaugh were all interested in touring. This was followed by the announcement of a European tour, taking place between August 8th and 19th of 2023, with shows at London&#x27;s Eventim Apollo, Øyafestivalen in Norway, Way Out West festival in Sweden, Flow Festival in Finland, Green Man Festival in Wales, and Luna Fest in Portugal. This was followed in November and December by a string of shows in the USA and Australia.On January 21st, 2024, &quot;Devo,&quot; a Chris Smith directed documentary on the band premiered at Sundance Film Festival, with the group performing at the event. The film was produced and financed by BMG, Fremantle Documentaries, and Warner Music Entertainment, and according to a statement by the band &quot;explores Devo&#x27;s evolution from hippie artistes to art-rockers with a message, to their unexpected mainstream success as a hit rock band and the pioneers of the MTV age,&quot; following the group&#x27;s career arc up to its status as &quot;elder statesmen&quot;. Smith was executive producer on &quot;Tiger King&quot;, which had been scored by Mark Mothersbaugh, with Bob Mothersbaugh co-scoring its first season.

Between May 4th and 26th, Devo underwent another short US tour, including a show at the Andy Warhol Museum and at this same time, Mothersbaugh released an art book titled &quot;Apotropaic Beatnik Graffiti.&quot; On the June 5th, 2024, a collaboration between David Byrne and Devo was released. The recording was an early version of Byrne&#x27;s song &quot;Empire,&quot; recorded during the sessions for his 1997 &quot;Feelings&quot; album, seven years before the song appeared on his &quot;Grown Backwards&quot; album.

<text>Dale Chihuly ( ; born September 20, 1941) is an American glass artist and entrepreneur. He is well known in the field of blown glass, &quot;moving it into the realm of large-scale sculpture&quot;.

== Early life ==
Dale Patrick Chihuly was born on September 20, 1941, in Tacoma, Washington. His parents were George and Viola Chihuly; his paternal grandfather was born in Slovakia. In 1957, his older brother and only sibling George died in a Navy aviation training accident in Pensacola, Florida. In 1958, Chihuly&#x27;s father died of a heart attack at the age of 51.

Chihuly had no interest in continuing his formal education after graduating from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1959. However, at his mother&#x27;s urging, he enrolled at the College of Puget Sound. A year later, he transferred to the University of Washington in Seattle to study interior design. In 1961, he joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Kappa Epsilon chapter), and the same year he learned how to melt and fuse glass. In 1962, Chihuly dropped out of the university to study art in Florence. He later traveled to the Middle East where he met architect Robert Landsman. Their meeting and his time abroad spurred Chihuly to return to his studies. In 1963, he took a weaving class where he incorporated glass shards into tapestries. He received an award for his work from the Seattle Weavers Guild in 1964. Chihuly graduated from the University of Washington in 1965 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in interior design.

Chihuly began experimenting with glassblowing in 1965, and in 1966 he received a full scholarship to attend the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He studied under Harvey Littleton, who had established the first glass program in the United States at the university. In 1967, Chihuly received a Master of Science degree in sculpture. After graduating, he enrolled at the Rhode Island School of Design, where he met and became close friends with Italo Scanga. Chihuly earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in sculpture from the RISD in 1968. That same year, he was awarded a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation grant for his work in glass, as well as a Fulbright Fellowship. He traveled to Venice to work at the Venini factory on the island of Murano, where he first saw the team approach to blowing glass. After returning to the United States, Chihuly spent the first of four consecutive summers teaching at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, Maine. In 1969, he traveled to Europe, in part to meet Erwin Eisch in Germany and Stanislav Libenský and Jaroslava Brychtová in Czechoslovakia.
Chihuly donated a portion of a large exhibit to his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin, in 1997 and it is on permanent display in the Kohl Center. In 2013 the university awarded him an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts.

==Career==

In 1971, with the support of John Hauberg and Anne Gould Hauberg, Chihuly co-founded the Pilchuck Glass School near Stanwood, Washington. Chihuly also founded the HillTop Artists program in Tacoma, Washington at Hilltop Heritage Middle School and Wilson High School.

In 1976, while Chihuly was in England, he was involved in a head-on car accident that propelled him through the windshield. His face was severely cut by glass and he was blinded in his left eye. After recovering, he continued to blow glass until he dislocated his right shoulder in 1979 while bodysurfing.

In 1983, Chihuly returned to his native Pacific Northwest where he continued to develop his own work at the Pilchuck Glass School, which he had helped to found in 1971. No longer able to hold the glassblowing pipe, he hired others to do the work. Chihuly explained the change in a 2006 interview, saying &quot;Once I stepped back, I liked the view&quot;, and said that it allowed him to see the work from more perspectives, enabling him to anticipate problems earlier. Chihuly&#x27;s role has been described as &quot;more choreographer than dancer, more supervisor than participant, more director than actor&quot;. &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; reporter Erin Glass wrote that she &quot;wonders at the vision of not just the artist Chihuly, but the very successful entrepreneur Chihuly, whose estimated sales by 2004 was reported by &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; as $29 million.&quot;

Chihuly and his team of artists were the subjects of the documentary &quot;.&quot; They were also featured in the documentary &quot;Chihuly in the Hotshop,&quot; syndicated to public television stations by American Public Television starting on November 1, 2008.

In 2010, the Space Needle Corporation submitted a proposal for an exhibition of Chihuly&#x27;s work at a site in the Seattle Center, in competition with proposals for other uses from several other groups. The project, which sees the new Chihuly exhibition hall occupy the site of the former Fun Forest amusement park in the Seattle Center park and entertainment complex, received the final approval from the Seattle City Council on April 25, 2011. Called Chihuly Garden and Glass, it opened May 21, 2012.

=== 2006 lawsuit ===
In 2006, Chihuly filed a lawsuit against his former longtime employee, glassblower Bryan Rubino, and businessman Robert Kaindl, claiming copyright and trademark infringement. Kaindl&#x27;s pieces used titles Chihuly had employed for his own works, such as Seaforms and Ikebana, and resembled the construction of Chihuly&#x27;s pieces. Legal experts stated that influence on art style did not constitute copyright infringement. Chihuly settled the lawsuit with Rubino initially, and later with Kaindl as well.

== Works ==

Regina Hackett, a &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; art critic, provided a chronology of Chihuly&#x27;s work during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s:
* 1975: Navajo Blanket Series, in which patterns of Navajo blankets were painted onto glass
* 1977: Northwest Coast Basket Series, baskets inspired by Northwest coast Indian baskets he had seen as a child
* 1980: Seaform Series, transparent sculptures of thin glass, strengthened by ribbed strands of color
* 1981: Macchia Series, featuring every color available in the studio
* 1986: Persian Series, inspired by Middle East glass from the 12th- to 14th-century, featuring more restrained color and room-sized installations
* 1988: Venetian Series, improvisations based on Italian Art Deco
* 1989: Ikebana Series, glass flower arrangements inspired by ikebana
* 1990: Venetian Series returns, this time in a more eccentric form
* 1991: Niijima Floats, six-foot spheres of intricate color inspired by Japanese glass fishing floats from the island of Niijima from Chihuly&#x27;s website
* 1992: Chandeliers, starting modestly but by the middle of the decade involving a multitude of glass orbs and shapes that in some works look like flowers, others like breasts, and still others like snakes. Chihuly has also produced a sizable volume of &quot;Irish cylinders&quot;, which are more modest in conception than his blown glass works.

For his exhibition in Jerusalem, in 1999–2000, in addition to the glass pieces, he had enormous blocks of transparent ice brought in from an Alaskan artesian well and formed a wall, echoing the stones of the nearby Citadel. Lights with color gels were set up behind them for illumination. Chihuly said the melting wall represented the &quot;dissolution of barriers&quot; between people. This exhibit holds the world record for most visitors to a temporary exhibit with more than 1.3 million visitors.

In 1999, Chihuly&#x27;s &quot;Millenium Tree&quot; was present in the East Wing of the Clinton White House during a Millenium celebration. The tree now resides in the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum.

Two of Chihuly&#x27;s pieces can also be found at two casino resorts owned by MGM Resorts International: one in the reception area of the Bellagio on the Las Vegas Strip, and the other in the VIP lobby of the MGM Macau in Macau, China. The piece at the Bellagio, titled &quot;Fiori di Como&quot;, holds the Guinness World Record for largest glass sculpture. In July 2001, in response to positive feedback from guests who viewed the installation at Bellagio, Chihuly partnered with Bellagio to open a store that sold some of the artist&#x27;s original works, as well as books and videos about the artist. However, the store has since been marked permanently closed on Google Maps. 

There is also one piece titled Blue River in the Casino of the Sky at Mohegan Sun: Casino and Resort in Uncasville, CT. The distinctive cobalt blue, silver and clear colored glass sculpture, measuring fourteen feet in width, soars twenty-five feet above visitors, creating a spectacular centerpiece.

=== Exhibitions ===

==== Permanent collections ====
Chihuly&#x27;s art appears in over 400 permanent collections all over the world, including in the United States, Canada, England, Israel, China, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia. Chihuly&#x27;s largest permanent exhibit is at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art. Other large collections can be found at the Morean Arts Center in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Chihuly Garden and Glass in Seattle, Washington. Four large-scale installations are on permanent display at the Baker Museum in Naples, Florida. 

=== Recognition ===
* 1994: Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement
* 2006: American Craft Council&#x27;s gold medal
* 2011: Fritz Redlich Alumni Award of the Institute of International Education

During his teenage years, Kamen was already being paid for his ideas; local bands and museums paid him to build light and sound systems. His annual earnings reached $60,000 before his high school graduation.

He attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute, but in 1976 quit before graduating, after five years of private advanced research for the insulin pump AutoSyringe.

==Career==
===Inventions===
Kamen is known best for inventing the product that eventually became known as the Segway PT, an electric, self-balancing human transporter with a computer-controlled gyroscopic stabilization and control system. The device is balanced on two parallel wheels and is controlled by moving body weight. The machine&#x27;s development was the object of much speculation and hype after segments of a book quoting Steve Jobs and other notable information technology visionaries espousing its society-revolutionizing potential were leaked in December 2001.

Kamen was already a successful inventor: his company &quot;Auto Syringe&quot; manufactures and markets the first drug infusion pump. His company DEKA also holds patents for the technology used in portable dialysis machines, an insulin pump (based on the drug infusion pump technology), and an all-terrain electric wheelchair known as the iBOT, using many of the same gyroscopic balancing technologies that later made their way into the Segway.

Kamen has worked extensively on a project involving Stirling engine designs, attempting to create two machines: one that would generate power, and the Slingshot that would serve as a water purification system. He hopes the project will help improve living standards in developing countries. Kamen has a patent on his water purifier, and other patents pending. In 2014, the film &quot;SlingShot&quot; was released, detailing Kamen&#x27;s quest to use his vapor compression distiller to fix the world&#x27;s water crisis.

Kamen is also the co-inventor of a compressed air device that would launch a human into the air in order to quickly launch SWAT teams or other emergency workers to the roofs of tall, inaccessible buildings.

In 2009 Kamen stated that his company DEKA was now working on solar powered inventions.

Kamen and DEKA also developed the DEKA Arm System or &quot;Luke&quot;, a prosthetic arm replacement that offers its user much more fine motor control than traditional prosthetic limbs. It was approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2014, and DEKA is looking for partners to mass-produce the prosthesis.

===FIRST===
In 1989, Kamen founded FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), an organization intended to build students&#x27; interests in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). In 1992, working with MIT Professor Emeritus Woodie Flowers, Kamen created the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), which evolved into an international competition that by 2020 had drawn 3,647 teams and more than 91,000 students.

FIRST organizes robotics competition leagues for students in grades K-12, including FIRST LEGO League Discover for ages 4–6, FIRST LEGO League Explore for younger elementary school students, FIRST LEGO League Challenge for older elementary school and middle school students, FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) for middle and high school students, and FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) for high school students. In 2017, FIRST held its first Olympics-style competition – FGC (FIRST Global Challenge) – in Washington, D.C.

In 2010, Kamen called FIRST the invention he is most proud of, and said that 1 million students had taken part in the contests.

=== Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute ===
In 2017, Kamen founded the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI) and launched BioFabUSA, a Manufacturing USA Innovation Institute with an $80 million grant from the Department of Defense. BioFabUSA&#x27;s mission is to &quot;...&quot;make practical the large-scale manufacturing of engineered tissues and tissue-related technologies, to benefit existing industries and grow new ones&quot;&quot; In addition to DoD funding, Kamen brought together a consortium of private sector entities to form a public-private partnership which pledged $214M additional private dollars.

In early 2020, ARMI was awarded a grant from the Department of Health and Human Services to establish the first Foundry for American Biotechnology, known as NextFab &quot;to produce technological solutions that help the United States protect against and respond to health security threats, enhance daily medical care, and add to the U.S. bioeconomy&quot;.

===Awards===
Kamen has won numerous awards. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1997 for inventing and commercializing biomedical devices and fluid measurement and control systems, and for popularizing engineering among young people. In 1999 he was awarded the 5th Annual Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment, and in 2000 received the National Medal of Technology from then President Clinton for inventions that have advanced medical care worldwide. In April 2002, Kamen was awarded the Lemelson-MIT Prize for inventors, for his invention of the Segway and of an infusion pump for diabetics. In 2003 his &quot;Project Slingshot&quot;, an inexpensive portable water purification system, was named a runner-up for &quot;coolest invention of 2003&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

In 2005 he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his invention of the AutoSyringe. In 2006 Kamen was awarded the &quot;Global Humanitarian Action Award&quot; by the United Nations. In 2007 he received the ASME Medal, the highest award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, in 2008 he was the recipient of the IRI Achievement Award from the Industrial Research Institute, and in 2011 Kamen was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Mechanical Engineering of the Franklin Institute.

Kamen received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1992, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute May 17, 1996, a Doctor of Engineering degree from Kettering University in 2001, an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Clarkson University on May 13, 2001, an honorary &quot;Doctor of Science&quot; degree from the University of Arizona on May 16, 2009, and an honorary doctorate from the Wentworth Institute of Technology when he spoke at the college&#x27;s centennial celebration in 2004, and other honorary doctorates from North Carolina State University in 2005, Bates College in 2007, the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2008, the Illinois Institute of Technology in 2008 the Plymouth State University in May 2008 and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2012. In 2015, Kamen received an honorary Doctor of Engineering and Technology degree from Yale University. In 2017, Kamen was honored with an institutional honorary degree from Université de Sherbrooke.

Kamen received the Stevens Honor Award on November 6, 2009, given by the Stevens Institute of Technology and the Stevens Alumni Association. On November 14, 2013, he received the James C. Morgan Global Humanitarian Award.

Kamen received the 2018 Public Service Award from the National Science Board, honoring his exemplary public service and contributions to the public&#x27;s understanding of science and engineering.

==Trivia==

In 2007, his residence was a hexagonal, shed style mansion he dubbed Westwind, located in Bedford, New Hampshire, just outside Manchester. The house has at least four levels and is very eclectically conceived, with such things as: hallways resembling mine shafts; 1960s novelty furniture; a collection of vintage wheelchairs; spiral staircases; at least one secret passage; an observation tower; a fully equipped machine shop; and a huge cast iron steam engine which once belonged to Henry Ford (built into the multi-story center atrium of the house) which Kamen is working to convert into a Stirling engine-powered kinetic sculpture. Kamen owns and pilots an Embraer Phenom 300 light jet aircraft and three Enstrom helicopters, including a 280FX, a 480, and a 480B. He regularly commutes to work via his helicopters and had a hangar built into his house. In 2016 he flew as a passenger in a B-2 Spirit bomber at Whiteman AFB, marking the opening of the 2016 FRC World Championship in St. Louis.

He is the main subject of &quot;Code Name Ginger: the Story Behind Segway and Dean Kamen&#x27;s Quest to Invent a New World&quot;, a nonfiction narrative book by journalist Steve Kemper published by Harvard Business School Press in 2003 (released in paperback as &quot;Reinventing the Wheel&quot;).

His company, DEKA, annually creates intricate mechanical presents for him. The company has created a robotic chess player, which is a mechanical arm attached to a chess board, and a vintage-looking computer with antique wood, and a converted typewriter as a keyboard. In addition, DEKA has received funding from DARPA to work on a brain-controlled prosthetic limb called the Luke Arm.

Kamen is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Advisory Board and is also a member of the Xconomists, an ad hoc team of editorial advisors for the tech news and media company, Xconomy. He is also on the Board of Trustees of the X Prize Foundation.

&quot;Dean of Invention&quot;, a TV show on Planet Green, premiered on October 22, 2010. It starred Kamen and correspondent Joanne Colan, in which they investigate new technologies,

Kamen was a keynote speaker at the 2015 Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders.

In the 2016 United States Senate election in New Hampshire, Kamen endorsed Kelly Ayotte, appearing in an ad supporting her.
