<doc id="5688" wikidata="Q457092" url="?curid=5688" title="Colin Dexter">
<text>Norman Colin Dexter (29 September 1930 – 21 March 2017) was an English crime writer known for his &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; series of novels, which were written between 1975 and 1999 and adapted as an ITV television series, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, from 1987 to 2000. His characters have spawned a sequel series, &quot;Lewis&quot;, from 2006 to 2015, and a prequel series, &quot;Endeavour&quot;, from 2012 to 2023.

==Early life and career==
Dexter was born in Stamford, Lincolnshire, to Alfred and Dorothy Dexter. He had an elder brother, John, a fellow classicist, who taught Classics at The King&#x27;s School, Peterborough, and a sister, Avril. Alfred ran a small garage and taxi company from premises in Scotgate, Stamford. Dexter was educated at St John&#x27;s Infants School and Bluecoat Junior School, from which he gained a scholarship to Stamford School, a boys&#x27; grammar school, where a younger contemporary was England cricket captain and England rugby player, M. J. K. Smith.

After leaving school, Dexter completed his national service with the Royal Corps of Signals and then read classics at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1953 and receiving a master&#x27;s degree in 1958.

In 1954, Dexter began his teaching career as assistant Classics master at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester. There he helped the school&#x27;s Christian Union. However, in 2000 he stated that he shared the same views on politics and religion as Inspector Morse, who was portrayed in the final Morse novel, &quot;The Remorseful Day&quot;, as an atheist. A post at Loughborough Grammar School followed in 1957, then he took up the position of senior Classics teacher at Corby Grammar School, Northamptonshire, in 1959.

In 1966, he was forced by the onset of deafness to retire from teaching and took up the post of senior assistant secretary at the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE) in Oxford, a job he held until his retirement in 1988.

In November 2008, Dexter featured prominently in the BBC Four programme &quot;How to Solve a Cryptic Crossword&quot;, as part of the &quot;Timeshift&quot; series, in which he recounted some of the crossword clues solved by Morse.

==Writing career==
The initial books written by Dexter were general studies textbooks. He began writing mysteries in 1972 during a family holiday. &quot;Last Bus to Woodstock&quot; was published in 1975 and introduced the character of Inspector Morse, the irascible detective whose penchants for cryptic crosswords, English literature, cask ale, and music by Wagner reflected Dexter&#x27;s own enthusiasms. Dexter&#x27;s plots used false leads and other red herrings, &quot;presenting Morse, and his readers, with fiendishly difficult puzzles to solve&quot;.

The success of the 33 two-hour episodes of the ITV television series &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, produced between 1987 and 2000, brought further attention to Dexter&#x27;s writings. The show featured Inspector Morse, played by John Thaw, and his assistant Sergeant Robert Lewis, played by Kevin Whately. In the manner of Alfred Hitchcock, Dexter made a cameo appearance in almost all episodes.

From 2006 to 2015, Morse&#x27;s assistant Lewis was featured in a 33-episode ITV series titled &quot;Lewis&quot; (&quot;Inspector Lewis&quot; in the United States). Lewis is assisted by DS James Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox. A prequel series, &quot;Endeavour&quot;, features a young Morse and stars Shaun Evans and Roger Allam. &quot;Endeavour&quot; was first broadcast on the ITV network in 2012, ending with the ninth series in 2023, taking young Morse&#x27;s career into 1972. Dexter was a consultant for &quot;Lewis&quot; and the first few years of &quot;Endeavour&quot;. As with &quot;Morse&quot;, Dexter occasionally made cameo appearances in both &quot;Lewis&quot; and &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

Including both Morse and Lewis, many of the characters in Dexter&#x27;s books were taken from the names of other cruciverbalists. For example, although Dexter&#x27;s military service was as a Morse code operator in the Royal Corps of Signals, the character was named after his friend Sir Jeremy Morse, a crossword devotee like Dexter. The music for the television series, written by Barrington Pheloung, used a motif based on the Morse code for Morse&#x27;s name.

==Awards and honours==
Dexter received several Crime Writers&#x27; Association awards: two Silver Daggers for &quot;Service of All the Dead&quot; in 1979 and &quot;The Dead of Jericho&quot; in 1981; two Gold Daggers for &quot;The Wench is Dead&quot; in 1989 and &quot;The Way Through the Woods&quot; in 1992; and a Cartier Diamond Dagger for lifetime achievement in 1997. In 1996, Dexter received a Macavity Award for his short story &quot;Evans Tries an O-Level&quot;. In 1980, he was elected a member of the by-invitation-only Detection Club. In 2005 Dexter became a Fellow by Special Election of St Cross College, Oxford.

In the 2000 Birthday Honours Dexter was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to literature. In 2001 he was awarded the Freedom of the City of Oxford. In September 2011, the University of Lincoln awarded Dexter an honorary Doctor of Letters degree.

==Personal life==
In 1956, he married Dorothy Cooper. They had a daughter, Sally, and a son, Jeremy.

==Death==
On 21 March 2017 Dexter&#x27;s publisher, Macmillan, said in a statement &quot;With immense sadness, Macmillan announces the death of Colin Dexter who died peacefully at his home in Oxford this morning&quot;.

<text>A college (Latin: &quot;collegium&quot;) may be a tertiary educational institution (sometimes awarding degrees), part of a collegiate university, an institution offering vocational education, a further education institution, or a secondary school.
In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. In the United States, a college may offer undergraduate programs – either as an independent institution or as the undergraduate program of a university – or it may be a residential college of a university or a community college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to provide affordable and accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees. The word is generally also used as a synonym for a university in the US. Colleges in countries such as France, Belgium, and Switzerland provide secondary education.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;college&quot; is from the Latin verb &quot;lego, legere, legi, lectum&quot;, &quot;to collect, gather together, pick&quot;, plus the preposition &quot;cum&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, thus meaning &quot;selected together&quot;. Thus &quot;colleagues&quot; are literally &quot;persons who have been selected to work together&quot;. In ancient Rome a &quot;collegium&quot; was a &quot;body, guild, corporation united in colleagueship; of magistrates, praetors, tribunes, priests, augurs; a political club or trade guild&quot;. Thus a college was a form of corporation or corporate body, an artificial legal person (body/corpus) with its own legal personality, with the capacity to enter into legal contracts, to sue and be sued. In mediaeval England there were colleges of priests, for example in chantry chapels; modern survivals include the Royal College of Surgeons in England (originally the Guild of Surgeons Within the City of London), the College of Arms in London (a body of heralds enforcing heraldic law), an electoral college (to elect representatives); all groups of persons &quot;selected in common&quot; to perform a specified function and appointed by a monarch, founder or other person in authority. As for the modern &quot;college of education&quot;, it was a body created for that purpose, for example Eton College was founded in 1440 by letters patent of King Henry VI for the constitution of a college &quot;of Fellows, priests, clerks, choristers, poor scholars, and old poor men, with one master or governor&quot;, whose duty it shall be to instruct these scholars and any others who may resort thither from any part of England in the knowledge of letters, and especially of grammar, without payment&quot;.

==Overview==

===Higher education===

Within higher education, the term can be used to refer to: 
* A constituent part of a collegiate university, for example King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, or of a federal university, for example King&#x27;s College London.
* A liberal arts college, an independent institution of higher education focusing on undergraduate education, such as Williams College or Amherst College.
* A liberal arts division of a university whose undergraduate program does not otherwise follow a liberal arts model, such as the Yuanpei College at Peking University.
* An institute providing specialised training, such as a college of further education, for example Belfast Metropolitan College, a teacher training college, or an art college.
* A Catholic higher education institute which includes universities, colleges, and other institutions of higher education privately run by the Catholic Church, typically by religious institutes. Those tied to the Holy See are specifically called pontifical universities.
* In the United States, college is sometimes but rarely a synonym for a research university, such as Dartmouth College, one of the eight universities in the Ivy League.
* In the United States, the undergraduate college of a university which also confers graduate degrees, such as Yale College, the undergraduate college within Yale University.

===Further education===

A sixth form college or college of further education is an educational institution in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Belize, the Caribbean, Malta, Norway, Brunei, and Southern Africa, among others, where students aged 16 to 19 typically study for advanced school-level qualifications, such as A-levels, BTEC, HND or its equivalent and the International Baccalaureate Diploma, or school-level qualifications such as GCSEs. In Singapore and India, this is known as a junior college. The municipal government of the city of Paris uses the phrase &quot;sixth form college&quot; as the English name for a lycée.

===Secondary education===

In some national education systems, secondary schools may be called &quot;colleges&quot; or have &quot;college&quot; as part of their title.

In Australia the term &quot;college&quot; is applied to any private or independent (non-government) primary and, especially, secondary school as distinct from a state school. Melbourne Grammar School, Cranbrook School, Sydney and The King&#x27;s School, Parramatta are considered colleges.

There has also been a recent trend to rename or create government secondary schools as &quot;colleges&quot;. In the state of Victoria, some state high schools are referred to as &quot;secondary colleges&quot;, although the pre-eminent government secondary school for boys in Melbourne is still named Melbourne High School. In Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, &quot;college&quot; is used in the name of all state high schools built since the late 1990s, and also some older ones. In New South Wales, some high schools, especially multi-campus schools resulting from mergers, are known as &quot;secondary colleges&quot;. In Queensland some newer schools which accept primary and high school students are styled &quot;state college&quot;, but state schools offering only secondary education are called &quot;State High School&quot;. In Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, &quot;college&quot; refers to the final two years of high school (years 11 and 12), and the institutions which provide this. In this context, &quot;college&quot; is a system independent of the other years of high school. Here, the expression is a shorter version of &quot;matriculation college&quot;.

In a number of Canadian cities, many government-run secondary schools are called &quot;collegiates&quot; or &quot;collegiate institutes&quot; (C.I.), a complicated form of the word &quot;college&quot; which avoids the usual &quot;post-secondary&quot; connotation. This is because these secondary schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational, subjects and ability levels (for example, collegiates offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses). Some private secondary schools (such as Upper Canada College, Vancouver College) choose to use the word &quot;college&quot; in their names nevertheless. Some secondary schools elsewhere in the country, particularly ones within the separate school system, may also use the word &quot;college&quot; or &quot;collegiate&quot; in their names.

In New Zealand the word &quot;college&quot; normally refers to a secondary school for ages 13 to 17 and &quot;college&quot; appears as part of the name especially of private or integrated schools. &quot;Colleges&quot; most frequently appear in the North Island, whereas &quot;high schools&quot; are more common in the South Island.

In the Netherlands, &quot;college&quot; is equivalent to HBO (Higher professional education). It is oriented towards professional training with a clear occupational outlook, unlike universities which are scientifically oriented.

In South Africa, some secondary schools, especially private schools on the English public school model, have &quot;college&quot; in their title, including six of South Africa&#x27;s Elite Seven high schools. A typical example of this category would be St John&#x27;s College.

Private schools that specialize in improving children&#x27;s marks through intensive focus on examination needs are informally called &quot;cram-colleges&quot;.

In Sri Lanka the word &quot;college&quot; (known as &quot;Vidyalaya&quot; in &quot;Sinhala&quot;) normally refers to a secondary school, which usually signifies above the 5th standard. During the British colonial period a limited number of exclusive secondary schools were established based on English public school model (Royal College Colombo, S. Thomas&#x27; College, Mount Lavinia, Trinity College, Kandy) these along with several Catholic schools (St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Colombo, St Anthony&#x27;s College) traditionally carry their name as colleges. Following the start of free education in 1931 large group of central colleges were established to educate the rural masses. Since Sri Lanka gained Independence in 1948, many schools that have been established have been named as &quot;college&quot;.

===Other===
As well as an educational institution, the term, in accordance with its etymology, may also refer to any formal group of colleagues set up under statute or regulation; often under a Royal Charter. Examples include an electoral college, the College of Arms, a college of canons, and the College of Cardinals. Other collegiate bodies include professional associations, particularly in medicine and allied professions. In the UK these include the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Physicians. Examples in the United States include the American College of Physicians, the American College of Surgeons, and the American College of Dentists. An example in Australia is the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.

==College by country==

The different ways in which the term &quot;college&quot; is used to describe educational institutions in various regions of the world is listed below:

==Americas==
===Canada===

In Canadian English, the term &quot;college&quot; usually refers to a trades school, applied arts/science/technology/business/health school or community college. These are post-secondary institutions granting certificates, diplomas, associate degrees and (in some cases) bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The French acronym specific to public institutions within Quebec&#x27;s particular system of pre-university and technical education is CEGEP (&quot;Collège d&#x27;enseignement général et professionnel&quot;, &quot;college of general and professional education&quot;). They are collegiate-level institutions that a student typically enrols in if they wish to continue onto university in the Quebec education system, or to learn a trade. In Ontario and Alberta, there are also institutions that are designated university colleges, which only grant undergraduate degrees. This is to differentiate between universities, which have both undergraduate and graduate programs and those that do not.

In Canada, there is a strong distinction between &quot;college&quot; and &quot;university&quot;. In conversation, one specifically would say either &quot;they are going to university&quot; (i.e., studying for a three- or four-year degree at a university) or &quot;they are going to college&quot; (i.e., studying at a technical/career training).

====Usage in a university setting====
The term &quot;college&quot; also applies to distinct entities that formally act as an affiliated institution of the university, formally referred to as federated college, or affiliated colleges. A university may also formally include several constituent colleges, forming a collegiate university. Examples of collegiate universities in Canada include Trent University, and the University of Toronto. These types of institutions act independently, maintaining their own endowments, and properties. However, they remain either affiliated, or federated with the overarching university, with the overarching university being the institution that formally grants the degrees. For example, Trinity College was once an independent institution, but later became federated with the University of Toronto. Several centralized universities in Canada have mimicked the collegiate university model; although constituent colleges in a centralized university remains under the authority of the central administration. Centralized universities that have adopted the collegiate model to a degree includes the University of British Columbia, with Green College and St. John&#x27;s College; and the Memorial University of Newfoundland, with Sir Wilfred Grenfell College.

Occasionally, &quot;college&quot; refers to a subject specific faculty within a university that, while distinct, are neither &quot;federated&quot; nor &quot;affiliated&quot;—College of Education, College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Biological Science among others.

The Royal Military College of Canada is a military college which trains officers for the Canadian Armed Forces. The institution is a full-fledged university, with the authority to issue graduate degrees, although it continues to word the term &quot;college&quot; in its name. The institution&#x27;s sister schools, Royal Military College Saint-Jean also uses the term college in its name, although it academic offering is akin to a CEGEP institution in Quebec. A number of post-secondary art schools in Canada formerly used the word &quot;college&quot; in their names, despite formally being universities. However, most of these institutions were renamed, or re-branded in the early 21st century, omitting the word &quot;college&quot; from its name.

====Usage in secondary education====
The word &quot;college&quot; continues to be used in the names public separate secondary schools in Ontario. A number of independent schools across Canada also use the word &quot;college&quot; in its name.

Public secular school boards in Ontario also refer to their secondary schools as &quot;collegiate institutes&quot;. However, usage of the word &quot;collegiate institute&quot; varies between school boards. &quot;Collegiate institute&quot; is the predominant name for secondary schools in Lakehead District School Board, and Toronto District School Board, although most school boards in Ontario use &quot;collegiate institute&quot; alongside &quot;high school&quot;, and &quot;secondary school&quot; in the names of their institutions. Similarly, secondary schools in Regina, and Saskatoon are referred to as &quot;Collegiate&quot;.

===Chile===
Officially, since 2009, the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile incorporated the term &quot;college&quot; as the name of a tertiary education program as a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The program features a &quot;Bachelor of Natural Sciences and Mathematics&quot;, a &quot;Bachelor of Social Science&quot; and a &quot;Bachelor of Arts and Humanities&quot;. It has the same system as the American universities, it combines majors and minors and finally, it let the students continue a higher degree in the same university once the program it is completed.

But in Chile, the term &quot;college&quot; is not usually used for tertiary education, but is used mainly in the name of some private bilingual schools, corresponding to levels 0, 1 and 2 of the ISCED 2011. Some examples are they Santiago College, Saint George&#x27;s College, among others.

===United States===


In the United States, there were 5,916 post-secondary institutions (universities and colleges) having peaked at 7,253 in 2012–13 and fallen every year since. A &quot;college&quot; in the US can refer to a constituent part of a university (which can be a residential college, the sub-division of the university offering undergraduate courses, or a school of the university offering particular specialized courses), an independent institution offering bachelor&#x27;s-level courses, or an institution offering instruction in a particular professional, technical or vocational field. In popular usage, the word &quot;college&quot; is the generic term for any post-secondary undergraduate education. Americans &quot;go to college&quot; after high school, regardless of whether the specific institution is formally a college or a university. Some students choose to dual-enroll, by taking college classes while still in high school. The word and its derivatives are the standard terms used to describe the institutions and experiences associated with American post-secondary undergraduate education.

Students must pay for college before taking classes. Some borrow the money via loans, and some students fund their educations with cash, scholarships, grants, or some combination of these payment methods. In 2011, the state or federal government subsidized $8,000 to $100,000 for each undergraduate degree. For state-owned schools (called &quot;public&quot; universities), the subsidy was given to the college, with the student benefiting from lower tuition. The state subsidized on average 50% of public university tuition.
Colleges vary in terms of size, degree, and length of stay. Two-year colleges, also known as junior or community colleges, usually offer an associate degree, and four-year colleges usually offer a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Often, these are entirely undergraduate institutions, although some have graduate school programs.

Four-year institutions in the U.S. that emphasize a liberal arts curriculum are known as liberal arts colleges. Until the 20th century, liberal arts, law, medicine, theology, and divinity were about the only form of higher education available in the United States. These schools have traditionally emphasized instruction at the undergraduate level, although advanced research may still occur at these institutions.
While there is no national standard in the United States, the term &quot;university&quot; primarily designates institutions that provide undergraduate and graduate education. A university typically has as its core and its largest internal division an undergraduate college teaching a liberal arts curriculum, also culminating in a bachelor&#x27;s degree. What often distinguishes a university is having, in addition, one or more graduate schools engaged in both teaching graduate classes and in research. Often these would be called a School of Law or School of Medicine, (but may also be called a college of law, or a faculty of law). An exception is Vincennes University, Indiana, which is styled and chartered as a &quot;university&quot; even though almost all of its academic programs lead only to two-year associate degrees. Some institutions, such as Dartmouth College and The College of William &amp; Mary, have retained the term &quot;college&quot; in their names for historical reasons. In one unique case, Boston College and Boston University, the former located in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts and the latter located in Boston, Massachusetts, are completely separate institutions.

Usage of the terms varies among the states. In 1996, for example, Georgia changed all of its four-year institutions previously designated as colleges to universities, and all of its vocational technology schools to technical colleges.
The terms &quot;university&quot; and &quot;college&quot; do not exhaust all possible titles for an American institution of higher education. Other options include &quot;institute&quot; (Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Massachusetts Institute of Technology), &quot;academy&quot; (United States Military Academy), &quot;union&quot; (Cooper Union), &quot;conservatory&quot; (New England Conservatory), and &quot;school&quot; (Juilliard School). In colloquial use, the institutions are still referred to as &quot;college&quot; when referring to undergraduate studies.

The term &quot;college&quot; is also, as in the United Kingdom, used for a constituent semi-autonomous part of a larger university but generally organized on academic rather than residential lines. For example, at many institutions, the undergraduate portion of the university can be briefly referred to as the college (such as The College of the University of Chicago, Harvard College at Harvard, or Columbia College at Columbia) while at others, such as the University of California, Berkeley, &quot;colleges&quot; are collections of academic programs and other units that share some common characteristics, mission, or disciplinary focus (the &quot;college of engineering&quot;, the &quot;college of nursing&quot;, and so forth). There exist other variants for historical reasons, including some uses that exist because of mergers and acquisitions; for example, Duke University, which was called Trinity College until the 1920s, still calls its main undergraduate subdivision Trinity College of Arts and Sciences.

====Residential colleges====

Some American universities, such as Princeton, Rice, and Yale have established residential colleges (sometimes, as at Harvard, the first to establish such a system in the 1930s, known as houses) along the lines of Oxford or Cambridge. Unlike the Oxbridge colleges, but similarly to Durham, these residential colleges are not autonomous legal entities nor are they typically much involved in education itself, being primarily concerned with room, board, and social life. At the University of Michigan, University of California, San Diego and the University of California, Santa Cruz, each residential college teaches its own core writing courses and has its own distinctive set of graduation requirements.

Many American universities have placed increased emphasis on their residential colleges in recent years. This is exemplified by the creation of new colleges at Ivy League schools such as Yale University and Princeton University, and efforts to strengthen the contribution of the residential colleges to student education, including through a 2016 taskforce at Princeton on residential colleges.

====Origin of the American usage====
The founders of the first institutions of higher education in the United States were graduates of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. The small institutions they founded would not have seemed to them like universities – they were tiny and did not offer the higher degrees in medicine and theology. Furthermore, they were not composed of several small colleges. Instead, the new institutions felt like the Oxford and Cambridge colleges they were used to – small communities, housing and feeding their students, with instruction from residential tutors (as in the United Kingdom, described above). When the first students graduated, these &quot;colleges&quot; assumed the right to confer degrees upon them, usually with authority—for example, The College of William &amp; Mary has a royal charter from the British monarchy allowing it to confer degrees while Dartmouth College has a charter permitting it to award degrees &quot;as are usually granted in either of the universities, or any other college in our realm of Great Britain.&quot;
The leaders of Harvard College (which granted America&#x27;s first degrees in 1642) might have thought of their college as the first of many residential colleges that would grow up into a New Cambridge university. However, over time, few new colleges were founded there, and Harvard grew and added higher faculties. Eventually, it changed its title to university, but the term &quot;college&quot; had stuck and &quot;colleges&quot; have arisen across the United States.

In American English, the word &quot;college&quot; not only embodies a particular type of school, but has historically been used to refer to the general concept of undergraduate education when it is not necessary to specify a school, as in &quot;going to college&quot; or &quot;college savings accounts&quot; offered by banks.

In a survey of more than 2,000 college students in 33 states and 156 different campuses, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group found the average student spends as much as $1,200 each year on textbooks and supplies alone. By comparison, the group says that&#x27;s the equivalent of 39 percent of tuition and fees at a community college, and 14 percent of tuition and fees at a four-year public university.

====Morrill Land-Grant Act====

In addition to private colleges and universities, the U.S. also has a system of government funded, public universities. Many were founded under the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862. A movement had arisen to bring a form of more practical higher education to the masses, as &quot;...many politicians and educators wanted to make it possible for all young Americans to receive some sort of advanced education.&quot; The Morrill Act &quot;...made it possible for the new western states to establish colleges for the citizens.&quot; Its goal was to make higher education more easily accessible to the citizenry of the country, specifically to improve agricultural systems by providing training and scholarship in the production and sales of agricultural products, and to provide formal education in &quot;...agriculture, home economics, mechanical arts, and other professions that seemed practical at the time.&quot;

The act was eventually extended to allow all states that had remained with the Union during the American Civil War, and eventually all states, to establish such institutions. Most of the colleges established under the Morrill Act have since become full universities, and some are among the elite of the world.

====Benefits of college====
Selection of a four-year college as compared to a two-year junior college, even by marginal students such as those with a C+ grade average in high school and SAT scores in the mid 800s, increases the probability of graduation and confers substantial economic and social benefits.

==Asia==
===Bangladesh===

In Bangladesh, educational institutions offering higher secondary (11th–12th grade) education are known as colleges.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the term &#x27;college&#x27; is used by tertiary institutions as either part of their names or to refer to a constituent part of the university, such as the colleges in the collegiate The Chinese University of Hong Kong; or to a residence hall of a university, such as St. John&#x27;s College, University of Hong Kong. Many older secondary schools have the term &#x27;college&#x27; as part of their names.

===India===

The modern system of education was heavily influenced by the British starting in 1835.

In India, the term &quot;college&quot; is commonly reserved for institutions that offer high school diplomas at year 12 (&quot;Junior College&quot;, similar to American &quot;high schools&quot;), and those that offer the bachelor&#x27;s degree; some colleges, however, offer programmes up to PhD level. Generally, colleges are located in different parts of a state and all of them are affiliated to a regional university. The colleges offer programmes leading to degrees of that university. Colleges may be either Autonomous or non-autonomous. Autonomous Colleges are empowered to establish their own syllabus, and conduct and assess their own examinations; in non-autonomous colleges, examinations are conducted by the university, at the same time for all colleges under its affiliation. There are several hundred universities and each university has affiliated colleges, often a large number.

The first liberal arts and sciences college in India was &quot;Cottayam College&quot; or the &quot;Syrian College&quot;, Kerala in 1815. The First inter linguistic residential education institution in Asia was started at this college. At present it is a Theological seminary which is popularly known as Orthodox Theological Seminary or Old Seminary. After that, CMS College, Kottayam, established in 1817, and the Presidency College, Kolkata, also 1817, initially known as Hindu College. The first college for the study of Christian theology and ecumenical enquiry was Serampore College (1818). The first Missionary institution to impart Western style education in India was the Scottish Church College, Calcutta (1830). The first commerce and economics college in India was Sydenham College, Mumbai (1913).

In India a new term has been introduced that is Autonomous Institutes &amp; Colleges. An autonomous Colleges are colleges which need to be affiliated to a certain university. These colleges can conduct their own admission procedure, examination syllabus, fees structure etc. However, at the end of course completion, they cannot issue their own degree or diploma. The final degree or diploma is issued by the affiliated university. 
Also, some significant changes can pave way under the NEP (New Education Policy 2020) which may affect the present guidelines for universities and colleges. Implemented in the 2023–2024 academic year, the new education policy is said to fill the gaps and cover the drawbacks of the Indian education system.

===Israel===

In Israel, any non-university higher-learning facility is called a college. Institutions accredited by the Council for Higher Education in Israel (CHE) to confer a bachelor&#x27;s degree are called &quot;academic colleges&quot; (; plural ). These colleges (at least 4 for 2012) may also offer master&#x27;s degrees and act as research facilities. There are also over twenty teacher training colleges or seminaries, most of which may award only a Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree.
* Academic colleges: Any educational facility that had been approved to offer at least bachelor&#x27;s degree is entitled by CHE to use the term &quot;academic college&quot; in its name.
* Engineering academic college: Any academic facility that offers at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree and most of it faculties are providing an engineering degree and engineering license.
* Educational academic college: After an educational facility that had been approved for &quot;teachers seminar&quot; status is then approved to provide a Bachelor of Education, its name is changed to include &quot;educational academic college.&quot;
* Technical college: A &quot;technical college&quot; () is an educational facility that is approved to allow to provide P.E. degree (; 14&#x27;th class) or technician (; 13&#x27;th class) diploma and licenses.
* Training College: A &quot;training college&quot; ( or ) is an educational facility that provides basic training allowing a person to receive a working permit in a field such as alternative medicine, cooking, art, mechanic, electrician and other professions. A trainee could receive the right to work in certain professions as apprentice (j. mechanic, j. electrician etc.). After working in the training field for enough time, an apprentice can receive a license to operate as mechanic or electrician) This educational facility is mostly used to provide basic training for low tech jobs and for job seekers without any training that are provided by the nation&#x27;s Employment Service (שירות התעסוקה).

===Macau===
Following the Portuguese usage, the term &quot;college&quot; (&quot;colégio&quot;) in Macau has traditionally been used in the names for private (and non-governmental) pre-university educational institutions, which correspond to form one to form six level tiers. Such schools are usually run by the Roman Catholic church or missionaries in Macau. Examples include Chan Sui Ki Perpetual Help College, Yuet Wah College, and Sacred Heart Canossian College.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, colleges usually refer to institutions of learning that grant degrees but whose scholastic fields are not as diverse as that of a university (University of Santo Tomas, University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University, Far Eastern University, and AMA University), such as the San Beda College which specializes in law, AMA Computer College whose campuses are spread all over the Philippines which specializes in information and computing technologies, and the Mapúa Institute of Technology which specializes in engineering, or to component units within universities that do not grant degrees but rather facilitate the instruction of a particular field, such as a College of Science and College of Engineering, among many other colleges of the University of the Philippines.

A state college may not have the word &quot;college&quot; on its name, but may have several component colleges, or departments. Thus, the Eulogio Amang Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology is a state college by classification.

Usually, the term &quot;college&quot; is also thought of as a hierarchical demarcation between the term &quot;university&quot;, and quite a number of colleges seek to be recognized as universities as a sign of improvement in academic standards (Colegio de San Juan de Letran, San Beda College), and increase in the diversity of the offered degree programs (called &quot;courses&quot;). For private colleges, this may be done through a survey and evaluation by the Commission on Higher Education and accrediting organizations, as was the case of Urios College which is now the Fr. Saturnino Urios University. For state colleges, it is usually done by a legislation by the Congress or Senate. In common usage, &quot;going to college&quot; simply means attending school for an undergraduate degree, whether it&#x27;s from an institution recognized as a college or a university.

When it comes to referring to the level of education, &quot;college&quot; is the term more used to be synonymous to tertiary or higher education. A student who is or has studied his/her undergraduate degree at either an institution with &quot;college&quot; or &quot;university&quot; in its name is considered to be going to or have gone to &quot;college&quot;.

===Singapore===
The term &quot;college&quot; in Singapore is generally only used for pre-university educational institutions called &quot;Junior Colleges&quot;, which provide the final two years of secondary education (equivalent to sixth form in British terms or grades 11–12 in the American system). Since 1 January 2005, the term also refers to the three campuses of the Institute of Technical Education with the introduction of the &quot;collegiate system&quot;, in which the three institutions are called ITE College East, ITE College Central, and ITE College West respectively.

The term &quot;university&quot; is used to describe higher-education institutions offering locally conferred degrees. Institutions offering diplomas are called &quot;polytechnics&quot;, while other institutions are often referred to as &quot;institutes&quot; and so forth.

===Sri Lanka===
There are several professional and vocational institutions that offer post-secondary education without granting degrees that are referred to as &quot;colleges&quot;. This includes the Sri Lanka Law College, the many Technical Colleges and Teaching Colleges.

===Turkey===
In Turkey, the term &quot;kolej&quot; (college) refers to a private high school, typically preceded by one year of preparatory language education. Notable Turkish colleges include Robert College, Uskudar American Academy, American Collegiate Institute and Tarsus American College.

==Africa==
===South Africa===
Although the term &quot;college&quot; is hardly used in any context at any university in South Africa, some non-university tertiary institutions call themselves colleges. These include teacher training colleges, business colleges and wildlife management colleges. See: List of universities in South Africa#Private colleges and universities; List of post secondary institutions in South Africa.

===Zimbabwe===

The term college is mainly used by private or independent secondary schools with Advanced Level (Upper 6th formers) and also Polytechnic Colleges which confer diplomas only. A student can complete secondary education (International General Certificate of Secondary Education, IGCSE) at 16 years and proceed straight to a poly-technical college or they can proceed to Advanced level (16 to 19 years) and obtain a General Certificate of Education (GCE) certificate which enables them to enroll at a university, provided they have good grades. Alternatively, with lower grades, the GCE certificate holders will have an added advantage over their GCSE counterparts if they choose to enroll at a polytechnical college. Some schools in Zimbabwe choose to offer the International Baccalaureate studies as an alternative to the IGCSE and GCE.

==Europe==
===Greece===
Kollegio (in Greek Κολλέγιο) refers to the Centers of Post-Lyceum Education (in Greek Κέντρο Μεταλυκειακής Εκπαίδευσης, abbreviated as KEME), which are principally private and belong to the Greek post-secondary education system. Some of them have links to EU or US higher education institutions or accreditation organizations, such as the NEASC. &quot;Kollegio&quot; (or &quot;Kollegia&quot; in plural) may also refer to private non-tertiary schools, such as the Athens College.

===Ireland===
In Ireland the term &quot;college&quot; is normally used to describe an institution of tertiary education. University students often say they attend &quot;college&quot; rather than &quot;university&quot;. Until 1989, no university provided teaching or research directly; they were formally offered by a constituent college of the university.

There are number of secondary education institutions that traditionally used the word &quot;college&quot; in their names: these are either older, private schools (such as Belvedere College, Gonzaga College, Castleknock College, and St. Michael&#x27;s College) or what were formerly a particular kind of secondary school. These secondary schools, formerly known as &quot;technical colleges,&quot; were renamed &quot;community colleges,&quot; but remain secondary schools.

The country&#x27;s only ancient university is the University of Dublin. Created during the reign of Elizabeth I, it is modelled on the collegiate universities of Cambridge and Oxford. However, only one constituent college was ever founded, hence the curious position of Trinity College Dublin today; although both are usually considered one and the same, the university and college are completely distinct corporate entities with separate and parallel governing structures.

Among more modern foundations, the National University of Ireland, founded in 1908, consisted of constituent colleges and recognised colleges until 1997. The former are now referred to as constituent universities – institutions that are essentially universities in their own right. The National University can trace its existence back to 1850 and the creation of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland and the creation of the Catholic University of Ireland in 1854. From 1880, the degree awarding roles of these two universities was taken over by the Royal University of Ireland, which remained until the creation of the National University in 1908 and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

The state&#x27;s two new universities, Dublin City University and University of Limerick, were initially National Institute for Higher Education institutions. These institutions offered university level academic degrees and research from the start of their existence and were awarded university status in 1989 in recognition of this.

Third level technical education in the state has been carried out in the Institutes of Technology, which were established from the 1970s as Regional Technical Colleges. These institutions have &quot;delegated authority&quot; which entitles them to give degrees and diplomas from Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) in their own names.

A number of private colleges exist such as Dublin Business School, providing undergraduate and postgraduate courses validated by QQI and in some cases by other universities.

Other types of college include colleges of education, such as the Church of Ireland College of Education. These are specialist institutions, often linked to a university, which provide both undergraduate and postgraduate academic degrees for people who want to train as teachers.

A number of state-funded further education colleges exist – which offer vocational education and training in a range of areas from business studies and information and communications technology to sports injury therapy. These courses are usually one, two or less often three years in duration and are validated by QQI at Levels 5 or 6, or for the BTEC Higher National Diploma award, which is a Level 6/7 qualification, validated by Edexcel. There are numerous private colleges (particularly in Dublin and Limerick) which offer both further and higher education qualifications. These degrees and diplomas are often certified by foreign universities/international awarding bodies and are aligned to the National Framework of Qualifications at Levels 6, 7 and 8.

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands there are 3 main educational routes after high school.
* MBO (middle-level applied education), which is the equivalent of junior college. Designed to prepare students for either skilled trades and technical occupations and workers in support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, nursing, medicine, architecture, and criminology or for additional education at another college with more advanced academic material.
* HBO (higher professional education), which is the equivalent of college and has a professional orientation. After HBO (typically 4–6 years), pupils can enroll in a (professional) master&#x27;s program (1–2 years) or enter the job market. The HBO is taught in vocational universities (hogescholen), of which there are over 40 in the Netherlands, each of which offers a broad variety of programs, with the exception of some that specialize in arts or agriculture. Note that the hogescholen are not allowed to name themselves university in Dutch. This also stretches to English and therefore HBO institutions are known as universities of applied sciences.
* WO (Scientific education), which is the equivalent to university level education and has an academic orientation.

HBO graduates can be awarded two titles, which are Baccalaureus (bc.) and Ingenieur (ing.). At a WO institution, many more bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s titles can be awarded. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees: Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc) and Bachelor of Laws (LLB). Master&#x27;s degrees: Master of Arts (MA), Master of Laws (LLM) and Master of Science (MSc). The PhD title is a research degree awarded upon completion and defense of a doctoral thesis.

===Portugal===

Presently in Portugal, the term &quot;colégio&quot; (college) is normally used as a generic reference to a private (non-government) school that provides from basic to secondary education. Many of the private schools include the term &quot;colégio&quot; in their name. Some special public schools – usually of the boarding school type – also include the term in their name, with a notable example being the &quot;Colégio Militar&quot; (Military College). The term &quot;colégio interno&quot; (literally &quot;internal college&quot;) is used specifically as a generic reference to a boarding school.

Until the 19th century, a &quot;colégio&quot; was usually a secondary or pre-university school, of public or religious nature, where the students usually lived together. A model for these colleges was the Royal College of Arts and Humanities, founded in Coimbra by King John III of Portugal in 1542.

===United Kingdom===
====Secondary education and further education====
Further education (FE) colleges and sixth form colleges are institutions providing further education to students over 16. Some of these also provide higher education courses (see below). In the context of secondary education, &#x27;college&#x27; is used in the names of some private schools, e.g. Eton College and Winchester College.

====Higher education====
In higher education, a college is normally a provider that does not hold university status, although it can also refer to a constituent part of a collegiate or federal university or a grouping of academic faculties or departments within a university. Traditionally the distinction between colleges and universities was that colleges did not award degrees while universities did, but this is no longer the case with NCG having gained taught degree awarding powers (the same as some universities) on behalf of its colleges, and many of the colleges of the University of London holding full degree awarding powers and being effectively universities. Most colleges, however, do not hold their own degree awarding powers and continue to offer higher education courses that are validated by universities or other institutions that can award degrees.

In England, , over 60% of the higher education providers directly funded by HEFCE (208/340) are sixth-form or further education colleges, often termed colleges of further and higher education, along with 17 colleges of the University of London, one university college, 100 universities, and 14 other providers (six of which use &#x27;college&#x27; in their name). Overall, this means over two-thirds of state-supported higher education providers in England are colleges of one form or another. Many private providers are also called colleges, e.g. the New College of the Humanities and St Patrick&#x27;s College, London.

Colleges within universities vary immensely in their responsibilities. The large constituent colleges of the University of London are effectively universities in their own right; colleges in some universities, including those of the University of the Arts London and smaller colleges of the University of London, run their own degree courses but do not award degrees; those at the University of Roehampton provide accommodation and pastoral care as well as delivering the teaching on university courses; those at Oxford and Cambridge deliver some teaching on university courses as well as providing accommodation and pastoral care; and those in Durham, Kent, Lancaster and York provide accommodation and pastoral care but do not normally participate in formal teaching. The legal status of these colleges also varies widely, with University of London colleges being independent corporations and recognised bodies, Oxbridge colleges, colleges of the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) and some Durham colleges being independent corporations and listed bodies, most Durham colleges being owned by the university but still listed bodies, and those of other collegiate universities not having formal recognition. When applying for undergraduate courses through UCAS, University of London colleges are treated as independent providers, colleges of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and UHI are treated as locations within the universities that can be selected by specifying a &#x27;campus code&#x27; in addition to selecting the university, and colleges of other universities are not recognised.

The UHI and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) both include further education colleges. However, while the UHI colleges integrate FE and HE provision, UWTSD maintains a separation between the university campuses (Lampeter, Carmarthen and Swansea) and the two colleges (&quot;Coleg Sir Gâr&quot; and &quot;Coleg Ceredigion&quot;; n.b. &quot;coleg&quot; is Welsh for college), which although part of the same group are treated as separate institutions rather than colleges within the university.

A university college is an independent institution with the power to award taught degrees, but which has not been granted university status. University College is a protected title that can only be used with permission, although note that University College London, University College, Oxford and University College, Durham are colleges within their respective universities and not university colleges (in the case of UCL holding full degree awarding powers that set it above a university college), while University College Birmingham is a university in its own right and also not a university college.

==Oceania==
===Australia===
In Australia a college may be an institution of tertiary education that is smaller than a university, run independently or as part of a university. Following a reform in the 1980s many of the formerly independent colleges now belong to a larger universities.

Referring to parts of a university, there are &quot;residential colleges&quot; which provide residence for students, both undergraduate and postgraduate, called university colleges. These colleges often provide additional tutorial assistance, and some host theological study. Many colleges have strong traditions and rituals, so are a combination of dormitory style accommodation and fraternity or sorority culture.

Most technical and further education institutions (TAFEs), which offer certificate and diploma vocational courses, are styled &quot;TAFE colleges&quot; or &quot;Colleges of TAFE&quot;. In some places, such as Tasmania, college refers to a type of school for Year 11 and 12 students, e.g. Don College.

===New Zealand===
The constituent colleges of the former University of New Zealand (such as Canterbury University College) have become independent universities. Some halls of residence associated with New Zealand universities retain the name of &quot;college&quot;, particularly at the University of Otago (which although brought under the umbrella of the University of New Zealand, already possessed university status and degree awarding powers). The institutions formerly known as &quot;Teacher-training colleges&quot; now style themselves &quot;College of education&quot;.

Some universities, such as the University of Canterbury, have divided their university into constituent administrative &quot;Colleges&quot; – the College of Arts containing departments that teach Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, College of Science containing Science departments, and so on. This is largely modelled on the Cambridge model, discussed above.

Like the United Kingdom some professional bodies in New Zealand style themselves as &quot;colleges&quot;, for example, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians.

In some parts of the country, secondary school is often referred to as college and the term is used interchangeably with high school. This sometimes confuses people from other parts of New Zealand. But in all parts of the country many secondary schools have &quot;College&quot; in their name, such as Rangitoto College, New Zealand&#x27;s largest secondary.

<text>Chalmers University of Technology (, commonly referred to as Chalmers) is a private research university located in Gothenburg, Sweden. Chalmers focuses on engineering and science, but more broadly it also conducts research and offers education in shipping, architecture and management. The university has approximately 3100 employees and 10,000 students.

Chalmers coordinates the development of a Swedish quantum computer
and
the Graphene Flagship, a European Union research initiative to develop commercial technologies with graphene.

The university is a co-founder of the CDIO Initiative, a member of the UNITECH International program, the IDEA League, the Nordic Five Tech, 
and the ENHANCE alliances as well as the EURECOM consortium and the CESAER network.

==History==
Chalmers was founded in 1829 following a donation by William Chalmers, a director of the Swedish East India Company. He donated part of his fortune for the establishment of an &quot;industrial school&quot;. The university was run as a private institution until 1937 when it became the second state-owned technical university. In 1994 the government of Sweden reorganised Chalmers into a private company (aktiebolag) owned by a government-controlled foundation.
Chalmers is one of three universities in Sweden which are named after a person, the other two being Karolinska Institutet and Linnaeus University.

==Departments==
Chalmers University of Technology has the following 13 departments:
* Architecture and Civil Engineering

==Rankings and reputation==
In 2018, a benchmarking report from MIT ranked Chalmers top 10 in the world of engineering education, while in 2020, the World University Research Rankings placed Chalmers 12th in the world based on the evaluation of three key research aspects, namely research multi-disciplinarity, research impact, and research cooperativeness.

Additionally, in 2022 the U-Multirank characterized Chalmers as a top performing university across various indicators (i.e., teaching &amp; learning, research, knowledge transfer and international orientation) with the highest number of ‘A’ (very good) scores on the institutional level for Sweden.

Finally, in 2011, the International Professional Ranking of Higher Education Institutions, which is established on the basis of the number of alumni holding a post of chief executive officer (CEO) or equivalent in one of the Fortune Global 500 companies, Chalmers ranked 38th in the world, ranking 1st in Sweden and 15th in Europe.

== Ties and partnerships ==
Chalmers is a member of the IDEA League network, a strategic alliance between five leading European universities of science and technology. The scope of the network is to provide the environment for students, researchers and staff to share knowledge, experience and resources.

Moreover, Chalmers is a partner of the UNITECH International, an organization consisting of distinguished technical universities and multinational companies across Europe. UNITECH offers exchange programs consisting of studies as well as an integrated internship at one of the corporate partners.

Chalmers is also a member of the Nordic Five Tech network, a strategic alliance of the five leading technical universities in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.

Additionally, Chalmers is a member of the ENHANCE, an alliance of ten leading Universities of Technology. The partner institutions have a history of solid cooperation in EU programmes and joint research projects.

Furthermore, Chalmers is a member of CESAER, a European association of universities of science and technology.

Additionally, Chalmers has established formal agreements with three leading materials science centers: University of California, Santa Barbara, ETH Zurich and Stanford University. Within the framework of the agreements, a yearly bilateral workshop is organized, and exchange of researchers is supported.

Chalmers has general exchange agreements with many European and U.S. universities and maintains a special exchange program agreement with National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Taiwan where the exchange students from the two universities maintain offices for, among other things, helping local students with applying and preparing for an exchange year as well as acting as representatives.

Finally, Chalmers has strong partnerships with major industries such as Ericsson, Volvo, Saab AB and AstraZeneca.

==Students==
Each year, around 250 postgraduate degrees are awarded as well as 850 graduate degrees. About 1,000 post-graduate students attend programmes at the university, and many students are taking Master of Science engineering programmes and the Master of Architecture programme. Since 2007, all master&#x27;s programmes are taught in English for both national and international students. This was a result of the adaptation to the Bologna process that started in 2004 at Chalmers (as the first technical university in Sweden).

As of 2025, about 17% of all students at Chalmers come from countries outside Sweden to enroll in a program at Chalmers.

Around 2,700 students also attend Bachelor of Science engineering programmes, merchant marine and other undergraduate courses at Campus Lindholmen. Chalmers also shares some students with Gothenburg University in the joint IT University project. The IT University focuses exclusively on information technology and offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programmes with degrees issued from either Chalmers or Gothenburg University, depending on the programme.

Chalmers confers honorary doctoral degrees to people outside the university who have shown great merit in their research or in society.

== Organization ==
Chalmers is an aktiebolag with 100 shares à 1,000 SEK, all of which are owned by the Chalmers University of Technology Foundation, a private foundation, which appoints the university board and the president. The foundation has its members appointed by the Swedish government (4 to 8 seats), the departments appoint one member, the student union appoints one member and the president automatically gains one chair. Each department is led by a department head, usually a member of the faculty of that department. The faculty senate represents members of the faculty when decisions are taken.

==Campuses==

In 1937, the school moved from the city centre to the new Gibraltar Campus, named after the mansion which owned the grounds, where it is now located. The Lindholmen College Campus was created in the early 1990s and is located on the island Hisingen. Campus Johanneberg and Campus Lindholmen, as they are now called, are connected by bus lines.

==Student societies and traditions==

<doc id="5691" wikidata="Q213924" url="?curid=5691" title="Codex">
<text>The codex (: codices ) was the historical ancestor format of the modern book. Technically, the vast majority of modern books use the codex format of a stack of pages bound at one edge, along the side of the text. But the term &quot;codex&quot; is now reserved for older manuscript books, which mostly used sheets of vellum, parchment, or papyrus, rather than paper.

By convention, the term is also used for any Aztec codex (although the earlier examples do not actually use the codex format), Maya codices and other pre-Columbian manuscripts. Library practices have led to many European manuscripts having &quot;codex&quot; as part of their usual name, as with the Codex Gigas, while most do not.

Modern books are divided into paperback (or softback) and those bound with stiff boards, called hardbacks. Elaborate historical bindings are called treasure bindings. At least in the Western world, the main alternative to the paged codex format for a long document was the continuous scroll, which was the dominant form of document in the ancient world. Some codices are continuously folded like a concertina, in particular the Maya codices and Aztec codices, which are actually long sheets of paper or animal skin folded into pages. In Japan, concertina-style codices made of paper and called orihon were developed during the Heian period (794–1185).

The ancient Romans developed the form from wax tablets. The gradual replacement of the scroll by the codex has been called the most important advance in book making before the invention of the printing press. The codex transformed the shape of the book itself, and offered a form that has lasted ever since. The spread of the codex is often associated with the rise of Christianity, which early on adopted the format for the Bible. First described in the 1st century of the Common Era, when the Roman poet Martial praised its convenient use, the codex achieved numerical parity with the scroll around 300 CE, and had completely replaced it throughout what was by then a Christianized Greco-Roman world by the 6th century.

==Etymology and origins==
The word codex comes from the Latin word &quot;caudex&quot;, meaning &quot;trunk of a tree&quot;, &quot;block of wood&quot; or &quot;book&quot;. The codex began to replace the scroll almost as soon as it was invented, although new finds add three centuries to its history (see below). In Egypt, by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll by ten to one based on surviving examples. By the sixth century, the scroll had almost vanished as a medium for literature. The change from rolls to codices roughly coincides with the transition from papyrus to parchment as the preferred writing material, but the two developments are unconnected. In fact, any combination of codices and scrolls with papyrus and parchment is technically feasible and common in the historical record.

Technically, even modern notebooks and paperbacks are codices, but publishers and scholars reserve the term for manuscript (hand-written) books produced from late antiquity until the Middle Ages. The scholarly study of these manuscripts is sometimes called codicology. The study of ancient documents in general is called paleography.

The codex provided considerable advantages over other book formats, primarily its compactness, sturdiness, economic use of materials by using both sides (recto and verso), and ease of reference (a codex accommodates random access, as opposed to a scroll, which uses sequential access).

==History==
The Romans used precursors made of reusable wax-covered tablets of wood for taking notes and other informal writings. Two ancient polyptychs, a &quot;pentaptych&quot; and &quot;octoptych&quot; excavated at Herculaneum, used a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on of thongs or cords. A first evidence of the use of papyrus in codex form comes from the Ptolemaic period in Egypt, as a find at the University of Graz shows.

Julius Caesar may have been the first Roman to reduce scrolls to bound pages in the form of a note-book, possibly even as a papyrus codex. At the turn of the 1st century AD, a kind of folded parchment notebook called &quot;pugillares membranei&quot; in Latin became commonly used for writing in the Roman Empire. Theodore Cressy Skeat theorized that this form of notebook was invented in Rome and then spread rapidly to the Near East.

Codices are described in certain works by the Classical Latin poet, Martial. He wrote a series of five couplets meant to accompany gifts of literature that Romans exchanged during the festival of Saturnalia. Three of these books are specifically described by Martial as being in the form of a codex; the poet praises the compendiousness of the form (as opposed to the scroll), as well as the convenience with which such a book can be read on a journey. In another poem by Martial, the poet advertises a new edition of his works, specifically noting that it is produced as a codex, taking less space than a scroll and being more comfortable to hold in one hand. According to Theodore Cressy Skeat, this might be the first recorded known case of an entire edition of a literary work (not just a single copy) being published in codex form, though it was likely an isolated case and was not a common practice until a much later time.

In his discussion of one of the earliest parchment codices to survive from Oxyrhynchus in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat&#x27;s notion when stating, &quot;its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory&quot;, and that &quot;early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt.&quot; Early codices of parchment or papyrus appear to have been widely used as personal notebooks, for instance in recording copies of letters sent (Cicero &quot;Fam.&quot; 9.26.1). Early codices were not always cohesive. They often contained multiple languages, various topics and even multiple authors. &quot;Such codices formed libraries in their own right.&quot; The parchment notebook pages were &quot;more durable, and could withstand being folded and stitched to other sheets&quot;. Parchments whose writing was no longer needed were commonly washed or scraped for re-use, creating a palimpsest; the erased text, which can often be recovered, is older and usually more interesting than the newer text which replaced it. Consequently, writings in a codex were often considered informal and impermanent. Parchment (animal skin) was expensive, and therefore it was used primarily by the wealthy and powerful, who were also able to pay for textual design and color. &quot;Official documents and deluxe manuscripts [in the late Middle Ages] were written in gold and silver ink on parchment...dyed or painted with costly purple pigments as an expression of imperial power and wealth.&quot;

As early as the early 2nd century, there is evidence that a codex—usually of papyrus—was the preferred format among Christians. In the library of the Villa of the Papyri, Herculaneum (buried in AD 79), all the texts (of Greek literature) are scrolls (see Herculaneum papyri). However, in the Nag Hammadi library, hidden about AD 390, all texts (Gnostic) are codices. Despite this comparison, a fragment of a non-Christian parchment codex of Demosthenes&#x27; &quot;De Falsa Legatione&quot; from Oxyrhynchus in Egypt demonstrates that the surviving evidence is insufficient to conclude whether Christians played a major or central role in the development of early codices—or if they simply adopted the format to distinguish themselves from Jews.

The earliest surviving fragments from codices come from Egypt, and are variously dated (always tentatively) towards the end of the 1st century or in the first half of the 2nd. This group includes the Rylands Library Papyrus P52, containing part of St John&#x27;s Gospel, and perhaps dating from between 125 and 160.

In Western culture, the codex gradually replaced the scroll. Between the 4th century, when the codex gained wide acceptance, and the Carolingian Renaissance in the 8th century, many works that were not converted from scroll to codex were lost. The codex improved on the scroll in several ways. It could be opened flat at any page for easier reading, pages could be written on both front and back (recto and verso), and the protection of durable covers made it more compact and easier to transport.

The ancients stored codices with spines facing inward, and not always vertically. The spine could be used for the incipit, before the concept of a proper title developed in medieval times. Though most early codices were made of papyrus, the material was fragile and supplied from Egypt, the only place where papyrus grew. The more durable parchment and vellum gained favor, despite the cost.

The codices of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica (Mexico and Central America) had a similar appearance when closed to the European codex, but were instead made with long folded strips of either fig bark (amatl) or plant fibers, often with a layer of whitewash applied before writing. New World codices were written as late as the 16th century (see Maya codices and Aztec codices). Those written before the Spanish conquests seem all to have been single long sheets folded concertina-style, sometimes written on both sides of the &quot;amatl&quot; paper. There are significant codices produced in the colonial era, with pictorial and alphabetic texts in Spanish or an indigenous language such as Nahuatl.

In East Asia, the scroll remained standard for far longer than in the Mediterranean world. There were intermediate stages, such as scrolls folded concertina-style and pasted together at the back and books that were printed only on one side of the paper. This replaced traditional Chinese writing mediums such as bamboo and wooden slips, as well as silk and paper scrolls. The evolution of the codex in China began with folded-leaf pamphlets in the 9th century, during the late Tang dynasty (618–907), improved by the &#x27;butterfly&#x27; bindings of the Song dynasty (960–1279), the wrapped back binding of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), the stitched binding of the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties (1644–1912), and finally the adoption of Western-style bookbinding in the 20th century. The initial phase of this evolution, the accordion-folded palm-leaf-style book, most likely came from India and was introduced to China via Buddhist missionaries and scriptures.

Judaism still retains the Torah scroll, at least for ceremonial use.

==From scrolls to codices==
Among the experiments of earlier centuries, scrolls were sometimes unrolled horizontally, as a succession of columns. The Dead Sea Scrolls are a famous example of this format, and it is the standard format for Jewish Torah scrolls made to this day for ritual use. This made it possible to fold the scroll as an accordion. The next evolutionary step was to cut the folios and sew and glue them at their centers, making it easier to use the papyrus or vellum recto-verso as with a modern book.

Traditional bookbinders would call one of these assembled, trimmed and bound folios (that is, the &quot;pages&quot; of the book as a whole, comprising the front matter and contents) a &quot;codex&quot; in contradistinction to the cover or &quot;case,&quot; producing the format of book now colloquially known as a &quot;hardcover&quot;. In the hardcover bookbinding process, the procedure of binding the codex is very different to that of producing and attaching the case.

==Preparation==
The first stage in creating a codex is to prepare the animal skin. The skin is washed with water and lime but not together. The skin is soaked in the lime for a couple of days. The hair is removed, and the skin is dried by attaching it to a frame, called a herse. The parchment maker attaches the skin at points around the circumference. The skin attaches to the herse by cords. To prevent it from being torn, the maker wraps the area of the skin attached to the cord around a pebble called a pippin. After completing that, the maker uses a crescent shaped knife called a &quot;lunarium&quot; or &quot;lunellum&quot; to remove any remaining hairs. Once the skin completely dries, the maker gives it a deep clean and processes it into sheets. The number of sheets from a piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the final product dimensions. For example, the average calfskin can provide three-and-a-half medium sheets of writing material, which can be doubled when they are folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a &quot;bifolium&quot;. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts in which the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers. Defects can often be found in the membrane, whether they are from the original animal, human error during the preparation period, or from when the animal was killed. Defects can also appear during the writing process. Unless the manuscript is kept in perfect condition, defects can also appear later in its life.

===Preparation of pages for writing===
Firstly, the membrane must be prepared. The first step is to set up the quires. The quire is a group of several sheets put together. Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in &quot;Introduction to Manuscript Studies&quot;, that &quot;the quire was the scribe&#x27;s basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages&quot;:

Pricking is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of it ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks... The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered and with vertical bounding lines that marked the boundaries of the columns.

===Forming quire===
From the Carolingian period to the end of the Middle Ages, different styles of folding the quire came about. For example, in continental Europe throughout the Middle Ages, the quire was put into a system in which each side folded on to the same style. The hair side met the hair side and the flesh side to the flesh side. This was not the same style used in the British Isles, where the membrane was folded so that it turned out an eight-leaf quire, with single leaves in the third and sixth positions. The next stage was tacking the quire. Tacking is when the scribe would hold together the leaves in quire with thread. Once threaded together, the scribe would then sew a line of parchment up the &quot;spine&quot; of the manuscript to protect the tacking.

===Materials===
The materials codices are made with are their support, and include papyrus, parchment (sometimes referred to as membrane or vellum), and paper. They are written and drawn on with metals, pigments, and ink. The quality, size, and choice of support determine the status of a codex. Papyrus is found only in late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Codices intended for display were bound with more durable materials than vellum. Parchment varied widely due to animal species and finish, and identification of animals used to make it has only begun to be studied in the 21st century. How manufacturing influenced the final products, technique, and style, is little understood. However, changes in style are underpinned more by variation in technique. Before the 14th and 15th centuries, paper was expensive, and its use may mark off the deluxe copy.

===Structure===
The structure of a codex includes its size, format/&quot;ordinatio&quot; (its quires or gatherings), consisting of sheets folded a number of times, often twice- a &quot;bifolio&quot;, sewing, bookbinding, and rebinding. A quire consisted of a number of folded sheets inserting into one another- at least three, but most commonly four bifolia, that is eight sheets and sixteen pages: Latin quaternio or Greek tetradion, which became a synonym for quires. Unless an exemplar (text to be copied) was copied exactly, format differed. In preparation for writing codices, ruling patterns were used that determined the layout of each page. Holes were prickled with a spiked lead wheel and a circle. Ruling was then applied separately on each page or once through the top folio. Ownership markings, decorations, and illumination are also a part of it. They are specific to the scriptoria, or any production center, and libraries of codices.

===Pages===
Watermarks may provide, although often approximate, dates for when the copying occurred. The layout (size of the margin and the number of lines) is determined. There may be textual articulations, running heads, openings, chapters, and paragraphs. Space was reserved for illustrations and decorated guide letters. The apparatus of books for scholars became more elaborate during the 13th and 14th centuries when chapter, verse, page numbering, marginalia finding guides, indexes, glossaries, and tables of contents were developed.

===The &quot;libraire&quot;===
By a close examination of the physical attributes of a codex, it is sometimes possible to match up long-separated elements originally from the same book. In 13th-century book publishing, due to secularization, stationers or &quot;libraires&quot; emerged. They would receive commissions for texts, which they would contract out to scribes, illustrators, and binders, to whom they supplied materials. Due to the systematic format used for assembly by the &quot;libraire&quot;, the structure can be used to reconstruct the original order of a manuscript. However, complications can arise in the study of a codex. Manuscripts were frequently rebound, and this resulted in a particular codex incorporating works of different dates and origins, thus different internal structures. Additionally, a binder could alter or unify these structures to ensure a better fit for the new binding. Completed quires or books of quires might constitute independent book units- booklets, which could be returned to the stationer, or combined with other texts to make anthologies or miscellanies. Exemplars were sometimes divided into quires for simultaneous copying and loaned out to students for study. To facilitate this, catchwords were used- a word at the end of a page providing the next page&#x27;s first word.

<text>A calf (: calves) is a young domestic cow or bull. Calves are reared to become adult cattle or are slaughtered for their meat, called veal, and their hide.

The term &quot;calf&quot; is also used for some other species. See &quot;Other animals&quot; below.

== Terminology ==
&quot;Calf&quot; is the term used from birth to weaning, when it becomes known as a &quot;weaner&quot; or &quot;weaner calf&quot;, though in some areas the term &quot;calf&quot; may be used until the animal is a . The birth of a calf is known as &quot;calving&quot;. A calf that has lost its mother is an orphan calf, also known as a &quot;poddy&quot; or &quot;poddy-calf&quot; in British. &quot;Bobby calves&quot; are young calves which are to be slaughtered for human consumption. A &quot;vealer&quot; is a calf weighing less than about which is at about eight to nine months of age. A young female calf from birth until she has had a calf of her own is called a &quot;heifer&quot;
(). In the American Old West, a motherless or small, runty calf was sometimes referred to as a dodie.

The term &quot;calf&quot; is also used for some other species. See &quot;Other animals&quot; below.

== Early development ==
Calves may be produced by natural means, or by artificial breeding using artificial insemination or embryo transfer.

Calves are born after nine months. They usually stand within a few minutes of calving, and suckle within an hour. However, for the first few days they are not easily able to keep up with the rest of the herd, so young calves are often left hidden by their mothers, who visit them several times a day to suckle them. By a week old the calf is able to follow the mother all the time.

Some calves are ear tagged soon after birth, especially those that are stud cattle in order to correctly identify their dams (mothers), or in areas (such as the EU) where tagging is a legal requirement for cattle. Typically when the calves are about two months old they are branded, ear marked, castrated and vaccinated.

== Calf rearing systems ==

The &quot;single suckler&quot; system of rearing calves is similar to that occurring naturally in wild cattle, where each calf is suckled by its own mother until it is weaned at about nine months old. This system is commonly used for rearing beef cattle throughout the world.

Cows kept on poor forage (as is typical in subsistence farming) produce a limited amount of milk. A calf left with such a mother all the time can easily drink all the milk, leaving none for human consumption. For dairy production under such circumstances, the calf&#x27;s access to the cow must be limited, for example by penning the calf and bringing the mother to it once a day after partly milking her. The small amount of milk available for the calf under such systems may mean that it takes a longer time to rear, and in subsistence farming it is therefore common for cows to calve only in alternate years.

In more intensive dairy farming, cows can easily be bred and fed to produce far more milk than one calf can drink. In the &quot;multi-suckler&quot; system, several calves are fostered onto one cow in addition to her own, and these calves&#x27; mothers can then be used wholly for milk production. More commonly, calves of dairy cows are fed formula milk from soon after birth, usually from a bottle or bucket.

Purebred female calves of dairy cows are reared as replacement dairy cows. Most purebred dairy calves are produced by artificial insemination (AI). By this method each bull can serve many cows, so only a very few of the purebred dairy male calves are needed to provide bulls for breeding. The remainder of the male calves may be reared for beef or veal. Only a proportion of purebred heifers are needed to provide replacement cows, so often some of the cows in dairy herds are put to a beef bull to produce crossbred calves suitable for rearing as beef.

Veal calves may be reared entirely on milk formula and killed at about 18 or 20 weeks as &quot;white&quot; veal, or fed on grain and hay and killed at 22 to 35 weeks to produce red or pink veal.

== Growth ==
A commercial steer or bull calf is expected to put on about per month. A nine-month-old steer or bull is therefore expected to weigh about . Heifers will weigh at least at eight months of age.
Calves are usually weaned at about eight to nine months of age, but depending on the season and condition of the dam, they might be weaned earlier. They may be paddock weaned, often next to their mothers, or weaned in stockyards. The latter system is preferred by some as it accustoms the weaners to the presence of people and they are trained to take feed other than grass. Small numbers may also be weaned with their dams with the use of weaning nose rings or nosebands which results in the mothers rejecting the calves&#x27; attempts to suckle. Many calves are also weaned when they are taken to the large weaner auction sales that are conducted in the south eastern states of Australia. Victoria and New South Wales have (sale yard numbers) of up to 8,000 weaners (calves) for auction sale in one day. The best of these weaners may go to the butchers. Others will be purchased by re-stockers to grow out and fatten on grass or as potential breeders. In the United States these weaners may be known as &quot;feeders&quot; and would be placed directly into feedlots.

At about 12 months old a beef heifer reaches puberty if she is well grown.

== Diseases ==
Calves suffer from few congenital abnormalities but the Akabane virus is widely distributed in temperate to tropical regions of the world. The virus is a teratogenic pathogen which causes spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, premature births and congenital abnormalities, but occurs only during some years.

Calves commonly face on-farm acquired diseases, often of infectious nature. Preweaned calves most commonly experience conditions such as diarrhea, omphalitis, lameness and respiratory diseases. Diarrhea, omphalitis and lameness are most common in calves aged up to two weeks, while the frequency of respiratory diseases tends to increase with age. These conditions also display seasonal patterns, with omphalitis being more common in the summer months, and respiratory diseases and diarrhea occurring more frequently in the fall.

== Uses ==
Calf meat for human consumption is called veal, and is usually produced from the male calves of dairy cattle. Also eaten are calf&#x27;s brains and calf liver. The hide is used to make calfskin, or tanned into leather and called calf leather, or sometimes in the US &quot;novillo&quot;, the Spanish term. The fourth compartment of the stomach of slaughtered milk-fed calves is the source of rennet. The intestine is used to make Goldbeater&#x27;s skin, and is the source of Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIP).

Dairy heifers and cows can only produce milk after having calved. Dairy cows need to produce one calf each year in order to remain in milk production. Heifer (female) calves will nearly always become a replacement dairy cow. Some dairy heifers grow up to be mothers of beef cattle. Male dairy calves are generally reared for beef or veal; relatively few are kept for use as breeding stock.

== Other animals ==

In English, the term &quot;calf&quot; is used by extension for the young of various other large species of mammal. In addition to other bovid species (such as bison, yak and water buffalo), these include the young of camels, dolphins, elephants, giraffes, hippopotamuses, deer (such as moose, elk (wapiti) and red deer), rhinoceroses, porpoises, whales, walruses and larger seals. (Generally, the adult males of these same species are called &quot;bulls&quot; and the adult females &quot;cows&quot;.) However, common domestic species tend to have their own specific names, such as lamb, foal used for all &quot;Equidae&quot;, or piglet used for all suidae.

<doc id="5693" wikidata="Q92760" url="?curid=5693" title="Claude Shannon">
<text>Claude Elwood Shannon (April 30, 1916 – February 24, 2001) was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, computer scientist, cryptographer and inventor known as the &quot;father of information theory&quot; and as the &quot;father of the Information Age&quot;. Shannon was the first to describe the Boolean gates (electronic circuits) that are essential to all digital electronic circuits, and was one of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence. Shannon is credited with laying the foundations of the Information Age.

At the University of Michigan, Shannon dual degreed, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in both electrical engineering and mathematics in 1936. A 21-year-old master&#x27;s degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in electrical engineering, his thesis concerned switching circuit theory, demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship, thereby establishing the theory behind digital computing and digital circuits. The thesis has been claimed to be the most important master&#x27;s thesis of all time, having also been called the &quot;birth certificate of the digital revolution&quot;, and winning the 1939 Alfred Noble Prize. He then graduated with a PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1940, with his thesis focused on genetics, with it deriving important results, but it went unpublished.

Shannon contributed to the field of cryptanalysis for national defense of the United States during World War II, including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications, writing a paper which is considered one of the foundational pieces of modern cryptography, with his work described as &quot;a turning point, and marked the closure of classical cryptography and the beginning of modern cryptography.&quot; The work of Shannon is the foundation of secret-key cryptography, including the work of Horst Feistel, the Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and more. As a result, Shannon has been called the &quot;founding father of modern cryptography&quot;.

His &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot; paper in 1948 laid the foundations for the field of information theory, with his famous paper referred to as a &quot;blueprint for the digital era&quot; by electrical engineer Robert G. Gallager. It has been called &quot;the Magna Carta of the Information Age&quot; by &quot;Scientific American,&quot; along with his work being described as being at &quot;the heart of today&#x27;s digital information technology&quot;. The mathematician Solomon W. Golomb remarked on Shannon&#x27;s influence on the digital age that &quot;It&#x27;s like saying how much influence the inventor of the alphabet has had on literature.&quot; Shannon&#x27;s theory is widely used and has been fundamental to the success of many scientific endeavors, such as the invention of the compact disc, the development of the Internet, feasibility of mobile phones, the understanding of black holes, and more, and is at the intersection of numerous important fields. Shannon also formally introduced the term &quot;bit&quot;.

Shannon made numerous contributions to the field of artificial intelligence, writing papers on programming a computer for chess, which have been immensely influential. His Theseus machine was the first electrical device to learn by trial and error, being one of the first examples of artificial intelligence. He also co-organized and participated in the Dartmouth workshop of 1956, considered the founding event of the field of artificial intelligence. 

Roboticist Rodney Brooks declared that Shannon was the 20th century engineer who contributed the most to 21st century technologies, and Golomb described the intellectual achievement of Shannon as &quot;one of the greatest of the twentieth century&quot;. His achievements are considered to be on par with those of Albert Einstein, Sir Isaac Newton, and Charles Darwin.

==Biography==

===Childhood===
The Shannon family lived in Gaylord, Michigan, and Claude was born in a hospital that was nearby Petoskey. His father, Claude Sr. (1862–1934), was a businessman and, for a while, a judge of probate in Gaylord. His mother, Mabel Wolf Shannon (1880–1945), was a language teacher, who also served as the principal of Gaylord High School. Claude Sr. was a descendant of New Jersey settlers, while Mabel was a child of German immigrants. Shannon&#x27;s family was active in their Methodist Church during his youth.

Most of the first 16 years of Shannon&#x27;s life were spent in Gaylord, where he attended public school, graduating from Gaylord High School in 1932. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things. His best subjects were science and mathematics. At home, he constructed such devices as models of planes, a radio-controlled model boat and a barbed-wire telegraph system to a friend&#x27;s house a half-mile away. While growing up, he also worked as a messenger for the Western Union company.

Shannon&#x27;s childhood hero was Thomas Edison, whom he later learned was a distant cousin. Both Shannon and Edison were descendants of John Ogden (1609–1682), a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people.

===Logic circuits===
In 1932, Shannon entered the University of Michigan, where he was introduced to the work of George Boole. He graduated in 1936 with two bachelor&#x27;s degrees: one in electrical engineering and the other in mathematics.

In 1936, Shannon began his graduate studies in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he worked on Vannevar Bush&#x27;s differential analyzer, which was an early analog computer that was composed of electromechanical parts and could solve differential equations. While studying the complicated &quot;ad hoc&quot; circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed switching circuits based on Boole&#x27;s concepts. In 1937, he wrote his master&#x27;s degree thesis, &quot;A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits,&quot; with a paper from this thesis published in 1938. A revolutionary work for switching circuit theory, Shannon diagramed switching circuits that could implement the essential operators of Boolean algebra. Then he proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays that were used during that time in telephone call routing switches. Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could solve. In the last chapter, he presented diagrams of several circuits, including a digital 4-bit full adder. His work differed significantly from the work of previous engineers such as Akira Nakashima, who still relied on the existent circuit theory of the time and took a grounded approach. Shannon&#x27;s idea were more abstract and relied on mathematics, thereby breaking new ground with his work, with his approach dominating modern-day electrical engineering.

Using electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Shannon&#x27;s work became the foundation of digital circuit design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after World War II. The theoretical rigor of Shannon&#x27;s work superseded the &quot;ad hoc&quot; methods that had prevailed previously. Howard Gardner hailed Shannon&#x27;s thesis &quot;possibly the most important, and also the most famous, master&#x27;s thesis of the century.&quot; Herman Goldstine described it as &quot;surely ... one of the most important master&#x27;s theses ever written ... It helped to change digital circuit design from an art to a science.&quot; One of the reviewers of his work commented that &quot;To the best of my knowledge, this is the first application of the methods of symbolic logic to so practical an engineering problem. From the point of view of originality I rate the paper as outstanding.&quot; Shannon&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis won the 1939 Alfred Noble Prize.

Shannon received his PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1940. Vannevar Bush had suggested that Shannon should work on his dissertation at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, in order to develop a mathematical formulation for Mendelian genetics. This research resulted in Shannon&#x27;s PhD thesis, called &quot;An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics&quot;. However, the thesis went unpublished after Shannon lost interest, but it did contain important results. Notably, he was one of the first to apply an algebraic framework to study theoretical population genetics. In addition, Shannon devised a general expression for the distribution of several linked traits in a population after multiple generations under a random mating system, which was original at the time, with the new theorem unworked out by other population geneticists of the time.

In 1940, Shannon became a National Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In Princeton, Shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl and John von Neumann, and he also had occasional encounters with Albert Einstein and Kurt Gödel. Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical information theory.

===Wartime research===
Shannon had worked at Bell Labs for a few months in the summer of 1937, and returned there to work on fire-control systems and cryptography during World War II, under a contract with section D-2 (Control Systems section) of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC).

Shannon is credited with the invention of signal-flow graphs, in 1942. He discovered the topological gain formula while investigating the functional operation of an analog computer.

For two months early in 1943, Shannon came into contact with the leading British mathematician Alan Turing. Turing had been posted to Washington to share with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s cryptanalytic service the methods used by the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park to break the cyphers used by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; U-boats in the north Atlantic Ocean. He was also interested in the encipherment of speech and to this end spent time at Bell Labs. Shannon and Turing met at teatime in the cafeteria. Turing showed Shannon his 1936 paper that defined what is now known as the &quot;universal Turing machine&quot;. This impressed Shannon, as many of its ideas complemented his own.

Shannon and his team developed anti-aircraft systems that tracked enemy missiles and planes, while also determining the paths for intercepting missiles.

In 1945, as the war was coming to an end, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on fire control, a special essay titled &quot;Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems&quot;, coauthored by Shannon, Ralph Beebe Blackman, and Hendrik Wade Bode, formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire-control by analogy with &quot;the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems.&quot; In other words, it modeled the problem in terms of data and signal processing and thus heralded the coming of the Information Age.

Shannon&#x27;s work on cryptography was even more closely related to his later publications on communication theory. At the close of the war, he prepared a classified memorandum for Bell Telephone Labs entitled &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography&quot;, dated September 1945. A declassified version of this paper was published in 1949 as &quot;Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems&quot; in the &quot;Bell System Technical Journal&quot;. This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;. Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously, and that &quot;they were so close together you couldn&#x27;t separate them&quot;. In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to &quot;develop these results … in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information.&quot;

While he was at Bell Labs, Shannon proved that the cryptographic one-time pad is unbreakable in his classified research that was later published in 1949. The same article also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one-time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and kept secret.

===Information theory===
In 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;, an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the &quot;Bell System Technical Journal&quot;. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the message a sender wants to transmit. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure of the information content in a message, which is a measure of uncertainty reduced by the message. In so doing, he essentially invented the field of information theory.

The book &quot;The Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot; reprints Shannon&#x27;s 1948 article and Warren Weaver&#x27;s popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. Weaver pointed out that the word &quot;information&quot; in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one&#x27;s freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon&#x27;s concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce&#x27;s &quot;Symbols, Signals, and Noise&quot;.

Information theory&#x27;s fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics was further established in 1951, in his article &quot;Prediction and Entropy of Printed English&quot;, showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of English – giving a statistical foundation to language analysis. In addition, he proved that treating space as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

Another notable paper published in 1949 is &quot;Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems&quot;, a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography, in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable cyphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is credited with the introduction of sampling theorem, which he had derived as early as 1940, and which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later. He further wrote a paper in 1956 regarding coding for a noisy channel, which also became a classic paper in the field of information theory. However, also in 1956 he wrote a one-page editorial for the &quot;IRE Transactions on Information Theory&quot; entitled &quot;The Bandwagon&quot; which he began by observing: &quot;Information theory has, in the last few years, become something of a scientific bandwagon&quot; and which he concluded by warning: &quot;Only by maintaining a thoroughly scientific attitude can we achieve real progress in communication theory and consolidate our present position.&quot;

Claude Shannon&#x27;s influence has been immense in the field, for example, in a 1973 collection of the key papers in the field of information theory, he was author or coauthor of 12 of the 49 papers cited, while no one else appeared more than three times. Even beyond his original paper in 1948, he is still regarded as the most important post-1948 contributor to the theory.

In May 1951, Mervin Kelly received a request from the director of the CIA, general Walter Bedell Smith, regarding Shannon and the need for him, as Shannon was regarded as, based on &quot;the best authority&quot;, the &quot;most eminently qualified scientist in the particular field concerned&quot;. As a result of the request, Shannon became part of the CIA&#x27;s Special Cryptologic Advisory Group or SCAG.

===Artificial Intelligence===
In 1950, Shannon designed and built, with the help of his wife, a learning machine named Theseus. It consisted of a maze on a surface, through which a mechanical mouse could move. Below the surface were sensors that followed the path of a mechanical mouse through the maze. After much trial and error, this device would learn the shortest path through the maze, and direct the mechanical mouse through the maze. The pattern of the maze could be changed at will.

Mazin Gilbert stated that Theseus &quot;inspired the whole field of AI. This random trial and error is the foundation of artificial intelligence.&quot;

Shannon wrote multiple influential papers on artificial intelligence, such as his 1950 paper titled &quot;Programming a Computer for Playing Chess&quot;, and his 1953 paper titled &quot;Computers and Automata&quot;. Alongside John McCarthy, he co-edited a book titled &quot;Automata Studies&quot;, which was published in 1956. The categories in the articles within the volume were influenced by Shannon&#x27;s own subject headings in his 1953 paper. Shannon shared McCarthy&#x27;s goal of creating a science of intelligent machines, but also held a broader view of viable approaches in automata studies, such as neural nets, Turing machines, cybernetic mechanisms, and symbolic processing by computer.

Shannon co-organized and participated in the Dartmouth workshop of 1956, alongside John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky and Nathaniel Rochester, and which is considered the founding event of the field of artificial intelligence.

===Teaching at MIT===
In 1956 Shannon joined the MIT faculty, holding an endowed chair. He worked in the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE). He continued to serve on the MIT faculty until 1978.

===Later life===
Shannon developed Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and spent the last few years of his life in a nursing home; he died in 2001, survived by his wife, a son and daughter, and two granddaughters.

=== Hobbies and inventions ===

Outside of Shannon&#x27;s academic pursuits, he was interested in juggling, unicycling, and chess. He also invented many devices, including a Roman numeral computer called THROBAC, and juggling machines. He built a device that could solve the Rubik&#x27;s Cube puzzle.

Shannon also invented flame-throwing trumpets, rocket-powered frisbees, and plastic foam shoes for navigating a lake, and which to an observer, would appear as if Shannon was walking on water.

Shannon designed the Minivac 601, a digital computer trainer to teach business people about how computers functioned. It was sold by the Scientific Development Corp starting in 1961.

He is also considered the co-inventor of the first wearable computer along with Edward O. Thorp. The device was used to improve the odds when playing roulette.

===Personal life===

Shannon married Norma Levor, a wealthy, Jewish, left-wing intellectual in January 1940. The marriage ended in divorce after about a year. Levor later married Ben Barzman.

Shannon met his second wife, Mary Elizabeth Moore (Betty), when she was a numerical analyst at Bell Labs. They were married in 1949. Betty assisted Claude in building some of his most famous inventions. They had three children.

Shannon presented himself as apolitical and an atheist.

===Tributes and legacy===

There are six statues of Shannon sculpted by Eugene Daub: one at the University of Michigan; one at MIT in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems; one in Gaylord, Michigan; one at the University of California, San Diego; one at Bell Labs; and another at AT&amp;T Shannon Labs. The statue in Gaylord is located in the Claude Shannon Memorial Park. After the breakup of the Bell System, the part of Bell Labs that remained with AT&amp;T Corporation was named Shannon Labs in his honor.

In June 1954, Shannon was listed as one of the top 20 most important scientists in America by &quot;Fortune&quot;. In 2013, information theory was listed as one of the top 10 revolutionary scientific theories by &quot;Science News&quot;.

According to Neil Sloane, an AT&amp;T Fellow who co-edited Shannon&#x27;s large collection of papers in 1993, the perspective introduced by Shannon&#x27;s communication theory (now called &quot;information theory&quot;) is the foundation of the digital revolution, and every device containing a microprocessor or microcontroller is a conceptual descendant of Shannon&#x27;s publication in 1948: &quot;He&#x27;s one of the great men of the century. Without him, none of the things we know today would exist. The whole digital revolution started with him.&quot; The cryptocurrency unit shannon (a synonym for gwei) is named after him.

Shannon is credited by many as single-handedly creating information theory and for laying the foundations for the Digital Age.

The artificial intelligence large language model family Claude (language model) was named in Shannon&#x27;s honor.

&quot;A Mind at Play&quot;, a biography of Shannon written by Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman, was published in 2017. They described Shannon as &quot;the most important genius you’ve never heard of, a man whose intellect was on par with Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton&quot;. Consultant and writer Tom Rutledge, writing for Boston Review, stated that &quot;Of the computer pioneers who drove the mid-20th-century information technology revolution—an elite men’s club of scholar-engineers who also helped crack Nazi codes and pinpoint missile trajectories—Shannon may have been the most brilliant of them all.&quot; Electrical engineer Robert Gallager stated about Shannon that &quot;He had this amazing clarity of vision. Einstein had it, too – this ability to take on a complicated problem and find the right way to look at it, so that things become very simple.&quot; In an obituary by Neil Sloane and Robert Calderbank, they stated that &quot;Shannon must rank near the top of the list of major figures of twentieth century science&quot;. Due to his work in multiple fields, Shannon is also regarded as a polymath.

Historian James Gleick noted the importance of Shannon, stating that &quot;Einstein looms large, and rightly so. But we’re not living in the relativity age, we’re living in the information age. It’s Shannon whose fingerprints are on every electronic device we own, every computer screen we gaze into, every means of digital communication. He’s one of these people who so transform the world that, after the transformation, the old world is forgotten.&quot; Gleick further noted that &quot;he created a whole field from scratch, from the brow of Zeus&quot;.

On April 30, 2016, Shannon was honored with a Google Doodle to celebrate his life on what would have been his 100th birthday.

&quot;The Bit Player&quot;, a feature film about Shannon directed by Mark Levinson premiered at the World Science Festival in 2019. Drawn from interviews conducted with Shannon in his house in the 1980s, the film was released on Amazon Prime in August 2020.

==&quot;The Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;==

=== Weaver&#x27;s Contribution ===
Shannon&#x27;s &quot;The Mathematical Theory of Communication,&quot; begins with an interpretation of his own work by Warren Weaver. Although Shannon&#x27;s entire work is about communication itself, Warren Weaver communicated his ideas in such a way that those not acclimated to complex theory and mathematics could comprehend the fundamental laws he put forth. The coupling of their unique communicational abilities and ideas generated the Shannon-Weaver model, although the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings emanate entirely from Shannon&#x27;s work after Weaver&#x27;s introduction. For the layman, Weaver&#x27;s introduction better communicates &quot;The Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;, but Shannon&#x27;s subsequent logic, mathematics, and expressive precision was responsible for defining the problem itself.

==Other work==

===Shannon&#x27;s mouse===
&quot;Theseus&quot;, created in 1950, was a mechanical mouse controlled by an electromechanical relay circuit that enabled it to move around a labyrinth of 25 squares. The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions. The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior. Shannon&#x27;s mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.

===Shannon&#x27;s estimate for the complexity of chess===

In 1949 Shannon completed a paper (published in March 1950) which estimates the game-tree complexity of chess, which is approximately 10120. This number is now often referred to as the &quot;Shannon number&quot;, and is still regarded today as an accurate estimate of the game&#x27;s complexity. The number is often cited as one of the barriers to solving the game of chess using an exhaustive analysis (i.e. brute force analysis).

===Shannon&#x27;s computer chess program===
On March 9, 1949, Shannon presented a paper called &quot;Programming a Computer for playing Chess&quot;. The paper was presented at the National Institute for Radio Engineers Convention in New York. He described how to program a computer to play chess based on position scoring and move selection. He proposed basic strategies for restricting the number of possibilities to be considered in a game of chess. In March 1950 it was published in &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;, and is considered one of the first articles published on the topic of programming a computer for playing chess, and using a computer to solve the game. In 1950, Shannon wrote an article titled &quot;A Chess-Playing Machine&quot;, which was published in &quot;Scientific American.&quot; Both papers have had immense influence and laid the foundations for future chess programs.

His process for having the computer decide on which move to make was a minimax procedure, based on an evaluation function of a given chess position. Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position. &quot;Material&quot; was counted according to the usual chess piece relative value (1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen). He considered some positional factors, subtracting ½ point for each doubled pawn, backward pawn, and isolated pawn; &quot;mobility&quot; was incorporated by adding 0.1 point for each legal move available.

===Shannon&#x27;s maxim===
Shannon formulated a version of Kerckhoffs&#x27; principle as &quot;The enemy knows the system&quot;. In this form it is known as &quot;Shannon&#x27;s maxim&quot;.

===Miscellaneous===
Shannon also contributed to combinatorics and detection theory. His 1948 paper introduced many tools used in combinatorics. He did work on detection theory in 1944, with his work being one of the earliest expositions of the “matched filter” principle.

He was known as a successful investor who gave lectures on investing. A report from &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; on August 11, 1986, detailed the recent performance of 1,026 mutual funds, and Shannon achieved a higher return than 1,025 of them. Comparing the portfolio of Shannon from the late 1950s to 1986, to Warren Buffett&#x27;s of 1965 to 1995, Shannon had a return of about 28% percent, compared to 27% for Buffett. One such method of Shannon&#x27;s was labeled Shannon&#x27;s demon, which was to form a portfolio of equal parts cash and a stock, and rebalance regularly to take advantage of the stock&#x27;s randomly jittering price movements. Shannon reportedly long thought of publishing about investing, but ultimately did not, despite giving multiple lectures. He was one of the first investors to download stock prices, and a snapshot of his portfolio in 1981 was found to be $582,717.50, translating to $1.5 million in 2015, excluding another one of his stocks.

==Commemorations==

===Shannon centenary===
The Shannon centenary, 2016, marked the life and influence of Claude Elwood Shannon on the hundredth anniversary of his birth on April 30, 1916. It was inspired in part by the Alan Turing Year. An ad hoc committee of the IEEE Information Theory Society including Christina Fragouli, Rüdiger Urbanke, Michelle Effros, Lav Varshney and Sergio Verdú, coordinated worldwide events. The initiative was announced in the History Panel at the 2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop Jerusalem and the IEEE Information Theory Society newsletter.

A detailed listing of confirmed events was available on the website of the IEEE Information Theory Society.

Some of the activities included:
* Bell Labs hosted the First Shannon Conference on the Future of the Information Age on April 28–29, 2016, in Murray Hill, New Jersey, to celebrate Claude Shannon and the continued impact of his legacy on society. The event includes keynote speeches by global luminaries and visionaries of the information age who will explore the impact of information theory on society and our digital future, informal recollections, and leading technical presentations on subsequent related work in other areas such as bioinformatics, economic systems, and social networks. There is also a student competition
* Bell Labs launched a Web exhibit on April 30, 2016, chronicling Shannon&#x27;s hiring at Bell Labs (under an NDRC contract with US Government), his subsequent work there from 1942 through 1957, and details of Mathematics Department. The exhibit also displayed bios of colleagues and managers during his tenure, as well as original versions of some of the technical memoranda which subsequently became well known in published form.
* The Republic of Macedonia issued a commemorative stamp. A USPS commemorative stamp is being proposed, with an active petition.
* A documentary on Claude Shannon and on the impact of information theory, The Bit Player, was produced by Sergio Verdú and Mark Levinson.
* A trans-Atlantic celebration of both George Boole&#x27;s bicentenary and Claude Shannon&#x27;s centenary that is being led by University College Cork and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A first event was a workshop in Cork, When Boole Meets Shannon, and will continue with exhibits at the Boston Museum of Science and at the MIT Museum.
* Many organizations around the world are holding observance events, including the Boston Museum of Science, the Heinz-Nixdorf Museum, the Institute for Advanced Study, Technische Universität Berlin, University of South Australia (UniSA), Unicamp (Universidade Estadual de Campinas), University of Toronto, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cairo University, Telecom ParisTech, National Technical University of Athens, Indian Institute of Science, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Nanyang Technological University of Singapore, University of Maryland, University of Illinois at Chicago, École Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), University of California Los Angeles, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

<doc id="5695" wikidata="Q177634" url="?curid=5695" title="Community">
<text>A community is a social unit (a group of people) with a shared socially-significant characteristic, such as place, set of norms, culture, religion, values, customs, or identity. Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable good relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to people&#x27;s identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, TV network, society, or humanity at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, &quot;community&quot; may also refer to large-group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.

In terms of sociological categories, a community can seem like a sub-set of a social collectivity.
In developmental views, a community can emerge out of a collectivity.

The English-language word &quot;community&quot; derives from the Old French (Modern French: &quot;&quot;), which comes from the Latin &quot;communitas&quot; &quot;community&quot;, &quot;public spirit&quot; (from Latin &quot;&quot;, &quot;common&quot;).

Human communities may have intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.

==Perspectives of various disciplines==

===Archaeology===
Archaeological studies of social communities use the term &quot;community&quot; in two ways, mirroring usage in other areas. The first meaning is an informal definition of community as a place where people used to live. In this literal sense it is synonymous with the concept of an ancient settlement—whether a hamlet, village, town, or city. The second meaning resembles the usage of the term in other social sciences: a community is a group of people living near one another who interact socially. Social interaction on a small scale can be difficult to identify with archaeological data. Most reconstructions of social communities by archaeologists rely on the principle that social interaction in the past was conditioned by physical distance. Therefore, a small village settlement likely constituted a social community and spatial subdivisions of cities and other large settlements may have formed communities. Archaeologists typically use similarities in material culture—from house types to styles of pottery—to reconstruct communities in the past. This classification method relies on the assumption that people or households will share more similarities in the types and styles of their material goods with other members of a social community than they will with outsiders.

=== Sociology ===
Early sociological studies identified communities as fringe groups at the behest of local power elites. Such early academic studies include &quot;Who Governs?&quot; by Robert Dahl as well as the papers by Floyd Hunter on Atlanta. At the turn of the 21st century the concept of community was rediscovered by academics, politicians, and activists. Politicians hoping for a democratic election started to realign with community interests.

===Ecology===
In ecology, a community is an assemblage of populations—potentially of different species—interacting with one another. Community ecology is the branch of ecology that studies interactions between and among species. It considers how such interactions, along with interactions between species and the abiotic environment, affect social structure and species richness, diversity and patterns of abundance. Species interact in three ways: competition, predation and mutualism:
* Competition typically results in a double negative—that is both species lose in the interaction.
* Predation involves a win/lose situation, with one species winning.
* Mutualism sees both species co-operating in some way, with both winning.

The two main types of ecological communities are major communities, which are self-sustaining and self-regulating (such as a forest or a lake), and minor communities, which rely on other communities (like fungi decomposing a log) and are the building blocks of major communities. Moreover, we can establish other non-taxonomic subdivisions of biocenosis, such as guilds.

=== Semantics ===
The concept of &quot;community&quot; often has a positive semantic connotation, exploited rhetorically by populist politicians and by advertisers
to promote feelings and associations of mutual well-being, happiness and togetherness—veering towards an almost-achievable utopian community.

In contrast, the epidemiological term &quot;community transmission&quot; can have negative implications, and instead of a &quot;criminal community&quot; one often speaks of a &quot;criminal underworld&quot; or of the &quot;criminal fraternity&quot;.

==Key concepts==

===&quot;Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft&quot;===
In (1887), German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies described two types of human association: (usually translated as &quot;community&quot;) and (&quot;society&quot; or &quot;association&quot;). Tönnies proposed the &quot;–&quot; dichotomy as a way to think about social ties. No group is exclusively one or the other. stress personal social interactions, and the roles, values, and beliefs based on such interactions. stress indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, and beliefs based on such interactions.

===Sense of community===
In a seminal 1986 study, McMillan and Chavis identify four elements of &quot;sense of community&quot;:

# membership: feeling of belonging or of sharing a sense of personal relatedness,
# influence: mattering, making a difference to a group and of the group mattering to its members
# reinforcement: integration and fulfillment of needs,
# shared emotional connection.

A &quot;sense of community index&quot; (SCI) was developed by Chavis and colleagues, and revised and adapted by others. Although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods, the index has been adapted for use in schools, the workplace, and a variety of types of communities.

Studies conducted by the APPA indicate that young adults who feel a sense of belonging in a community, particularly small communities, develop fewer psychiatric and depressive disorders than those who do not have the feeling of love and belonging.

====Socialization====

The process of learning to adopt the behavior patterns of the community is called socialization. The most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which individuals develop the skills and knowledge and learn the roles necessary to function within their culture and social environment. For some psychologists, especially those in the psychodynamic tradition, the most important period of socialization is between the ages of one and ten. But socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment where they must learn a new set of behaviors.

Socialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community norms. Other important influences include schools, peer groups, people, mass media, the workplace, and government. The degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one&#x27;s willingness to engage with others. The norms of tolerance, reciprocity, and trust are important &quot;habits of the heart&quot;, as de Tocqueville put it, in an individual&#x27;s involvement in community.

==Development==
Community development is often linked with community work or community planning, and may involve stakeholders, foundations, governments, or contracted entities including non-government organisations (NGOs), universities or government agencies to progress the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities. More grassroots efforts, called community building or community organizing, seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities. These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda. Community development practitioners understand how to work with individuals and affect communities&#x27; positions within the context of larger social institutions. Public administrators, in contrast, understand community development in the context of rural and urban development, housing and economic development, and community, organizational and business development.

Formal accredited programs conducted by universities, as part of degree granting institutions, are often used to build a knowledge base to drive curricula in public administration, sociology and community studies. The General Social Survey from the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and the Saguaro Seminar at the Harvard Kennedy School are examples of national community development in the United States. The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in New York State offers core courses in community and economic development, and in areas ranging from non-profit development to US budgeting (federal to local, community funds). In the United Kingdom, the University of Oxford has led in providing extensive research in the field through its &quot;Community Development Journal,&quot; used worldwide by sociologists and community development practitioners.

At the intersection between community &quot;development&quot; and community &quot;building&quot; are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools. One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of Northwestern University. The institute makes available downloadable tools to assess community assets and make connections between non-profit groups and other organizations that can help in community building. The Institute focuses on helping communities develop by &quot;mobilizing neighborhood assets&quot; – building from the inside out rather than the outside in. In the disability field, community building was prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s with roots in John McKnight&#x27;s approaches.

===Building and organizing===
In &quot;The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace&quot; (1987) Scott Peck argues that the almost accidental sense of community that exists at times of crisis can be consciously built. Peck believes that conscious community building is a process of deliberate design based on the knowledge and application of certain rules. He states that this process goes through four stages:

# Pseudocommunity: When people first come together, they try to be &quot;nice&quot; and present what they feel are their most personable and friendly characteristics.
# Chaos: People move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe enough to present their &quot;shadow&quot; selves. 
# Emptiness: Moves beyond the attempts to fix, heal and convert of the chaos stage, when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness, common to human beings.
# True community: Deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community.
In 1991, Peck remarked that building a sense of community is easy but maintaining this sense of community is difficult in the modern world. An interview with M. Scott Peck by Alan Atkisson. &quot;In Context&quot; #29, p. 26.
The three basic types of community organizing are grassroots organizing, coalition building, and &quot;institution-based community organizing&quot;, (also called &quot;broad-based community organizing&quot;, an example of which is faith-based community organizing, or Congregation-based Community Organizing).

Community building can use a wide variety of practices, ranging from simple events (e.g., potlucks, small book clubs) to larger-scale efforts (e.g., mass festivals, construction projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors).

Community building that is geared toward citizen action is usually termed &quot;community organizing&quot;. In these cases, organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies. Where good-faith negotiations fail, these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, boycotting, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics. 

Community organizing can focus on more than just resolving specific issues. Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance. Such groups facilitate and encourage consensus decision-making with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group.

If communities are developed based on something they share in common, whether location or values, then one challenge for developing communities is how to incorporate individuality and differences. Rebekah Nathan suggests in her book, &quot;My Freshman Year&quot;, we are drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness, despite stated commitments to diversity, such as those found on university websites.

==Types==
A number of ways to categorize types of community have been proposed. One such breakdown is as follows:

# Location-based: range from the local neighbourhood, suburb, village, town or city, region, nation or even the planet as a whole. These are also called communities of place.
# Identity-based: range from the local clique, sub-culture, ethnic group, religious, multicultural or pluralistic civilisation, or the global community cultures of today. They may be included as &quot;communities of need&quot; or &quot;identity&quot;, such as disabled persons, or frail aged people.
# Organizationally-based: range from communities organized informally around family or network-based guilds and associations to more formal incorporated associations, political decision-making structures, economic enterprises, or professional associations at a small, national or international scale.
# Intentional: a mix of all three previous types, these are highly cohesive residential communities with a common social or spiritual purpose, ranging from monasteries and ashrams to modern ecovillages and housing cooperatives.

The usual categorizations of community relations have a number of problems: (1) they tend to give the impression that a particular community can be defined as just this kind or another; (2) they tend to conflate modern and customary community relations; (3) they tend to take sociological categories such as ethnicity or race as given, forgetting that different ethnically defined persons live in different kinds of communities—grounded, interest-based, diasporic, etc.

In response to these problems, Paul James and his colleagues have developed a taxonomy that maps community relations, and recognizes that actual communities can be characterized by different kinds of relations at the same time:

# Grounded community relations. This involves enduring attachment to particular places and particular people. It is the dominant form taken by customary and tribal communities. In these kinds of communities, the land is fundamental to identity.
# Life-style community relations. This involves giving primacy to communities coming together around particular chosen ways of life, such as morally charged or interest-based relations or just living or working in the same location. Hence the following sub-forms:
## community-life as morally bounded, a form taken by many traditional faith-based communities.
## community-life as interest-based, including sporting, leisure-based and business communities which come together for regular moments of engagement.
## community-life as proximately-related, where neighbourhood or commonality of association forms a community of convenience, or a community of place (see below).
# Projected community relations. This is where a community is self-consciously treated as an entity to be projected and re-created. It can be projected as through thin advertising slogan, for example gated community, or can take the form of ongoing associations of people who seek political integration, communities of practice based on professional projects, associative communities which seek to enhance and support individual creativity, autonomy and mutuality. A nation is one of the largest forms of projected or imagined community.

In these terms, communities can be nested and/or intersecting; one community can contain another—for example a location-based community may contain a number of ethnic communities. Both lists above can be used in a cross-cutting matrix in relation to each other.

==Internet communities==

In general, virtual communities value knowledge and information as currency or social resource. What differentiates virtual communities from their physical counterparts is the extent and impact of &quot;weak ties&quot;, which are the relationships acquaintances or strangers form to acquire information through online networks. Relationships among members in a virtual community tend to focus on information exchange about specific topics. A survey conducted by Pew Internet and The American Life Project in 2001 found those involved in entertainment, professional, and sports virtual-groups focused their activities on obtaining information.

An epidemic of bullying and harassment has arisen from the exchange of information between strangers, especially among teenagers, in virtual communities. Despite attempts to implement anti-bullying policies, Sheri Bauman, professor of counselling at the University of Arizona, claims the &quot;most effective strategies to prevent bullying&quot; may cost companies revenue.

Virtual Internet-mediated communities can interact with offline real-life activity, potentially forming strong and tight-knit groups such as QAnon.

<text>A community college is a type of undergraduate higher education institution, generally leading to an associate degree, certificate, or diploma. The term can have different meanings in different countries: many community colleges have an open enrollment policy for students who have graduated from high school, also known as senior secondary school or upper secondary school. The term usually refers to a higher educational institution that provides workforce education and college transfer academic programs. Some institutions maintain athletic teams and dormitories similar to their university counterparts.

==Australia==

In Australia, the term &quot;community college&quot; refers to small private businesses running short (e.g. six weeks) courses generally of a self-improvement or hobbyist nature. Equivalent to the American notion of community colleges are Technical and Further Education colleges or TAFEs; these are institutions regulated mostly at state and territory level. There are also an increasing number of private providers colloquially called &quot;colleges&quot;.

TAFEs and other providers carry on the tradition of adult education, which was established in Australia around the mid-19th century, when evening classes were held to help adults enhance their numeracy and literacy skills. Most Australian universities can also be traced back to such forerunners, although obtaining a university charter has always changed their nature. In TAFEs and colleges today, courses are designed for personal development of an individual or for employment outcomes. Educational programs cover a variety of topics such as arts, languages, business and lifestyle. They usually are scheduled to run two, three or four days of the week, depending on the level of the course undertaken. A Certificate I may only run for 4 hours twice a week for a term of 9 weeks. A full-time Diploma course might have classes 4 days per week for a year (36 weeks). Some courses may be offered in the evenings or weekends to accommodate people working full-time. Funding for colleges may come from government grants and course fees. Many are not-for-profit organisations. Such TAFES are located in metropolitan, regional and rural locations of Australia.

Education offered by TAFEs and colleges has changed over the years. By the 1980s, many colleges had recognised a community need for computer training. Since then thousands of people have increased skills through IT courses. The majority of colleges by the late 20th century had also become Registered Training Organisations. They offer individuals a nurturing, non-traditional education venue to gain skills that better prepare them for the workplace and potential job openings. TAFEs and colleges have not traditionally offered bachelor&#x27;s degrees, instead providing pathway arrangements with universities to continue towards degrees. The American innovation of the associate degree is being developed at some institutions. Certificate courses I to IV, diplomas and advanced diplomas are typically offered, the latter deemed equivalent to an undergraduate qualification, albeit typically in more vocational areas. Recently, some TAFE institutes (and private providers) have also become higher education providers in their own right and are now starting to offer bachelor&#x27;s degree programs.

==Canada==

In Canada, colleges are adult educational institutions that provide higher education and tertiary education, and grant certificates and diplomas. Alternatively, Canadian colleges are often called &quot;institutes&quot; or &quot;polytechnic institutes&quot;. As well, in Ontario, the 24 colleges of applied arts and technology have been mandated to offer their own stand-alone degrees as well as to offer joint degrees with universities through &quot;articulation agreements&quot; that often result in students emerging with both a diploma and a degree. Thus, for example, the University of Guelph &quot;twins&quot; with Humber College and York University does the same with Seneca College. More recently, however, colleges have been offering a variety of their own degrees, often in business, technology, science, and other technical fields. Each province has its own educational system, as prescribed by the Canadian federalism model of governance. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, most Canadian colleges began to provide practical education and training for the emerging and booming generation, and for immigrants from around the world who were entering Canada in increasing numbers at that time. A formative trend was the merging of the then separate vocational training and adult education (night school) institutions.

Canadian colleges are either publicly funded or private post-secondary institutions (run for profit).

In terms of academic pathways, Canadian colleges and universities collaborate with each other with the purpose of providing college students the opportunity to academically upgrade their education. Students can transfer their diplomas and earn transfer credits through their completed college credits towards undergraduate university degrees.

The term associate degree is used in Western Canada to refer to a two-year college arts or science degree, similar to how the term is used in the United States. In other parts of Canada, the term advanced degree is used to indicate a three- or four-year college program.

In Quebec, three years is the norm for a university degree because a year of credit is earned in the CÉGEP (college) system. Even when speaking in English, people often refer to all colleges as Cégeps; however, the term is an acronym more correctly applied specifically to the French-language public system: Collège d&#x27;enseignement général et professionnel (CEGEP); in English: College of General and Vocational Education. The word &quot;college&quot; can also refer to a private high school in Quebec.

==India==

In India, 98 community colleges are recognized by the University Grants Commission. The courses offered by these colleges are diplomas, advance diplomas and certificate courses. The duration of these courses usually ranges from six months to two years.

==Malaysia==
Community colleges in Malaysia are a network of educational institutions whereby vocational and technical skills training could be provided at all levels for school leavers before they entered the workforce. The community colleges also provide an infrastructure for rural communities to gain skills training through short courses as well as providing access to a post-secondary education.

At the moment, most community colleges award qualifications up to Level 3 in the Malaysian Qualifications Framework (Certificate 3) in both the Skills sector (Sijil Kemahiran Malaysia or the Malaysian Skills Certificate) as well as the Vocational and Training sector but the number of community colleges that are starting to award Level 4 qualifications (Diploma) are increasing. This is two levels below a bachelor&#x27;s degree (Level 6 in the MQF) and students within the system who intend to further their studies to that level will usually seek entry into Advanced Diploma programs in public universities, polytechnics or accredited private providers.

==Philippines==

In the Philippines, a community school functions as elementary or secondary school at daytime and towards the end of the day convert into a community college. This type of institution offers night classes under the supervision of the same principal, and the same faculty members who are given part-time college teaching load.

The concept of community college dates back to the time of the former Minister of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) that had under its wings the Bureaus of Elementary Education, Secondary Education, Higher Education and Vocational-Technical Education. MECS Secretary, Cecilio Putong, who in 1971 wrote that a community school is a school established in the community, by the community, and for the community itself. Pedro T. Orata of Pangasinan shared the same idea, hence the establishment of a community college, now called the City College of Urdaneta.

A community college like the one in Abuyog, Leyte can operate with only a PHP 124,000 annual budget in a two-story structure housing more than 700 students.

==United Kingdom==

Except for Scotland, this term is rarely used in the United Kingdom. When it is, a community college is a school which not only provides education for the school-age population (11–18) of the locality, but also additional services and education to adults and other members of the community. This education includes but is not limited to sports, adult literacy and lifestyle education. Usually when students finish their secondary school studies at age 16, they move on to a sixth form college where they study for their A-levels (although some secondary schools have integrated sixth forms). After the two-year A-level period, they may proceed to a college of further education or a university. The former is also known as a technical college.

==United States==

In the United States, community colleges, sometimes called junior colleges, technical colleges, two-year colleges, or city colleges, are primarily public institutions providing tertiary education, also known as continuing education, that focuses on certificates, diplomas, and associate degrees. After graduating from a community college, some students transfer to a liberal arts college or university for two to three years to complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

Before the 1970s, community colleges in the United States were more commonly referred to as &quot;junior colleges&quot;. That term is still used at some institutions. Public community colleges primarily attract and accept students from the local community and are usually supported by local tax revenue. They usually work with local and regional businesses to ensure students are being prepared for the local workforce.

==Research==
Some research organizations and publications focus upon the activities of community college, junior college, and technical college institutions. Many of these institutions and organizations present the most current research and practical outcomes at annual community college conferences.
* The American Association of Community Colleges has provided oversight on community college research since the 1920s. AACC publishes a research journal called the &quot;Community College Journal&quot;.
* The Community College Research Center (CCRC) at Teachers College, Columbia University, has been conducting research on community colleges since 1996 to identify barriers to students&#x27; post-secondary access and promising solutions. CCRC&#x27;s publishes research reports, briefs, and resources geared toward a variety of community college stakeholders, including college and college system leaders, faculty and support staff, policymakers, and institutional researchers.
* The Association of Community College Trustees (ACCT) has provided education for community college boards of directors and advocacy for community colleges since 1972. ACCT President and CEO J. Noah Brown published a book about the past, present, and future of community colleges, &quot;Charting a New Course for Community Colleges: Aligning Policies with Practice&quot;.
* The Center for Community College Student Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin administers surveys and provides data analysis support to member colleges regarding various factors of student engagement and involvement in community colleges in the United States and Canada.
* The Office of Community College Research and Leadership at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign studies policies, programs, and practices designed to enhance outcomes for diverse youth and adults who seek to transition to and through college to employment. OCCRL&#x27;s research spans the P-20 education continuum, with an intense focus on how community colleges impact education and employment outcomes for diverse learners. Results of OCCRL&#x27;s studies of pathways and programs of study, extending from high school to community colleges and universities and to employment, are disseminated nationally and internationally. Reports and materials are derived from new knowledge captured and disseminated through OCCRL&#x27;s website, scholarly publications, and other vehicles.

Several peer-reviewed journals extensively publish research on community colleges, including &quot;Community College Review&quot; and others.

<text>The Civil Rights Memorial is an American memorial in Montgomery, Alabama, created by Maya Lin. The names of 41 people are inscribed on the granite fountain as martyrs who were killed in the civil rights movement. The memorial is sponsored by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

==Design==
The names included in the memorial belong to those who were killed between 1955 and 1968. The dates chosen represent a time when legalized segregation was prominent. In 1954 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that racial segregation in schools was unlawful and 1968 is the year of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The monument was created by Maya Lin, who also created the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The Civil Rights Memorial was dedicated in 1989.

The concept of Lin&#x27;s design is based on the soothing and healing effect of water. It was inspired by a passage from King&#x27;s 1963 &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech &quot;...we will not be satisfied &quot;until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream...&quot; The quotation in the passage, which is inscribed on the memorial, is a direct paraphrase of Amos 5:24, as translated in the American Standard Version of the Bible. The memorial is a fountain in the form of an asymmetric inverted stone cone. A film of water flows over the base of the cone, which contains the 41 names included. It is possible to touch the smooth film of water and to alter it temporarily, which quickly returns to smoothness. The memorial is designed in a timeline manner. It begins with Brown v. Board in 1954, and ends with Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s assassination in 1968.

==Tours and location==
The memorial is in downtown Montgomery, at 400 Washington Avenue, in an open plaza in front of the Civil Rights Memorial Center, which was the offices of the Southern Poverty Law Center until it moved across the street into a new building in 2001. The memorial may be visited freely 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The Civil Rights Memorial Center offers guided group tours, lasting approximately one hour. Tours are available by appointment, Monday to Saturday.

The memorial is only a few blocks from other historic sites, including the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, the Alabama State Capitol, the Alabama Department of Archives and History, the corners where Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks boarded buses in 1955 on which they would later refuse to give up their seats, and the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.

<text>Charles Babbage (; 26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer.

Babbage is considered by some to be &quot;father of the computer&quot;. He is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine, that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in his Analytical Engine, programmed using a principle openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom. Babbage had a broad range of interests in addition to his work on computers covered in his 1832 book &quot;Economy of Manufactures and Machinery&quot;. He was an important figure in the social scene in London, and is credited with importing the &quot;scientific soirée&quot; from France with his well-attended Saturday evening soirées. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as &quot;pre-eminent&quot; among the many polymaths of his century.

Babbage, who died before the complete successful engineering of many of his designs, including his Difference Engine and Analytical Engine, remained a prominent figure in the ideating of computing. Parts of his incomplete mechanisms are on display in the Science Museum in London. In 1991, a functioning difference engine was constructed from the original plans. Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage&#x27;s machine would have worked.

==Early life==

Babbage&#x27;s birthplace is disputed, but according to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; he was most likely born at 44 Crosby Row, Walworth Road, London, England. A blue plaque on the junction of Larcom Street and Walworth Road commemorates the event.

His date of birth was given in his obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; as 26 December 1792; but then a nephew wrote to say that Babbage was born one year earlier, in 1791. The parish register of St. Mary&#x27;s, Newington, London, shows that Babbage was baptised on 6 January 1792, supporting a birth year of 1791.
Babbage was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape. His father was a banking partner of William Praed in founding Praed&#x27;s &amp; Co. of Fleet Street, London, in 1801. In 1808, the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in East Teignmouth. Around the age of eight, Babbage was sent to a country school in Alphington near Exeter to recover from a life-threatening fever. For a short time, he attended King Edward VI Grammar School in Totnes, South Devon, but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time.

Babbage then joined the 30-student Holmwood Academy, in Baker Street, Enfield, Middlesex, under the Reverend Stephen Freeman. The academy had a library that prompted Babbage&#x27;s love of mathematics. He studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy. The first was a clergyman near Cambridge; through him Babbage encountered Charles Simeon and his evangelical followers, but the tuition was not what he needed. He was brought home, to study at the Totnes school: this was at age 16 or 17. The second was an Oxford tutor, under whom Babbage reached a level in Classics sufficient to be accepted by the University of Cambridge.

==At the University of Cambridge==
Babbage arrived at Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1810. He was already self-taught in some parts of contemporary mathematics; he had read Robert Woodhouse, Joseph Louis Lagrange, and Maria Gaetana Agnesi. As a result, he was disappointed in the standard mathematical instruction available at the university.

Babbage, John Herschel, George Peacock, and several other friends formed the Analytical Society in 1812; they were also close to Edward Ryan. As a student, Babbage was also a member of other societies such as The Ghost Club, concerned with investigating supernatural phenomena, and the Extractors Club, dedicated to liberating its members from the madhouse, should any be committed to one.

In 1812, Babbage transferred to Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was the top mathematician there, but did not graduate with honours. He instead received a degree without examination in 1814. He had defended a thesis that was considered blasphemous in the preliminary public disputation, but it is not known whether this fact is related to his not sitting the examination.

==After Cambridge==
Considering his reputation, Babbage quickly made progress. He lectured to the Royal Institution on astronomy in 1815, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1816. After graduation, on the other hand, he applied for positions unsuccessfully, and had little in the way of a career. In 1816 he was a candidate for a teaching job at Haileybury College; he had recommendations from James Ivory and John Playfair, but lost out to Henry Walter. In 1819, Babbage and Herschel visited Paris and the Society of Arcueil, meeting leading French mathematicians and physicists. That year Babbage applied to be professor at the University of Edinburgh, with the recommendation of Pierre Simon Laplace; the post went to William Wallace.

With Herschel, Babbage worked on the electrodynamics of Arago&#x27;s rotations, publishing in 1825. Their explanations were only transitional, being picked up and broadened by Michael Faraday. The phenomena are now part of the theory of eddy currents, and Babbage and Herschel missed some of the clues to unification of electromagnetic theory, staying close to Ampère&#x27;s force law.

Babbage purchased the actuarial tables of George Barrett, who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work, and surveyed the field in 1826 in &quot;Comparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives&quot;. This interest followed a project to set up an insurance company, prompted by Francis Baily and mooted in 1824, but not carried out. Babbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme, using Equitable Society mortality data from 1762 onwards.

During this whole period, Babbage depended awkwardly on his father&#x27;s support, given his father&#x27;s attitude to his early marriage, of 1814: he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters. He made a home in Marylebone in London and established a large family. On his father&#x27;s death in 1827, Babbage inherited a large estate (value around £100,000, equivalent to £ or $ today), making him independently wealthy. After his wife&#x27;s death in the same year he spent time travelling. In Italy he met Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, foreshadowing a later visit to Piedmont. In April 1828 he was in Rome, and relying on Herschel to manage the difference engine project, when he heard that he had become a professor at Cambridge, a position he had three times failed to obtain (in 1820, 1823 and 1826).

===Royal Astronomical Society===
Babbage was instrumental in founding the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820, initially known as the Astronomical Society of London. Its original aims were to reduce astronomical calculations to a more standard form, and to circulate data. These directions were closely connected with Babbage&#x27;s ideas on computation, and in 1824 he won its Gold Medal, cited &quot;for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables&quot;.

Babbage&#x27;s motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation had been a commonplace since Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; (under Babbage&#x27;s guidance). The context of these developments is still debated. Babbage&#x27;s own account of the origin of the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society&#x27;s wish to improve &quot;The Nautical Almanac&quot;. Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to recalculate some part of those tables. With the results to hand, discrepancies were found. This was in 1821 or 1822, and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation. The issue of the &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks, who had died in 1820.

Babbage studied the requirements to establish a modern postal system, with his friend Thomas Frederick Colby, concluding there should be a uniform rate that was put into effect with the introduction of the Uniform Fourpenny Post supplanted by the Uniform Penny Post in 1839 and 1840. Colby was another of the founding group of the Society. He was also in charge of the Survey of Ireland. Herschel and Babbage were present at a celebrated operation of that survey, the remeasuring of the Lough Foyle baseline.

===British Lagrangian School===
The Analytical Society had initially been no more than an undergraduate provocation. During this period it had some more substantial achievements. In 1816, Babbage, Herschel and Peacock published a translation from French of the lectures of Sylvestre Lacroix, which was then the state-of-the-art calculus textbook.

Reference to Lagrange in calculus terms marks out the application of what are now called formal power series. British mathematicians had used them from about 1730 to 1760. As re-introduced, they were not simply applied as notations in differential calculus. They opened up the fields of functional equations (including the difference equations fundamental to the difference engine) and operator (D-module) methods for differential equations. The analogy of difference and differential equations was notationally changing Δ to D, as a &quot;finite&quot; difference becomes &quot;infinitesimal&quot;. These symbolic directions became popular, as operational calculus, and pushed to the point of diminishing returns. The Cauchy concept of limit was kept at bay. Woodhouse had already founded this second &quot;British Lagrangian School&quot; with its treatment of Taylor series as formal.

In this context function composition is complicated to express, because the chain rule is not simply applied to second and higher derivatives. This matter was known to Woodhouse by 1803, who took from Louis François Antoine Arbogast what is now called Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula. In essence it was known to Abraham De Moivre (1697). Herschel found the method impressive, Babbage knew of it, and it was later noted by Ada Lovelace as compatible with the analytical engine. In the period to 1820 Babbage worked intensively on functional equations in general, and resisted both conventional finite differences and Arbogast&#x27;s approach (in which Δ and D were related by the simple additive case of the exponential map). But via Herschel he was influenced by Arbogast&#x27;s ideas in the matter of iteration, i.e. composing a function with itself, possibly many times. Writing in a major paper on functional equations in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; (1815/6), Babbage said his starting point was work of Gaspard Monge.

==Academic==
From 1828 to 1839, Babbage was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. Not a conventional resident don, and inattentive to his teaching responsibilities, he wrote three topical books during this period of his life. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832. Babbage was out of sympathy with colleagues: George Biddell Airy, his predecessor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, thought an issue should be made of his lack of interest in lecturing. Babbage planned to lecture in 1831 on political economy. Babbage&#x27;s reforming direction looked to see university education more inclusive, universities doing more for research, a broader syllabus and more interest in applications; but William Whewell found the programme unacceptable. A controversy Babbage had with Richard Jones lasted for six years. He never did give a lecture.

It was during this period that Babbage tried to enter politics. Simon Schaffer writes that his views of the 1830s included disestablishment of the Church of England, a broader political franchise, and inclusion of manufacturers as stakeholders. He twice stood for Parliament as a candidate for the borough of Finsbury. In 1832 he came in third among five candidates, missing out by some 500 votes in the two-member constituency when two other reformist candidates, Thomas Wakley and Christopher Temple, split the vote. In his memoirs Babbage related how this election brought him the friendship of Samuel Rogers: his brother Henry Rogers wished to support Babbage again, but died within days. In 1834 Babbage finished last among four. In 1832, Babbage, Herschel and Ivory were appointed Knights of the Royal Guelphic Order, however they were not subsequently made knights bachelor to entitle them to the prefix &quot;Sir&quot;, which often came with appointments to that foreign order (though Herschel was later created a baronet).

===&quot;Declinarians&quot;, learned societies and the BAAS===

Babbage now emerged as a polemicist. One of his biographers notes that all his books contain a &quot;campaigning element&quot;. His &quot;Reflections on the Decline of Science and some of its Causes&quot; (1830) stands out, however, for its sharp attacks. It aimed to improve British science, and more particularly to oust Davies Gilbert as President of the Royal Society, which Babbage wished to reform. It was written out of pique, when Babbage hoped to become the junior secretary of the Royal Society, as Herschel was the senior, but failed because of his antagonism to Humphry Davy. Michael Faraday had a reply written, by Gerrit Moll, as &quot;On the Alleged Decline of Science in England&quot; (1831). On the front of the Royal Society Babbage had no impact, with the bland election of the Duke of Sussex to succeed Gilbert the same year. As a broad manifesto, on the other hand, his &quot;Decline&quot; led promptly to the formation in 1831 of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS).

The &quot;Mechanics&#x27; Magazine&quot; in 1831 identified as Declinarians the followers of Babbage. In an unsympathetic tone it pointed out David Brewster writing in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; as another leader; with the barb that both Babbage and Brewster had received public money.

In the debate of the period on statistics (&quot;qua&quot; data collection) and what is now statistical inference, the BAAS in its Statistical Section (which owed something also to Whewell) opted for data collection. This Section was the sixth, established in 1833 with Babbage as chairman and John Elliot Drinkwater as secretary. The foundation of the Statistical Society followed. Babbage was its public face, backed by Richard Jones and Robert Malthus.

===&quot;On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures&quot;===
Babbage published &quot;On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures&quot; (1832), on the organisation of industrial production. It was an influential early work of operational research. John Rennie the Younger in addressing the Institution of Civil Engineers on manufacturing in 1846 mentioned mostly surveys in encyclopaedias, and Babbage&#x27;s book was first an article in the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot;, the form in which Rennie noted it, in the company of related works by John Farey Jr., Peter Barlow and Andrew Ure. From &quot;An essay on the general principles which regulate the application of machinery to manufactures and the mechanical arts&quot; (1827), which became the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot; article of 1829, Babbage developed the schematic classification of machines that, combined with discussion of factories, made up the first part of the book. The second part considered the &quot;domestic and political economy&quot; of manufactures.

The book sold well, and quickly went to a fourth edition (1836). Babbage represented his work as largely a result of actual observations in factories, British and abroad. It was not, in its first edition, intended to address deeper questions of political economy; the second (late 1832) did, with three further chapters including one on piece rate. The book also contained ideas on rational design in factories, and profit sharing.

====&quot;Babbage principle&quot;====
In &quot;Economy of Machinery&quot; was described what is now called the &quot;Babbage principle&quot;. It pointed out commercial advantages available with more careful division of labour. As Babbage himself noted, it had already appeared in the work of Melchiorre Gioia in 1815. The term was introduced in 1974 by Harry Braverman. Related formulations are the &quot;principle of multiples&quot; of Philip Sargant Florence, and the &quot;balance of processes&quot;.

What Babbage remarked is that skilled workers typically spend parts of their time performing tasks that are below their skill level. If the labour process can be divided among several workers, labour costs may be cut by assigning only high-skill tasks to high-cost workers, restricting other tasks to lower-paid workers. He also pointed out that training or apprenticeship can be taken as fixed costs; but that returns to scale are available by his approach of standardisation of tasks, therefore again favouring the factory system. His view of human capital was restricted to minimising the time period for recovery of training costs.

====Publishing====
Another aspect of the work was its detailed breakdown of the cost structure of book publishing. Babbage took the unpopular line, from the publishers&#x27; perspective, of exposing the trade&#x27;s profitability. He went as far as to name the organisers of the trade&#x27;s restrictive practices. Twenty years later he attended a meeting hosted by John Chapman to campaign against the Booksellers Association, still a cartel.

====Influence====
It has been written that &quot;what Arthur Young was to agriculture, Charles Babbage was to the factory visit and machinery&quot;. Babbage&#x27;s theories are said to have influenced the layout of the 1851 Great Exhibition, and his views had a strong effect on his contemporary George Julius Poulett Scrope. Karl Marx argued that the source of the productivity of the factory system was exactly the combination of the division of labour with machinery, building on Adam Smith, Babbage and Ure. Where Marx picked up on Babbage and disagreed with Smith was on the motivation for division of labour by the manufacturer: as Babbage did, he wrote that it was for the sake of profitability, rather than productivity, and identified an impact on the concept of a trade.

John Ruskin went further, to oppose completely what manufacturing in Babbage&#x27;s sense stood for. Babbage also affected the economic thinking of John Stuart Mill. George Holyoake saw Babbage&#x27;s detailed discussion of profit sharing as substantive, in the tradition of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier, if requiring the attentions of a benevolent captain of industry, and ignored at the time.

Charles Babbage&#x27;s Saturday night soirées, held from 1828 into the 1840s, were important gathering places for prominent scientists, authors and aristocracy. Babbage is credited with importing the &quot;scientific soirée&quot; from France with his well-attended Saturday evening soirées. 

Works by Babbage and Ure were published in French translation in 1830; &quot;On the Economy of Machinery&quot; was translated in 1833 into French by Édouard Biot, and into German the same year by Gottfried Friedenberg. The French engineer and writer on industrial organisation Léon Lalanne was influenced by Babbage, but also by the economist Claude Lucien Bergery, in reducing the issues to &quot;technology&quot;. William Jevons connected Babbage&#x27;s &quot;economy of labour&quot; with his own labour experiments of 1870. The Babbage principle is an inherent assumption in Frederick Winslow Taylor&#x27;s scientific management.

Mary Everest Boole claimed that there was profound influence – via her uncle George Everest – of Indian thought in general and Indian logic, in particular, on Babbage and on her husband George Boole, as well as on Augustus De Morgan:

Think what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage, De Morgan, and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830–65. What share had it in generating the Vector Analysis and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted? 

===Natural theology===
In 1837, responding to the series of eight &quot;Bridgewater Treatises&quot;, Babbage published his &quot;Ninth Bridgewater Treatise&quot;, under the title &quot;On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation&quot;. In this work Babbage weighed in on the side of uniformitarianism in a current debate. He preferred the conception of creation in which a God-given natural law dominated, removing the need for continuous &quot;contrivance&quot;.

The book is a work of natural theology, and incorporates extracts from related correspondence of Herschel with Charles Lyell. Babbage put forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator. In this book, Babbage dealt with relating interpretations between science and religion; on the one hand, he insisted that &quot;there exists no fatal collision between the words of Scripture and the facts of nature;&quot; on the other hand, he wrote that the Book of Genesis was not meant to be read literally in relation to scientific terms. Against those who said these were in conflict, he wrote &quot;that the contradiction they have imagined can have no real existence, and that whilst the testimony of Moses remains unimpeached, we may also be permitted to confide in the testimony of our senses.&quot;

The &quot;Ninth Bridgewater Treatise&quot; was quoted extensively in &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;. The parallel with Babbage&#x27;s computing machines is made explicit, as allowing plausibility to the theory that transmutation of species could be pre-programmed.
Jonar Ganeri, author of &quot;Indian Logic&quot;, believes Babbage may have been influenced by Indian thought; one possible route would be through Henry Thomas Colebrooke. Mary Everest Boole argues that Babbage was introduced to Indian thought in the 1820s by her uncle George Everest:
Some time about 1825, [Everest] came to England for two or three years, and made a fast and lifelong friendship with Herschel and with Babbage, who was then quite young. I would ask any fair-minded mathematician to read Babbage&#x27;s Ninth Bridgewater Treatise and compare it with the works of his contemporaries in England; and then ask himself whence came the peculiar conception of the nature of miracle which underlies Babbage&#x27;s ideas of Singular Points on Curves (Chap, viii) – from European Theology or Hindu Metaphysic? Oh! how the English clergy of that day hated Babbage&#x27;s book!

=== Religious views ===
Babbage was raised in the Protestant form of the Christian faith, his family having inculcated in him an orthodox form of worship. He explained:

Rejecting the Athanasian Creed as a &quot;direct contradiction in terms&quot;, in his youth he looked to Samuel Clarke&#x27;s works on religion, of which &quot;Being and Attributes of God&quot; (1704) exerted a particularly strong influence on him. Later in life, Babbage concluded that &quot;the true value of the Christian religion rested, not on speculative [theology] ... but ... upon those doctrines of kindness and benevolence which that religion claims and enforces, not merely in favour of man himself but of every creature susceptible of pain or of happiness.&quot;

In his autobiography (1864), Babbage wrote a whole chapter on the topic of religion, where he identified three sources of divine knowledge:
# &quot;A priori&quot; or mystical experience
# From Revelation
# From the examination of the works of the Creator
He stated, on the basis of the design argument, that studying the works of nature had been the more appealing evidence, and the one which led him to actively profess the existence of God. Advocating for natural theology, he wrote:
Like Samuel Vince, Babbage also wrote a defence of the belief in divine miracles. Against objections previously posed by David Hume, Babbage advocated for the belief of divine agency, stating &quot;we must not measure the credibility or incredibility of an event by the narrow sphere of our own experience, nor forget that there is a Divine energy which overrides what we familiarly call the laws of nature.&quot; He alluded to the limits of human experience, expressing: &quot;all that we see in a miracle is an effect which is new to our observation, and whose cause is concealed. The cause may be beyond the sphere of our observation, and would be thus beyond the familiar sphere of nature; but this does not make the event a violation of any law of nature. The limits of man&#x27;s observation lie within very narrow boundaries, and it would be arrogance to suppose that the reach of man&#x27;s power is to form the limits of the natural world.&quot;

==Later life==

The British Association was consciously modelled on the Deutsche Naturforscher-Versammlung, founded in 1822. It rejected romantic science as well as metaphysics, and started to entrench the divisions of science from literature, and professionals from amateurs. Belonging as he did to the &quot;Wattite&quot; faction in the BAAS, represented in particular by James Watt the younger, Babbage identified closely with industrialists. He wanted to go faster in the same directions, and had little time for the more gentlemanly component of its membership. Indeed, he subscribed to a version of conjectural history that placed industrial society as the culmination of human development (and shared this view with Herschel). A clash with Roderick Murchison led in 1838 to his withdrawal from further involvement. At the end of the same year he sent in his resignation as Lucasian professor, walking away also from the Cambridge struggle with Whewell. His interests became more focussed, on computation and metrology, and on international contacts.

===Metrology programme===
A project announced by Babbage was to tabulate all physical constants (referred to as &quot;constants of nature&quot;, a phrase in itself a neologism), and then to compile an encyclopaedic work of numerical information. He was a pioneer in the field of &quot;absolute measurement&quot;. His ideas followed on from those of Johann Christian Poggendorff, and were mentioned to Brewster in 1832. There were to be 19 categories of constants, and Ian Hacking sees these as reflecting in part Babbage&#x27;s &quot;eccentric enthusiasms&quot;. Babbage&#x27;s paper &quot;On Tables of the Constants of Nature and Art&quot; was reprinted by the Smithsonian Institution in 1856, with an added note that the physical tables of Arnold Henry Guyot &quot;will form a part of the important work proposed in this article&quot;.

Exact measurement was also key to the development of machine tools. Here again Babbage is considered a pioneer, with Henry Maudslay, William Sellers, and Joseph Whitworth.

===Engineer and inventor===
Through the Royal Society Babbage acquired the friendship of the engineer Marc Brunel. It was through Brunel that Babbage knew of Joseph Clement, and so came to encounter the artisans whom he observed in his work on manufactures. Babbage provided an introduction for Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1830, for a contact with the proposed Bristol &amp; Birmingham Railway. He carried out studies, around 1838, to show the superiority of the broad gauge for railways, used by Brunel&#x27;s Great Western Railway.

In 1838, Babbage invented the pilot (also called a cow-catcher), the metal frame attached to the front of locomotives that clears the tracks of obstacles; he also constructed a dynamometer car. His eldest son, Benjamin Herschel Babbage, worked as an engineer for Brunel on the railways before emigrating to Australia in the 1850s.

Babbage also invented an ophthalmoscope, which he gave to Thomas Wharton Jones for testing. Jones, however, ignored it. The device only came into use after being independently invented by Hermann von Helmholtz.

===Cryptography===
Babbage achieved notable results in cryptography, though this was still not known a century after his death. Letter frequency was category 18 of Babbage&#x27;s tabulation project. Joseph Henry later defended interest in it, in the absence of the facts, as relevant to the management of movable type.

As early as 1845, Babbage had solved a cipher that had been posed as a challenge by his nephew Henry Hollier, and in the process, he made a discovery about ciphers that were based on Vigenère tables. Specifically, he realised that enciphering plain text with a keyword rendered the cipher text subject to modular arithmetic. During the Crimean War of the 1850s, Babbage broke Vigenère&#x27;s autokey cipher as well as the much weaker cipher that is called Vigenère cipher today. His discovery was kept a military secret, and was not published. Credit for the result was instead given to Friedrich Kasiski, a Prussian infantry officer, who made the same discovery some years later. However, in 1854, Babbage published the solution of a Vigenère cipher, which had been published previously in the &quot;Journal of the Society of Arts&quot;. In 1855, Babbage also published a short letter, &quot;Cypher Writing&quot;, in the same journal. Nevertheless, his priority was not established until 1985.

===Public nuisances===
Babbage involved himself in well-publicised but unpopular campaigns against public nuisances. He once counted all the broken panes of glass of a factory, publishing in 1857 a &quot;Table of the Relative Frequency of the Causes of Breakage of Plate Glass Windows&quot;: Of 464 broken panes, 14 were caused by &quot;drunken men, women or boys&quot;.

Babbage&#x27;s distaste for commoners (the Mob) included writing &quot;Observations of Street Nuisances&quot; in 1864, as well as tallying up 165 &quot;nuisances&quot; over a period of 80 days. He especially hated street music, and in particular the music of organ grinders, against whom he railed in various venues. The following quotation is typical:

Babbage was not alone in his campaign. A convert to the cause was the MP Michael Thomas Bass.

In the 1860s, Babbage also took up the anti-hoop-rolling campaign. He blamed hoop-rolling boys for driving their iron hoops under horses&#x27; legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg. Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for &quot;commencing a crusade against the popular game of tip-cat and the trundling of hoops.&quot;

==Computing pioneer==
Babbage&#x27;s machines were among the first mechanical computers. That they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and clashes of personality, most notably with George Biddell Airy, the Astronomer Royal.

Babbage directed the building of some steam-powered machines that achieved some modest success, suggesting that calculations could be mechanised. For more than ten years he received government funding for his project, which amounted to £17,000, but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him.

While Babbage&#x27;s machines were mechanical and unwieldy, their basic architecture was similar to that of a modern computer. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction-based, the control unit could make conditional jumps, and the machine had a separate I/O unit.

===Background on mathematical tables===
In Babbage&#x27;s time, printed mathematical tables were calculated by human computers; in other words, by hand. They were central to navigation, science and engineering, as well as mathematics. Mistakes were known to occur in transcription as well as calculation.

At Cambridge, Babbage saw the fallibility of this process, and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management. His own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion: 

There was another period, seven years later, when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables. The French official initiative by Gaspard de Prony, and its problems of implementation, were familiar to him. After the Napoleonic Wars came to a close, scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact: in 1819 Charles Blagden was in Paris looking into the printing of the stalled de Prony project, and lobbying for the support of the Royal Society. In works of the 1820s and 1830s, Babbage referred in detail to de Prony&#x27;s project.

===Difference engine===


Babbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of polynomial functions. It was created to calculate a series of values automatically. By using the method of finite differences, it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division.

For a prototype difference engine, Babbage brought in Joseph Clement to implement the design, in 1823. Clement worked to high standards, but his machine tools were particularly elaborate. Under the standard terms of business of the time, he could charge for their construction, and would also own them. He and Babbage fell out over costs around 1831.

Some parts of the prototype survive in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford. This prototype evolved into the &quot;first difference engine&quot;. It remained unfinished and the finished portion is located at the Science Museum in London. This first difference engine would have been composed of around 25,000 parts, weighed , and would have been tall. Although Babbage received ample funding for the project, it was never completed. He later (1847–1849) produced detailed drawings for an improved version,&quot;Difference Engine No. 2&quot;, but did not receive funding from the British government. His design was finally constructed in 1989–1991, using his plans and 19th-century manufacturing tolerances. It performed its first calculation at the Science Museum, London, returning results to 31 digits.

Nine years later, in 2000, the Science Museum completed the printer Babbage had designed for the difference engine.

====Completed models====
The Science Museum has constructed two Difference Engines according to Babbage&#x27;s plans for the Difference Engine No 2. One is owned by the museum. The other, owned by the technology multimillionaire Nathan Myhrvold, went on exhibition at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California on 10 May 2008. The two models that have been constructed are not replicas.

===Analytical Engine===
After the attempt at making the first difference engine fell through, Babbage worked to design a more complex machine called the Analytical Engine. He hired C. G. Jarvis, who had previously worked for Clement as a draughtsman. The Analytical Engine marks the transition from mechanised arithmetic to fully-fledged general purpose computation. It is largely on it that Babbage&#x27;s standing as computer pioneer rests.

The major innovation was that the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards: the Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquard&#x27;s punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could use as input the results of preceding computations. The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching and looping. It would have been the first mechanical device to be, in principle, Turing-complete. Charles Babbage wrote a series of programs for the Analytical Engine from 1837 to 1840. The first program was finished in 1837. The Engine was not a single physical machine, but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871.
===Ada Lovelace and Italian followers===
Ada Lovelace, who corresponded with Babbage during his development of the Analytical Engine, is credited with developing an algorithm that would enable the Engine to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers. Despite documentary evidence in Lovelace&#x27;s own handwriting, some scholars dispute to what extent the ideas were Lovelace&#x27;s own. For this achievement, she is often described as the first computer programmer; though no programming language had yet been invented.

Lovelace also translated and wrote literature supporting the project. Describing the engine&#x27;s programming by punch cards, she wrote: &quot;We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.&quot;

Babbage visited Turin in 1840 at the invitation of Giovanni Plana, who had developed in 1831 an analog computing machine that served as a perpetual calendar. Here in 1840 in Turin, Babbage gave the only public explanation and lectures about the Analytical Engine. In 1842 Charles Wheatstone approached Lovelace to translate a paper of Luigi Menabrea, who had taken notes of Babbage&#x27;s Turin talks; and Babbage asked her to add something of her own. Fortunato Prandi who acted as interpreter in Turin was an Italian exile and follower of Giuseppe Mazzini.

===Swedish followers===
Per Georg Scheutz wrote about the difference engine in 1830, and experimented in automated computation. After 1834 and Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; article he set up a project of his own, doubting whether Babbage&#x27;s initial plan could be carried out. This he pushed through with his son, Edvard Scheutz. Another Swedish engine was that of Martin Wiberg (1860).

===Legacy===
In 2011, researchers in Britain proposed a multimillion-pound project, &quot;Plan 28&quot;, to construct Babbage&#x27;s Analytical Engine. Since Babbage&#x27;s plans were continually being refined and were never completed, they intended to engage the public in the project and crowd-source the analysis of what should be built. It would have the equivalent of 675 bytes of memory, and run at a clock speed of about 7 Hz. They hoped to complete it by the 150th anniversary of Babbage&#x27;s death, in 2021.

Advances in MEMS and nanotechnology have led to recent high-tech experiments in mechanical computation. The benefits suggested include operation in high radiation or high temperature environments. These modern versions of mechanical computation were highlighted in &quot;The Economist&quot; in its special &quot;end of the millennium&quot; black cover issue in an article entitled &quot;Babbage&#x27;s Last Laugh&quot;.

Due to his association with the town Babbage was chosen in 2007 to appear on the 5 Totnes pound note. An image of Babbage features in the British cultural icons section of the newly designed British passport in 2015.

==Family==
On 25 July 1814, Babbage married Georgiana Whitmore, sister of British parliamentarian William Wolryche-Whitmore, at St. Michael&#x27;s Church in Teignmouth, Devon. The couple lived at Dudmaston Hall, Shropshire (where Babbage engineered the central heating system), before moving to 5 Devonshire Street, London in 1815.

Charles and Georgiana had eight children, but only four – Benjamin Herschel, Georgiana Whitmore, Dugald Bromhead and Henry Prevost – survived childhood. Charles&#x27; wife Georgiana died in Worcester on 1 September 1827, the same year as his father, their second son (also named Charles) and their newborn son Alexander.
* Benjamin Herschel Babbage (1815–1878)
* Charles Whitmore Babbage (1817–1827)
* Georgiana Whitmore Babbage (1818 – 26 September 1834)
* Edward Stewart Babbage (1819–1821)
* Francis Moore Babbage (1821–????)
* Dugald Bromhead (Bromheald?) Babbage (1823–1901)
* (Maj-Gen) Henry Prevost Babbage (1824–1918)
* Alexander Forbes Babbage (1827–1827)

His youngest surviving son, Henry Prevost Babbage (1824–1918), went on to create six small demonstration pieces for Difference Engine No. 1 based on his father&#x27;s designs, one of which was sent to Harvard University where it was later discovered by Howard H. Aiken, pioneer of the Harvard Mark I. Henry Prevost&#x27;s 1910 Analytical Engine Mill, previously on display at Dudmaston Hall, is now on display at the Science Museum.

==Death==

Babbage lived and worked for over 40 years at 1 Dorset Street, Marylebone, where he died, at the age of 79, on 18 October 1871; he was buried in London&#x27;s Kensal Green Cemetery. According to Horsley, Babbage died &quot;of renal inadequacy, secondary to cystitis.&quot; He had declined both a knighthood and baronetcy. He also argued against hereditary peerages, favouring life peerages instead.

=== Autopsy report ===
In 1983, the autopsy report for Charles Babbage was discovered and later published by his great-great-grandson. A copy of the original is also available. Half of Babbage&#x27;s brain is preserved at the Hunterian Museum in the Royal College of Surgeons in London. The other half of Babbage&#x27;s brain is on display in the Science Museum, London.

==In fiction and film==
Babbage frequently appears in steampunk works; he has been called an iconic figure of the genre. Other works in which Babbage appears include:

* The 2008 short film &quot;Babbage&quot;, screened at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, a 2009 finalist with Haydenfilms, and shown at the 2009 HollyShorts Film Festival and other international film festivals. The film shows Babbage at a dinner party, with guests discussing his life and work.
* Sydney Padua created &quot;The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage&quot;, a cartoon alternate history in which Babbage and Lovelace succeed in building the Analytical Engine. It quotes heavily from the writings of Lovelace, Babbage and their contemporaries.
* Kate Beaton, cartoonist of webcomic &quot;Hark! A Vagrant&quot;, devoted one of her comic strips to Charles and Georgiana Babbage.
* The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Spyfall, Part 2&quot; (Season 12, episode 2) features Charles Babbage and Ada Gordon as characters who assist the Doctor when she&#x27;s stuck in the year 1834.

<text>Cross-dressing is the act of wearing clothes traditionally or stereotypically associated with a different gender. From as early as pre-modern history, cross-dressing has been practiced in order to disguise, comfort, entertain, and express oneself.

Socialization establishes social norms among the people of a particular society. With regard to the social aspects of clothing, such standards may reflect guidelines relating to the style, color, or type of clothing that individuals are expected to wear. Such expectations may be delineated according to gender roles. Cross-dressing involves dressing contrary to the prevailing standards (or in some cases, laws) for a person of their gender in their own society.

The term &quot;cross-dressing&quot; refers to an action or a behavior, without attributing or implying any specific causes or motives for that behavior. Cross-dressing is not synonymous with being transgender.

==Terminology==
The phenomenon of cross-dressing is seen throughout recorded history, being referred to as far back as the Hebrew Bible. The terms used to describe it have changed throughout history; the Anglo-Saxon-rooted term &quot;cross-dresser&quot; is viewed more favorably than the Latin-origin term &quot;transvestite&quot; in some circles, where it has come to be seen as outdated and derogatory. Its first mention originated in Magnus Hirschfeld&#x27;s (&quot;The Transvestites&quot;) in 1910, originally associating cross-dressing with non-heterosexual behavior or derivations of sexual intent. Its connotations largely changed in the 20th century as its use was more frequently associated with sexual excitement, otherwise known as transvestic disorder. This term was historically used to diagnose psychiatric disorders (e.g. transvestic fetishism), but the former (cross-dressing) was coined by the transgender community. The Oxford English Dictionary gives 1911 as the earliest citation of the term &quot;cross-dressing&quot;, by Edward Carpenter: &quot;Cross-dressing must be taken as a general indication of, and a cognate phenomenon to, homosexuality&quot;. In 1928, Havelock Ellis used the two terms &quot;cross-dressing&quot; and &quot;transvestism&quot; interchangeably. The earliest citations for &quot;cross-dress&quot; and &quot;cross-dresser&quot; are 1966 and 1976, respectively.

=== and ===
The term () is a lexical borrowing of a French phrase. It is used in the transgender and crossdressing community to describe the act of wearing feminine clothing or expressing a stereotypically feminine personality. The term is borrowed from the modern French phrase &quot;en femme&quot; meaning &quot;as a woman&quot;, Most crossdressers also use a female name whilst ; that is their &quot;femme name&quot;. In the cross-dressing community the persona a man adopts when he dresses as a woman is known as his &quot;femme self&quot;.

Between 1987 and 1991, JoAnn Roberts and CDS published a magazine called &quot;En Femme&quot; that was &quot;for the transvestite, transsexual, crossdresser, and female impersonator&quot;,

 () is a similar anglicized adaptation of a French phrase, used to describe the act of wearing masculine clothing or expressing a stereotypically masculine personality. The term is derived from the modern colloquial French phrase meaning &quot;as a man&quot; and the anglicized adaptation literally translates as &quot;in man&quot;. Most crossdressers also use a masculine name whilst .

==History==


===Non-Western history===
Cross-dressing has been practiced throughout much of recorded history, in many societies, and for many reasons. Examples exist in Greek, Norse, and Hindu mythology. Cross-dressing can be found in theater and religion, such as kabuki, Noh, and Korean shamanism, as well as in folklore, literature, and music. For instance, in examining kabuki culture during Japan&#x27;s edo period, cross-dressing was not only used for theater purposes, but also because current societal trends: cross-dressing and the switching of genders was a familiar concept to the Japanese at the time which allowed them to interchange characters&#x27;s genders easily and incorporate geisha fashion into men&#x27;s wear. This was especially common in the story-telling of ancient stories such as the character Benten from Benten Kozō. He was a thief in the play cross-dressing as a woman. Cross-dressing was also exhibited in Japanese Noh for similar reasons. Societal standards at the time broke boundaries between gender. For example, ancient Japanese portraits of aristocrats have no clear differentiation in characteristics between male and female beauty. Thus, in Noh performance, the cross-dressing of actors was common; especially given the ease of disguising biological sex with the use of masks and heavy robes. In a non-entertainment context, cross-dressing is also exhibited in Korean shamanism for religious purposes. Specifically, this is displayed in chaesu-gut, a shamanistic rite gut in which a shaman offers a sacrifice to the spirits to intermediate in the fortunes of the intended humans for the gut. Here, cross-dressing serves many purposes. Firstly, the shaman (typically a woman) would cross-dress as both male and female spirits can occupy her. This allows her to represent the opposite sex and become a cross-sex icon in 75% of the time of the ritual. This also allows her to become a sexually liminal being. It is clear that in entertainment, literature, art, and religion, different civilizations have utilized cross-dressing for many different purposes.

===Western history===

In the British and European context, theatrical troupes (&quot;playing companies&quot;) were all-male, with the female parts undertaken by boy players.

The Rebecca Riots took place between 1839 and 1843 in West and Mid Wales. They were a series of protests undertaken by local farmers and agricultural workers in response to unfair taxation. The rioters, often men dressed as women, took their actions against toll-gates, as they were tangible representations of high taxes and tolls. The riots ceased prior to 1844 due to several factors, including increased troop levels, a desire by the protestors to avoid violence and the appearance of criminal groups using the guise of the biblical character Rebecca for their own purposes. In 1844 an Act of Parliament to consolidate and amend the laws relating to turnpike trusts in Wales was passed.

A variety of historical figures are known to have cross-dressed to varying degrees. Many women found they had to disguise themselves as men in order to participate in the wider world. For example, it is postulated that Margaret King cross-dressed in the early 19th century to attend medical school, as universities at that time accepted only male students. A century later, Vita Sackville-West dressed as a young soldier in order to &quot;walk out&quot; with her girlfriend Violet Keppel, to avoid the street harassment that two women would have faced. The prohibition on women wearing male garb, once strictly applied, still has echoes today in some Western societies which require girls and women to wear skirts, for example as part of school uniform or office dress codes. In some countries, even in casual settings, women are still prohibited from wearing traditionally male clothing.

==Legal issues==
In many countries, cross-dressing was illegal under laws that identified it as indecent or immoral. Many such laws were challenged in the late 1900s giving people the right to freedom of gender expression with regard to their clothing. There still remains 13 UN member states that explicitly criminalize transgender individuals, and there exist even more countries that use a great deal of diverse laws to target them. The third edition of the Trans Legal Mapping Report, done by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association found that an especially common method to target these individuals is through cross-dressing regulations.

=== North America ===
For instance, from 1840 forward, United States saw state and city laws forbidding people from appearing in public while dressed in clothes not commonly associated with their assigned sex. The goal of this wave of policies was to create a tool that would enforce a normative gender narrative, targeting multiple gender identities across the gender spectrum. With the progression of time, styles, and societal trends, it became even more difficult to draw the line between what was cross-dressing or not. Only recently have these laws changed. As recently as 2011, it was still possible for a man to get arrested for &quot;impersonating a woman&quot; — a vestige of the 19th century laws. Even with this, legal issues surrounding cross-dressing perpetuated all throughout the mid 20th century. During this time period, police would often reference laws that did not exist or laws that have been repealed in order to target the LGBTQ+ community.

=== Asia ===
Nepal decriminalized cross-dressing in 2007. Only in 2014 did an appeal court in Malaysia finally overturn a state law prohibiting Muslim men from cross-dressing as women.

=== Oceania ===
In the Australian state of Tasmania, cross-dressing in public was made a criminal offence in 1935, and this law was only repealed in 2000.

==Varieties==
There are many different kinds of cross-dressing and many different reasons why an individual might engage in cross-dressing behavior. Some people cross-dress as a matter of comfort or style, a personal preference for clothing associated with the opposite gender. Some people cross-dress to shock others or challenge social norms; others will limit their cross-dressing to underwear, so that it is not apparent. Some people attempt to pass as a member of the opposite gender in order to gain access to places or resources they would not otherwise be able to reach.

===Theater and performance===
Single-sex theatrical troupes often have some performers who cross-dress to play roles written for members of the opposite sex (travesti and trouser roles). Cross-dressing, particularly the depiction of males wearing dresses, was historically used for comic effect onstage and on-screen.

Boy player refers to children who performed in Medieval and English Renaissance playing companies. Some boy players worked for the adult companies and performed the female roles as women did not perform on the English stage in this period. Others worked for children&#x27;s companies in which all roles, not just the female ones, were played by boys. 

In an effort to clamp down on kabuki&#x27;s popularity, women&#x27;s kabuki, known as , was banned in 1629 in Japan for being too erotic. Following this ban, young boys began performing in , which was also soon banned. Thus adult men play female roles in kabuki.

Dan is the general name for female roles in Chinese opera, often referring to leading roles. They may be played by male or female actors. In the early years of Peking opera, all roles were played by men, but this practice is no longer common in any Chinese opera genre.

Women have often been excluded from Noh, and men often play female characters in it.

Drag is a special form of performance art based on the act of cross-dressing. A drag queen is usually a male-assigned person who performs as an exaggeratedly feminine character, in heightened costuming sometimes consisting of a showy dress, high-heeled shoes, obvious make-up, and wig. A drag queen may imitate famous female film or pop-music stars. A faux queen is a female-assigned person employing the same techniques. A drag king is a counterpart of the drag queen – a female-assigned person who adopts a masculine persona in performance or imitates a male film or pop-music star. Some female-assigned people undergoing Gender-affirming surgery also self-identify as &#x27;drag kings&#x27;.The modern activity of battle reenactments has raised the question of women passing as male soldiers. In 1989, Lauren Burgess dressed as a male soldier in a U.S. National Park Service reenactment of the Battle of Antietam, and was ejected after she was discovered to be a woman. Burgess sued the Park Service for sexual discrimination. The case spurred spirited debate among Civil War buffs. In 1993, a federal judge ruled in Burgess&#x27;s favor.

&quot;Wigging&quot; refers to the practice of male stunt doubles taking the place of an actress, parallel to &quot;paint downs&quot;, where white stunt doubles are made up to resemble black actors. Female stunt doubles have begun to protest this norm of &quot;historical sexism&quot;, saying that it restricts their already limited job possibilities.

====British pantomime, television and comedy====

Cross-dressing is a traditional popular trope in British comedy. The pantomime dame in British pantomime dates from the 19th century, which is part of the theatrical tradition of female characters portrayed by male actors in drag. Widow Twankey (Aladdin&#x27;s mother) is a popular pantomime dame: in 2004 Ian McKellen played the role.

The Monty Python comedy troupe donned frocks and makeup, playing female roles while speaking in falsetto. Character comics such as Benny Hill and Dick Emery drew upon several female identities. In the BBC&#x27;s long-running sketch show &quot;The Dick Emery Show&quot; (broadcast from 1963 to 1981), Emery played Mandy, a busty peroxide blonde whose catchphrase, &quot;Ooh, you are awful ... but I like you!&quot;, was given in response to a seemingly innocent remark made by her interviewer, but perceived by her as ribald double entendre. The popular tradition of cross dressing in British comedy extended to the 1984 music video for Queen&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot; where the band parody several female characters from the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

===Sexual fetishes===
Transvestic fetishism is a psychiatric diagnosis applied to people who are sexually aroused by the act of cross-dressing and experience significant distress or impairment – socially or occupationally – because of their behavior. The limit to gynephilic men in the fourth edition of &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; was abrogated with the passage of the DSM-5.

Sometimes either cisgender member of an androphilic and gynephilic couple will cross-dress in order to arouse the other. For example, the male might wear skirts or lingerie and/or the female will wear boxers or other male clothing. (See also forced feminization)

===Passing===

Some people who cross-dress may endeavor to project a complete impression of belonging to another gender, including mannerisms, speech patterns, and emulation of sexual characteristics. This is referred to as passing or &quot;trying to pass&quot;, depending how successful the person is. An observer who sees through the cross-dresser&#x27;s attempt to pass is said to have &quot;read&quot; or &quot;clocked&quot; them. There are videos, books, and magazines on how a man may look more like a woman.

Others may choose to take a mixed approach, adopting some feminine traits and some masculine traits in their appearance. For instance, a man might wear both a dress and a beard. This is sometimes known as &quot;genderfuck&quot;. In a broader context, cross-dressing may also refer to other actions undertaken to pass as a particular sex, such as packing (accentuating the male crotch bulge) or, the opposite, tucking (concealing the male crotch bulge).

== Gender disguise ==
Gender disguise has been used by women and girls to pass as male, and by men and boys to pass as female. Gender disguise has also been used as a plot device in storytelling, particularly in narrative ballads, and is a recurring motif in literature, theater, and film. Historically, some women have cross-dressed to take up male-dominated or male-exclusive professions, such as military service. Conversely, some men have cross-dressed to escape from mandatory military service or as a disguise to assist in political or social protest, as men in Wales did in the Rebecca Riots and when conducting Ceffyl Pren as a form of mob justice.

=== Sports ===
Conversation surrounding exclusion and gender inequality in sports has been around for decades. Some women have dressed as men to enter male sports, or registered in male sports using an alias.

==== Roberta &quot;Bobbi&quot; Gibb ====
Roberta &quot;Bobbi&quot; Gibb is the first woman to have competed in the Boston Marathon. In 1966 Bobbi Gibb wrote a letter to the Boston Athletic Association asking to participate in the race happening that year. When Gibb received her letter back in the mail she was faced with the news that her entry to the race was denied due to her gender. Rather than just accept her fate, Gibb did not take no for an answer and decided to run the marathon anyways—however, she would do it hidden as a man. On the day of the race Gibb showed up in an oversized sweatshirt, her brother&#x27;s shorts, and men&#x27;s running shoes. Gibb hid in the bushes until the race started and then joined in with the crowd. Eventually her fellow runners figured out Gibb&#x27;s real gender but stated that they would make sure that she finished the race. Gibb ended up finishing her first Boston Marathon in 3 hours, 27 minutes and 40 seconds. She crossed the finish line with blistered, bleeding feet from the men&#x27;s running shoes she was wearing. Gibb&#x27;s act of defiance influenced other women marathon runners of the time like Katherine Switzer, who also registered under an alias to be able to run the race in 1967. It would not be until 1972 until there was an official women&#x27;s race within the Boston Marathon.

==== Sam Kerr ====
Sam Kerr is a forward for the Australian Women&#x27;s Soccer Team and Chelsea FC in the FA Women&#x27;s Super League. Kerr has been regarded as one of the best forward players in the sport and has been one of the most highly paid players in women&#x27;s soccer as well. While Kerr now shares the world state with other great women soccer players, as a young child she shared the field with young boys. Kerr grew up in a suburb of Perth where there was little to no access to young girls soccer teams in the direct area. Not having a girls team to play on did not bother Kerr though, she simply played on a youth boys team where all of her teammates just assumed she was also a boy. Kerr states in her book &quot;My Journey to the World Cup&quot; that she continued to hide her gender because she did not want to be treated any differently. In her book Kerr also revealed that when one of her teammates found out that she was, in fact a girl, he cried. While Kerr&#x27;s act of hiding her gender was initially an accident, it is still an example of how women (and in the case a young girl) can create opportunities for themselves by looking or acting as a man.

=== War ===
One of the most common instances of gender disguise is in the instance of war/militaristic situations. From Joan of Arc in the 15th century to Mulan from the animated Disney Mulan to young girls in World War II, there have been many different people of many different sexes that disguise themselves as men in order to be able to fight in wars.

==== Joan of Arc ====
Born , St Joan of Arc or the Maid of Orleans is one of the oldest examples of gender disguise. At 13, after receiving a revelation that she was supposed to lead the French to victory over the English in the 100 years war, Joan donned the clothing of a male soldier in the French army. Joan was able to convince King Charles the VIII to allow her to take the lead of some of the French armies in order to help him get his crown back. Ultimately, Joan of Arc was successful in claiming victory over the English but was captured in 1430 and found guilty of heresy, leading to her execution in 1431. The impact of her actions was seen even after Joan&#x27;s death. During the suffragette movement, Joan of Arc was used as an inspiration for the movement, particularly in Britain where many used her actions as fuel for their fight for political reform.

==== Deborah Sampson ====
Born in 1760 in Plympton, Massachusetts, Deborah Sampson was the first female soldier in the US Army. The only woman in the Revolution to receive a full military pension, at age 18 Deborah took the name &quot;Robert Shirtleff&quot; and enlisted in revolutionary forces. In her capacity as a soldier, she was very successful, being named captain and leading an infantry in the capture of 15 enemy soldiers among other things. One and a half years into service, her true sex was revealed when she had to receive medical care. Following an honorable discharge, Deborah petitioned congress for her full pay that was withheld on the grounds of being an &quot;invalid soldier&quot; and eventually received it. She died in 1827 at age 66. Even after her death, Deborah Sampson continues to be a &quot;hero of the American Revolution&quot;. In 2019, a diary from corporal Abner Weston shares about Deborah Sampson&#x27;s previously unknown first attempt to enlist in the Continental Army.

These women are just a few among many who have disguised themselves as men in order to be able to fight in many different wars. Others who have used gender disguise for this purpose include Kit Kavanaugh/Christian Davies, Hannah Snell, Sarah Emma Edmonds, Frances Clayton, Dorothy Lawrence, Zoya Smirnow, and Brita Olofsdotter.

=== Journalism and culture ===
In some instances, women in journalism deem wearing the identity of a man necessary in order to gather information that is only accessible from the male point of view. In other cases, people cross-dress to navigate certain cultures and/or specific circumstances that involve strict gender norms and expectations.

==== Norah Vincent ====
Norah Vincent, author of the book &quot;Self-Made Man: One Woman&#x27;s Journey Into Manhood and Back Again&quot;, used gender disguise in order to go undercover as a man to penetrate men&#x27;s social circles and experience life as a man. In 2003, Vincent put her life on pause to adopt a new masculine identity as Ned Vincent. She worked with a makeup artist and vocal coach in order to convincingly play the role of a biological man. She wore an undersized sports bra, a stuffed jock strap, and size 11½ shoes to deceive those around her. In her book, Vincent makes discoveries about socialization, romance, sex, and stress as a man that leads her to conclude that, &quot;[Men] have different problems than women have, but they don&#x27;t have it better&quot;, However, Vincent developed controversial opinions about sex and gender, claiming that transgender people are not legitimate until they undergo hormone therapy and surgical intervention. After writing &quot;Self-Made Man,&quot; Vincent became a victim of depression; she died by medically assisted suicide in 2022.

==== Bacha posh ====
Bacha posh, an Afghan tradition, involves the crossdressing of young Afghan girls by their families so that they present to the public as boys. Families without sons, or whose sons are heavily outnumbered by daughters, may choose to raise one of their daughters bacha posh for a number of reasons. Having a bacha posh daughter may ease financial burdens, as girls and women are generally prohibited from work in contemporary Afghanistan, and improve their social status, as families with boys tend to be more well regarded in Afghan society. While there is no law that prohibits bacha posh, girls are expected to revert to traditional gender norms upon reaching puberty. According to Thomas Barfield, an anthropology professor at Boston University, bacha posh is &quot;one of the most under-investigated&quot; topics in the realm of gender studies, making difficult to determine exactly how common the practice is in Afghan society. However, some prominent female figures in Afghan society have admitted to being bacha posh in their youth. A more famous example of this is Afghan parliament member Azita Rafaat. Rafaat claims that bacha posh was a positive experience that built her self-confidence in Afghanistan&#x27;s heavily patriarchal society and gave her a more well rounded understanding of women&#x27;s issues in Afghanistan.

==Fashion==
The actual determination of cross-dressing is largely socially constructed. For example, in Western society, trousers have long been adopted for usage by women, and it is no longer regarded as cross-dressing. In cultures where men have traditionally worn skirt-like garments such as the kilt or sarong, these are not seen as women&#x27;s clothing, and wearing them is not seen as cross-dressing for men. In many parts of the world, it remains socially disapproved for men to wear clothes traditionally associated with women.

Cosplaying may also involve cross-dressing, for some females may wish to dress as a male, and vice versa (see crossplay). Females may choose to chest bind while cosplaying a male character.

While creating a more feminine figure, male cross-dressers will may utilize breast forms or breast plates to give the appearance of breasts. Some male cross-dressers may also cinch their waists or use padding to create a profile that appears more stereotypically feminine.

While most male cross-dressers utilize clothing associated with modern women, some are involved in subcultures that involve dressing as little girls or in vintage clothing. Some such men have written that they enjoy dressing as femininely as possible, so they wear frilly dresses with lace and ribbons, bridal gowns complete with veils, as well as multiple petticoats, corsets, girdles and/or garter belts with nylon stockings.

The term &quot;underdressing&quot; is used by male cross-dressers to describe wearing female undergarments such as panties under their male clothes. The famous low-budget film-maker Edward D. Wood Jr. (who also went out in public dressed in drag as &quot;Shirley&quot;, his female alter ego) said he often wore women&#x27;s underwear under his military uniform as a Marine during World War II. &quot;Female masking&quot; is a form of cross-dressing in which men wear masks that present them as female.

Some drag kings may use binders or chest plates to give the impression of a more stereotypically male physique, but others forego this. They may also paste or draw on fake facial hair. Drag kings may use a phallic prosthetic for packing to create the appearance of having male genitals.

==Social issues==

Cross-dressers may begin wearing clothing associated with the opposite sex in childhood, using the clothes of a sibling, parent, or friend. Some parents have said they allowed their children to cross-dress and, in many cases, the child stopped when they became older. The same pattern often continues into adulthood, where there may be confrontations with a spouse, partner, family member or friend. Married cross-dressers can experience considerable anxiety and guilt if their spouse objects to their behavior.

Sometimes because of guilt or other reasons cross-dressers dispose of all their clothing, a practice called &quot;purging&quot;, only to start collecting the other gender&#x27;s clothing again.

==Festivals==
Celebrations of cross-dressing occur in widespread cultures. The Abissa festival in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Ofudamaki in Japan, and Kottankulangara Festival in India are all examples of this.

==Analysis==
Advocacy for social change has done much to relax the constrictions of gender roles on men and women, but they are still subject to prejudice from some people. It is noticeable that as being transgender becomes more socially accepted as a normal human condition, the prejudices against cross-dressing are changing quite quickly, just as the similar prejudices against homosexuals have changed rapidly in recent decades.

The reason it is so hard to have statistics for female cross-dressers is that the line where cross-dressing stops and cross-dressing begins has become blurred, whereas the same line for men is as well defined as ever. This is one of the many issues being addressed by third wave feminism as well as the modern-day masculist movement.

The general culture has very mixed views about cross-dressing. A woman who wears her husband&#x27;s shirt to bed is considered attractive, while a man who wears his wife&#x27;s nightgown to bed may be considered transgressive. Marlene Dietrich in a tuxedo was considered very erotic; Jack Lemmon in a dress was considered ridiculous. All this may result from an overall gender role rigidity for males; that is, because of the prevalent gender dynamic throughout the world, men frequently encounter discrimination when deviating from masculine gender norms, particularly violations of heteronormativity. A man&#x27;s adoption of feminine clothing is often considered a going down in the gendered social order whereas a woman&#x27;s adoption of what are traditionally men&#x27;s clothing (at least in the English-speaking world) has less of an impact because women have been traditionally subordinate to men, unable to affect serious change through style of dress. Thus when a male cross-dresser puts on his clothes, he transforms into the quasi-female and thereby becomes an embodiment of the conflicted gender dynamic. Following the work of Judith Butler, gender proceeds along through ritualized performances, but in male cross-dressing it becomes a performative &quot;breaking&quot; of the masculine and a &quot;subversive repetition&quot; of the feminine.

Psychoanalysts today do not regard cross-dressing by itself as a psychological problem, unless it interferes with a person&#x27;s life. &quot;For instance&quot;, said Joseph Merlino, senior editor of &quot;Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius&quot;, &quot;[suppose that]...I&#x27;m a cross-dresser and I don&#x27;t want to keep it confined to my circle of friends, or my party circle, and I want to take that to my wife and I don&#x27;t understand why she doesn&#x27;t accept it, or I take it to my office and I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t accept it, then it&#x27;s become a problem because it&#x27;s interfering with my relationships and environment&quot;,

== Cross-dressing in the 21st century ==

=== Fashion trends ===

Cross-dressing today is much more common and normalized due to trends such as camp fashion and androgynous fashion. These trends have long histories but have recently been popularized thanks to major designers, fashion media, and celebrities today. 
Camp is a style of fashion that has had a long history extending all the way back to the Victorian era to the modern era. During the Victorian era up until the mid-20th century, it was defined as an exaggerated and flamboyant style of dressing. This was typically associated with ideas of effeminacy, de-masculization, and homosexuality. As the trend entered the 20th century, it also developed an association with a lack of conduct, creating the connotation that those who engaged in Camp are unrefined, improper, distasteful, and, essentially, undignified. Though this was its former understanding, Camp has now developed a new role in the fashion industry. It is considered a fashion style that has &quot;failed seriousness&quot; and has instead become a fun way of self-expression. Thanks to its integration with high fashion and extravagance, Camp is now seen as a high art form of absurdity: including loud, vibrant, bold, fun, and empty frivolity.

Camp is often used in drag culture as a method of exaggerating or inversing traditional conceptions of what it means to be feminine. In actuality, the QTPOC community has had a large impact on Camp. This is exhibited by ballroom culture, camp/glamour queens, Black &#x27;70s funk, Caribbean Carnival costumes, Blaxploitation movies, &quot;pimp/player fashion&quot;, and more. This notion has also been materialized by camp icons such as Josephine Baker and RuPaul.

Androgynous fashion is described as neither masculine nor feminine rather it is the embodiment of a gender inclusive and sexually neutral fashion of expression. The general understanding of androgynous fashion is mixing both masculine and feminine pieces with the goal of producing a look that has no visual differentiations between one gender or another. This look is achieved by masking the general body so that one cannot identify the biological sex of an individual given the silhouette of the clothing pieces: Therefore, many androgynous looks include looser, baggier clothing that can conceal curves in the female body or using more &quot;feminine&quot; fabrics and prints for men.

Both of these style forms have been normalized and popularized by celebrities such as Harry Styles, Timothée Chalamet, Billie Eilish, Troye Sivan, and more.

=== Societal changes ===

Beyond fashion, cross-dressing in non-Western countries has not fully outgrown the negative connotations that it has in the West. For instance, many Eastern and Southeastern Asian countries have a narrative of discrimination and stigma against LGBTQ+ and cross-dressing individuals. This is especially evident in the post-pandemic world. During this time, it was clear to see the failures of these governments to provide sufficient support to these individuals due to a lack of legal services, lack of job opportunity, and more. For instance, to be able to receive government aid, these individuals need to be able to quickly change their legal name, gender, and other information on official ID documents. This fault augmented the challenges of income loss, food insecurity, safe housing, healthcare, and more for many trans and cross-dressing individuals. This was especially pertinent as many of these individuals relied on entertainment and sex work for income. With the pandemic removing these job opportunities, the stigmatisation and discrimination against these individuals only increased, especially in Southeast Asian countries. 

On the other hand, some Asian countries have grown to be more accepting of cross-dressing as modernization has increased. For instance, among Japan&#x27;s niche communities, there exists the otokonoko. This is a group of male-assigned individuals who engage in female cross-dressing as a form of gender expression. This trend originated with manga and grew with an increase in maid cafes, cosplaying, and more in the 2010s. With the normalization of this through cosplay, cross-dressing has become a large part of otaku and anime culture.

In 2023, Noor Alsaffar, an Iraqi vlogger and model, who described themselves as a cross-dresser, was murdered. The killing of Alsaffar appears to be linked to an increase in homophobia and transphobia in Iraq.

==Across media==
Women dressed as men, and less often men dressed as women, is a common trope in fiction and folklore. For example, in Thrymskvitha, Thor disguised himself as Freya. These disguises were also popular in Gothic fiction, such as in works by Charles Dickens, Alexandre Dumas, père, and Eugène Sue, and in a number of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, such as &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. In &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, Toad dresses as a washerwoman, and in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Éowyn pretends to be a man.

In science fiction, fantasy and women&#x27;s literature, this literary motif is occasionally taken further, with literal transformation of a character from male to female or vice versa. Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot; focuses on a man who becomes a woman, as does a warrior in Peter S. Beagle&#x27;s &quot;The Innkeeper&#x27;s Song&quot;; while in Geoff Ryman&#x27;s &quot;The Warrior Who Carried Life&quot;, Cara magically transforms herself into a man.

Other popular examples of gender disguise include &quot;Madame Doubtfire&quot; (published as &quot;Alias Madame Doubtfire&quot; in the United States) and its movie adaptation &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, featuring a man disguised as a woman. Similarly, the movie &quot;Tootsie&quot; features Dustin Hoffman disguised as a woman, while the movie &quot;The Associate&quot; features Whoopi Goldberg disguised as a man. Japanese fashion designer and visual kei musician Mana of the bands Malice Mizer and Moi dix Mois is notable for wearing traditionally female clothes. He is credited with popularizing cross-dressing among visual kei bands.

==Medical views==
The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems listed &quot;dual-role transvestism&quot; (non-sexual cross-dressing) and &quot;fetishistic transvestism&quot; (cross-dressing for sexual pleasure) as disorders in its 10th edition, but both were removed for the 11th edition, which came into effect in 2022. 

Transvestic fetishism is a psychiatric diagnosis applied to people who are sexually aroused by the act of cross-dressing and experience significant distress or impairment – socially or occupationally – because of their behavior. Under the name transvestic disorder, it is categorized as a paraphiliac disorder in the DSM-5. The DSM-5 defines a paraphilic disorder as &quot;a paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, to others&quot;, adding that paraphilias do not require or justify psychiatric treatment in themselves.

<text>The Channel Tunnel (), sometimes referred to by the portmanteau Chunnel, is a undersea railway tunnel, opened in 1994, that connects Folkestone (Kent, England) with Coquelles (Pas-de-Calais, France) beneath the English Channel at the Strait of Dover. It is the only fixed link between the island of Great Britain and the European mainland. 

At its lowest point, it is below the sea bed and below sea level. At , it has the longest underwater section of any tunnel in the world and is the third-longest railway tunnel in the world. The speed limit for trains through the tunnel is . The tunnel is owned and operated by Getlink, formerly Groupe Eurotunnel.

The tunnel carries high-speed Eurostar passenger trains, LeShuttle services for road vehicles and freight trains. It connects end-to-end with high-speed railway lines: the LGV Nord in France and High Speed 1 in England. In 2017, rail services carried 10.3million passengers and 1.22million tonnes of freight, and the Shuttle carried 10.4million passengers, 2.6million cars, 51,000 coaches, and 1.6million lorries (equivalent to 21.3million tonnes of freight), compared with 11.7million passengers, 2.6million lorries and 2.2million cars by sea through the Port of Dover.

Plans to build a cross-Channel tunnel were proposed as early as 1802, but British political and media criticism motivated by fears of compromising national security had disrupted attempts to build one. An early unsuccessful attempt was made in the late 19th century, on the English side, &quot;in the hope of forcing the hand of the English Government&quot;. The eventual successful project, organised by Eurotunnel, began construction in 1988 and opened in 1994. Estimated to cost £5.5 billion in 1985, it was at the time the most expensive construction project ever proposed. The cost finally amounted to £9 billion (equivalent to £ billion in ).

Since its opening, the tunnel has experienced occasional mechanical problems. Both fires and cold weather have temporarily disrupted its operation. Since at least 1997, aggregations of migrants around Calais seeking entry to the United Kingdom, such as through the tunnel, have prompted deterrence and countermeasures.

== History ==

=== Earlier proposals ===

In 1802, Albert Mathieu-Favier, a French mining engineer, proposed a tunnel under the English Channel, with illumination from oil lamps, horse-drawn coaches, and an artificial island positioned mid-Channel for changing horses. His design envisaged a bored two-level tunnel with the top tunnel used for transport and the bottom one for groundwater flows.

In 1839, Aimé Thomé de Gamond, a Frenchman, performed the first geological and hydrographical surveys on the Channel between Calais and Dover. He explored several schemes and, in 1856, presented a proposal to Napoleon III for a mined railway tunnel from Cap Gris-Nez to East Wear Point with a port/airshaft on the Varne sandbank at a cost of 170 million francs, or less than £7 million.


In 1865, a deputation led by George Ward Hunt proposed the idea of a tunnel to the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day, William Ewart Gladstone.

In 1866, Henry Marc Brunel made a survey of the floor of the Strait of Dover. By his results, he proved that the floor was composed of chalk, like the adjoining cliffs, and thus a tunnel was feasible. For this survey, he invented the gravity corer, which is still used in geology.

Around 1866, William Low and Sir John Hawkshaw promoted tunnel ideas, but apart from preliminary geological studies, none were implemented.

An official Anglo-French protocol was established in 1876 for a cross-Channel railway tunnel.

In 1881, British railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin and Alexandre Lavalley, a French Suez Canal contractor, were in the Anglo-French Submarine Railway Company that conducted exploratory work on both sides of the Channel. From June 1882 to March 1883, the British tunnel boring machine tunnelled, through chalk, a total of , while Lavalley used a similar machine to drill from Sangatte on the French side. However, the cross-Channel tunnel project was abandoned in 1883, despite this success, after fears raised by the British military that an underwater tunnel might be used as an invasion route. Nevertheless, in 1883, this TBM was used to bore a railway ventilation tunnel— in diameter and long—between Birkenhead and Liverpool, England, through sandstone under the Mersey River. These early works were encountered more than a century later during the project TransManche Link (TML).

A 1907 film, &quot;Tunnelling the English Channel&quot; by pioneer filmmaker Georges Méliès, depicts King Edward VII and President Armand Fallières dreaming of building a tunnel under the English Channel.

In 1919, during the Paris Peace Conference, British prime minister David Lloyd George repeatedly brought up the idea of a Channel tunnel as a way of reassuring France about British willingness to defend against another German attack. The French did not take the idea seriously, and nothing came of the proposal.

In the 1920s, Winston Churchill advocated for the Channel Tunnel, using that exact name in his essay &quot;Should Strategists Veto The Tunnel?&quot; It was published on 27 July 1924 in the &quot;Weekly Dispatch&quot;, and argued vehemently against the idea that the tunnel could be used by a Continental enemy in an invasion of Britain. Churchill expressed his enthusiasm for the project again in an article for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on 12 February 1936, &quot;Why Not A Channel Tunnel?&quot;

There was another proposal in 1929, but nothing came of this discussion and the idea was abandoned. Proponents estimated the construction cost at US$150million. The engineers had addressed the concerns of both nations&#x27; military leaders by designing two sumps – one near the coast of each country – that could be flooded at will to block the tunnel, but this did not appease the military, or dispel concerns about hordes of tourists who would disrupt English life.

A British film from Gaumont Studios, &quot;The Tunnel&quot; (also known as &quot;TransAtlantic Tunnel&quot;), was released in 1935 as a science-fiction project concerning the creation of a transatlantic tunnel. It referred briefly to its protagonist, a Mr. McAllan, as having completed a British Channel tunnel successfully in 1940, five years into the future of the film&#x27;s release.

Military fears continued during World War II. After the surrender of France, as Britain prepared for an expected German invasion, a Royal Navy officer in the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development calculated that Hitler could use slave labour to build two Channel tunnels in 18 months. The estimate caused rumours that Germany had already begun digging.

By 1955, defence arguments had become less relevant due to the dominance of air power, and both the British and French governments supported technical and geological surveys. In 1958 the 1881 workings were cleared in preparation for a £100,000 geological survey by the Channel Tunnel Study Group. 30% of the funding came from Channel Tunnel Co Ltd, the largest shareholder of which was the British Transport Commission, as successor to the South Eastern Railway. A detailed geological survey was carried out in 1964 and 1965.

Although the two countries agreed to build a tunnel in 1964, the phase 1 initial studies and signing of a second agreement to cover phase 2 took until 1973. The plan described a government-funded project to create two tunnels to accommodate car shuttle wagons on either side of a service tunnel. Construction started on both sides of the Channel in 1974.

On 20 January 1975, to the dismay of their French partners, the then-governing Labour Party in Britain cancelled the project due to uncertainty about the UK&#x27;s membership of the European Economic Community, doubling cost estimates amid the general economic crisis at the time. By this time the British tunnel boring machine was ready and the Ministry of Transport had performed a experimental drive. (This short tunnel, named Adit A1, was eventually reused as the starting and access point for tunnelling operations from the British side, and remains an access point to the service tunnel.) The cancellation costs were estimated at £17million. On the French side, a tunnel-boring machine had been installed underground in a stub tunnel. It lay there for 14 years until 1988, when it was sold, dismantled, refurbished and shipped to Turkey, where it was used to drive the Moda tunnel for the Istanbul Sewerage Scheme.

=== Initiation of project ===

In 1979, the &quot;Mouse-hole Project&quot; was suggested when the Conservatives came to power in Britain. The concept was a single-track rail tunnel with a service tunnel but without shuttle terminals. The British government took no interest in funding the project, but British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher did not object to a privately funded project, although she said she assumed it would be for cars rather than trains. In 1981, Thatcher and French president François Mitterrand agreed to establish a working group to evaluate a privately funded project. In June 1982 the Franco-British study group favoured a twin tunnel to accommodate conventional trains and a vehicle shuttle service. In April 1985 promoters were invited to submit scheme proposals. Four submissions were shortlisted:
* Channel Tunnel, a rail proposal based on the 1975 scheme presented by Channel Tunnel Group/France–Manche (CTG/F–M).
* Eurobridge, a suspension bridge with a series of spans with a roadway in an enclosed tube.
* Euroroute, a tunnel between artificial islands approached by bridges.
* Channel Expressway, a set of large-diameter road tunnels with mid-Channel ventilation towers.

The cross-Channel ferry industry protested using the name &quot;Flexilink&quot;. In 1975 there was no campaign protesting a fixed link, with one of the largest ferry operators (Sealink) being state-owned. Flexilink continued rousing opposition throughout 1986 and 1987. Public opinion strongly favoured a drive-through tunnel, but concerns about ventilation, accident management and driver mesmerisation resulted in the only shortlisted rail submission, CTG/F-M, being awarded the project in January 1986. Reasons given for the selection included that it caused least disruption to shipping in the Channel and least environmental disruption, was the best protected against terrorism, and was the most likely to attract sufficient private finance.

=== Arrangement ===
The British &quot;Channel Tunnel Group&quot; consisted of two banks and five construction companies, while their French counterparts, &quot;France–Manche&quot;, consisted of three banks and five construction companies. The banks&#x27; role was to advise on financing and secure loan commitments. On 2 July 1985, the groups formed Channel Tunnel Group/France–Manche (CTG/F–M). Their submission to the British and French governments was drawn from the 1975 project, including 11 volumes and a substantial environmental impact statement.

The Anglo-French Treaty on the Channel Tunnel was signed by both governments in Canterbury Cathedral. The Treaty of Canterbury (1986) prepared the Concession for the construction and operation of the Fixed Link by privately owned companies and outlined arbitration methods to be used in the event of disputes. It established the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC), responsible for monitoring all matters associated with the Tunnel&#x27;s construction and operation on behalf of the British and French governments, and a Safety Authority to advise the IGC.
It drew a land frontier between the two countries in the middle of the Channel tunnel—the first of its kind.

Design and construction were done by the ten construction companies in the CTG/F-M group. The French terminal and boring from Sangatte were done by the five French construction companies in the joint venture group &quot;GIE Transmanche Construction&quot;. The English Terminal and boring from Shakespeare Cliff were done by the five British construction companies in the &quot;Translink Joint Venture&quot;. The two partnerships were linked by a bi-national project organisation, TransManche Link (TML). The &quot;Maître d&#x27;Oeuvre&quot; was a supervisory engineering body employed by Eurotunnel under the terms of the concession that monitored the project and reported to the governments and banks.

In France, with its long tradition of infrastructure investment, the project had widespread approval. The French National Assembly approved it unanimously in April 1987, and after a public inquiry, the Senate approved it unanimously in June. In Britain, select committees examined the proposal, making history by holding hearings away from Westminster, in Kent. In February 1987, the third reading of the Channel Tunnel Bill took place in the House of Commons, and passed by 94 votes to 22. The Channel Tunnel Act gained Royal assent and passed into law in July. Parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of Parliament on the basis of promises of regional Eurostar through train services that never materialised; the promises were repeated in 1996 when the contract for construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link was awarded.

=== Cost ===
The tunnel is a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) project with a concession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 96/97&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; TML would design and build the tunnel, but financing was through a separate legal entity, Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel absorbed CTG/F-M and signed a construction contract with TML, but the British and French governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions, now managed by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. The British and French governments gave Eurotunnel a 55-year operating concession (from 1987; extended by 10 years to 65 years in 1993) to repay loans and pay dividends. A Railway Usage Agreement was signed between Eurotunnel, British Rail and SNCF guaranteeing future revenue in exchange for the railways obtaining half of the tunnel&#x27;s capacity.

Private funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale. Initial equity of £45 million was raised by CTG/F-M, increased by £206 million private institutional placement, £770 million was raised in a public share offer that included press and television advertisements, a syndicated bank loan and letter of credit arranged £5 billion. Privately financed, the total investment costs at 1985 prices were £2.6 billion. At the 1994 completion actual costs were, in 1985 prices, £4.65 billion: an 80% cost overrun. The cost overrun was partly due to enhanced safety, security, and environmental demands. Financing costs were 140% higher than forecast.

=== Construction ===

Working from both the English and French sides of the Channel, eleven tunnel boring machines (TBMs) cut through chalk marl to construct two rail tunnels and a service tunnel. The vehicle shuttle terminals are at Cheriton (part of Folkestone) and Coquelles, and are connected to the English M20 and French A16 motorways respectively.

Tunnelling commenced in 1988, and the tunnel began operating in 1994. At the peak of construction 15,000 people were employed with daily expenditure over £3 million. Ten workers, eight of them British, were killed during construction between 1987 and 1993, most in the first few months of boring.

=== Completion ===

A diameter pilot hole allowed the service tunnel to break through without ceremony on 30 October 1990. On 1 December 1990, Englishman Graham Fagg and Frenchman Phillippe Cozette broke through the service tunnel with the media watching. Eurotunnel completed the tunnel on time. (A BBC TV television commentator called Graham Fagg &quot;the first man to cross the Channel by land for 8000 years&quot;.) The two tunnelling efforts met each other with an offset of only . A Paddington Bear soft toy was chosen by British tunnellers as the first item to pass through to their French counterparts when the two sides met.

The tunnel was officially opened, one year later than originally planned, by the French president François Mitterrand and Queen Elizabeth II, at a ceremony in Calais on 6 May 1994. The Queen travelled through the tunnel to Calais on a Eurostar train, which stopped nose to nose with the train that carried President Mitterrand from Paris. After the ceremony, President Mitterrand and the Queen travelled on Le Shuttle to a similar ceremony in Folkestone. A full public service did not start for several months. The first freight train, however, ran on 1 June 1994 and carried Rover and Mini cars being exported to Italy.

The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL), now called High Speed 1, runs from St Pancras railway station in London to the tunnel portal at Folkestone in Kent. It cost £5.8 billion. On 16 September 2003 the prime minister, Tony Blair, opened the first section of High Speed 1, from Folkestone to north Kent. On 6 November 2007, the Queen officially opened High Speed 1 and St Pancras International station, replacing the original slower link to Waterloo International railway station. High Speed 1 trains travel at up to , the journey from London to Paris taking 2 hours 15 minutes, to Brussels 1 hour 51 minutes.

In 1994, the American Society of Civil Engineers elected the tunnel as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World. In 1995, the American magazine &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; published the results.

==Opening dates==
The opening was phased for various services offered as the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, the IGC, gave permission for various services to begin at several dates over the period 1994/1995 but start-up dates were a few days later.

== Engineering ==
Site investigation undertaken in the 20 years before construction confirmed earlier speculations that a tunnel could be bored through a chalk marl stratum. The chalk marl is conducive to tunnelling, with impermeability, ease of excavation and strength. The chalk marl runs along the entire length of the English side of the tunnel, but on the French side a length of has variable and difficult geology. The tunnel consists of three bores: two diameter rail tunnels, apart, in length with a diameter service tunnel in between. The three bores are connected by cross-passages and piston relief ducts. 

The service tunnel was used as a pilot tunnel, boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions. English access was provided at Shakespeare Cliff and French access from a shaft at Sangatte. The French side used five tunnel boring machines (TBMs), and the English side six. The service tunnel uses Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) and Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS). Fire safety was a critical design issue.

Between the portals at Beussingue and Castle Hill the tunnel is long, with under land on the French side and on the UK side, and under sea. It is the third-longest rail tunnel in the world, behind the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland and the Seikan Tunnel in Japan, but with the longest under-sea section. The average depth is below the seabed. On the UK side, of the expected of spoil approximately was used for fill at the terminal site, and the remainder was deposited at Lower Shakespeare Cliff behind a seawall, reclaiming of land. This land was then made into the Samphire Hoe Country Park. Environmental assessment did not identify any major risks for the project, and further studies into safety, noise, and air pollution were overall positive. However, environmental objections were raised concerning a high-speed link to London.

=== Geology ===
Successful tunnelling required a sound understanding of topography and geology and the selection of the best rock strata through which to dig. The geology of this site generally consists of northeasterly dipping Cretaceous strata, part of the northern limb of the Wealden-Boulonnais dome. It has:
* Continuous chalk in the cliffs on either side of the Channel, with no major faulting, as observed by Verstegan in 1605.
* Four geological strata, marine sediments laid down 90–100 million years ago; pervious Upper and Middle Chalk above slightly pervious Lower Chalk and finally impermeable Gault Clay. There is a sandy stratum of Glauconitic marl (tortia), between the chalk marl and the gault clay.
* A layer of chalk marl (French: &quot;craie bleue&quot;) in the lower third of the lower chalk appeared to present the best tunnelling medium. The chalk has a clay content of 30–40% providing impermeability to groundwater yet relatively easy excavation with strength allowing minimal support. Ideally, the tunnel would be bored in the bottom of the chalk marl, allowing water inflow from fractures and joints to be minimised, but above the gault clay that would increase stress on the tunnel lining and swell and soften when wet.

On the English side, the stratum dip is less than 5°; on the French side, this increases to 20°. Jointing and faulting are present on both sides. On the English side, only minor faults of displacement less than exist; on the French side, displacements of up to are present owing to the Quenocs anticlinal fold. The faults are of limited width, filled with calcite, pyrite and remolded clay. The increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of routes on the French side. To avoid confusion, microfossil assemblages were used to classify the chalk marl. On the French side, particularly near the coast, the chalk was harder, more brittle and more fractured than on the English side. This led to the adoption of different tunnelling techniques on the two sides.

The Quaternary undersea valley Fosse Dangeard, and Castle Hill landslip at the English portal, caused concerns. Identified by the 1964–1965 geophysical survey, the Fosse Dangeard is an infilled valley system extending below the seabed, south of the tunnel route in mid-channel. A 1986 survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel, and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible. The English terminal had to be located in the Castle Hill landslip, which consists of displaced and tipping blocks of lower chalk, glauconitic marl and gault debris. Thus the area was stabilised by buttressing and inserting drainage adits. The service tunnel acted as a pilot preceding the main ones, so that the geology, areas of crushed rock, and zones of high water inflow could be predicted. Exploratory probing was done in the service tunnel, in the form of extensive forward probing, vertical downward probes and sideways probing.

=== Site investigation ===
Marine soundings and samplings were made by Thomé de Gamond in 1833–67, establishing the seabed depth at a maximum of and the continuity of geological strata (layers). Surveying continued for many years, with 166 marine and 70 land-deep boreholes being drilled and more than 4,000linekilometres of the marine geophysical survey completed. Surveys were undertaken in 1958–1959, 1964–1965, 1972–1974 and 1986–1988.

The surveying in 1958–1959 catered for immersed tube and bridge designs, as well as a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At that time, marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964–1965 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70 boreholes, an area of deeply weathered rock with high permeability was located just south of Dover harbour.

Given the previous survey results and access constraints, a more southerly route was investigated in the 1972–1973 survey, and the route was confirmed to be feasible. Information for the tunnelling project also came from work before the 1975 cancellation. On the French side at Sangatte, a deep shaft with adits was made. On the English side at Shakespeare Cliff, the government allowed of diameter tunnel to be driven. The actual tunnel alignment, method of excavation and support were essentially the same as the 1975 attempt. In the 1986–1987 survey, previous findings were reinforced, and the characteristics of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium (chalk marl that made up 85% of the route) were investigated. Geophysical techniques from the oil industry were employed.

=== Tunnelling ===
Tunnelling was a major engineering challenge; the only precedent was the undersea Seikan Tunnel in Japan, which opened in 1988. A serious health and safety risk with building tunnels under water is major water inflow due to the high hydrostatic pressure from the sea above, under weak ground conditions. The tunnel also had the challenge of timescale: being privately funded, an early financial return was paramount.

The objective was to construct two rail tunnels, apart, in length; a service tunnel between the two main ones; pairs of -diameter cross-passages linking the rail tunnels to the service tunnel at spacing; piston relief ducts in diameter connecting the rail tunnels apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail tunnels, with the service tunnel always preceding the main ones by at least to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with excavating through chalk in the mining industry, while the undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem. The French one was based on the Mount Baker Ridge freeway tunnel in Seattle; the UK cavern was dug from the service tunnel ahead of the main ones, to avoid delay.

Precast segmental linings in the main tunnel boring machine (TBM) drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed, so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only done in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key. On the French side, a diameter deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff—the same place as the marine tunnels—not from Folkestone. The platform at the base of the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary, which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the Foster Yeoman coastal super quarry at Glensanda in Loch Linnhe on the west coast of Scotland.
On the French side, owing to the greater permeability to water, earth pressure balance TBMs with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were used in the closed mode for the first , but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum. This minimised the impact to the ground, allowed high water pressures to be withstood and also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one mainland machine (the short land drives of allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. 

On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs. Six machines were used; all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels. Towards the completion of the undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. These buried TBMs were then used to provide an electrical earth. The French TBMs then completed the tunnel and were dismantled. A gauge railway was used on the English side during construction.

In contrast to the English machines, which were given technical names, the French tunnelling machines were all named after women: Brigitte, Europa, Catherine, Virginie, Pascaline, Séverine.

After the tunnelling, one machine was on display at the side of the M20 motorway in Folkestone until Eurotunnel sold it on eBay for £39,999 to a scrap metal merchant. Another machine (T4 &quot;Virginie&quot;) still survives on the French side, adjacent to Junction 41 on the A16, in the middle of the D243E3/D243E4 roundabout. On it are the words &quot;hommage aux bâtisseurs du tunnel&quot;, meaning &quot;tribute to the builders of the tunnel&quot;.

=== Tunnel boring machines ===
The eleven tunnel boring machines were designed and manufactured through a joint venture between the Robbins Company of Kent, Washington, United States; Markham &amp; Co. of Chesterfield, England; and Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan. The TBMs for the service tunnels and main tunnels on the UK side were designed and manufactured by James Howden &amp; Company Ltd, Scotland.

=== Railway design ===
====Loading gauge====

The loading gauge height is .

==== Communications ====
There are three communication systems:
* Concession radio – for the tunnel operator&#x27;s personnel and vehicles within the concession area (terminals, tunnels, coastal shafts)
* Track-to-train radio – secure speech and data between trains and the railway control centre
* Shuttle internal radio – communication among shuttle crew, and to passengers over car radios

==== Power supply ====
Power is delivered to the locomotives via an overhead line at  with a normal overhead clearance of . All tunnel services run on electricity, shared equally from English and French sources. There are two substations fed at 400 kV at each terminal, but in an emergency, the tunnel&#x27;s lighting (about 20,000 light fittings) and the plant can be powered solely from either England or France.

The traditional railway south of London uses a 750 V DC third rail to deliver electricity, but since the opening of High Speed 1 there is no longer any need for tunnel trains to use it. High Speed 1, the tunnel and the LGV Nord all have power provided via overhead catenary at 25 kV 50 Hz AC. The railways on &quot;classic&quot; lines in Belgium are also electrified by overhead wires, but at 3,000 V DC.

==== Signalling ====
A cab signalling system gives information directly to train drivers on a display. There is a train protection system that stops the train if the speed exceeds that indicated on the in-cab display. TVM430, as used on LGV Nord and High Speed 1, is used in the tunnel. The TVM signalling is interconnected with the signalling on the high-speed lines on either side, allowing trains to enter and exit the tunnel system without stopping. The maximum speed is .

Signalling in the tunnel is coordinated from a control centre at the Folkestone terminal. A backup facility at the Calais terminal is staffed at all times and can take over all operations in the event of a breakdown or emergency.

==== Track system ====
Conventional ballasted tunnel track was ruled out owing to the difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision. The Sonneville International Corporation&#x27;s track system was chosen because it was reliable and also cost-effective. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT), which is held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of support the rails every and are held by thick closed-cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separates the blocks&#x27; mass movements from the concrete. The track provides extra overhead clearance for larger trains. UIC60 (60 kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.

Maintenance activities are less than projected. The rails had initially been ground on a yearly basis or after approximately 100MGT of traffic. Maintenance is facilitated by the existence of two tunnel junctions or crossover facilities, allowing for two-way operation in each of the six tunnel segments, and providing safe access for maintenance of one isolated tunnel segment at a time. The two crossovers are the largest artificial undersea caverns ever built, at long, high and wide. The English crossover is from Shakespeare Cliff, and the French crossover is from Sangatte.

==== Ventilation, cooling and drainage ====
The ventilation system maintains greater air pressure in the service tunnel than in the rail tunnels, so that in the event of a fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels. There is a normal ventilating system and a supplementary system. Twin fans are mounted in vertical shafts where digging for the tunnel began, on both sides of the channel: two in Sangatte, France, and two more at Shakespeare Cliff, UK. The normal ventilating system is connected direct to the service tunnel and provides fresh air through the cross- passages into the running tunnels, where it is dispersed by the piston effect of the train and shuttle movements. Only one fan on each side is ever running, the second being available as a backup. The supplementary ventilating system is a separate emergency system and can be used to control smoke or supply emergency air within the tunnels. On both systems, the fans are normally run on supply mode, pulling in air from the outside, but they can also be used in extraction mode to remove smoke or fumes from the tunnels.

Two cooling water pipes in each rail tunnel circulate chilled water to remove heat generated by the rail traffic. Pumping stations remove water in the tunnels from rain, seepage, and so on.

During the design stage of the tunnel, engineers found that its aerodynamic properties and the heat generated by high-speed trains as they passed through it would raise the temperature inside the tunnel to . As well as making the trains &quot;unbearably warm&quot; for passengers, this also presented a risk of equipment failure and track distortion. To cool the tunnel to below , engineers installed of diameter cooling pipes carrying of water. The network—Europe&#x27;s largest cooling system—was supplied by eight York Titan chillers running on R22, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) refrigerant gas.

Due to R22&#x27;s ozone depletion potential and high global warming potential, its use is being phased out in developed countries. Since 1 January 2015, it has been illegal in Europe to use HCFCs to service air-conditioning equipment; broken equipment that used HCFCs must be replaced with equipment that does not use it. In 2016, Trane was selected to provide replacement chillers for the tunnel&#x27;s cooling network. The York chillers were decommissioned and four &quot;next generation&quot; Trane Series E CenTraVac large-capacity (2,600 kW to 14,000 kW) chillers were installed—two in Sangatte, France, and two at Shakespeare Cliff, UK. The energy-efficient chillers, using Honeywell&#x27;s non-flammable, ultra-low GWP R1233zd(E) refrigerant, maintain temperatures at , and in their first year of operation generated savings of 4.8GWh—approximately 33%, equating to €500,000 ($585,000)—for tunnel operator Getlink.

=== Rolling stock ===
=== Rolling stock used previously ===
== Operators ==
=== LeShuttle ===
Getlink operates the LeShuttle, a vehicle shuttle service, through the tunnel.

Car shuttle sets have two separate halves: single and double deck. Each half has two loading/unloading wagons and 12 carrier wagons. Eurotunnel&#x27;s original order was for nine car shuttle sets.

Heavy goods vehicle (HGV) shuttle sets also have two halves, with each half containing one loading wagon, one unloading wagon and 14 carrier wagons. There is a club car behind the leading locomotive, where drivers must stay during the journey. Eurotunnel originally ordered six HGV shuttle sets.

Initially 38 LeShuttle locomotives were commissioned, with one at each end of a shuttle train.

=== Freight locomotives ===
Forty-six Class 92 locomotives for hauling freight trains and overnight passenger trains (the Nightstar project, which was abandoned) were commissioned, running on both overhead AC and third-rail DC power. However, RFF does not let these run on French railways, so there are plans to certify Alstom Prima II locomotives for use in the tunnel.

=== International passenger ===

Thirty-one Eurostar trains, based on the French TGV, built to UK loading gauge with many modifications for safety within the tunnel, were commissioned, with ownership split between British Rail, French national railways (SNCF) and Belgian national railways (NMBS/SNCB). British Rail ordered seven more for services north of London. Around 2010, Eurostar ordered ten trains from Siemens based on its Velaro product. The Class 374 entered service in 2016 and has been operating through the Channel Tunnel ever since alongside the current Class 373.

Germany (DB) tried from about 2005 to get permission to run train services to London. At the end of 2009, extensive fire-proofing requirements were dropped and DB received permission to run German Intercity-Express (ICE) test trains through the tunnel. In June 2013 DB was granted access to the tunnel, but these plans were ultimately terminated.

In October 2021, Renfe, the Spanish state railway company, expressed interest in operating a cross-Channel route between Paris and London using some of their existing trains with the intention of competing with Eurostar. No details have been revealed as to which trains would be used.

Between October and November 2023, three more companies expressed interest in potentially running services between London and various European cities:

*&quot;Evolyn&quot;, a start-up company based in Spain announced plans that they intended to run services between London and Paris by 2026. The company stated that orders had been placed for the newly developed &quot;Avelia&quot; high speed trains built by Alstom for international operations. Alstom however, noted that no firm order for any rolling stock had been placed, but that there were ongoing discussions with the start-up over potential procurements.
*Virgin Group founder Richard Branson had reportly hired the former managing director of Virgin Trains to initiate infrastructure talks on a potential international service to rival Eurostar running services between London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.
*Dutch start-up &quot;Heuro&quot; announced plans to start running services from Amsterdam to both Paris and London. Heuro is said to have officially applied for timetable slots beginning in December 2027 and is reportedly raising investment funds in Europe and the USA.

=== Service locomotives ===
Diesel locomotives for rescue and shunting work are Eurotunnel Class 0001 and Eurotunnel Class 0031.

== Operation ==
The following chart presents the estimated number of passengers and tonnes of freight, respectively, annually transported through the Channel Tunnel since 1994 (M = million).

=== Usage and services ===
Transport services offered by the tunnel are as follows:
* Eurotunnel Le Shuttle roll-on roll-off shuttle service for road vehicles and their drivers and passengers,
* Eurostar passenger trains,
* through freight trains.

Both the freight and passenger traffic forecasts made before the construction of the tunnel were overestimated; in particular, Eurotunnel&#x27;s commissioned forecasts were over-predictions. Although the captured share of Channel crossings was forecast correctly, high competition (especially from budget airlines which expanded rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s) and reduced tariffs led to low revenue. Overall cross-Channel traffic was overestimated.

With the European Union&#x27;s liberalisation of international rail services, the tunnel and High Speed 1 have been open to competition since 2010. There have been a number of operators interested in running trains through the tunnel and along High Speed 1 to London. In June 2013, after several years, Deutsche Bahn obtained a license to operate Frankfurt – London trains, not expected to run before 2016 because of delivery delays of the custom-made trains.
Plans for the service to Frankfurt seem to have been shelved in 2018.

==== Passenger traffic volumes ====
Cross-tunnel passenger traffic volumes peaked at 18.4 million in 1998, decreased to 14.9 million in 2003, and have increased substantially since then.

At the time of the decision about building the tunnel, 15.9 million passengers were predicted for Eurostar trains during the first year. In 1995, the first full year, actual numbers were a little over 2.9 million, growing to 7.1 million in 2000, then decreasing to 6.3 million in 2003. Eurostar was initially limited by the lack of a high-speed connection on the British side. After the completion of High Speed 1 in two stages in 2003 and 2007, traffic increased. In 2008, Eurostar carried 9,113,371 passengers, a 10% increase over the previous year, despite traffic limitations due to the 2008 Channel Tunnel fire. Eurostar passenger numbers continued to increase.

==== Freight traffic volumes ====
Freight volumes have been erratic, with a major decrease during 1997 due to a closure caused by a fire in a freight shuttle. Freight crossings increased over the period, indicating the substitutability of the tunnel by sea crossings. The tunnel has achieved a market share close to or above Eurotunnel&#x27;s 1980s predictions but Eurotunnel&#x27;s 1990 and 1994 predictions were overestimates.

For through freight trains, the first year prediction was 7.2 million tonnes; the actual 1995 figure was 1.3 m tonnes. Through freight volumes peaked in 1998 at 3.1 m tonnes. This fell back to 1.21 m tonnes in 2007, increasing slightly to 1.24 m tonnes in 2008. Together with that carried on freight shuttles, freight volumes have grown since opening, with 6.4 m tonnes carried in 1995, 18.4 m tonnes recorded in 2003 and 19.6 m tonnes in 2007. Numbers fell back in the wake of the 2008 fire.

Eurotunnel&#x27;s freight subsidiary is Europorte 2. In September 2006 EWS, the UK&#x27;s largest rail freight operator, announced that owing to the cessation of UK-French government subsidies of £52 million per annum to cover the tunnel &quot;Minimum User Charge&quot; (a subsidy of around £13,000 per train, at a traffic level of 4,000 trains per annum), freight trains would stop running after 30 November.

==== Economic performance ====

Shares in Eurotunnel were issued at £3.50 per share on 9 December 1987. By mid-1989 their price had risen to £11.00. Delays and cost overruns resulted in the price falling; during demonstration runs in October 1994, it reached an all-time low. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy. In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel&#x27;s operating concession by 34 years, to 2086. There was a financial restructuring of Eurotunnel in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite this, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability. A cost-benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few effects on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project and that the British economy would have been better off if it had not been constructed.

Under the terms of the Concession, Eurotunnel was obliged to investigate a cross-Channel road tunnel. In December 1999 road and rail tunnel proposals were presented to the British and French governments, but it was stressed that there was not enough demand for a second tunnel. A three-way treaty between the United Kingdom, France and Belgium governs border controls, with the establishment of &quot;control zones&quot; within which the officers of the other nation may exercise limited customs and law enforcement powers. For most purposes, these are at either end of the tunnel, with the French border controls on the UK side of the tunnel and vice versa. For some city-to-city trains, the train is a control zone. A binational emergency plan coordinates UK and French emergency activities.

In 1999 Eurostar posted its first net profit, having made a loss of £925m in 1995. In 2005 Eurotunnel was described as being in a serious situation. In 2013, operating profits rose 4percent from 2012, to £54million.

==== Security ====
There is a need for full passport controls, as the tunnel acts as a border between the Schengen Area and the Common Travel Area. There are juxtaposed controls, meaning that passports are checked before boarding by officials of the departing country and by officials of the destination country. These control points are only at the main Eurostar stations: French officials operate at London St Pancras, while British officials operate at Lille-Europe, Brussels-South, Paris-Gare du Nord, Rotterdam CS, and Amsterdam CS. During the winter ski season, they also operate at Gare de Bourg-Saint-Maurice and Moûtiers-Salins-Brides-les-Bains station. Eurostar passengers pass through airport-style security screening. For the shuttle road-vehicle trains, there are juxtaposed passport controls before boarding the trains.

When Eurostar trains ran south of Paris such as from Marseille, there were no passport and security checks before departure, and those trains had to stop in Lille at least 30 minutes to allow all passengers to be checked. No checks are performed on board. There have been plans for services from Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Cologne to London, but a major reason to cancel them was the need for a stop in Lille. Direct service from London to Amsterdam started on 4 April 2018; following the building of check-in terminals at Amsterdam and Rotterdam and the intergovernmental agreement, a direct service from the two Dutch cities to London started on 30 April 2020.

== Terminals ==


The terminals&#x27; sites are at Cheriton (near Folkestone in the United Kingdom) and Coquelles (near Calais in France). The UK site uses the M20 motorway for access. The terminals are organised with the frontier controls juxtaposed with the entry to the system to allow travellers to go onto the motorway at the destination country immediately after leaving the shuttle.

To achieve design output at the French terminal, the shuttles accept cars on double-deck wagons; for flexibility, ramps were placed inside the shuttles to provide access to the top decks. At Folkestone there are of the main-line track, 45 turnouts and eight platforms. At Calais there are of track and 44 turnouts. At the terminals, the shuttle trains traverse a figure eight to reduce uneven wear on the wheels. There is a freight marshalling yard west of Cheriton at Dollands Moor Freight Yard.

== Regional effect ==
A 1996 report from the European Commission predicted that Kent and Nord-Pas de Calais would have increased traffic volumes due to the general growth of cross-Channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel. In Kent, a high-speed rail line to London would transfer traffic from road to rail. Kent&#x27;s regional development would benefit from the tunnel, but being so close to London restricts the benefits. Gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent on the development of Ashford International railway station, without which Kent would be dependent totally on London&#x27;s expansion. Nord-Pas-de-Calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the Tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing.

The removal of a bottleneck by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to European high-speed transport and active political response is more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located in the immediate vicinity of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effects, such as &quot;The New Inn&quot; at Etchinghill which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being &#x27;the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel&#x27;. Tunnel-induced regional development is small compared to general economic growth. The South East of England is likely to benefit developmentally and socially from faster and cheaper transport to continental Europe, but the benefits are unlikely to be distributed equally throughout the region. The overall environmental effect is almost certainly negative.

Since the opening of the tunnel, small positive effects on the wider economy have been felt, but it is difficult to identify major economic successes attributed directly to the tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 68/69&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. p. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; The Eurotunnel does operate profitably, offering an alternative transportation mode unaffected by poor weather. High costs of construction did delay profitability, however, and companies involved in the tunnel&#x27;s construction and operation early in operation relied on government aid to deal with the accumulated debt.

== Illegal immigration ==
Illegal immigrants and would-be asylum seekers have used the tunnel to attempt to enter Britain. By 1997, the problem had attracted international press attention, and by 1999, the French Red Cross opened the first migrant centre at Sangatte, using a warehouse once used for tunnel construction; by 2002, it housed up to 1,500 people at a time, most of them trying to get to the UK. In 2001, most came from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran, but African countries were also represented.

Eurotunnel, the company that operates the crossing, said that more than 37,000 migrants were intercepted between January and July 2015. Approximately 3,000 migrants, mainly from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan and Afghanistan, were living in the temporary camps erected in Calais at the time of an official count in July 2015. An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 migrants were waiting in Calais for a chance to get to England.

Britain and France operate a system of juxtaposed controls on immigration and customs, where investigations happen before travel. France is part of the Schengen immigration zone, removing border checks in normal times between most EU member states; Britain and Ireland form their own separate Common Travel Area immigration zone.

Most illegal immigrants and would-be asylum seekers who got into Britain found some way to ride a freight train. Trucks are loaded onto freight trains. In a few instances, migrants stowed away in a liquid chocolate tanker and managed to survive, spread across several attempts. Although the facilities were fenced, total security was deemed impossible; migrants would even jump from bridges onto moving trains. In several incidents people were injured during the crossing; others tampered with railway equipment, causing delays and requiring repairs. Eurotunnel said it was losing £5m per month because of the problem.

In 2001 and 2002, several riots broke out at Sangatte, and groups of migrants (as many as 550 in a December 2001 incident) stormed the fences and attempted to enter &quot;en masse&quot;.

Other migrants seeking permanent UK settlement use the Eurostar passenger train. They may purport to be visitors (whether to be issued with a required visit visa, or deny and falsify their true intentions to obtain a maximum of 6-months-in-a-year at-port stamp); purport to be someone else whose documents they hold, or used forged or counterfeit passports. Such breaches result in refusal of permission to enter the UK, effected by Border Force after such a person&#x27;s identity is fully established, assuming they persist in their application to enter the UK.

Increased security measures around the tunnel have resulted in much of the migration moving to small boats instead.

=== Diplomatic efforts ===
Local authorities in both France and the UK called for the closure of the Sangatte migrant camp, and Eurotunnel twice sought an injunction against it. As of 2006 the United Kingdom blamed France for allowing Sangatte to open, and France blamed both the UK for its then lax asylum rules/law, and the EU for not having a uniform immigration policy. The problem&#x27;s &quot;cause célèbre&quot; nature even resulted in journalists being detained as they followed migrants onto railway property.

In 2002, the European Commission told France that it was in breach of European Union rules on the free transfer of goods because of the delays and closures as a result of its poor security. The French government built a double fence, at a cost of £5 million, reducing the numbers of migrants detected each week reaching Britain on goods trains from 250 to almost none. Other measures included CCTV cameras and increased police patrols. At the end of 2002, the Sangatte centre was closed after the UK agreed to absorb some migrants.

On 23 and 30 June 2015, striking workers associated with MyFerryLink damaged sections of track by burning car tires, cancelling all trains and creating a backlog of vehicles. Hundreds seeking to reach Britain attempted to stow away inside and underneath transport trucks destined for the UK. Extra security measures included a £2million upgrade of detection technology, £1million extra for dog searches, and £12million (over three years) towards a joint fund with France for security surrounding the Port of Calais.

=== Illegal attempts to cross and deaths ===
In 2002, a dozen migrants died in crossing attempts. In the two months from June to July 2015, ten migrants died near the French tunnel terminal, during a period when 1,500 attempts to evade security precautions were being made each day.

On 6 July 2015, a migrant died while attempting to climb onto a freight train while trying to reach Britain from the French side of the Channel. The previous month an Eritrean man was killed under similar circumstances.

During the night of 28 July 2015, one person, aged 25–30, was found dead after a night in which 1,500–2,000 migrants had attempted to enter the Eurotunnel terminal. The body of a Sudanese migrant was subsequently found inside the tunnel. On 4 August 2015, another Sudanese migrant walked nearly the entire length of one of the tunnels. He was arrested close to the British side, after having walked about through the tunnel.

== Mechanical incidents ==

=== Fires ===
There have been three fires in the tunnel, all on the heavy goods vehicle (HGV) shuttles, that were significant enough to close the tunnel, as well as other minor incidents.

On 9 December 1994, during an &quot;invitation only&quot; testing phase, a fire broke out in a Ford Escort car while its owner was loading it onto the upper deck of a tourist shuttle. The fire started at about 10:00, with the shuttle train stationary in the Folkestone terminal, and was put out about 40 minutes later with no passenger injuries.

On 18 November 1996, a fire broke out on an HGV shuttle wagon in the tunnel, but nobody was hurt seriously. The exact cause is unknown, although it was neither a Eurotunnel equipment nor rolling stock problem; it may have been due to arson of a heavy goods vehicle. It is estimated that the heart of the fire reached , with the tunnel severely damaged over , with some affected to some extent. Full operation recommenced six months after the fire.

On 21 August 2006, the tunnel was closed for several hours when a truck on an HGV shuttle train caught fire.

On 11 September 2008, a fire occurred in the Channel Tunnel at 13:57 GMT. The incident started on an HGV shuttle train travelling towards France. The event occurred from the French entrance to the tunnel. No one was killed but several people were taken to hospitals suffering from smoke inhalation, and minor cuts and bruises. The tunnel was closed to all traffic, with the undamaged South Tunnel reopening for limited services two days later. Full service resumed on 9 February 2009 after repairs costing €60 million.

On 29 November 2012, the tunnel was closed for several hours after a truck on an HGV shuttle caught fire.

On 17 January 2015, both tunnels were closed after a lorry fire that filled the midsection of Running Tunnel North with smoke. Eurostar cancelled all services. The shuttle train had been heading from Folkestone to Coquelles and stopped adjacent to cross-passage CP 4418 just before 12:30 UTC. 38 passengers and four members of Eurotunnel staff were evacuated into the service tunnel and transported to France in special STTS road vehicles. They were taken to the Eurotunnel Fire/Emergency Management Centre close to the French portal.

=== Train failures ===
On the night of 19/20 February 1996, about 1,000 passengers became trapped in the Channel Tunnel when Eurostar trains from London broke down owing to failures of electronic circuits caused by snow and ice being deposited and then melting on the circuit boards.

On 3 August 2007, an electrical failure lasting six hours caused passengers to be trapped in the tunnel on a shuttle.

On the evening of 18 December 2009, during the December 2009 European snowfall, five London-bound Eurostar trains failed inside the tunnel, trapping 2,000 passengers for approximately 16 hours, during the coldest temperatures in eight years. A Eurotunnel spokesperson explained that snow had evaded the train&#x27;s winterisation shields, and the transition from cold air outside to the tunnel&#x27;s warm atmosphere had melted the snow, resulting in electrical failures. One train was turned back before reaching the tunnel; two trains were hauled out of the tunnel by Eurotunnel Class 0001 diesel locomotives. The blocking of the tunnel led to the implementation of Operation Stack, the transformation of the M20 motorway into a linear car park.

The occasion was the first time that a Eurostar train was evacuated inside the tunnel; the failing of four at once was described as &quot;unprecedented&quot;. The Channel Tunnel reopened the following morning. Nirj Deva, Member of the European Parliament for South East England, had called for Eurostar chief executive Richard Brown to resign over the incidents. An independent report by Christopher Garnett (former CEO of Great North Eastern Railway) and Claude Gressier (a French transport expert) on the 18/19 December 2009 incidents was issued in February 2010, making 21 recommendations.

On 7 January 2010, a Brussels–London Eurostar broke down in the tunnel. The train had 236 passengers on board and was towed to Ashford; other trains that had not yet reached the tunnel were turned back.

=== Safety ===
The Channel Tunnel Safety Authority is responsible for some aspects of safety regulation in the tunnel; it reports to the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC).

The service tunnel is used for access to technical equipment in cross-passages and equipment rooms, to provide fresh-air ventilation and for emergency evacuation. The Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) allows fast access to all areas of the tunnel. The service vehicles are rubber-tired with a buried wire guidance system. 

The 24 STTS vehicles are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and emergencies. &quot;Pods&quot; with different purposes, up to a payload of , are inserted into the side of the vehicles. The vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel and are driven from either end. The maximum speed is when the steering is locked. A fleet of 15 Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS) was introduced to supplement the STTSs. The LADOGS has a short wheelbase with a turning circle, allowing two-point turns within the service tunnel. Steering cannot be locked like the STTS vehicles, and maximum speed is . Pods up to can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles. Drivers in the tunnel sit on the right, and the vehicles drive on the left. Owing to the risk of French personnel driving on their native right side of the road, sensors in the vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side.

The three tunnels contain of air that needs to be conditioned for comfort and safety. Air is supplied from ventilation buildings at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte, with each building capable of providing 100% standby capacity. Supplementary ventilation also exists on either side of the tunnel. In the event of a fire, ventilation is used to keep smoke out of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air. The tunnel was the first main-line railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment. Heat is generated from traction equipment and drag. The design limit was set at , using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel.

Trains travelling at high speed create piston effect pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and which drag on the trains. Piston relief ducts of diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4 ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results. However, this design led to extreme lateral forces on the trains, so a reduction in train speed was required and restrictors were installed in the ducts.

The safety issue of a possible fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk attracting the most attention in a 1994 safety case for three reasons: the opposition of ferry companies to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; Home Office statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station—now part of the Building Research Establishment—to give reports of vehicle fires, and liaised with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned. The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30 minutes, longer than the transit time of 27 minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or ultraviolet radiation, smoke and gases that can trigger halon gas to quench a fire. 

Since the HGV wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel. A water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at intervals. The ventilation system can control smoke movement. Special arrival sidings accept a train that is on fire, as the train is not allowed to stop whilst on fire in the tunnel unless continuing its journey would lead to a worse outcome. Two STTS (Service Tunnel Transportation System) vehicles with firefighting pods are on duty at all times, with a maximum delay of 10 minutes before they reach a burning train.
Eurotunnel has banned a wide range of hazardous goods from travelling in the tunnel.

== Unusual traffic ==

=== Trains ===

In 1999, the &quot;Kosovo Train for Life&quot; passed through the tunnel en route to Pristina, in Kosovo.

=== Other ===
In 2009, former F1 racing champion John Surtees drove a Ginetta G50 EV electric sports car prototype from England to France, using the service tunnel, as part of a charity event. He was required to keep to the speed limit. To celebrate the 2014 Tour de France&#x27;s transfer from its opening stages in Britain to France in July of that year, Chris Froome of Team Sky rode a bicycle through the service tunnel, becoming the first solo rider to do so. The crossing took under an hour, reaching speeds of —faster than most cross-channel ferries.

== Mobile network coverage ==
Since 2012, French operators Bouygues Telecom, Orange and SFR have covered Running Tunnel South, the tunnel bore normally used for travel from France to Britain.

In January 2014, UK operators EE and Vodafone signed ten-year contracts with Eurotunnel for Running Tunnel North. The agreements will enable both operators&#x27; subscribers to use 2G and 3G services. Both EE and Vodafone planned to offer LTE services on the route; EE said it expected to cover the route with LTE connectivity by the summer of 2014. EE and Vodafone will offer Channel Tunnel network coverage for travellers from the UK to France. Eurotunnel said it also held talks with Three UK but had yet to reach an agreement with the operator.

In May 2014, Eurotunnel announced that they had installed equipment from Alcatel-Lucent to cover Running Tunnel North and simultaneously to provide mobile service (GSM 900/1800 MHz and UMTS 2100 MHz) by EE, O2 and Vodafone. The service of EE and Vodafone commenced on the same date as the announcement. O2 service was expected to be available soon afterwards.

In November 2014, EE announced that it had previously switched on LTE earlier in September 2014. O2 turned on 2G, 3G and 4G services in November 2014, whilst Vodafone&#x27;s 4G was due to go live later.

== Other (non-transport) services ==
The tunnel also houses the 1,000 MW ElecLink interconnector to transfer power between the British and French electricity networks. During the night of 31 August/1 September 2021, the 51 km-long 320 kV DC cable was switched into service for the first time.

<text>Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting said to focus on a combination of &quot;low-life and high tech&quot;. It features futuristic technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence and cyberware, juxtaposed with societal collapse, dystopia or decay. Much of cyberpunk is rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers like Philip K. Dick, Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny, John Brunner, J. G. Ballard, Philip José Farmer and Harlan Ellison examined the impact of technology, drug culture, and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction.

Comics exploring cyberpunk themes began appearing as early as Judge Dredd, first published in 1977. Released in 1984, William Gibson&#x27;s influential debut novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot; helped solidify cyberpunk as a genre, drawing influence from punk subculture and early hacker culture. Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;Ronin&quot; is an example of a cyberpunk graphic novel. Other influential cyberpunk writers included Bruce Sterling and Rudy Rucker. The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s manga series &quot;Akira&quot;, with its 1988 anime film adaptation (also directed by Otomo) later popularizing the subgenre.

Early films in the genre include Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, one of several of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s works that have been adapted into films (in this case, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;). The &quot;first cyberpunk television series&quot; was the TV series &quot;Max Headroom&quot; from 1987, playing in a futuristic dystopia ruled by an oligarchy of television networks, and where computer hacking played a central role in many story lines. The films &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; (1995) and &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; (1998), both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically, while &quot;The Matrix&quot; trilogy (1999–2003) and &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; (1995) were some of the most successful cyberpunk films.

Newer cyberpunk media includes &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017), a sequel to the original 1982 film; &quot;Dredd&quot; (2012), which was not a sequel to the original movie; &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (2017), a live-action adaptation of the original manga; &quot;&quot; (2019), based on the 1990s Japanese manga &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;; the 2018 Netflix TV series &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;, based on Richard K. Morgan&#x27;s 2002 novel of the same name; and the video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; (2020) and original net animation (ONA) miniseries &quot;&quot; (2022), both based on R. Talsorian Games&#x27;s 1988 tabletop role-playing game &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;.

== Background ==
Lawrence Person has attempted to define the content and ethos of the cyberpunk literary movement stating:

Cyberpunk plots often involve conflict between artificial intelligence, hackers, and megacorporations, and tend to be set in a near-future Earth, rather than in the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; or Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;. The settings are usually post-industrial dystopias but tend to feature extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its original inventors (&quot;the street finds its own uses for things&quot;). Much of the genre&#x27;s atmosphere echoes film noir, and written works in the genre often use techniques from detective fiction. There are sources who view that cyberpunk has shifted from a literary movement to a mode of science fiction due to the limited number of writers and its transition to a more generalized cultural formation.

== History and origins ==
The origins of cyberpunk are rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, where &quot;New Worlds&quot;, under the editorship of Michael Moorcock, began inviting and encouraging stories that examined new writing styles, techniques, and archetypes. Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like Roger Zelazny, J. G. Ballard, Philip José Farmer, Samuel R. Delany, and Harlan Ellison often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the ongoing sexual revolution, drawing themes and influence from experimental literature of Beat Generation authors such as William S. Burroughs, and art movements like Dadaism.

Ballard, a notable critic of literary archetypes in science fiction, instead employs metaphysical and psychological concepts, seeking greater relevance to readers of the day. Ballard&#x27;s work is considered have had a profound influence on cyberpunk&#x27;s development, as evidenced by the term &quot;Ballardian&quot; becoming used to ascribe literary excellence amongst science fiction social circles. Ballard, along with Zelazny and others continued the popular development of &quot;realism&quot; within the genre.

Delany&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;Nova&quot;, considered a forerunner of cyberpunk literature, includes neural implants, a now popular cyberpunk trope for human computer interfaces. Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, first published in 1968, shares common dystopian themes with later works by Gibson and Sterling, and is praised for its &quot;realist&quot; exploration of cybernetic and artificial intelligence ideas and ethics.

=== Etymology ===
The term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; first appeared as the title of a short story by Bruce Bethke, written in 1980 and published in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1983. The name was picked up by Gardner Dozois, editor of &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;, and popularized in his editorials.

Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology. He described the idea thus:

Afterward, Dozois began using this term in his own writing, most notably in a 1984 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article where he said &quot;About the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic &#x27;school&#x27; would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been referred to as &#x27;cyberpunks&#x27; — Sterling, Gibson, Shiner, Cadigan, Bear.&quot;

Also in 1984, William Gibson&#x27;s novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot; was published, delivering a glimpse of a future encompassed by what became an archetype of cyberpunk &quot;virtual reality&quot;, with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. Some, perhaps ironically including Bethke himself, argued at the time that the writers whose style Gibson&#x27;s books epitomized should be called &quot;Neuromantics&quot;, a pun on the name of the novel plus &quot;New Romantics&quot;, a term used for a New Wave pop music movement that had just occurred in Britain, but this term did not catch on. Bethke later paraphrased Michael Swanwick&#x27;s argument for the term: &quot;the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they were doing was clearly imitating &quot;Neuromancer&quot;&quot;.

Sterling was another writer who played a central role, often consciously, in the cyberpunk genre, variously seen as either keeping it on track, or distorting its natural path into a stagnant formula. In 1986, he edited a volume of cyberpunk stories called &quot;&quot;, an attempt to establish what cyberpunk was, from Sterling&#x27;s perspective.

In the subsequent decade, the motifs of Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot; became formulaic, climaxing in the satirical extremes of Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Snow Crash&quot; in 1992.

Bookending the cyberpunk era, Bethke himself published a novel in 1995 called &quot;Headcrash&quot;, like &quot;Snow Crash&quot; a satirical attack on the genre&#x27;s excesses. Fittingly, it won an honor named after cyberpunk&#x27;s spiritual founder, the Philip K. Dick Award. It satirized the genre in this way:

== Style and ethos ==
Primary figures in the cyberpunk movement include William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Bruce Sterling, Bruce Bethke, Pat Cadigan, Rudy Rucker, and John Shirley. Philip K. Dick (author of &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, from which the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was adapted) is also seen by some as prefiguring the movement.

&quot;Blade Runner&quot; can be seen as a quintessential example of the cyberpunk style and theme. Video games, board games, and tabletop role-playing games, such as &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; and &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, often feature storylines that are heavily influenced by cyberpunk writing and movies. Beginning in the early 1990s, some trends in fashion and music were also labeled as cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is also featured prominently in anime and manga (Japanese cyberpunk), with &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; being among the most notable.

=== Setting ===


Cyberpunk writers tend to use elements from crime fiction—particularly hardboiled detective fiction and film noir—and postmodernist prose to describe an often nihilistic underground side of an electronic society. The genre&#x27;s vision of a troubled future is often called the antithesis of the generally utopian visions of the future popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Gibson defined cyberpunk&#x27;s antipathy towards utopian science fiction in his 1981 short story &quot;The Gernsback Continuum&quot;, which pokes fun at and, to a certain extent, condemns utopian science fiction.

In some cyberpunk writing, much of the action takes place online, in cyberspace, blurring the line between actual and virtual reality. A typical trope in such work is a direct connection between the human brain and computer systems. Cyberpunk settings are dystopias with corruption, computers, and computer networks.

The economic and technological state of Japan is a regular theme in the cyberpunk literature of the 1980s. Of Japan&#x27;s influence on the genre, William Gibson said, &quot;Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk.&quot; Cyberpunk is often set in urbanized, artificial landscapes, and &quot;city lights, receding&quot; was used by Gibson as one of the genre&#x27;s first metaphors for cyberspace and virtual reality.

The cityscapes of Hong Kong has had major influences in the urban backgrounds, ambiance and settings in many cyberpunk works such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Shadowrun&quot;. Ridley Scott envisioned the landscape of cyberpunk Los Angeles in &quot;Blade Runner&quot; to be &quot;Hong Kong on a very bad day&quot;. The streetscapes of the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; film were based on Hong Kong. Its director Mamoru Oshii felt that Hong Kong&#x27;s strange and chaotic streets where &quot;old and new exist in confusing relationships&quot; fit the theme of the film well. Hong Kong&#x27;s Kowloon Walled City is particularly notable for its disorganized hyper-urbanization and breakdown in traditional urban planning to be an inspiration to cyberpunk landscapes. During the British rule of Hong Kong, it was an area neglected by both the British and Qing administrations, embodying elements of liberalism in a dystopian context. Portrayals of East Asia and Asians in Western cyberpunk have been criticized as Orientalist and promoting racist tropes playing on American and European fears of East Asian dominance; this has been referred to as &quot;techno-Orientalism&quot;.

=== Society and government ===
Cyberpunk can be intended to disquiet readers and call them to action. It often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could describe it as a type of cultural revolution in science fiction. In the words of author and critic David Brin:

...a closer look [at cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic ...Popular science fiction tales by Gibson, Williams, Cadigan and others &quot;do&quot; depict Orwellian accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate elite.

Cyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the Internet. The earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the World Wide Web entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as Arthur C. Clarke and some social commentators such as James Burke began predicting that such networks would eventually form.

Some observers cite that cyberpunk tends to marginalize sectors of society such as women and people of colour. It is claimed that, for instance, cyberpunk depicts fantasies that ultimately empower masculinity using fragmentary and decentered aesthetic that culminate in a masculine genre populated by male outlaws. Critics also note the absence of any reference to Africa or black characters in the quintessential cyberpunk film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, while other films reinforce stereotypes.

== Media ==
=== Literature ===
Minnesota writer Bruce Bethke coined the term in 1983 for his short story &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;, which was published in an issue of &quot;Amazing Science Fiction Stories&quot;. The term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Pat Cadigan and others. Of these, Sterling became the movement&#x27;s chief ideologue, thanks to his fanzine &quot;Cheap Truth&quot;. John Shirley wrote articles on Sterling and Rucker&#x27;s significance. John Brunner&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;The Shockwave Rider&quot; is considered by many to be the first cyberpunk novel with many of the tropes commonly associated with the genre, some five years before the term was popularized by Dozois.

William Gibson with his novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot; (1984) is arguably the most famous writer connected with the term cyberpunk. He emphasized style, a fascination with surfaces, and atmosphere over traditional science-fiction tropes. Regarded as ground-breaking and sometimes as &quot;the archetypal cyberpunk work&quot;, &quot;Neuromancer&quot; was awarded the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick Awards. &quot;Count Zero&quot; (1986) and &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; (1988) followed after Gibson&#x27;s popular debut novel. According to the Jargon File, &quot;Gibson&#x27;s near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and tremendously stimulating.&quot;

Early on, cyberpunk was hailed as a radical departure from science-fiction standards and a new manifestation of vitality. Shortly thereafter, however, some critics arose to challenge its status as a revolutionary movement. These critics said that the science fiction New Wave of the 1960s was much more innovative as far as narrative techniques and styles were concerned. Furthermore, while &quot;Neuromancer&quot;″s narrator may have had an unusual &quot;voice&quot; for science fiction, much older examples can be found: Gibson&#x27;s narrative voice, for example, resembles that of an updated Raymond Chandler, as in his novel &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1939). Others noted that almost all traits claimed to be uniquely cyberpunk could in fact be found in older writers&#x27; works—often citing J. G. Ballard, Philip K. Dick, Harlan Ellison, Stanisław Lem, Samuel R. Delany, and even William S. Burroughs. For example, Philip K. Dick&#x27;s works contain recurring themes of social decay, artificial intelligence, paranoia, and blurred lines between objective and subjective realities. The influential cyberpunk movie &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) is based on his book, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;. Humans linked to machines are found in Pohl and Kornbluth&#x27;s &quot;Wolfbane&quot; (1959) and Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;Creatures of Light and Darkness&quot; (1968).

In 1994, scholar Brian Stonehill suggested that Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; &quot;not only curses but precurses what we now glibly dub cyberspace.&quot; Other important predecessors include Alfred Bester&#x27;s two most celebrated novels, &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; and &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot;, as well as Vernor Vinge&#x27;s novella &quot;True Names&quot;.

==== Reception and impact ====
Science-fiction writer David Brin describes cyberpunk as &quot;the finest free promotion campaign ever waged on behalf of science fiction&quot;. It may not have attracted the &quot;real punks&quot;, but it did ensnare many new readers, and it provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary critics found alluring. Cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive to academics, argues Brin; in addition, it made science fiction more profitable to Hollywood and to the visual arts generally. Although the &quot;self-important rhetoric and whines of persecution&quot; on the part of cyberpunk fans were irritating at worst and humorous at best, Brin declares that the &quot;rebels did shake things up. We owe them a debt.&quot;

Fredric Jameson considers cyberpunk the &quot;supreme literary expression if not of postmodernism, then of late capitalism itself&quot;.

Cyberpunk further inspired many later writers to incorporate cyberpunk ideas into their own works, such as George Alec Effinger&#x27;s &quot;When Gravity Fails&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, created by Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe, mixes new technology, art, literature, and current topics in order to interest today&#x27;s cyberpunk fans, which Paula Yoo claims &quot;proves that hardcore hackers, multimedia junkies, cyberpunks and cellular freaks are poised to take over the world&quot;.

=== Film and television ===
The film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) is set in 2019 in a dystopian future in which manufactured beings called replicants are slaves used on space colonies and are legal prey on Earth to various bounty hunters who &quot;retire&quot; (kill) them. Although &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was largely unsuccessful in its first theatrical release, it found a viewership in the home video market and became a cult film. Since the movie omits the religious and mythical elements of Dick&#x27;s original novel (e.g. empathy boxes and Wilbur Mercer), it falls more strictly within the cyberpunk genre than the novel does. William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision for &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, a book he was then working on. The film&#x27;s tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as &quot;The Matrix trilogy&quot; (1999–2003), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements. A sequel to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was released in 2017.

The TV series &quot;Max Headroom&quot; (1987) is an iconic cyberpunk work, taking place in a futuristic dystopia ruled by an oligarchy of television networks. Computer hacking played a central role in many of the story lines. &quot;Max Headroom&quot; has been called &quot;the first cyberpunk television series&quot;.

The number of films in the genre has grown steadily since &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Several of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s works have been adapted to the silver screen. The films &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; (1995) and &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; (1998), both based on short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically. Other cyberpunk films include &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987), &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990), &quot;Hardware&quot; (1990), &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot; (1992), &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), &quot;Hackers&quot; (1995), and &quot;Strange Days&quot; (1995). Some cyberpunk films have been described as tech-noir, a hybrid genre combining neo-noir and science fiction or cyberpunk.

=== Anime and manga ===

The Japanese cyberpunk subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s manga series &quot;Akira&quot;, with its 1988 anime film adaptation, which Otomo directed, later popularizing the subgenre. &quot;Akira&quot; inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and anime series such as &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;, and &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. Other early Japanese cyberpunk works include the 1982 film &quot;Burst City&quot;, and the 1989 film &quot;&quot;.

According to Paul Gravett, when &quot;Akira&quot; began to be published, cyberpunk literature had not yet been translated into Japanese, Otomo has distinct inspirations such as Mitsuteru Yokoyama&#x27;s manga series &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot; (1956–1966) and Moebius.

In contrast to Western cyberpunk which has roots in New Wave science fiction literature, Japanese cyberpunk has roots in underground music culture, specifically the Japanese punk subculture that arose from the Japanese punk music scene in the 1970s. The filmmaker Sogo Ishii introduced this subculture to Japanese cinema with the punk film &quot;Panic High School&quot; (1978) and the punk biker film &quot;Crazy Thunder Road&quot; (1980), both portraying the rebellion and anarchy associated with punk, and the latter featuring a punk biker gang aesthetic. Ishii&#x27;s punk films paved the way for Otomo&#x27;s seminal cyberpunk work &quot;Akira&quot;.

Cyberpunk themes are widely visible in anime and manga. In Japan, where cosplay is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in Chiba, one of Japan&#x27;s largest industrial areas, although at the time of writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.

Cyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with Western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. &quot;The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk often incorporates many Japanese elements.&quot; William Gibson is now a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of Japan have become a reality:

Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk. The Japanese themselves knew it and delighted in it. I remember my first glimpse of Shibuya, when one of the young Tokyo journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering, animated crawl of commercial information—said, &quot;You see? You see? It is &quot;Blade Runner&quot; town.&quot; And it was. It so evidently was.

==== Influence ====
&quot;Akira&quot; (1982 manga) and its 1988 anime film adaptation have influenced numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games. &quot;Akira&quot; has been cited as a major influence on Hollywood films such as &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Looper&quot;, &quot;Midnight Special&quot;, and &quot;Inception&quot;, as well as cyberpunk-influenced video games such as Hideo Kojima&#x27;s &quot;Snatcher&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, Valve&#x27;s &quot;Half-Life&quot; series and Dontnod Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Remember Me&quot;. &quot;Akira&quot; has also influenced the work of musicians such as Kanye West, who paid homage to &quot;Akira&quot; in the &quot;Stronger&quot; music video, and Lupe Fiasco, whose album &quot;Tetsuo &amp; Youth&quot; is named after Tetsuo Shima. The popular bike from the film, Kaneda&#x27;s Motorbike, appears in &quot;Steven Spielberg&quot;&#x27;s film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;, and CD Projekt&#x27;s video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;.

&quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (1995) influenced a number of prominent filmmakers, most notably the Wachowskis in &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) and its sequels. &quot;The Matrix&quot; series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain, which was inspired by the opening credits of &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; and a sushi magazine the wife of the senior designer of the animation, Simon Witheley, had in the kitchen at the time, and the way characters access the Matrix through holes in the back of their necks. Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot;, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, and Jonathan Mostow&#x27;s &quot;Surrogates&quot;. James Cameron cited &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; as a source of inspiration, citing it as an influence on &quot;Avatar&quot;.

The original video animation &quot;Megazone 23&quot; (1985) has a number of similarities to &quot;The Matrix&quot;. &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; (1990) has had a notable influence on filmmaker James Cameron, who was planning to adapt it into a film since 2000. It was an influence on his TV series &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, and he is the producer of the 2019 film adaptation &quot;&quot;.

=== Comics ===
In 1975, artist Moebius collaborated with writer Dan O&#x27;Bannon on a story called &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot;, published in the French magazine &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;. One of the first works featuring elements now seen as exemplifying cyberpunk, it combined influences from film noir and hardboiled crime fiction with a distant sci-fi environment. Author William Gibson stated that Moebius&#x27; artwork for the series, along with other visuals from &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, strongly influenced his 1984 novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. The series had a far-reaching impact in the cyberpunk genre, being cited as an influence on Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Moebius later expanded upon &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot;&#x27;s aesthetic with &quot;The Incal&quot;, a graphic novel collaboration with Alejandro Jodorowsky published from 1980 to 1988. The story centers around the exploits of a detective named John Difool in various science fiction settings, and while not confined to the tropes of cyberpunk, it features many elements of the genre. Moebius was one of the designers of &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), a movie that shows a world inside a computer.

Concurrently with many other foundational cyberpunk works, DC Comics published Frank Miller&#x27;s six-issue miniseries &quot;Rōnin&quot; from 1983 to 1984. The series, incorporating aspects of Samurai culture, martial arts films and manga, is set in a dystopian near-future New York. It explores the link between an ancient Japanese warrior and the apocalyptic, crumbling cityscape he finds himself in. The comic also bears several similarities to &quot;Akira&quot;, with highly powerful telepaths playing central roles, as well as sharing many key visuals.

&quot;Rōnin&quot; would go on to influence many later works, including &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; and the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, as well as video games such as &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;. Two years later, Miller himself would incorporate several toned-down elements of &quot;Rōnin&quot; into his acclaimed 1986 miniseries &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, in which a retired Bruce Wayne once again takes up the mantle of Batman in a Gotham that is increasingly becoming more dystopian.

Paul Pope&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, published in 2006, also exhibits several traits typical of cyberpunk fiction, such as a rebel protagonist opposing a future authoritarian state, and a distinct retrofuturist aesthetic that makes callbacks to both &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and Batman&#x27;s original appearances in the 1940s.

=== Video games ===
There are many cyberpunk video games. Popular series include the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series, Kojima&#x27;s &quot;Snatcher&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, &quot;Deus Ex&quot; series, &quot;Syndicate&quot; series, and &quot;System Shock&quot; and its sequel. Other games, like &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, and the &quot;Matrix&quot; series, are based upon genre movies, or role-playing games (for instance the various &quot;Shadowrun&quot; games).

Several RPGs called &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; exist: &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;, &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;, &quot;Cyberpunk v3.0&quot; and &quot;Cyberpunk Red&quot; written by Mike Pondsmith and published by R. Talsorian Games, and &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot;, published by Steve Jackson Games as a module of the GURPS family of RPGs. &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; was designed with the settings of William Gibson&#x27;s writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval, unlike the approach taken by FASA in producing the transgenre &quot;Shadowrun&quot; game and its various sequels, which mixes cyberpunk with fantasy elements such as magic and fantasy races such as orcs and elves. Both are set in the near future, in a world where cybernetics are prominent. In addition, Iron Crown Enterprises released an RPG named &quot;Cyberspace&quot;, which was out of print for several years until recently being re-released in online PDF form. CD Projekt Red released &quot;Cyberpunk 2077,&quot; a cyberpunk open world first-person shooter/role-playing video game (RPG) based on the tabletop RPG &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;, on December 10, 2020. In 1990, in a convergence of cyberpunk art and reality, the United States Secret Service raided Steve Jackson Games&#x27;s headquarters and confiscated all their computers. Officials denied that the target had been the &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; sourcebook, but Jackson would later write that he and his colleagues &quot;were never able to secure the return of the complete manuscript; [...] The Secret Service at first flatly refused to return anything – then agreed to let us copy files, but when we got to their office, restricted us to one set of out-of-date files – then agreed to make copies for us, but said &quot;tomorrow&quot; every day from March 4 to March 26. On March 26 we received a set of disks which purported to be our files, but the material was late, incomplete and well-nigh useless.&quot; Steve Jackson Games won a lawsuit against the Secret Service, aided by the new Electronic Frontier Foundation. This event has achieved a sort of notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. All published editions of &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; have a tagline on the front cover, which reads &quot;The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service!&quot; Inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath.

Cyberpunk has also inspired several tabletop, miniature and board games such as &quot;Necromunda&quot; by Games Workshop. &quot;Netrunner&quot; is a collectible card game introduced in 1996, based on the &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; role-playing game. &quot;Tokyo NOVA&quot;, debuting in 1993, is a cyberpunk role-playing game that uses playing cards instead of dice.

&quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; set a new record for the largest number of simultaneous players in a single player game, with a record 1,054,388 playing just after the December 10th launch, according to Steam Database. That tops the previous Steam record of 472,962 players set by &quot;Fallout 4&quot; back in 2015.

=== Music ===

Invariably the origin of cyberpunk music lies in the synthesizer-heavy scores of cyberpunk films such as &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981) and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982). Some musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include Psydoll, Front Line Assembly, Clock DVA, Angelspit and Sigue Sigue Sputnik.

Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as the British musician and songwriter Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Replicas&quot;, &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; and &quot;Telekon&quot; were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; and &quot;Computer World&quot; albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. Nine Inch Nails&#x27; concept album &quot;Year Zero&quot; also fits into this category. Fear Factory concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. Billy Idol&#x27;s &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the cyberdelic counter culture in its creation. &quot;1. Outside&quot;, a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by David Bowie, was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including Sonic Youth, whose albums &quot;Sister&quot; and &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. Madonna&#x27;s 2001 Drowned World Tour opened with a cyberpunk section, where costumes, asethetics and stage props were used to accentuate the dystopian nature of the theatrical concert. Lady Gaga used a cyberpunk-persona and visual style for her sixth studio album Chromatica (2020).

Vaporwave and synthwave are also influenced by cyberpunk. The former has been inspired by one of the messages of cyberpunk and is interpreted as a dystopian critique of capitalism in the vein of cyberpunk and the latter is more surface-level, inspired only by the aesthetic of cyberpunk as a nostalgic retrofuturistic revival of aspects of cyberpunk&#x27;s origins.

== Social impact ==
=== Art and architecture ===
Writers David Suzuki and Holly Dressel describe the cafes, brand-name stores and video arcades of the Sony Center in the Potsdamer Platz public square of Berlin, Germany, as &quot;a vision of a cyberpunk, corporate urban future&quot;.

=== Society and counterculture ===
Several subcultures have been inspired by cyberpunk fiction. These include the cyberdelic counter culture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as &quot;cyberpunks&quot;, attempted to blend the psychedelic art and drug movement with the technology of cyberculture. Early adherents included Timothy Leary, Mark Frauenfelder and R. U. Sirius. The movement largely faded following the dot-com bubble implosion of 2000.

Cybergoth is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as rave and Gothic subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years which rejects the raver and goth influences of cybergoth, and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, &quot;post apocalypse&quot;, functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction. This fashion goes by names like &quot;tech wear&quot;, &quot;goth ninja&quot; or &quot;tech ninja&quot;.

The Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong (demolished in 1994) is often referenced as the model cyberpunk/dystopian slum as, given its poor living conditions at the time coupled with the city&#x27;s political, physical, and economic isolation has caused many in academia to be fascinated by the ingenuity of its spawning.

=== Cyberpunk derivatives ===
As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, some of which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is &quot;steampunk,&quot; which is set in an alternate history Victorian era that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk&#x27;s bleak film noir world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of Tim Powers, James P. Blaylock, and K.W. Jeter, but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their collaborative novel &quot;The Difference Engine&quot; the term was being used earnestly as well.

Another subgenre is &quot;biopunk&quot; (cyberpunk themes dominated by biotechnology) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by genetic manipulation.

== Registered trademark status ==
In the United States, the term &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; is a registered trademark owned by CD Projekt SA who obtained it from the previous owner R. Talsorian Games Inc. who originally registered it for its tabletop role-playing game. R. Talsorian Games currently used the trademark under license from CD Projekt SA for the tabletop role-playing game.

Within the European Union, the &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; trademark is owned by two parties: CD Projekt SA for &quot;games and online gaming services&quot; (particularly for the video game adaptation of the former) and by Sony Music for use outside games.

<text>A comic strip is a sequence of cartoons, arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th and into the 21st century, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with daily horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in newspapers, while Sunday papers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the advent of the internet, online comic strips began to appear as webcomics.

Most strips are written and drawn by a comics artist, known as a cartoonist. As the word &quot;comic&quot; implies, strips are frequently humorous. Examples of these gag-a-day strips are &quot;Blondie&quot;, &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, &quot;Marmaduke&quot;, and &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;. In the late 1920s, comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories, as seen in &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Captain Easy&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, &quot;Tarzan&quot;, and &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;. In the 1940s, soap-opera-continuity strips such as &quot;Judge Parker&quot; and &quot;Mary Worth&quot; gained popularity. Because &quot;comic&quot; strips are not always funny, cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that sequential art would be a better genre-neutral name.

Comic strips have appeared inside American magazines such as &quot;Liberty&quot; and &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, but also on the front covers, such as the &quot;Flossy Frills&quot; series on &quot;The American Weekly&quot; Sunday newspaper supplement. In the UK and the rest of Europe, comic strips are also serialized in &quot;comic book magazines&quot;, with a strip&#x27;s story sometimes continuing over three pages.

==History==
Storytelling using a sequence of pictures has existed through history. One medieval European example in textile form is the Bayeux Tapestry. Printed examples emerged in 19th-century Germany and in mid 18th-century England, where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced. William Hogarth&#x27;s 18th-century English caricature include both narrative sequences, such as &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, and single panels.

The &quot;Biblia pauperum&quot; (&quot;Paupers&#x27; Bible&quot;), a tradition of picture Bibles beginning in the Late Middle Ages, sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the miniatures written on scrolls coming out of their mouths—which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips.

In China, with its traditions of block printing and of the incorporation of text with image, experiments with what became &quot;lianhuanhua&quot; date back to 1884.

The origin of the modern English language comic strip can be traced to the efflorescence of caricature in late 18th century London. English caricaturists such as Richard Newton and George Woodward developed sophisticated caricature styles using strips of expressive comic figures with captions that could be read left to right to cumulative effect, as well as business models for advertising and selling cheap comic illustration on regular subscription.

Other leading British caricaturists produced strips as well; for example James Gillray in &quot;Democracy;-or-a Sketch of the Life of Buonaparte&quot;. His contemporary Thomas Rowlandson used strips as early as 1784 for example in &quot;The Loves of the Fox and the Badger&quot;. Rowlandson may also be credited with inventing the first internationally recognized comic strip character: &quot;Doctor Syntax&quot; whose picaresque journeys through England were told through a series of comic etchings, accompanied by verse. Original published in parts between 1809 and 1811 in Rudolf Ackermann&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Magazine&quot;, in book form &quot;The Tour of Doctor Syntax in search of the picturesque&quot; ran to 9 editions between 1812 and 1819, spun off two sequels, a prequel, numerous pirate imitations and copies including French, German, Danish and translations. His image was available on pottery, textiles wallpaper and other merchandise.

The Caricature Magazine or Hudibrastic Mirror, an influential English comic series published in London between 1807 and 1819 by Thomas Tegg included some satirical stories in comic strip format such as &quot;The Adventures of Johnny Newcome&quot;. 
==Newspapers==
The first newspaper comic strips appeared in North America in the late 19th century. &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot; is usually credited as one of the first newspaper strips. However, the art form combining words and pictures developed gradually and there are many examples which led up to the comic strip.

The Glasgow Looking Glass was the first mass-produced publication to tell stories using illustrations and is regarded as the world&#x27;s first comic strip. It satirised the political and social life of Scotland in the 1820s. It was conceived and illustrated by William Heath.

Swiss author and caricature artist Rodolphe Töpffer (Geneva, 1799–1846) is considered the father of the modern comic strips. His illustrated stories such as &quot;Histoire de Mr. Vieux Bois&quot; (1827), first published in the US in 1842 as &quot;The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck&quot; or &quot;Histoire de Monsieur Jabot&quot; (1831), inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists. In 1865, German painter, author, and caricaturist Wilhelm Busch created the strip &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;, about two trouble-making boys, which had a direct influence on the American comic strip. &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; was a series of seven severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children&#x27;s stories such as &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot; (&quot;Shockheaded Peter&quot;). In the story&#x27;s final act, the boys, after perpetrating some mischief, are tossed into a sack of grain, run through a mill, and consumed by a flock of geese (without anybody mourning their demise). &quot;Max and Moritz&quot; provided an inspiration for German immigrant Rudolph Dirks, who created the &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot; in 1897—a strip starring two German-American boys visually modelled on &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;. Familiar comic-strip iconography such as stars for pain, sawing logs for snoring, speech balloons, and thought balloons originated in Dirks&#x27; strip.

Hugely popular, &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot; occasioned one of the first comic-strip copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium. When Dirks left William Randolph Hearst for the promise of a better salary under Joseph Pulitzer, it was an unusual move, since cartoonists regularly deserted Pulitzer for Hearst. In a highly unusual court decision, Hearst retained the rights to the name &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, while creator Dirks retained the rights to the characters. Hearst promptly hired Harold Knerr to draw his own version of the strip. Dirks renamed his version &quot;Hans and Fritz&quot; (later, &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot;). Thus, two versions distributed by rival syndicates graced the comics pages for decades. Dirks&#x27; version, eventually distributed by United Feature Syndicate, ran until 1979.

In the United States, the great popularity of comics sprang from the newspaper war (1887 onwards) between Pulitzer and Hearst. &quot;The Little Bears&quot; (1893–96) was the first American comic strip with recurring characters, while the first color comic supplement was published by the &quot;Chicago Inter-Ocean&quot; sometime in the latter half of 1892, followed by the &quot;New York Journal&quot;″s first color Sunday comic pages in 1897. On January 31, 1912, Hearst introduced the nation&#x27;s first full daily comic page in his &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot;. The history of this newspaper rivalry and the rapid appearance of comic strips in most major American newspapers is discussed by Ian Gordon. Numerous events in newspaper comic strips have reverberated throughout society at large, though few of these events occurred in recent years, owing mainly to the declining use of continuous storylines on newspaper comic strips, which since the 1970s had been waning as an entertainment form. From 1903 to 1905 Gustave Verbeek, wrote his comic series &quot;The UpsideDowns of Old Man Muffaroo and Little Lady Lovekins&quot;. These comics were made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. He made 64 such comics in total.

The longest-running American comic strips are:
# &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; (1897–2006; 109 years)
# &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; (1918–present)
# &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; (1918–present)
# &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot; (1919–present)
# &quot;Thimble Theater/Popeye&quot; (1919–present)
# &quot;Blondie&quot; (1930–present)
# &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1931–present)
# &quot;Alley Oop&quot; (1932–present)
# &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; (1913–2000; 87 years)
# &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; (1924–2010; 86 years)

Most newspaper comic strips are syndicated; a syndicate hires people to write and draw a strip and then distributes it to many newspapers for a fee. Some newspaper strips begin or remain exclusive to one newspaper. For example, the &quot;Pogo&quot; comic strip by Walt Kelly originally appeared only in the &quot;New York Star&quot; in 1948 and was not picked up for syndication until the following year.

Newspaper comic strips come in two different types: daily strips and Sunday strips. In the United States, a daily strip appears in newspapers on weekdays, Monday through Saturday, as contrasted with a Sunday strip, which typically only appears on Sundays. Daily strips usually are printed in black and white, and Sunday strips are usually in color. However, a few newspapers have published daily strips in color, and some newspapers have published Sunday strips in black and white.

== Popularity ==

Making his first appearance in the British magazine &quot;Judy&quot; by writer and fledgling artist Charles H. Ross in 1867, Ally Sloper is one of the earliest comic strip characters and he is regarded as the first recurring character in comics. The highly popular character was spun off into his own comic, &quot;Ally Sloper&#x27;s Half Holiday&quot;, in 1884.

While in the early 20th century comic strips were a frequent target for detractors of &quot;yellow journalism&quot;, by the 1920s the medium became wildly popular. While radio, and later, television surpassed newspapers as a means of entertainment, most comic strip characters were widely recognizable until the 1980s, and the &quot;funny pages&quot; were often arranged in a way they appeared at the front of Sunday editions. In 1931, George Gallup&#x27;s first poll had the comic section as the most important part of the newspaper, with additional surveys pointing out that the comic strips were the second most popular feature after the picture page. During the 1930s, many comic sections had between 12 and 16 pages, although in some cases, these had up to 24 pages.

The popularity and accessibility of strips meant they were often clipped and saved; authors including John Updike and Ray Bradbury have written about their childhood collections of clipped strips. Often posted on bulletin boards, clipped strips had an ancillary form of distribution when they were faxed, photocopied or mailed. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;″s Linda White recalled, &quot;I followed the adventures of &quot;Winnie Winkle&quot;, &quot;Moon Mullins&quot; and &quot;Dondi&quot;, and waited each fall to see how Lucy would manage to trick Charlie Brown into trying to kick that football. (After I left for college, my father would clip out that strip each year and send it to me just to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss it.)&quot;

== Production and format ==
The two conventional formats for newspaper comics are strips and single gag panels. The strips are usually displayed horizontally, wider than they are tall. Single panels are square, circular or taller than they are wide. Strips usually, but not always, are broken up into several smaller panels with continuity from panel to panel. A horizontal strip can also be used for a single panel with a single gag, as seen occasionally in Mike Peters&#x27; &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot;.

Early daily strips were large, often running the entire width of the newspaper, and were sometimes three or more inches high. Initially, a newspaper page included only a single daily strip, usually either at the top or the bottom of the page. By the 1920s, many newspapers had a comics page on which many strips were collected together. During the 1930s, the original art for a daily strip could be drawn as large as 25 inches wide by six inches high. Over decades, the daily strips became smaller and smaller, until by 2000, four standard daily strips could fit in an area once occupied by a single daily strip. As strips have become smaller, the number of panels have been reduced.

Proof sheets were the means by which syndicates provided newspapers with black-and-white line art for the reproduction of strips (which they arranged to have colored in the case of Sunday strips). Michigan State University Comic Art Collection librarian Randy Scott describes these as &quot;large sheets of paper on which newspaper comics have traditionally been distributed to subscribing newspapers. Typically each sheet will have either six daily strips of a given title or one Sunday strip. Thus, a week of &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; would arrive at the &quot;Lansing State Journal&quot; in two sheets, printed much larger than the final version and ready to be cut apart and fitted into the local comics page.&quot; Comic strip historian Allan Holtz described how strips were provided as mats (the plastic or cardboard trays in which molten metal is poured to make plates) or even plates ready to be put directly on the printing press. He also notes that with electronic means of distribution becoming more prevalent printed sheets &quot;are definitely on their way out.&quot;

NEA Syndicate experimented briefly with a two-tier daily strip, &quot;Star Hawks&quot;, but after a few years, &quot;Star Hawks&quot; dropped down to a single tier.

In Flanders, the two-tier strip is the standard publication style of most daily strips like &quot;Spike and Suzy&quot; and &quot;Nero&quot;. They appear Monday through Saturday; until 2003 there were no Sunday papers in Flanders. In the last decades, they have switched from black and white to color.

===Cartoon panels===
Single panels usually, but not always, are not broken up and lack continuity. The daily &quot;Peanuts&quot; is a strip, and the daily &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; is a single panel. J. R. Williams&#x27; long-run &quot;Out Our Way&quot; continued as a daily panel even after it expanded into a Sunday strip, &quot;Out Our Way with the Willets&quot;. Jimmy Hatlo&#x27;s &quot;They&#x27;ll Do It Every Time&quot; was often displayed in a two-panel format with the first panel showing some deceptive, pretentious, unwitting or scheming human behavior and the second panel revealing the truth of the situation.

==Sunday comics==

Sunday newspapers traditionally included a special color section. Early Sunday strips (known colloquially as &quot;the funny papers&quot;, shortened to &quot;the funnies&quot;), such as &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; and &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, filled an entire newspaper page, a format known to collectors as full page. Sunday pages during the 1930s and into the 1940s often carried a secondary strip by the same artist as the main strip. No matter whether it appeared above or below a main strip, the extra strip was known as the topper, such as &quot;The Squirrel Cage&quot; which ran along with &quot;Room and Board&quot;, both drawn by Gene Ahern.

During the 1930s, the original art for a Sunday strip was usually drawn quite large. For example, in 1930, Russ Westover drew his &quot;Tillie the Toiler&quot; Sunday page at a size of 17&quot; × 37&quot;. In 1937, the cartoonist Dudley Fisher launched the innovative &quot;Right Around Home&quot;, drawn as a huge single panel filling an entire Sunday page.

Full-page strips were eventually replaced by strips half that size. Strips such as &quot;The Phantom&quot; and &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; began appearing in a format of two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, such as the &quot;New Orleans Times Picayune&quot;, or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. When Sunday strips began to appear in more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged, cropped or dropped panels. During World War II, because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday strips began to shrink. After the war, strips continued to get smaller and smaller because of increased paper and printing costs. The last full-page comic strip was the &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; strip for 11 April 1971.

Comic strips have also been published in Sunday newspaper magazines. Russell Patterson and Carolyn Wells&#x27; &quot;New Adventures of Flossy Frills&quot; was a continuing strip series seen on Sunday magazine covers. Beginning January 26, 1941, it ran on the front covers of Hearst&#x27;s &quot;American Weekly&quot; newspaper magazine supplement, continuing until March 30 of that year. Between 1939 and 1943, four different stories featuring Flossy appeared on &quot;American Weekly&quot; covers.

Sunday comics sections employed offset color printing with multiple print runs imitating a wide range of colors. Printing plates were created with four or more colors—traditionally, the CMYK color model: cyan, magenta, yellow and &quot;K&quot; for black. With a screen of tiny dots on each printing plate, the dots allowed an image to be printed in a halftone that appears to the eye in different gradations. The semi-opaque property of ink allows halftone dots of different colors to create an optical effect of full-color imagery.

==Underground comic strips==
The decade of the 1960s saw the rise of underground newspapers, which often carried comic strips, such as &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; and &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot;. &quot;Zippy the Pinhead&quot; initially appeared in underground publications in the 1970s before being syndicated. &quot;Bloom County&quot; and &quot;Doonesbury&quot; began as strips in college newspapers under different titles, and later moved to national syndication. Underground comic strips covered subjects that are usually taboo in newspaper strips, such as sex and drugs. Many underground artists, notably Vaughn Bode, Dan O&#x27;Neill, Gilbert Shelton, and Art Spiegelman went on to draw comic strips for magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, and Pete Millar&#x27;s &quot;CARtoons&quot;. Jay Lynch graduated from undergrounds to alternative weekly newspapers to &quot;Mad&quot; and children&#x27;s books.

==Webcomics==

&quot;Webcomics&quot;, also known as &quot;online comics&quot; and &quot;internet comics&quot;, are comics that are available to read on the Internet. Many are exclusively published online, but the majority of traditional newspaper comic strips have some Internet presence. King Features Syndicate and other syndicates often provide archives of recent strips on their websites. Some, such as Scott Adams, creator of &quot;Dilbert&quot;, include an email address in each strip.

==Conventions and genres==

Most comic strip characters do not age throughout the strip&#x27;s life, but in some strips, like Lynn Johnston&#x27;s award-winning &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;, the characters age as the years pass. The first strip to feature aging characters was &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;.

The history of comic strips also includes series that are not humorous, but tell an ongoing dramatic story. Examples include &quot;The Phantom&quot;, &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Mary Worth&quot;, &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, and &quot;Tarzan&quot;. Sometimes these are spin-offs from comic books, for example &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;.

A number of strips have featured animals as main characters. Some are non-verbal (&quot;Marmaduke&quot;, &quot;The Angriest Dog in the World&quot;), some have verbal thoughts but are not understood by humans, (&quot;Garfield&quot;, Snoopy in &quot;Peanuts&quot;), and some can converse with humans (&quot;Bloom County&quot;, &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, &quot;Mutts&quot;, &quot;Citizen Dog&quot;, &quot;Buckles&quot;, &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot;, &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;, and &quot;Pooch Cafe&quot;). Other strips are centered entirely on animals, as in &quot;Pogo&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck&quot;. Gary Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Far Side&quot; was unusual, as there were no central characters. Instead &quot;The Far Side&quot; used a wide variety of characters including humans, monsters, aliens, chickens, cows, worms, amoebas, and more. John McPherson&#x27;s &quot;Close to Home&quot; also uses this theme, though the characters are mostly restricted to humans and real-life situations. Wiley Miller not only mixes human, animal, and fantasy characters, but also does several different comic strip continuities under one umbrella title, &quot;Non Sequitur&quot;. Bob Thaves&#x27;s &quot;Frank &amp; Ernest&quot; began in 1972 and paved the way for some of these strips, as its human characters were manifest in diverse forms—as animals, vegetables, and minerals.

==Social and political influence==

The comics have long held a distorted mirror to contemporary society, and almost from the beginning have been used for political or social commentary. This ranged from the conservative slant of Harold Gray&#x27;s &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; to the unabashed liberalism of Garry Trudeau&#x27;s &quot;Doonesbury&quot;. Al Capp&#x27;s &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; espoused liberal opinions for most of its run, but by the late 1960s, it became a mouthpiece for Capp&#x27;s repudiation of the counterculture.

&quot;Pogo&quot; used animals to particularly devastating effect, caricaturing many prominent politicians of the day as animal denizens of Pogo&#x27;s Okeefenokee Swamp. In a fearless move, Pogo&#x27;s creator Walt Kelly took on Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s, caricaturing him as a bobcat named Simple J. Malarkey, a megalomaniac who was bent on taking over the characters&#x27; birdwatching club and rooting out all undesirables. Kelly also defended the medium against possible government regulation in the McCarthy era. At a time when comic books were coming under fire for supposed sexual, violent, and subversive content, Kelly feared the same would happen to comic strips. Going before the Congressional subcommittee, he proceeded to charm the members with his drawings and the force of his personality. The comic strip was safe for satire.

During the early 20th century, comic strips were widely associated with publisher William Randolph Hearst, whose papers had the largest circulation of strips in the United States. Hearst was notorious for his practice of yellow journalism, and he was frowned on by readers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other newspapers which featured few or no comic strips. Hearst&#x27;s critics often assumed that all the strips in his papers were fronts for his own political and social views. Hearst did occasionally work with or pitch ideas to cartoonists, most notably his continued support of George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;. An inspiration for Bill Watterson and other cartoonists, &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; gained a considerable following among intellectuals during the 1920s and 1930s.

Some comic strips, such as &quot;Doonesbury&quot; and &quot;Mallard Fillmore&quot;, may be printed on the editorial or op-ed page rather than the comics page because of their regular political commentary. For example, the August 12, 1974 &quot;Doonesbury&quot; strip was awarded a 1975 Pulitzer Prize for its depiction of the Watergate scandal. &quot;Dilbert&quot; is sometimes found in the business section of a newspaper instead of the comics page because of the strip&#x27;s commentary about office politics, and &quot;Tank McNamara&quot; often appears on the sports page because of its subject matter. Lynn Johnston&#x27;s &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; created an uproar when Lawrence, one of the strip&#x27;s supporting characters, came out of the closet.

==Publicity and recognition==
The world&#x27;s longest comic strip is long and on display at Trafalgar Square as part of the London Comedy Festival. The London Cartoon Strip was created by 15 of Britain&#x27;s best known cartoonists and depicts the history of London.

The Reuben, named for cartoonist Rube Goldberg, is the most prestigious award for U.S. comic strip artists. Reuben awards are presented annually by the National Cartoonists Society (NCS).

In 1995, the United States Postal Service issued a series of commemorative stamps, Comic Strip Classics, marking the comic-strip centennial.

Today&#x27;s strip artists, with the help of the NCS, enthusiastically promote the medium, which since the 1970s (and particularly the 1990s) has been considered to be in decline due to numerous factors such as changing tastes in humor and entertainment, the waning relevance of newspapers in general and the loss of most foreign markets outside English-speaking countries. One particularly humorous example of such promotional efforts is the Great Comic Strip Switcheroonie, held in 1997 on April Fool&#x27;s Day, an event in which dozens of prominent artists took over each other&#x27;s strips. &quot;Garfield&quot;″s Jim Davis, for example, switched with &quot;Blondie&quot;″s Stan Drake, while Scott Adams (&quot;Dilbert&quot;) traded strips with Bil Keane (&quot;The Family Circus&quot;).

While the 1997 Switcheroonie was a one-time publicity stunt, an artist taking over a feature from its originator is an old tradition in newspaper cartooning (as it is in the comic book industry). In fact, the practice has made possible the longevity of the genre&#x27;s more popular strips. Examples include &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; (drawn and plotted by Harold Gray from 1924 to 1944 and thereafter by a succession of artists including Leonard Starr and Andrew Pepoy), and &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;, started by Milton Caniff in 1934 and picked up by George Wunder.

A business-driven variation has sometimes led to the same feature continuing under a different name. In one case, in the early 1940s, Don Flowers&#x27; &quot;Modest Maidens&quot; was so admired by William Randolph Hearst that he lured Flowers away from the Associated Press and to King Features Syndicate by doubling the cartoonist&#x27;s salary, and renamed the feature &quot;Glamor Girls&quot; to avoid legal action by the AP. The latter continued to publish &quot;Modest Maidens&quot;, drawn by Jay Allen in Flowers&#x27; style.

==Issues in U.S. newspaper comic strips==
As newspapers have declined, the changes have affected comic strips. Jeff Reece, lifestyle editor of &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot;, wrote, &quot;Comics are sort of the &#x27;third rail&#x27; of the newspaper.&quot;

===Size===

In the early decades of the 20th century, all Sunday comics received a full page, and daily strips were generally the width of the page. The competition between papers for having more cartoons than the rest from the mid-1920s, the growth of large-scale newspaper advertising during most of the thirties, paper rationing during World War II, the decline on news readership (as television newscasts began to be more common) and inflation (which has caused higher printing costs) beginning during the fifties and sixties led to Sunday strips being published on smaller and more diverse formats. As newspapers have reduced the page count of Sunday comic sections since the late 1990s (by the 2010s, most sections have only four pages, with the back page not always being destined for comics) has also led to further downsizes.

Daily strips have suffered as well. Before the mid-1910s, there was not a &quot;standard&quot; size&quot;, with strips running the entire width of a page or having more than one tier. By the 1920s, strips often covered six of the eight columns occupied by a traditional broadsheet paper. During the 1940s, strips were reduced to four columns wide (with a &quot;transition&quot; width of five columns). As newspapers became narrower beginning in the 1970s, strips have gotten even smaller, often being just three columns wide, a similar width to the one most daily panels occupied before the 1940s.

In an issue related to size limitations, Sunday comics are often bound to rigid formats that allow their panels to be rearranged in several different ways while remaining readable. Such formats usually include throwaway panels at the beginning, which some newspapers will omit for space. As a result, cartoonists have less incentive to put great efforts into these panels. &quot;Garfield&quot; and &quot;Mutts&quot; were known during the mid-to-late 80s and 1990s respectively for their throwaways on their Sunday strips, however both strips now run &quot;generic&quot; title panels.

Some cartoonists have complained about this, with Walt Kelly, creator of &quot;Pogo,&quot; openly voicing his discontent about being forced to draw his Sunday strips in such rigid formats from the beginning. Kelly&#x27;s heirs opted to end the strip in 1975 as a form of protest against the practice. Since then, &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; creator Bill Watterson has written extensively on the issue, arguing that size reduction and dropped panels reduce both the potential and freedom of a cartoonist. After a lengthy battle with his syndicate, Watterson won the privilege of making half page-sized Sunday strips where he could arrange the panels any way he liked. Many newspaper publishers and a few cartoonists objected to this, and some papers continued to print &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; at small sizes. &quot;Opus&quot; won that same privilege years after &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; ended, while Wiley Miller circumvented further downsizes by making his &quot;Non Sequitur&quot; Sunday strip available only in a vertical arrangement. Most strips created since 1990, however, are drawn in the unbroken &quot;third-page&quot; format. Few newspapers still run half-page strips, as with &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; and &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; in the front page of the &quot;Reading Eagle&quot; Sunday comics section until the mid-2010s.

===Format===
With the success of &quot;The Gumps&quot; during the 1920s, it became commonplace for strips (comedy- and adventure-laden alike) to have lengthy stories spanning weeks or months. The &quot;Monarch of Medioka&quot; story in Floyd Gottfredson&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip ran from September 8, 1937, to May 2, 1938. Between the 1960s and the late 1980s, as television news relegated newspaper reading to an occasional basis rather than daily, syndicators were abandoning long stories and urging cartoonists to switch to simple daily gags, or week-long &quot;storylines&quot; (with six consecutive (mostly unrelated) strips following a same subject), with longer storylines being used mainly on adventure-based and dramatic strips. Strips begun during the mid-1980s or after (such as &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot;, &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;, &quot;Monty&quot;, and others) are known for their heavy use of storylines, lasting between one and three weeks in most cases.

The writing style of comic strips changed as well after World War II. With an increase in the number of college-educated readers, there was a shift away from slapstick comedy and towards more cerebral humor. Slapstick and visual gags became more confined to Sunday strips, because as &quot;Garfield&quot; creator Jim Davis put it, &quot;Children are more likely to read Sunday strips than dailies.&quot;

===Second author===
Many older strips are no longer drawn by the original cartoonist, who has either died or retired. Such strips are known as &quot;zombie strips&quot;. A cartoonist, paid by the syndicate or sometimes a relative of the original cartoonist, continues writing the strip, a tradition that became commonplace in the early half of the 20th century. &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; and &quot;Frank and Ernest&quot; are both drawn by the sons of the creators. Some strips which are still in affiliation with the original creator are produced by small teams or entire companies, such as Jim Davis&#x27; &quot;Garfield&quot;, however there is some debate if these strips fall in this category.

This act is commonly criticized by modern cartoonists including Watterson and &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;&#x27;s Stephan Pastis. The issue was addressed in six consecutive &quot;Pearls&quot; strips in 2005. Charles Schulz, of &quot;Peanuts&quot; fame, requested that his strip not be continued by another cartoonist after his death. He also rejected the idea of hiring an inker or letterer, comparing it to a golfer hiring a man to make his putts. Schulz&#x27;s family has honored his wishes and refused numerous proposals by syndicators to continue &quot;Peanuts&quot; with a new author.

====Assistants====
Since the consolidation of newspaper comics by the first quarter of the 20th century, most cartoonists have used a group of assistants (with usually one of them credited). However, quite a few cartoonists (e.g.: George Herriman and Charles Schulz, among others) have done their strips almost completely by themselves; often criticizing the use of assistants for the same reasons most have about their editors hiring anyone else to continue their work after their retirement.

===Rights to the strips===
Historically, syndicates owned the creators&#x27; work, enabling them to continue publishing the strip after the original creator retired, left the strip, or died. This practice led to the term &quot;legacy strips&quot;, or more pejoratively &quot;zombie strips&quot;. Most syndicates signed creators to 10- or even 20-year contracts. (There have been exceptions, however, such as Bud Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; being an early—if not the earliest—case in which the creator retained ownership of his work.) Both these practices began to change with the 1970 debut of Universal Press Syndicate, as the company gave cartoonists a 50-percent ownership share of their work. Creators Syndicate, founded in 1987, granted artists full rights to the strips, something that Universal Press did in 1990, followed by King Features in 1995. By 1999 both Tribune Media Services and United Feature had begun granting ownership rights to creators (limited to new and/or hugely popular strips).

===Censorship===
Starting in the late 1940s, the national syndicates which distributed newspaper comic strips subjected them to very strict censorship. &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was censored in September 1947 and was pulled from the Pittsburgh Press by Scripps-Howard. The controversy, as reported in &quot;Time&quot;, centered on Capp&#x27;s portrayal of the U.S. Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps, &quot;We don&#x27;t think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.&quot;

As comics are easier for children to access compared to other types of media, they have a significantly more rigid censorship code than other media. Stephan Pastis has lamented that the &quot;unwritten&quot; censorship code is still &quot;stuck somewhere in the 1950s&quot;. Generally, comics are not allowed to include such words as &quot;damn&quot;, &quot;sucks&quot;, &quot;screwed&quot;, and &quot;hell&quot;, although there have been exceptions such as the September 22, 2010 &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot; in which an elderly man says, &quot;This nursing home food sucks,&quot; and a pair of &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; comics from January 11, 2011, with a character named Ned using the word &quot;crappy&quot;. Naked backsides and shooting guns cannot be shown, according to &quot;Dilbert&quot; cartoonist Scott Adams. Such comic strip taboos were detailed in Dave Breger&#x27;s book &quot;But That&#x27;s Unprintable&quot; (Bantam, 1955).

Many issues such as sex, narcotics, and terrorism cannot or can very rarely be openly discussed in strips, although there are exceptions, usually for satire, as in &quot;Bloom County&quot;. This led some cartoonists to resort to double entendre or dialogue children do not understand, as in Greg Evans&#x27; &quot;Luann&quot;. Another example of wordplay to get around censorship is a July 27, 2016 Pearls Before Swine strip that features Pig talking to his sister, and says the phrase &quot;I SIS!&quot; repeatedly after correcting his sister&#x27;s grammar. The strip then cuts to a scene of a NSA wiretap agent, following a scene of Pig being arrested by the FBI saying &quot;Never correct your sister&#x27;s grammar&quot;, implying that the CIA mistook the phrase &quot;I SIS&quot; with &quot;ISIS&quot;. Younger cartoonists have claimed commonplace words, images, and issues should be allowed in the comics, considering that the pressure on &quot;clean&quot; humor has been a chief factor for the declining popularity of comic strips since the 1990s (Aaron McGruder, creator of &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, decided to end his strip partly because of censorship issues, while the &quot;Popeye&quot; daily comic strip ended in 1994 after newspapers objected to a storyline they considered to be a satire on abortion). Some of the taboo words and topics are mentioned daily on television and other forms of visual media. Webcomics and comics distributed primarily to college newspapers are much freer in this respect.

<doc id="5705" wikidata="Q208416" url="?curid=5705" title="Continuum hypothesis">
<text>In mathematics, specifically set theory, the continuum hypothesis (abbreviated CH) is a hypothesis about the possible sizes of infinite sets. It states:

Or equivalently:
In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC), this is equivalent to the following equation in aleph numbers: formula_1, or even shorter with beth numbers: formula_2.

The continuum hypothesis was advanced by Georg Cantor in 1878, and establishing its truth or falsehood is the first of Hilbert&#x27;s 23 problems presented in 1900. The answer to this problem is independent of ZFC, so that either the continuum hypothesis or its negation can be added as an axiom to ZFC set theory, with the resulting theory being consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent. This independence was proved in 1963 by Paul Cohen, complementing earlier work by Kurt Gödel in 1940.

The name of the hypothesis comes from the term &quot;the continuum&quot; for the real numbers.

==History==

Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and for many years tried in vain to prove it. It became the first on David Hilbert&#x27;s list of important open questions that was presented at the International Congress of Mathematicians in the year 1900 in Paris. Axiomatic set theory was at that point not yet formulated. 
Kurt Gödel proved in 1940 that the negation of the continuum hypothesis, i.e., the existence of a set with intermediate cardinality, could not be proved in standard set theory. The second half of the independence of the continuum hypothesis – i.e., unprovability of the nonexistence of an intermediate-sized set – was proved in 1963 by Paul Cohen.

==Cardinality of infinite sets==

Two sets are said to have the same &quot;cardinality&quot; or &quot;cardinal number&quot; if there exists a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between them. Intuitively, for two sets formula_3 and formula_4 to have the same cardinality means that it is possible to &quot;pair off&quot; elements of formula_3 with elements of formula_4 in such a fashion that every element of formula_3 is paired off with exactly one element of formula_4 and vice versa. Hence, the set formula_9 has the same cardinality as formula_10 despite the sets themselves containing different elements.

With infinite sets such as the set of integers or rational numbers, the existence of a bijection between two sets becomes more difficult to demonstrate. The rational numbers formula_11 seemingly form a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis: the integers form a proper subset of the rationals, which themselves form a proper subset of the reals, so intuitively, there are more rational numbers than integers and more real numbers than rational numbers. However, this intuitive analysis is flawed since it does not take into account the fact that all three sets are infinite. Perhaps more importantly, it in fact conflates the concept of &quot;size&quot; of the set formula_11 with the order or topological structure placed on it. In fact, it turns out the rational numbers can actually be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and therefore the set of rational numbers is the same size (&quot;cardinality&quot;) as the set of integers: they are both countable sets.

Cantor gave two proofs that the cardinality of the set of integers is strictly smaller than that of the set of real numbers (see Cantor&#x27;s first uncountability proof and Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument). His proofs, however, give no indication of the extent to which the cardinality of the integers is less than that of the real numbers. Cantor proposed the continuum hypothesis as a possible solution to this question.

In simple terms, the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) states that the set of real numbers has minimal possible cardinality which is greater than the cardinality of the set of integers. That is, every set formula_13 of real numbers can either be mapped one-to-one into the integers or the real numbers can be mapped one-to-one into formula_3. Since the real numbers are equinumerous with the powerset of the integers, i.e. formula_15, CH can be restated as follows:

Assuming the axiom of choice, there is a unique smallest cardinal number formula_16 greater than formula_17, and the continuum hypothesis is in turn equivalent to the equality formula_18.

==Independence from ZFC==

The independence of the continuum hypothesis (CH) from Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) follows from combined work of Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen.

Gödel
showed that CH cannot be disproved from ZF, even if the axiom of choice (AC) is adopted, i.e. from ZFC. Gödel&#x27;s proof shows that both CH and AC hold in the constructible universe formula_19, an inner model of ZF set theory, assuming only the axioms of ZF. The existence of an inner model of ZF in which additional axioms hold shows that the additional axioms are (relatively) consistent with ZF, provided ZF itself is consistent. The latter condition cannot be proved in ZF itself, due to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, but is widely believed to be true and can be proved in stronger set theories.

Cohen showed that CH cannot be proven from the ZFC axioms, completing the overall independence proof. To prove his result, Cohen developed the method of forcing, which has become a standard tool in set theory. Essentially, this method begins with a model of ZF in which CH holds and constructs another model which contains more sets than the original in a way that CH does not hold in the new model. Cohen was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 for his proof.

Cohen&#x27;s independence proof shows that CH is independent of ZFC. Specifically, it shows that the theory ZFC+¬CH. Further research has shown that CH is independent of all known &quot;large cardinal axioms&quot; in the context of ZFC. Moreover, it has been shown that the cardinality of the continuum formula_20 can be any cardinal consistent with König&#x27;s theorem. A result of Solovay, proved shortly after Cohen&#x27;s result on the independence of the continuum hypothesis, shows that in any model of ZFC, if formula_21 is a cardinal of uncountable cofinality, then there is a forcing extension in which formula_22. However, per König&#x27;s theorem, it is not consistent to assume formula_23 is formula_24 or formula_25 or any cardinal with cofinality formula_26.

The continuum hypothesis is closely related to many statements in analysis, point set topology and measure theory. As a result of its independence, many substantial conjectures in those fields have subsequently been shown to be independent as well.

The independence from ZFC means that proving or disproving the CH within ZFC is impossible. However, Gödel and Cohen&#x27;s negative results are not universally accepted as disposing of all interest in the continuum hypothesis. The continuum hypothesis remains an active topic of research: see Woodin and Koellner for an overview of the current research status.

The continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice were among the first genuinely mathematical statements shown to be independent of ZF set theory. Although the existence of some statements independent of ZFC had already been known more than two decades prior: for example, assuming good soundness properties and the consistency of ZFC, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems published in 1931 establish that there is a formal statement Con(ZFC) (one for each appropriate Gödel numbering scheme) expressing the consistency of ZFC, that is also independent of it. The latter independence result indeed holds for many theories.

==Arguments &quot;for&quot; and &quot;against&quot; the continuum hypothesis==

Gödel believed that CH is false, and that his proof that CH is consistent with ZFC only shows that the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms do not adequately characterize the universe of sets. Gödel was a Platonist and therefore had no problems with asserting the truth and falsehood of statements independent of their provability. Cohen, though a formalist, also tended towards rejecting CH.

Historically, mathematicians who favored a &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;large&quot; universe of sets were against CH, while those favoring a &quot;neat&quot; and &quot;controllable&quot; universe favored CH. Parallel arguments were made for and against the axiom of constructibility, which implies CH. More recently, Matthew Foreman has pointed out that ontological maximalism can actually be used to argue in favor of CH, because among models that have the same reals, models with &quot;more&quot; sets of reals have a better chance of satisfying CH.

Another viewpoint is that the conception of set is not specific enough to determine whether CH is true or false. This viewpoint was advanced as early as 1923 by Skolem, even before Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem. Skolem argued on the basis of what is now known as Skolem&#x27;s paradox, and it was later supported by the independence of CH from the axioms of ZFC since these axioms are enough to establish the elementary properties of sets and cardinalities. In order to argue against this viewpoint, it would be sufficient to demonstrate new axioms that are supported by intuition and resolve CH in one direction or another. Although the axiom of constructibility does resolve CH, it is not generally considered to be intuitively true any more than CH is generally considered to be false.

At least two other axioms have been proposed that have implications for the continuum hypothesis, although these axioms have not currently found wide acceptance in the mathematical community. In 1986, Chris Freiling presented an argument against CH by showing that the negation of CH is equivalent to Freiling&#x27;s axiom of symmetry, a statement derived by arguing from particular intuitions about probabilities. Freiling believes this axiom is &quot;intuitively clear&quot; but others have disagreed.

A difficult argument against CH developed by W. Hugh Woodin has attracted considerable attention since the year 2000. Foreman does not reject Woodin&#x27;s argument outright but urges caution. Woodin proposed a new hypothesis that he labeled the , or &quot;Star axiom&quot;. The Star axiom would imply that formula_23 is formula_28, thus falsifying CH. The Star axiom was bolstered by an independent May 2021 proof showing the Star axiom can be derived from a variation of Martin&#x27;s maximum. However, Woodin stated in the 2010s that he now instead believes CH to be true, based on his belief in his new &quot;ultimate L&quot; conjecture.

Solomon Feferman argued that CH is not a definite mathematical problem. He proposed a theory of &quot;definiteness&quot; using a semi-intuitionistic subsystem of ZF that accepts classical logic for bounded quantifiers but uses intuitionistic logic for unbounded ones, and suggested that a proposition formula_29 is mathematically &quot;definite&quot; if the semi-intuitionistic theory can prove formula_30. He conjectured that CH is not definite according to this notion, and proposed that CH should, therefore, be considered not to have a truth value. Peter Koellner wrote a critical commentary on Feferman&#x27;s article.

Joel David Hamkins proposes a multiverse approach to set theory and argues that &quot;the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and, as a result, it can no longer be settled in the manner formerly hoped for&quot;. In a related vein, Saharon Shelah wrote that he does &quot;not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that we just have to discover the additional axiom. My mental picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC&quot;.

==Generalized continuum hypothesis==
The &quot;generalized continuum hypothesis&quot; (GCH) states that if an infinite set&#x27;s cardinality lies between that of an infinite set and that of the power set formula_31 of , then it has the same cardinality as either or formula_31. That is, for any infinite cardinal formula_33 there is no cardinal formula_21 such that formula_35. GCH is equivalent to:

(occasionally called &quot;Cantor&#x27;s aleph hypothesis&quot;).

The beth numbers provide an alternative notation for this condition: formula_36 for every ordinal formula_37. The continuum hypothesis is the special case for the ordinal formula_38. GCH was first suggested by Philip Jourdain. For the early history of GCH, see Moore.

Like CH, GCH is also independent of ZFC, but Sierpiński proved that ZF + GCH implies the axiom of choice (AC) (and therefore the negation of the axiom of determinacy, AD), so choice and GCH are not independent in ZF; there are no models of ZF in which GCH holds and AC fails. To prove this, Sierpiński showed GCH implies that every cardinality n is smaller than some aleph number, and thus can be ordered. This is done by showing that n is smaller than formula_39 which is smaller than its own Hartogs number—this uses the equality formula_40; for the full proof, see Gillman.

Kurt Gödel showed that GCH is a consequence of ZF + V=L (the axiom that every set is constructible relative to the ordinals), and is therefore consistent with ZFC. As GCH implies CH, Cohen&#x27;s model in which CH fails is a model in which GCH fails, and thus GCH is not provable from ZFC. W. B. Easton used the method of forcing developed by Cohen to prove Easton&#x27;s theorem, which shows it is consistent with ZFC for arbitrarily large cardinals formula_41 to fail to satisfy formula_42. Much later, Foreman and Woodin proved that (assuming the consistency of very large cardinals) it is consistent that formula_43 holds for every infinite cardinal formula_21. Later Woodin extended this by showing the consistency of formula_45 for every Carmi Merimovich showed that, for each , it is consistent with ZFC that for each infinite cardinal , is the th successor of (assuming the consistency of some large cardinal axioms). On the other hand, László Patai proved that if is an ordinal and for each infinite cardinal , is the th successor of , then is finite.

For any infinite sets and , if there is an injection from to then there is an injection from subsets of to subsets of . Thus for any infinite cardinals and , formula_46. If and are finite, the stronger inequality formula_47 holds. GCH implies that this strict, stronger inequality holds for infinite cardinals as well as finite cardinals.

===Implications of GCH for cardinal exponentiation===
Although the generalized continuum hypothesis refers directly only to cardinal exponentiation with 2 as the base, one can deduce from it the values of cardinal exponentiation formula_48 in all cases. GCH implies that for ordinals and :

*formula_49 when ;
*formula_50 when and formula_51, where cf is the cofinality operation; and
*formula_52 when and 

The first equality (when ) follows from:

formula_53
while:

formula_54

The third equality (when and formula_55) follows from:

formula_56

by König&#x27;s theorem, while:

formula_57

<text>Çevik Bir (born 1939) is a retired Turkish army general. He was a member of the Turkish General Staff in the 1990s. He took a major part in several important international missions in the Middle East and North Africa. He was born in Buca, Izmir Province, in 1939 and is married with one child.

He graduated from the Turkish Military Academy as an engineer officer in 1958, from the Army Staff College in 1970 and from the Armed Forces College in 1971. He graduated from NATO Defense College, Rome, Italy in 1973.

From 1983 to 1985, he served at SHAPE, NATO&#x27;s headquarters in Belgium. He was promoted to brigadier general and commanded an armed brigade and division in Turkey. From 1987 to 1991, he served as major general, and then was promoted to lieutenant general.

After the dictator Siad Barre’s ousting, conflicts between the General Mohammed Farah Aidid party and other clans in Somalia had led to famine and lawlessness throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 people had died from starvation. A combined military force of United States and United Nations (under the name &quot;UNOSOM&quot;) were deployed to Mogadishu, to monitor the ceasefire and deliver food and supplies to the starving people of Somali. Çevik Bir, who was then a lieutenant-general of Turkey, became the force commander of UNOSOM II in April 1993. Despite the retreat of US and UN forces after several deaths due to local hostilities mainly led by Aidid, the introduction of a powerful military force opened the transportation routes, enabling the provision of supplies and ended the famine quickly. He was succeeded as Force Commander by a Malaysian general in January 1994.

He became a four-star general and served three years as vice chairman of the Turkish Armed Forces, then appointed commander of the Turkish First Army, in Istanbul. While he was vice chairman of the TAF, he signed the Turkish-Israeli Military Coordination agreement in 1996.

Çevik Bir became the Turkish army&#x27;s deputy chief of general staff shortly after the Somali operation and played a vital role in establishing a Turkish-Israeli entente. He retired from the army on 30 August 1999. He is a former member of the Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa (ASMEA).

On 12 April 2012, Bir and 30 other officers were taken in custody for their role in the 1997 military memorandum that forced the then Turkish government, led by the Refah Partisi (Welfare Party), to step down. On 11 September 2021, the General Staff Personnel Presidency reported to the Ankara 5th High Criminal Court, where the case was heard, that the administrative action was taken to demolish the 13 retired generals convicted in the February 28 trial. Thus, Çevik Bir was demoted. 

Çevik Bir, one of the generals who planned the process, said &quot;In Turkey we have a marriage of Islam and democracy. (…) The child of this marriage is secularism. Now this child gets sick from time to time. The Turkish Armed Forces is the doctor which saves the child. Depending on how sick the kid is, we administer the necessary medicine to make sure the child recuperates&quot;.

<text>Nepeta is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. The genus name, from Latin (“catnip”), is reportedly in reference to Nepete, an ancient Etruscan city. There are 295 accepted species.

The genus is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, and has also naturalized in North America.

Some members of this group are known as [[catnip]] or catmint because of their effect on house cats – the nepetalactone contained in some &quot;Nepeta&quot; species binds to the olfactory receptors of cats, typically resulting in temporary euphoria.

== Description ==
Most of the species are herbaceous perennial plants, but some are annuals. They have sturdy stems with opposite heart-shaped, green to gray-green leaves. &quot;Nepeta&quot; plants are usually aromatic in foliage and flowers.

The tubular flowers can be lavender, blue, white, pink, or lilac, and spotted with tiny lavender-purple dots. The flowers are located in verticillasters grouped on spikes; or the verticillasters are arranged in opposite cymes, racemes, or panicles – toward the tip of the stems.

The calyx is tubular or campanulate, they are slightly curved or straight, and the limbs are often 2-lipped with five teeth. The lower lip is larger, with 3-lobes, and the middle lobe is the largest. The flowers have 4 hairless stamens that are nearly parallel, and they ascend under the upper lip of the corolla. Two stamen are longer and stamens of pistillate flowers are rudimentary. The style protrudes outside of the mouth of the flowers.

The fruits are nutlets, which are oblong-ovoid, ellipsoid, ovoid, or obovoid in shape. The surfaces of the nutlets can be slightly ribbed, smooth or warty.

== Species ==
295 species are accepted.

==Gallery==
== Uses ==

=== Cultivation ===
Some &quot;Nepeta&quot; species are cultivated as ornamental plants. They can be drought tolerant – water conserving, often deer repellent, with long bloom periods from late spring to autumn. Some species also have repellent properties to insect pests, including aphids and squash bugs, when planted in a garden.

&quot;Nepeta&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species including &quot;Coleophora albitarsella&quot;, and as nectar sources for pollinators, such as honey bees and hummingbirds.

;Selected ornamental species
* &quot;Nepeta cataria&quot; (catnip, catswort) – the &quot;true catnip&quot;, cultivated as an ornamental plant, has become an invasive species in some habitats.
* &quot;Nepeta grandiflora&quot; (giant catmint, Caucasus catmint) – lusher than true catnip and has dark green leaves and dark blue flowers.
* &quot;Nepeta&quot; × &quot;faassenii&quot; (garden catmint) – a hybrid of garden source with gray-green foliage and lavender flowers. It is drought-tolerant and deer-resistant. The cultivar &#x27;Walker&#x27;s Low&#x27; was named Perennial of the Year for 2007 by the Perennial Plant Association.
* &quot;Nepeta racemosa&quot; (raceme catnip) – commonly used in landscaping. It is hardy, rated for USDA hardiness zone 5b.

<text>The Cornish Nationalist Party (CNP; ) is a political party founded in 1975. It initially campaigned for independence for Cornwall but later supported devolved powers under central UK control.

The CNP should not be confused other Cornish nationalist parties, including Mebyon Kernow (MK) from which the CNP split in 1975, or the similarly named Cornish National Party, which split from MK in 1969.

==History==
The party was formed on 28 May 1975 by people who left Mebyon Kernow, Cornwall&#x27;s main nationalist party, and was first led by James Whetter.

The split with Mebyon Kernow was based on two main debates. First was whether to be a centre-left party, appealing to the electorate on a social democratic line, or whether to appeal emotionally on a centre-right cultural line. At the time, the same debate was occurring in most political parties campaigning for autonomy from the United Kingdom, including the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru. Second was whether to embrace devolution as a first step to full independence (or as the sole step if this was what the electorate wished) or for independence to be &quot;all or nothing&quot;.

The CNP represented a more right-wing outlook based on the belief that cultural arguments were more likely to win votes than economic ones. The CNP worked to preserve the Celtic identity of Cornwall, and encouraged links with Cornish people overseas and with other regions with distinct identities. It also gave support to the Cornish language and commemorated Thomas Flamank, a leader of the Cornish Rebellion in 1497, at an annual ceremony at Bodmin on 27 June each year. It also worked to improve Cornwall&#x27;s economy.

Since the death of founder James Whetter in 2018, the CNP has been led by Androw Hawke.

===Electoral and campaign activity===
Throughout its history, the CNP has been sporadically registered with the Electoral Commission, fielding candidates for some elections but not others. When not participating in elections it has often continued to act as a campaign group or pressure group, although its visibility and influence within Cornwall is negligible.

It stood for national elections twice, in 1979 and 1983. In April 2009, a news story reported that the party had re-formed following a conference in Bodmin; however, it did not contest any elections that year.
A newspaper article and a revamp of the party website in October 2014 state that the party planned to contest elections once more. The reformed party was registered with the Electoral Commission in 2014, but ceased to be registered in 2017.

===Indian office===
In 1983 the party opened an office in India. The Indian office was established by Gagan Narayan Dua and published a periodical entitled &quot;Cornish India&quot;.

===Publications===
Whetter was the founder and editor of the CNP quarterly journal, &quot;The Cornish Banner&quot; (&quot;An Baner Kernewek&quot;), within the actions of the Roseland Institute.

==Elections and results==
At the 1984 European Parliament election, the CNP was affiliated to the former .

The CNP had one parish councillor, leader Androw Hawke who was elected to Polperro Community Council for the second time on 4 May 2017.

==Policy==
===Original policies===
The Policy Statement of the CNP was published in 1975. The 1977 &quot;Programme of the Cornish Nationalist Party&quot; was laid out under multiple key points.
;World and continental government
: The party promotes international federalism in which power is decentaralised &quot;to the true, natural identities and units&quot; to free Celtic nations from their &quot;imperialist overlords&quot;. It will work to achieve autonomy for Cornwall to the degree &quot;necessary for her total fulfilment as a Celtic nation. It believes &quot;internationalism is based on strong nationalisms.&quot;
;Celtic confederation
: The party will work to establish a confederation of the six Celtic countries with shared institutions, within a united Europe.
;The Cornish state
: A Cornish state should have sovereign authority inside its traditional border and over its surrounding sea. Its national flag will be the flag of Saint Piran. The Isles of Scilly may have a referendum to decide on membership. Devolved powers may be an acceptable step towards this ultimate goal.
;Democratic government
: Power within the Cornish state should also be decentralised to smaller units and these should be based on traditional hundred, parish and town boundaries.
;Legal system
: Transition from the English legal system to &quot;Celtic Confederation Courts&quot;, European courts, and UN courts. New court procedures will introduce the verdict &#x27;not proven&#x27; as in Scotland and treat crime against persons as more serious than property crime. Punishment will focus on rehabilitation.
;Language
: Cornish will be the official language, the language of government, and eventually of education, via a process modelled on the revival of the Hebrew language in Israel.
;Mass communication
: The Cornish state will have a free press. Publications and programming promoting Cornish and Celtic culture will be supported by the state. Aid will be given to the promotion of the party&#x27;s &quot;Cornish Banner&quot; periodical.
;Social organisation and welfare
: The party supports continuing welfare for the old, sick and young. For others it will &quot;encourage self-reliance and self-sufficiency&quot; instead of &quot;hand-outs&quot;. Men and women will be equal but &quot;encouraged in their loyalties to old-established and traditional nuclear families&quot; as well as to local communities and to Cornwall.
;Housing
: The party would end second homes and build housing to be bought affordably.
;Economy
: Property rights will be respected and registered in the Cornish state. The economy will be based on a mixture of capitalist and socialist systems. Small businesses will be encouraged, while new industry will emerge &quot;naturally&quot; from &quot;market conditions&quot;. English &quot;class antagnoism&quot; will be avoided in larger businesses via profit sharing and worker representation on boards. Farming will be encouraged and fishermen will have sole rights to seas within 50 miles. Cooperatives and unions will be formed. The state has rights to all natural resources in its territory, and extraction companies will pay a proportion of their value to the state. Tourism will be controlled in volume, given better amenities, and refocused on Cornish culture.
;Transport and communication
: Improvements will avoid widening roads and removing hedgerows.
;Energy
: The Cornish state will use existing resources and develop new ones, prioritising natural sources.
;Environment and ecology
: The environment is unique and should be protected via education. People should be encouraged to build new buildings in a traditional Celtic style. Planning control will be minimal to ensure freedom.
;Sport
: Cornish sports and sports that the Cornish are good at will be encouraged in schools and at the national or Celtic level.
;Culture and recreation
: Traditional festivals, dances, literature and folklore will be promoted.
;Religion
: Education should focus on Christianity and ancient Celtic religion. People should have freedom of religion.
;Youth
: The party will develop a Cornish Youth Movement based on the Welsh Urdd Gobaith Cymru.
;Defence
: The Cornish state will have a &quot;home defence force, linked to local communities and civil units of administration&quot;. It will have no offence force but will contribute to Celtic, European and UN forces. Water rights will be protected by fishery protection vessels and gun boats. Rights may be leased to England for naval use.
;Foreign policy and ambassadorial recognition
: The Cornish state will support international co-operation and justice as well as Celtic unity. Ambassadorial recognition of all but the most closely-linked stated will happen at the Celtic level.

===Other policies===

Other policies have included:
* Better job prospects for Cornish people.
* Reduction of unemployment to an acceptable level (2.5%).
* The protection of the self-employed and small businesses in Cornwall.
* Cheaper housing and priority for Cornish people.
* The Cornish state will have control over the number and nature of immigrants.
* The establishment of a Cornish economic department to aid the basic industries of farming, fishing, china clay and mining and secondary industries developing from these.
* Improved transport facilities in Cornwall with greater scope for private enterprise to operate.
* Existing medical and welfare services for Cornish people will be developed and improved.
* Protection of Cornish natural resources, including offshore resources.
* Courses on Cornish language and history should be made available in schools for those who want them.
* The rule of law will be upheld by the Cornish state and the judiciary will be separate from the legislative and executive functions of the state.

More recent policies include:
* A far greater say in government for Cornish people (by referendums if necessary) and the decentralisation of considerable powers to a Cornish nation within a united Europe - special links being established with our Celtic brothers and sisters in Scotland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Wales and Brittany.
*Calling for more legislative powers to be given to Cornwall Council. The authority should effectively become the Cornish government, with town and parish councils acting as local government.
*Cornwall council should have a reduction in councillors, with standardisation of electoral areas and constituencies in throughout Cornwall.
*The Westminster government should appoint a Minister for Cornwall and confirm there will be no further plans to have any parliamentary constituency covering part of Cornwall and Devon.
*John Le Bretton, vice-chairman of the party, stated: &quot;The CNP supports the retention of Cornwall Council as a Cornwall-wide authority running Cornish affairs and we call for the British government in Westminster to devolve powers to the council so that decisions affecting Cornwall can be made in Cornwall&quot;.

==Image==
The CNP has had image problems, having been seen as similarly styled to nativist and far-right parties, the British National Party (BNP) and National Front (NF). During the 1970s, the party magazine &quot;The Cornish Banner / An Baner Kernewek&quot; published letters sympathetic to the NF and critical of &quot;Zionist&quot; politicians.

In around 1976, CNP formed a controversial uniformed wing, for which it received criticism from members of the Celtic League and MK. The group, known as the &quot;Greenshirts&quot;, was led by the CNP Youth Movement leader and public relations officer Wallace Simmons. Simmons also founded the Cornish Front, which supported the NF. A notable political difference is that CNP and Cornish Front were sympathetic to Irish republicanism while the NF was largely supportive of Ulster loyalism, though there were exceptions within the NF, including former leading figure Patrick Harrington who is of Irish Catholic heritage.

<text>Cryptanalysis (from the Greek &quot;kryptós&quot;, &quot;hidden&quot;, and &quot;analýein&quot;, &quot;to analyze&quot;) refers to the process of analyzing information systems in order to understand hidden aspects of the systems. Cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown.

In addition to mathematical analysis of cryptographic algorithms, cryptanalysis includes the study of side-channel attacks that do not target weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms themselves, but instead exploit weaknesses in their implementation.

Even though the goal has been the same, the methods and techniques of cryptanalysis have changed drastically through the history of cryptography, adapting to increasing cryptographic complexity, ranging from the pen-and-paper methods of the past, through machines like the British Bombes and Colossus computers at Bletchley Park in World War II, to the mathematically advanced computerized schemes of the present. Methods for breaking modern cryptosystems often involve solving carefully constructed problems in pure mathematics, the best-known being integer factorization.

==Overview==
In encryption, confidential information (called the &quot;plaintext&quot;) is sent securely to a recipient by the sender first converting it into an unreadable form (&quot;ciphertext&quot;) using an encryption algorithm. The ciphertext is sent through an insecure channel to the recipient. The recipient decrypts the ciphertext by applying an inverse decryption algorithm, recovering the plaintext. To decrypt the ciphertext, the recipient requires a secret knowledge from the sender, usually a string of letters, numbers, or bits, called a &quot;cryptographic key&quot;. The concept is that even if an unauthorized person gets access to the ciphertext during transmission, without the secret key they cannot convert it back to plaintext.

Encryption has been used throughout history to send important military, diplomatic and commercial messages, and today is very widely used in computer networking to protect email and internet communication.

The goal of cryptanalysis is for a third party, a cryptanalyst, to gain as much information as possible about the original (&quot;plaintext&quot;), attempting to &quot;break&quot; the encryption to read the ciphertext and learning the secret key so future messages can be decrypted and read. A mathematical technique to do this is called a &quot;cryptographic attack&quot;. Cryptographic attacks can be characterized in a number of ways:

===Amount of information available to the attacker===

Cryptanalytical attacks can be classified based on what type of information the attacker has available. As a basic starting point it is normally assumed that, for the purposes of analysis, the general algorithm is known; this is Shannon&#x27;s Maxim &quot;the enemy knows the system&quot; – in its turn, equivalent to Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle. This is a reasonable assumption in practice – throughout history, there are countless examples of secret algorithms falling into wider knowledge, variously through espionage, betrayal and reverse engineering. (And on occasion, ciphers have been broken through pure deduction; for example, the German Lorenz cipher and the Japanese Purple code, and a variety of classical schemes):
* &quot;Ciphertext-only&quot;: the cryptanalyst has access only to a collection of ciphertexts or codetexts.
* &quot;Known-plaintext&quot;: the attacker has a set of ciphertexts to which they know the corresponding plaintext.
* &quot;Chosen-plaintext&quot; (&quot;chosen-ciphertext&quot;): the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts (plaintexts) corresponding to an arbitrary set of plaintexts (ciphertexts) of their own choosing.
* &quot;Adaptive chosen-plaintext&quot;: like a chosen-plaintext attack, except the attacker can choose subsequent plaintexts based on information learned from previous encryptions, similarly to the &quot;Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack&quot;.
* &quot;Related-key attack&quot;: Like a chosen-plaintext attack, except the attacker can obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys. The keys are unknown, but the relationship between them is known; for example, two keys that differ in the one bit.

===Computational resources required===

Attacks can also be characterised by the resources they require. Those resources include:
* Time – the number of &quot;computation steps&quot; (e.g., test encryptions) which must be performed.
* Memory – the amount of &quot;storage&quot; required to perform the attack.
* Data – the quantity and type of &quot;plaintexts and ciphertexts&quot; required for a particular approach.

It is sometimes difficult to predict these quantities precisely, especially when the attack is not practical to actually implement for testing. But academic cryptanalysts tend to provide at least the estimated &quot;order of magnitude&quot; of their attacks&#x27; difficulty, saying, for example, &quot;SHA-1 collisions now 252.&quot;

Bruce Schneier notes that even computationally impractical attacks can be considered breaks: &quot;Breaking a cipher simply means finding a weakness in the cipher that can be exploited with a complexity less than brute force. Never mind that brute-force might require 2128 encryptions; an attack requiring 2110 encryptions would be considered a break...simply put, a break can just be a certificational weakness: evidence that the cipher does not perform as advertised.&quot;

===Partial breaks===
The results of cryptanalysis can also vary in usefulness. Cryptographer Lars Knudsen (1998) classified various types of attack on block ciphers according to the amount and quality of secret information that was discovered:
* &quot;Total break&quot; – the attacker deduces the secret key.
* &quot;Global deduction&quot; – the attacker discovers a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption, but without learning the key.
* &quot;Instance (local) deduction&quot; – the attacker discovers additional plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.
* &quot;Information deduction&quot; – the attacker gains some Shannon information about plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.
* &quot;Distinguishing algorithm&quot; – the attacker can distinguish the cipher from a random permutation.

Academic attacks are often against weakened versions of a cryptosystem, such as a block cipher or hash function with some rounds removed. Many, but not all, attacks become exponentially more difficult to execute as rounds are added to a cryptosystem, so it&#x27;s possible for the full cryptosystem to be strong even though reduced-round variants are weak. Nonetheless, partial breaks that come close to breaking the original cryptosystem may mean that a full break will follow; the successful attacks on DES, MD5, and SHA-1 were all preceded by attacks on weakened versions.

In academic cryptography, a &quot;weakness&quot; or a &quot;break&quot; in a scheme is usually defined quite conservatively: it might require impractical amounts of time, memory, or known plaintexts. It also might require the attacker be able to do things many real-world attackers can&#x27;t: for example, the attacker may need to choose particular plaintexts to be encrypted or even to ask for plaintexts to be encrypted using several keys related to the secret key. Furthermore, it might only reveal a small amount of information, enough to prove the cryptosystem imperfect but too little to be useful to real-world attackers. Finally, an attack might only apply to a weakened version of cryptographic tools, like a reduced-round block cipher, as a step towards breaking the full system.

==History==
Cryptanalysis has coevolved together with cryptography, and the contest can be traced through the history of cryptography—new ciphers being designed to replace old broken designs, and new cryptanalytic techniques invented to crack the improved schemes. In practice, they are viewed as two sides of the same coin: secure cryptography requires design against possible cryptanalysis.

===Classical ciphers===

Although the actual word &quot;cryptanalysis&quot; is relatively recent (it was coined by William Friedman in 1920), methods for breaking codes and ciphers are much older. David Kahn notes in &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; that Arab scholars were the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic methods.

The first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis was given by Al-Kindi (c. 801–873, also known as &quot;Alkindus&quot; in Europe), a 9th-century Arab polymath, in &quot;Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu&#x27;amma&quot; (&quot;A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages&quot;). This treatise contains the first description of the method of frequency analysis. Al-Kindi is thus regarded as the first codebreaker in history. His breakthrough work was influenced by Al-Khalil (717–786), who wrote the &quot;Book of Cryptographic Messages&quot;, which contains the first use of to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.

Frequency analysis is the basic tool for breaking most classical ciphers. In natural languages, certain letters of the alphabet appear more often than others; in English, &quot;E&quot; is likely to be the most common letter in any sample of plaintext. Similarly, the digraph &quot;TH&quot; is the most likely pair of letters in English, and so on. Frequency analysis relies on a cipher failing to hide these statistics. For example, in a simple substitution cipher (where each letter is simply replaced with another), the most frequent letter in the ciphertext would be a likely candidate for &quot;E&quot;. Frequency analysis of such a cipher is therefore relatively easy, provided that the ciphertext is long enough to give a reasonably representative count of the letters of the alphabet that it contains.

Al-Kindi&#x27;s invention of the frequency analysis technique for breaking monoalphabetic substitution ciphers was the most significant cryptanalytic advance until World War II. Al-Kindi&#x27;s &quot;Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu&#x27;amma&quot; described the first cryptanalytic techniques, including some for polyalphabetic ciphers, cipher classification, Arabic phonetics and syntax, and most importantly, gave the first descriptions on frequency analysis. He also covered methods of encipherments, cryptanalysis of certain encipherments, and statistical analysis of letters and letter combinations in Arabic. An important contribution of Ibn Adlan (1187–1268) was on sample size for use of frequency analysis.

In Europe, Italian scholar Giambattista della Porta (1535–1615) was the author of a seminal work on cryptanalysis, &quot;De Furtivis Literarum Notis&quot;.

Successful cryptanalysis has undoubtedly influenced history; the ability to read the presumed-secret thoughts and plans of others can be a decisive advantage. For example, in England in 1587, Mary, Queen of Scots was tried and executed for treason as a result of her involvement in three plots to assassinate Elizabeth I of England. The plans came to light after her coded correspondence with fellow conspirators was deciphered by Thomas Phelippes.

In Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, the idea of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher was developed, among others by the French diplomat Blaise de Vigenère (1523–96). For some three centuries, the Vigenère cipher, which uses a repeating key to select different encryption alphabets in rotation, was considered to be completely secure (&quot;le chiffre indéchiffrable&quot;—&quot;the indecipherable cipher&quot;). Nevertheless, Charles Babbage (1791–1871) and later, independently, Friedrich Kasiski (1805–81) succeeded in breaking this cipher. During World War I, inventors in several countries developed rotor cipher machines such as Arthur Scherbius&#x27; Enigma, in an attempt to minimise the repetition that had been exploited to break the Vigenère system.

===Ciphers from World War I and World War II===

In World War I, the breaking of the Zimmermann Telegram was instrumental in bringing the United States into the war. In World War II, the Allies benefitted enormously from their joint success cryptanalysis of the German ciphers – including the Enigma machine and the Lorenz cipher – and Japanese ciphers, particularly &#x27;Purple&#x27; and JN-25. &#x27;Ultra&#x27; intelligence has been credited with everything between shortening the end of the European war by up to two years, to determining the eventual result. The war in the Pacific was similarly helped by &#x27;Magic&#x27; intelligence.

Cryptanalysis of enemy messages played a significant part in the Allied victory in World War II. F. W. Winterbotham, quoted the western Supreme Allied Commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower, at the war&#x27;s end as describing Ultra intelligence as having been &quot;decisive&quot; to Allied victory. Sir Harry Hinsley, official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, made a similar assessment about Ultra, saying that it shortened the war &quot;by not less than two years and probably by four years&quot;; moreover, he said that in the absence of Ultra, it is uncertain how the war would have ended.

In practice, frequency analysis relies as much on linguistic knowledge as it does on statistics, but as ciphers became more complex, mathematics became more important in cryptanalysis. This change was particularly evident before and during World War II, where efforts to crack Axis ciphers required new levels of mathematical sophistication. Moreover, automation was first applied to cryptanalysis in that era with the Polish Bomba device, the British Bombe, the use of punched card equipment, and in the Colossus computers – the first electronic digital computers to be controlled by a program.

====Indicator====
With reciprocal machine ciphers such as the Lorenz cipher and the Enigma machine used by Nazi Germany during World War II, each message had its own key. Usually, the transmitting operator informed the receiving operator of this message key by transmitting some plaintext and/or ciphertext before the enciphered message. This is termed the &quot;indicator&quot;, as it indicates to the receiving operator how to set his machine to decipher the message.

Poorly designed and implemented indicator systems allowed first Polish cryptographers and then the British cryptographers at Bletchley Park to break the Enigma cipher system. Similar poor indicator systems allowed the British to identify &quot;depths&quot; that led to the diagnosis of the Lorenz SZ40/42 cipher system, and the comprehensive breaking of its messages without the cryptanalysts seeing the cipher machine.

====Depth====
Sending two or more messages with the same key is an insecure process. To a cryptanalyst the messages are then said to be &quot;in depth.&quot; This may be detected by the messages having the same &quot;indicator&quot; by which the sending operator informs the receiving operator about the key generator initial settings for the message.

Generally, the cryptanalyst may benefit from lining up identical enciphering operations among a set of messages. For example, the Vernam cipher enciphers by bit-for-bit combining plaintext with a long key using the &quot;exclusive or&quot; operator, which is also known as &quot;modulo-2 addition&quot; (symbolized by ⊕ ):
::::Plaintext ⊕ Key = Ciphertext
Deciphering combines the same key bits with the ciphertext to reconstruct the plaintext:
::::Ciphertext ⊕ Key = Plaintext
(In modulo-2 arithmetic, addition is the same as subtraction.) When two such ciphertexts are aligned in depth, combining them eliminates the common key, leaving just a combination of the two plaintexts:
::::Ciphertext1 ⊕ Ciphertext2 = Plaintext1 ⊕ Plaintext2
The individual plaintexts can then be worked out linguistically by trying &quot;probable words&quot; (or phrases), also known as &quot;cribs,&quot; at various locations; a correct guess, when combined with the merged plaintext stream, produces intelligible text from the other plaintext component:
::::(Plaintext1 ⊕ Plaintext2) ⊕ Plaintext1 = Plaintext2
The recovered fragment of the second plaintext can often be extended in one or both directions, and the extra characters can be combined with the merged plaintext stream to extend the first plaintext. Working back and forth between the two plaintexts, using the intelligibility criterion to check guesses, the analyst may recover much or all of the original plaintexts. (With only two plaintexts in depth, the analyst may not know which one corresponds to which ciphertext, but in practice this is not a large problem.) When a recovered plaintext is then combined with its ciphertext, the key is revealed:
::::Plaintext1 ⊕ Ciphertext1 = Key
Knowledge of a key then allows the analyst to read other messages encrypted with the same key, and knowledge of a set of related keys may allow cryptanalysts to diagnose the system used for constructing them.

===Development of modern cryptography===
Governments have long recognized the potential benefits of cryptanalysis for intelligence, both military and diplomatic, and established dedicated organizations devoted to breaking the codes and ciphers of other nations, for example, GCHQ and the NSA, organizations which are still very active today.

Even though computation was used to great effect in the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher and other systems during World War II, it also made possible new methods of cryptography orders of magnitude more complex than ever before. Taken as a whole, modern cryptography has become much more impervious to cryptanalysis than the pen-and-paper systems of the past, and now seems to have the upper hand against pure cryptanalysis. The historian David Kahn notes:

Kahn goes on to mention increased opportunities for interception, bugging, side channel attacks, and quantum computers as replacements for the traditional means of cryptanalysis. In 2010, former NSA technical director Brian Snow said that both academic and government cryptographers are &quot;moving very slowly forward in a mature field.&quot;

However, any postmortems for cryptanalysis may be premature. While the effectiveness of cryptanalytic methods employed by intelligence agencies remains unknown, many serious attacks against both academic and practical cryptographic primitives have been published in the modern era of computer cryptography:
* The block cipher Madryga, proposed in 1984 but not widely used, was found to be susceptible to ciphertext-only attacks in 1998.
* FEAL-4, proposed as a replacement for the DES standard encryption algorithm but not widely used, was demolished by a spate of attacks from the academic community, many of which are entirely practical.
* The A5/1, A5/2, CMEA, and DECT systems used in mobile and wireless phone technology can all be broken in hours, minutes or even in real-time using widely available computing equipment.
* Brute-force keyspace search has broken some real-world ciphers and applications, including single-DES (see EFF DES cracker), 40-bit &quot;export-strength&quot; cryptography, and the DVD Content Scrambling System.
* In 2001, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), a protocol used to secure Wi-Fi wireless networks, was shown to be breakable in practice because of a weakness in the RC4 cipher and aspects of the WEP design that made related-key attacks practical. WEP was later replaced by Wi-Fi Protected Access.
* In 2008, researchers conducted a proof-of-concept break of SSL using weaknesses in the MD5 hash function and certificate issuer practices that made it possible to exploit collision attacks on hash functions. The certificate issuers involved changed their practices to prevent the attack from being repeated.

Thus, while the best modern ciphers may be far more resistant to cryptanalysis than the Enigma, cryptanalysis and the broader field of information security remain quite active.

==Symmetric ciphers==
* Boomerang attack
* Brute-force attack
* Davies&#x27; attack
* Differential cryptanalysis
* Harvest now, decrypt later
* Impossible differential cryptanalysis
* Improbable differential cryptanalysis
* Integral cryptanalysis
* Linear cryptanalysis
* Meet-in-the-middle attack
* Mod-n cryptanalysis
* Related-key attack
* Sandwich attack
* Slide attack
* XSL attack

==Asymmetric ciphers==
Asymmetric cryptography (or public-key cryptography) is cryptography that relies on using two (mathematically related) keys; one private, and one public. Such ciphers invariably rely on &quot;hard&quot; mathematical problems as the basis of their security, so an obvious point of attack is to develop methods for solving the problem. The security of two-key cryptography depends on mathematical questions in a way that single-key cryptography generally does not, and conversely links cryptanalysis to wider mathematical research in a new way.

Asymmetric schemes are designed around the (conjectured) difficulty of solving various mathematical problems. If an improved algorithm can be found to solve the problem, then the system is weakened. For example, the security of the Diffie–Hellman key exchange scheme depends on the difficulty of calculating the discrete logarithm. In 1983, Don Coppersmith found a faster way to find discrete logarithms (in certain groups), and thereby requiring cryptographers to use larger groups (or different types of groups). RSA&#x27;s security depends (in part) upon the difficulty of integer factorization – a breakthrough in factoring would impact the security of RSA.

In 1980, one could factor a difficult 50-digit number at an expense of 1012 elementary computer operations. By 1984 the state of the art in factoring algorithms had advanced to a point where a 75-digit number could be factored in 1012 operations. Advances in computing technology also meant that the operations could be performed much faster. Moore&#x27;s law predicts that computer speeds will continue to increase. Factoring techniques may continue to do so as well, but will most likely depend on mathematical insight and creativity, neither of which has ever been successfully predictable. 150-digit numbers of the kind once used in RSA have been factored. The effort was greater than above, but was not unreasonable on fast modern computers. By the start of the 21st century, 150-digit numbers were no longer considered a large enough key size for RSA. Numbers with several hundred digits were still considered too hard to factor in 2005, though methods will probably continue to improve over time, requiring key size to keep pace or other methods such as elliptic curve cryptography to be used.

Another distinguishing feature of asymmetric schemes is that, unlike attacks on symmetric cryptosystems, any cryptanalysis has the opportunity to make use of knowledge gained from the public key.

==Attacking cryptographic hash systems==

* Birthday attack
* Hash function security summary
* Rainbow table

==Side-channel attacks==
* Black-bag cryptanalysis
* Man-in-the-middle attack
* Power analysis
* Replay attack
* Rubber-hose cryptanalysis
* Timing analysis

==Quantum computing applications for cryptanalysis==
Quantum computers, which are still in the early phases of research, have potential use in cryptanalysis. For example, Shor&#x27;s Algorithm could factor large numbers in polynomial time, in effect breaking some commonly used forms of public-key encryption.

By using Grover&#x27;s algorithm on a quantum computer, brute-force key search can be made quadratically faster. However, this could be countered by doubling the key length.
