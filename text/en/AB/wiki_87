<text>E-commerce (electronic commerce) refers to commercial activities including the electronic buying or selling products and services which are conducted on online platforms or over the Internet. E-commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. E-commerce is the largest sector of the electronics industry and is in turn driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry.

== Defining e-commerce ==
The term was coined and first employed by Robert Jacobson, Principal Consultant to the California State Assembly&#x27;s Utilities &amp; Commerce Committee, in the title and text of California&#x27;s Electronic Commerce Act, carried by the late Committee Chairwoman Gwen Moore (D-L.A.) and enacted in 1984.

E-commerce typically uses the web for at least a part of a transaction&#x27;s life cycle although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail. Typical e-commerce transactions include the purchase of products (such as books from Amazon) or services (such as music downloads in the form of digital distribution such as the iTunes Store). There are three areas of e-commerce: online retailing, electronic markets, and online auctions. E-commerce is supported by electronic business. The existence value of e-commerce is to allow consumers to shop online and pay online through the Internet, saving the time and space of customers and enterprises, greatly improving transaction efficiency, especially for busy office workers, and also saving a lot of valuable time.

E-commerce businesses may also employ some or all of the following:
* Online shopping for retail sales direct to consumers via web sites and mobile apps, conversational commerce via live chat, chatbots, and voice assistants.
* Providing or participating in online marketplaces, which process third-party business-to-consumer (B2C) or consumer-to-consumer (C2C) sales;
* Business-to-business (B2B) buying and selling.
* Gathering and using demographic data through web contacts and social media.
* B2B electronic data interchange.
* Marketing to prospective and established customers by e-mail or fax (for example, with newsletters).
* Engaging in pretail for launching new products and services.
* Online financial exchanges for currency exchanges or trading purposes.

There are five essential categories of E-commerce:
* Business to Business
* Business to Consumer
* Business to Government
* Consumer to Business
* Consumer to Consumer

== Forms ==
Contemporary electronic commerce can be classified into two categories. The first category is business based on types of goods sold (involves everything from ordering &quot;digital&quot; content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to &quot;meta&quot; services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce). The second category is based on the nature of the participant (B2B, B2C, C2B and C2C).

On the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international business. Data integrity and security are pressing issues for electronic commerce.

Aside from traditional e-commerce, the terms m-Commerce (mobile commerce) as well (around 2013) t-Commerce have also been used.

== Governmental regulation ==
In the United States, California&#x27;s Electronic Commerce Act (1984), enacted by the Legislature, the more recent California Privacy Rights Act (2020), enacted through a popular election proposition and to control specifically how electronic commerce may be conducted in California. In the US in its entirety, electronic commerce activities are regulated more broadly by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These activities include the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and consumer privacy. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The Federal Trade Commission Act regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive. Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumers&#x27; personal information. As a result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.

The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which came into law in 2008, amends the Controlled Substances Act to address online pharmacies.

Conflict of laws in cyberspace is a major hurdle for harmonization of legal framework for e-commerce around the world. In order to give a uniformity to e-commerce law around the world, many countries adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996).

Internationally there is the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN), which was formed in 1991 from an informal network of government customer fair trade organisations. The purpose was stated as being to find ways of co-operating on tackling consumer problems connected with cross-border transactions in both goods and services, and to help ensure exchanges of information among the participants for mutual benefit and understanding. From this came Econsumer.gov, an ICPEN initiative since April 2001. It is a portal to report complaints about online and related transactions with foreign companies.

There is also Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. APEC was established in 1989 with the vision of achieving stability, security and prosperity for the region through free and open trade and investment. APEC has an Electronic Commerce Steering Group as well as working on common privacy regulations throughout the APEC region.

In Australia, trade is covered under Australian Treasury Guidelines for electronic commerce and the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission regulates and offers advice on how to deal with businesses online, and offers specific advice on what happens if things go wrong.

The European Union undertook an extensive enquiry into e-commerce in 2015–16 which observed significant growth in the development of e-commerce, along with some developments which raised concerns, such as increased use of selective distribution systems, which allow manufacturers to control routes to market, and &quot;increased use of contractual restrictions to better control product distribution&quot;. The European Commission felt that some emerging practices might be justified if they could improve the quality of product distribution, but &quot;others may unduly prevent consumers from benefiting from greater product choice and lower prices in e-commerce and therefore warrant Commission action&quot; in order to promote compliance with EU competition rules.

In the United Kingdom, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) was formerly the regulating authority for most aspects of the EU&#x27;s Payment Services Directive (PSD), until its replacement in 2013 by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. The UK implemented the PSD through the Payment Services Regulations 2009 (PSRs), which came into effect on 1 November 2009. The PSR affects firms providing payment services and their customers. These firms include banks, non-bank credit card issuers and non-bank merchant acquirers, e-money issuers, etc. The PSRs created a new class of regulated firms known as payment institutions (PIs), who are subject to prudential requirements. Article 87 of the PSD requires the European Commission to report on the implementation and impact of the PSD by 1 November 2012.

In India, the Information Technology Act 2000 governs the basic applicability of e-commerce.

In China, the Telecommunications Regulations of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (promulgated on 25 September 2000), stipulated the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) as the government department regulating all telecommunications related activities, including electronic commerce. On the same day, the Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services were released, the first administrative regulations to address profit-generating activities conducted through the Internet, and lay the foundation for future regulations governing e-commerce in China. On 28 August 2004, the eleventh session of the tenth NPC Standing Committee adopted an Electronic Signature Law, which regulates data message, electronic signature authentication and legal liability issues. It is considered the first law in China&#x27;s e-commerce legislation. It was a milestone in the course of improving China&#x27;s electronic commerce legislation, and also marks the entering of China&#x27;s rapid development stage for electronic commerce legislation.

==Global trends==
E-commerce has become an important tool for small and large businesses worldwide, not only to sell to customers, but also to engage them.

Cross-border e-Commerce is also an essential field for e-Commerce businesses.  It has responded to the trend of globalization. It shows that numerous firms have opened up new businesses, expanded new markets, and overcome trade barriers; more and more enterprises have started exploring the cross-border cooperation field. In addition, compared with traditional cross-border trade, the information on cross-border e-commerce is more concealed. In the era of globalization, cross-border e-commerce for inter-firm companies means the activities, interactions, or social relations of two or more e-commerce enterprises. However, the success of cross-border e-commerce promotes the development of small and medium-sized firms, and it has finally become a new transaction mode. It has helped the companies solve financial problems and realize the reasonable allocation of resources field. SMEs ( small and medium enterprises) can also precisely match the demand and supply in the market, having the industrial chain majorization and creating more revenues for companies.

In 2012, e-commerce sales topped $1 trillion for the first time in history.

Mobile devices are playing an increasing role in the mix of e-commerce, this is also commonly called mobile commerce, or m-commerce. In 2014, one estimate saw purchases made on mobile devices making up 25% of the market by 2017.

For traditional businesses, one research stated that information technology and cross-border e-commerce is a good opportunity for the rapid development and growth of enterprises. Many companies have invested an enormous volume of investment in mobile applications. The DeLone and McLean Model stated that three perspectives contribute to a successful e-business: information system quality, service quality and users&#x27; satisfaction. There is no limit of time and space, there are more opportunities to reach out to customers around the world, and to cut down unnecessary intermediate links, thereby reducing the cost price, and can benefit from one on one large customer data analysis, to achieve a high degree of personal customization strategic plan, in order to fully enhance the core competitiveness of the products in the company.

Modern 3D graphics technologies, such as Facebook 3D Posts, are considered by some social media marketers and advertisers as a preferable way to promote consumer goods than static photos, and some brands like Sony are already paving the way for augmented reality commerce. Wayfair now lets you inspect a 3D version of its furniture in a home setting before buying.

=== China ===

Among emerging economies, China&#x27;s e-commerce presence continues to expand every year. With 668 million Internet users as of 2014, China&#x27;s online shopping sales reached $253 billion in the first half of 2015, accounting for 10% of total Chinese consumer retail sales in that period. The Chinese retailers have been able to help consumers feel more comfortable shopping online. e-commerce transactions between China and other countries increased 32% to 2.3 trillion yuan ($375.8 billion) in 2012 and accounted for 9.6% of China&#x27;s total international trade. In 2013, Alibaba had an e-commerce market share of 80% in China. In 2014, Alibaba still dominated the B2B marketplace in China with a market share of 44.82%, followed by several other companies including Made-in-China.com at 3.21%, and GlobalSources.com at 2.98%, with the total transaction value of China&#x27;s B2B market exceeding 4.5 billion yuan.

China is also the largest e-commerce market in the world by value of sales, with an estimated in 2016. It accounted for 42.4% of worldwide retail e-commerce in that year, the most of any country. Research shows that Chinese consumer motivations are different enough from Western audiences to require unique e-commerce app designs instead of simply porting Western apps into the Chinese market.

The expansion of e-commerce in China has resulted in the development of Taobao villages, clusters of e-commerce businesses operating in rural areas. Because Taobao villages have increased the incomes or rural people and entrepreneurship in rural China, Taobao villages have become a component of rural revitalization strategies.

In 2015, the State Council promoted the Internet Plus initiative, a five-year plan to integrate traditional manufacturing and service industries with big data, cloud computing, and Internet of things technology. The State Council provided support for Internet Plus through policy support in area including cross-border e-commerce and rural e-commerce.

In 2019, the city of Hangzhou established a pilot program artificial intelligence-based Internet Court to adjudicate disputes related to e-commerce and internet-related intellectual property claims.

=== Europe ===
In 2010, the United Kingdom had the highest per capita e-commerce spending in the world. As of 2013, the Czech Republic was the European country where e-commerce delivers the biggest contribution to the enterprises&#x27; total revenue. Almost a quarter (24%) of the country&#x27;s total turnover is generated via the online channel.

=== Arab states ===
The rate of growth of the number of internet users in the Arab countries has been rapid – 13.1% in 2015. A significant portion of the e-commerce market in the Middle East comprises people in the 30–34 year age group. Egypt has the largest number of internet users in the region, followed by Saudi Arabia and Morocco; these constitute 3/4th of the region&#x27;s share. Yet, internet penetration is low: 35% in Egypt and 65% in Saudi Arabia.

The Gulf Cooperation Council countries have a rapidly growing market and are characterized by a population that becomes wealthier (Yuldashev). As such, retailers have launched Arabic-language websites as a means to target this population. Secondly, there are predictions of increased mobile purchases and an expanding internet audience (Yuldashev). The growth and development of the two aspects make the GCC countries become larger players in the electronic commerce market with time progress. Specifically, research shows that the e-commerce market is expected to grow to over $20 billion by 2020 among these GCC countries (Yuldashev). The e-commerce market has also gained much popularity among western countries, and in particular Europe and the U.S. These countries have been highly characterized by consumer-packaged goods (CPG) (Geisler, 34). However, trends show that there are future signs of a reverse. Similar to the GCC countries, there has been increased purchase of goods and services in online channels rather than offline channels. Activist investors are trying hard to consolidate and slash their overall cost and the governments in western countries continue to impose more regulation on CPG manufacturers (Geisler, 36). In these senses, CPG investors are being forced to adapt to e-commerce as it is effective as well as a means for them to thrive.

The future trends in the GCC countries will be similar to that of the western countries. Despite the forces that push business to adapt e-commerce as a means to sell goods and products, the manner in which customers make purchases is similar in countries from these two regions. For instance, there has been an increased usage of smartphones which comes in conjunction with an increase in the overall internet audience from the regions. Yuldashev writes that consumers are scaling up to more modern technology that allows for mobile marketing.
However, the percentage of smartphone and internet users who make online purchases is expected to vary in the first few years. It will be independent on the willingness of the people to adopt this new trend (The Statistics Portal). For example, UAE has the greatest smartphone penetration of 73.8 per cent and has 91.9 per cent of its population has access to the internet. On the other hand, smartphone penetration in Europe has been reported to be at 64.7 per cent (The Statistics Portal). Regardless, the disparity in percentage between these regions is expected to level out in future because e-commerce technology is expected to grow to allow for more users.

The e-commerce business within these two regions will result in competition. Government bodies at the country level will enhance their measures and strategies to ensure sustainability and consumer protection (Krings, et al.). These increased measures will raise the environmental and social standards in the countries, factors that will determine the success of the e-commerce market in these countries. For example, an adoption of tough sanctions will make it difficult for companies to enter the e-commerce market while lenient sanctions will allow ease of companies. As such, the future trends between GCC countries and the Western countries will be independent of these sanctions (Krings, et al.). These countries need to make rational conclusions in coming up with effective sanctions.

=== India ===

India has an Internet user base of about 460 million as of December 2017. Despite being the third largest user base in the world, the penetration of the Internet is low compared to markets like the United States, United Kingdom or France but is growing at a much faster rate, adding around six million new entrants every month. In India, cash on delivery is the most preferred payment method, accumulating 75% of the e-retail activities. The India retail market is expected to rise from 2.5% in 2016 to 5% in 2020.

=== Brazil ===
In 2013, Brazil&#x27;s e-commerce was growing quickly with retail e-commerce sales expected to grow at a double-digit pace through 2014. By 2016, eMarketer expected retail e-commerce sales in Brazil to reach $17.3 billion.

== Logistics ==
Logistics in e-commerce mainly concerns fulfillment. Online markets and retailers have to find the best possible way to fill orders and deliver products. Small companies usually control their own logistic operation because they do not have the ability to hire an outside company. Most large companies hire a fulfillment service that takes care of a company&#x27;s logistic needs. The optimization of logistics processes that contains long-term investment in an efficient storage infrastructure system and adoption of inventory management strategies is crucial to prioritize customer satisfaction throughout the entire process, from order placement to final delivery. 

==Impacts==
===Impact on markets and retailers===

E-commerce markets are growing at noticeable rates. The online market is expected to grow by 56% in 2015–2020. In 2017, retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted to 2.3 trillion US dollars and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to 4.891 trillion US dollars in 2021. Traditional markets are only expected 2% growth during the same time. Brick and mortar retailers are struggling because of online retailer&#x27;s ability to offer lower prices and higher efficiency. Many larger retailers are able to maintain a presence offline and online by linking physical and online offerings.

E-commerce allows customers to overcome geographical barriers and allows them to purchase products anytime and from anywhere. Online and traditional markets have different strategies for conducting business. Traditional retailers offer fewer assortment of products because of shelf space where, online retailers often hold no inventory but send customer orders directly to the manufacturer. The pricing strategies are also different for traditional and online retailers. Traditional retailers base their prices on store traffic and the cost to keep inventory. Online retailers base prices on the speed of delivery.

There are two ways for marketers to conduct business through e-commerce: fully online or online along with a brick and mortar store. Online marketers can offer lower prices, greater product selection, and high efficiency rates. Many customers prefer online markets if the products can be delivered quickly at relatively low price. However, online retailers cannot offer the physical experience that traditional retailers can. It can be difficult to judge the quality of a product without the physical experience, which may cause customers to experience product or seller uncertainty. Another issue regarding the online market is concerns about the security of online transactions. Many customers remain loyal to well-known retailers because of this issue.

Security is a primary problem for e-commerce in developed and developing countries. E-commerce security is protecting businesses&#x27; websites and customers from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. The type of threats include: malicious codes, unwanted programs (ad ware, spyware), phishing, hacking, and cyber vandalism. E-commerce websites use different tools to avert security threats. These tools include firewalls, encryption software, digital certificates, and passwords.

===Impact on supply chain management===
For a long time, companies had been troubled by the gap between the benefits which supply chain technology has and the solutions to deliver those benefits. However, the emergence of e-commerce has provided a more practical and effective way of delivering the benefits of the new supply chain technologies.

E-commerce has the capability to integrate all inter-company and intra-company functions, meaning that the three flows (physical flow, financial flow and information flow) of the supply chain could be also affected by e-commerce. The affections on physical flows improved the way of product and inventory movement level for companies. For the information flows, e-commerce optimized the capacity of information processing than companies used to have, and for the financial flows, e-commerce allows companies to have more efficient payment and settlement solutions.

In addition, e-commerce has a more sophisticated level of impact on supply chains: Firstly, the performance gap will be eliminated since companies can identify gaps between different levels of supply chains by electronic means of solutions; Secondly, as a result of e-commerce emergence, new capabilities such implementing ERP systems, like SAP ERP, Xero, or Megaventory, have helped companies to manage operations with customers and suppliers. Yet these new capabilities are still not fully exploited. Thirdly, technology companies would keep investing on new e-commerce software solutions as they are expecting investment return. Fourthly, e-commerce would help to solve many aspects of issues that companies may feel difficult to cope with, such as political barriers or cross-country changes. Finally, e-commerce provides companies a more efficient and effective way to collaborate with each other within the supply chain.

=== Impact on employment ===
E-commerce helps create new job opportunities due to information related services, software app and digital products. It also causes job losses. The areas with the greatest predicted job-loss are retail, postal, and travel agencies. The development of e-commerce will create jobs that require highly skilled workers to manage large amounts of information, customer demands, and production processes. In contrast, people with poor technical skills cannot enjoy the wages welfare. On the other hand, because e-commerce requires sufficient stocks that could be delivered to customers in time, the warehouse becomes an important element. Warehouse needs more staff to manage, supervise and organize, thus the condition of warehouse environment will be concerned by employees.

=== Impact on customers ===
E-commerce brings convenience for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse websites online, especially for buying products which are not sold in nearby shops. It could help customers buy a wider range of products and save customers&#x27; time. Consumers also gain power through online shopping. They are able to research products and compare prices among retailers. Thanks to the practice of user-generated ratings and reviews from companies like Bazaarvoice, Trustpilot, and Yelp, customers can also see what other people think of a product, and decide before buying if they want to spend money on it. Also, online shopping often provides sales promotion or discounts code, thus it is more price effective for customers. Moreover, e-commerce provides products&#x27; detailed information; even the in-store staff cannot offer such detailed explanation. Customers can also review and track the order history online.

E-commerce technologies cut transaction costs by allowing both manufactures and consumers to skip through the intermediaries. This is achieved through by extending the search area best price deals and by group purchase. The success of e-commerce in urban and regional levels depend on how the local firms and consumers have adopted to e-commerce.

However, e-commerce lacks human interaction for customers, especially who prefer face-to-face connection. Customers are also concerned with the security of online transactions and tend to remain loyal to well-known retailers. In recent years, clothing retailers such as Tommy Hilfiger have started adding Virtual Fit platforms to their e-commerce sites to reduce the risk of customers buying the wrong sized clothes, although these vary greatly in their fit for purpose. When the customer regret the purchase of a product, it involves returning goods and refunding process. This process is inconvenient as customers need to pack and post the goods. If the products are expensive, large or fragile, it refers to safety issues.

=== Impact on the environment ===
In 2018, E-commerce generated of container cardboard in North America, an increase from ) in 2017. Only 35 percent of North American cardboard manufacturing capacity is from recycled content. The recycling rate in Europe is 80 percent and Asia is 93 percent. Amazon, the largest user of boxes, has a strategy to cut back on packing material and has reduced packaging material used by 19 percent by weight since 2016. Amazon is requiring retailers to manufacture their product packaging in a way that does not require additional shipping packaging. Amazon also has an 85-person team researching ways to reduce and improve their packaging and shipping materials.

Accelerated movement of packages around the world includes accelerated movement of living things, with all its attendant risks. Weeds, pests, and diseases all sometimes travel in packages of seeds. Some of these packages are part of brushing manipulation of e-commerce reviews.

=== Impact on traditional retail ===
E-commerce has been cited as a major force for the failure of major U.S. retailers in a trend frequently referred to as a &quot;retail apocalypse.&quot; The rise of e-commerce outlets like Amazon has made it harder for traditional retailers to attract customers to their stores and forced companies to change their sales strategies. Many companies have turned to sales promotions and increased digital efforts to lure shoppers while shutting down brick-and-mortar locations. The trend has forced some traditional retailers to shutter its brick and mortar operations.

== E-commerce during COVID-19 ==

In March 2020, global retail website traffic hit 14.3 billion visits signifying an unprecedented growth of e-commerce during the lockdown of 2020. Later studies show that online sales increased by 25% and online grocery shopping increased by over 100% during the crisis in the United States. Meanwhile, as many as 29% of surveyed shoppers state that they will never go back to shopping in person again; in the UK, 43% of consumers state that they expect to keep on shopping the same way even after the lockdown is over.

Retail sales of e-commerce shows that COVID-19 has a significant impact on e-commerce and its sales are expected to reach $6.5 trillion by 2023.

<text>Euler&#x27;s formula, named after Leonhard Euler, is a mathematical formula in complex analysis that establishes the fundamental relationship between the trigonometric functions and the complex exponential function. Euler&#x27;s formula states that, for any real number , one has
formula_1
where is the base of the natural logarithm, is the imaginary unit, and and are the trigonometric functions cosine and sine respectively. This complex exponential function is sometimes denoted (&quot;cosine plus &quot;i&quot; sine&quot;). The formula is still valid if is a complex number, and is also called &quot;Euler&#x27;s formula&quot; in this more general case.

Euler&#x27;s formula is ubiquitous in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering. The physicist Richard Feynman called the equation &quot;our jewel&quot; and &quot;the most remarkable formula in mathematics&quot;.

When , Euler&#x27;s formula may be rewritten as or , which is known as Euler&#x27;s identity.

==History==
In 1714, the English mathematician Roger Cotes presented a geometrical argument that can be interpreted (after correcting a misplaced factor of formula_2) as:
formula_3
Exponentiating this equation yields Euler&#x27;s formula. Note that the logarithmic statement is not universally correct for complex numbers, since a complex logarithm can have infinitely many values, differing by multiples of .

Around 1740 Leonhard Euler turned his attention to the exponential function and derived the equation named after him by comparing the series expansions of the exponential and trigonometric expressions. The formula was first published in 1748 in his foundational work &quot;Introductio in analysin infinitorum&quot;.

Johann Bernoulli had found that
formula_4

And since
formula_5
the above equation tells us something about complex logarithms by relating natural logarithms to imaginary (complex) numbers. Bernoulli, however, did not evaluate the integral.

Bernoulli&#x27;s correspondence with Euler (who also knew the above equation) shows that Bernoulli did not fully understand complex logarithms. Euler also suggested that complex logarithms can have infinitely many values.

The view of complex numbers as points in the complex plane was described about 50 years later by Caspar Wessel.

==Definitions of complex exponentiation==
The exponential function for real values of may be defined in a few different equivalent ways (see Characterizations of the exponential function). Several of these methods may be directly extended to give definitions of for complex values of simply by substituting in place of and using the complex algebraic operations. In particular, we may use any of the three following definitions, which are equivalent. From a more advanced perspective, each of these definitions may be interpreted as giving the unique analytic continuation of to the complex plane.

===Differential equation definition===

The exponential function formula_6 is the unique differentiable function of a complex variable for which the derivative equals the function formula_7 and formula_8

===Power series definition===
For complex 
formula_9

Using the ratio test, it is possible to show that this power series has an infinite radius of convergence and so defines for all complex .

===Limit definition===
For complex 
formula_10

Here, is restricted to positive integers, so there is no question about what the power with exponent means.

==Proofs==
Various proofs of the formula are possible.

===Using differentiation===
This proof shows that the quotient of the trigonometric and exponential expressions is the constant function one, so they must be equal (the exponential function is never zero, so this is permitted).

Consider the function 
formula_11
for real . Differentiating gives by the product rule
formula_12
Thus, is a constant. Since , then for all real , and thus 
formula_13

===Using power series===
Here is a proof of Euler&#x27;s formula using power-series expansions, as well as basic facts about the powers of :
formula_14

Using now the power-series definition from above, we see that for real values of 
formula_15
where in the last step we recognize the two terms are the Maclaurin series for and . The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is absolutely convergent.

===Using polar coordinates===
Another proof is based on the fact that all complex numbers can be expressed in polar coordinates. Therefore, for some and depending on ,
formula_16
No assumptions are being made about and ; they will be determined in the course of the proof. From any of the definitions of the exponential function it can be shown that the derivative of is . Therefore, differentiating both sides gives
formula_17
Substituting for and equating real and imaginary parts in this formula gives and . Thus, is a constant, and is for some constant . The initial values and come from , giving and . This proves the formula
formula_18

==Applications==

===Applications in complex number theory===
==== Interpretation of the formula ====
This formula can be interpreted as saying that the function is a unit complex number, i.e., it traces out the unit circle in the complex plane as ranges through the real numbers. Here is the angle that a line connecting the origin with a point on the unit circle makes with the positive real axis, measured counterclockwise and in radians.

The original proof is based on the Taylor series expansions of the exponential function (where is a complex number) and of and for real numbers (see above). In fact, the same proof shows that Euler&#x27;s formula is even valid for all &quot;complex&quot; numbers .

A point in the complex plane can be represented by a complex number written in cartesian coordinates. Euler&#x27;s formula provides a means of conversion between cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates. The polar form simplifies the mathematics when used in multiplication or powers of complex numbers. Any complex number , and its complex conjugate, , can be written as
formula_19
where
* is the real part,
* is the imaginary part,
* is the magnitude of and

 is the argument of , i.e., the angle between the &quot;x&quot; axis and the vector &quot;z&quot; measured counterclockwise in radians, which is defined up to addition of . Many texts write instead of , but the first equation needs adjustment when . This is because for any real and , not both zero, the angles of the vectors and differ by radians, but have the identical value of .

==== Use of the formula to define the logarithm of complex numbers ====
Now, taking this derived formula, we can use Euler&#x27;s formula to define the logarithm of a complex number. To do this, we also use the definition of the logarithm (as the inverse operator of exponentiation):
formula_20
and that
formula_21
both valid for any complex numbers and . Therefore, one can write:
formula_22
for any . Taking the logarithm of both sides shows that
formula_23
and in fact, this can be used as the definition for the complex logarithm. The logarithm of a complex number is thus a multi-valued function, because is multi-valued.

Finally, the other exponential law
formula_24
which can be seen to hold for all integers , together with Euler&#x27;s formula, implies several trigonometric identities, as well as de Moivre&#x27;s formula.

==== Relationship to trigonometry ====

Euler&#x27;s formula, the definitions of the trigonometric functions and the standard identities for exponentials are sufficient to easily derive most trigonometric identities. It provides a powerful connection between analysis and trigonometry, and provides an interpretation of the sine and cosine functions as weighted sums of the exponential function:
formula_25

The two equations above can be derived by adding or subtracting Euler&#x27;s formulas:
formula_26
and solving for either cosine or sine.

These formulas can even serve as the definition of the trigonometric functions for complex arguments . For example, letting , we have:
formula_27

In addition
formula_28

Complex exponentials can simplify trigonometry, because they are mathematically easier to manipulate than their sine and cosine components. One technique is simply to convert sines and cosines into equivalent expressions in terms of exponentials sometimes called &quot;complex sinusoids&quot;. After the manipulations, the simplified result is still real-valued. For example:

formula_29

Another technique is to represent sines and cosines in terms of the real part of a complex expression and perform the manipulations on the complex expression. For example:
formula_30

This formula is used for recursive generation of for integer values of and arbitrary (in radians).

Considering a parameter in equation above yields recursive formula for Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.

===Topological interpretation===

In the language of topology, Euler&#x27;s formula states that the imaginary exponential function formula_31 is a (surjective) morphism of topological groups from the real line formula_32 to the unit circle formula_33. In fact, this exhibits formula_32 as a covering space of formula_33. Similarly, Euler&#x27;s identity says that the kernel of this map is formula_36, where formula_37. These observations may be combined and summarized in the commutative diagram below:

===Other applications===
In differential equations, the function is often used to simplify solutions, even if the final answer is a real function involving sine and cosine. The reason for this is that the exponential function is the eigenfunction of the operation of differentiation.

In electrical engineering, signal processing, and similar fields, signals that vary periodically over time are often described as a combination of sinusoidal functions (see Fourier analysis), and these are more conveniently expressed as the sum of exponential functions with imaginary exponents, using Euler&#x27;s formula. Also, phasor analysis of circuits can include Euler&#x27;s formula to represent the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor.

In the four-dimensional space of quaternions, there is a sphere of imaginary units. For any point on this sphere, and a real number, Euler&#x27;s formula applies:
formula_38
and the element is called a versor in quaternions. The set of all versors forms a 3-sphere in the 4-space.

==Other special cases==
The special cases that evaluate to units illustrate rotation around the complex unit circle:

The special case at (where , one turn) yields . This is also argued to link five fundamental constants with three basic arithmetic operations, but, unlike Euler&#x27;s identity, without rearranging the addends from the general case:
formula_39
An interpretation of the simplified form is that rotating by a full turn is an identity function.

<doc id="9615" wikidata="Q40599" url="?curid=9615" title="Édouard Manet">
<text>Édouard Manet (, ; ; 23 January 1832 – 30 April 1883) was a French modernist painter. He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, as well as a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.

Born into an upper-class household with strong political connections, Manet rejected the naval career originally envisioned for him; he became engrossed in the world of painting. His early masterworks, &quot;The Luncheon on the Grass&quot; (&quot;Le déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;) or &quot;Olympia&quot;, &quot;premiering&quot; in 1863 and &#x27;65, respectively, caused great controversy with both critics and the Academy of Fine Arts, but soon were praised by progressive artists as the breakthrough acts to the new style, Impressionism. These works, along with others, are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of modern art. The last 20 years of Manet&#x27;s life saw him form bonds with other great artists of the time; he developed his own simple and direct style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.

==Early life==

Édouard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832, in the ancestral hôtel particulier (mansion) on the Rue des Petits Augustins (now Rue Bonaparte) to an affluent and well-connected family. He had two younger brothers, Eugène (born 1833) and Gustave (born 1835). His mother, Eugénie-Desirée Fournier, was the daughter of a diplomat and goddaughter of the Swedish crown prince Charles Bernadotte, from whom the Swedish monarchs are descended. His father, Auguste Manet, was a French judge who expected Édouard to pursue a career in law. His uncle, Edmond Fournier, encouraged him to pursue painting and took young Manet to the Louvre. In 1844, he enrolled at secondary school, the Collège Rollin, where he boarded until 1848. He showed little academic talent and was generally unhappy at the school. In 1845, at the advice of his uncle, Manet enrolled in a special course of drawing where he met Antonin Proust, future Minister of Fine Arts and his lifelong friend.

At his father&#x27;s suggestion, in 1848 he sailed on a training vessel to Rio de Janeiro. After he twice failed the examination to join the Navy, his father relented to his wishes to pursue an art education. From 1850 to 1856, Manet studied under the academic painter Thomas Couture. Couture encouraged his students to paint contemporary life, though he would eventually be horrified by Manet&#x27;s choice of lower-class and &quot;degenerate&quot; subjects such as &quot;The Absinthe Drinker&quot;. In his spare time, Manet copied Old Masters such as Diego Velázquez and Titian in the Louvre.

From 1853 to 1856, Manet made brief visits to Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, during which time he was influenced by the Dutch painter Frans Hals and the Spanish artists Velázquez and Francisco José de Goya.

==Career==
In 1856, Manet opened a studio. His style in this period was characterized by loose brush strokes, simplification of details, and the suppression of transitional tones. Adopting the current style of realism initiated by Gustave Courbet, he painted &quot;The Absinthe Drinker&quot; (1858–59) and other contemporary subjects such as beggars, singers, Romani, people in cafés, and bullfights. After his early career, he rarely painted religious, mythological, or historical subjects; religious paintings from 1864 include his &quot;Jesus Mocked by the Soldiers&quot; and &quot;The Dead Christ with Angels&quot;.

Manet had two canvases accepted at the Salon in 1861. A portrait of his mother and father (&quot;Portrait of Monsieur and Madame Manet&quot;), the latter of whom at the time was paralysed by a stroke or advanced syphilis, was ill-received by critics. The other, &quot;The Spanish Singer&quot;, was admired by Théophile Gautier, and placed in a more conspicuous location as a result of its popularity with Salon-goers. Manet&#x27;s work, which appeared &quot;slightly slapdash&quot; when compared with the meticulous style of so many other Salon paintings, intrigued some young artists and brought new business to his studio. According to one contemporary source, &quot;The Spanish Singer&quot;, painted in a &quot;strange new fashion[,] caused many painters&#x27; eyes to open and their jaws to drop.&quot;

===&quot;Music in the Tuileries&quot;===
In 1862, Manet exhibited &quot;Music in the Tuileries&quot; (probably painted in 1860), one of his first masterpieces. With its portrayal of a crowd of subjects at the Jardin des Tuileries, the painting shows the outdoor leisure of contemporary Paris, which would be a lifelong subject of Manet&#x27;s. Among the figures in the gardens are the poet Charles Baudelaire, the musician Jacques Offenbach, and others of Manet&#x27;s family and friends, including a self-portrait of the artist.

&quot;Music in the Tuileries&quot; received substantial critical and public attention, most of it negative. In the words of one Manet biographer, &quot;it is difficult for us to imagine the kind of fury &quot;Music in the Tuileries&quot; provoked when it was exhibited&quot;. By portraying Manet&#x27;s social circle instead of classical heroes, historical icons, or gods, the painting could be interpreted as challenging the value of those subjects or as an attempt to elevate his contemporaries to the same level. The public, accustomed to the finely detailed brushwork of historical painters such as Ernest Meissonier, thought Manet&#x27;s thick brushstrokes looked crude and unfinished. Angered by the subject matter and technique, several visitors even threatened to destroy the painting. One of Manet&#x27;s idols, Eugène Delacroix, was one of the painting&#x27;s few defenders. Despite the largely negative reaction, the controversy made Manet a well-known name in Paris.

===&quot;Luncheon on the Grass &quot;(&quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;)===
Another major early work is &quot;The Luncheon on the Grass (Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe)&quot;, originally &quot;Le Bain&quot;. The Paris Salon rejected it for exhibition in 1863, but Manet agreed to exhibit it at the Salon des Refusés (Salon of the Rejected). This parallel salon was initiated by Emperor Napoleon III as a solution to the public outcry after the official salon&#x27;s Selection Committee only accepted 2,217 paintings out of more than 5,000 submissions. It gave rejected artists the opportunity to display their paintings if they chose.

The painting&#x27;s juxtaposition of fully dressed men and a nude woman was controversial, as was its abbreviated, sketch-like handling, an innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. One critic stated that the brushwork appeared to have been done with a &quot;floor mop&quot;. However, others such as his friend Antonin Proust celebrated the painting, and novelist Émile Zola was so affected by the experience of viewing it that he later based the title painting in his novel &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre&quot; (&quot;The Work of Art&quot;) on &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;.

At the same time, Manet&#x27;s composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi&#x27;s engraving of the &quot;Judgement of Paris&quot; () based on a drawing by Raphael. Two additional works cited by scholars as important precedents for are &quot;Pastoral Concert&quot; () and &quot;The Tempest&quot;, both of which are attributed variously to Italian Renaissance masters Giorgione or Titian.

&quot;Le Déjeuner&quot; and James McNeill Whistler&#x27;s &quot;Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl&quot; were the two most discussed works of the Salon des Refusés, which itself would become one of the most famous art exhibitions of all time. Following the Salon, Manet became yet more notorious and widely discussed. However, &quot;Le Déjeuner sur l&#x27;herbe&quot; and Manet&#x27;s other paintings still failed to sell, and Manet continued living off of his inheritance from his recently deceased father.

===&quot;Olympia&quot;===
As he had in &quot;Luncheon on the Grass&quot;, Manet again paraphrased a respected work by a Renaissance artist in the painting &quot;Olympia&quot; (1863), a nude portrayed in a style reminiscent of early studio photographs, but whose pose was based on Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot; (1538). The painting is also reminiscent of Francisco Goya&#x27;s painting &quot;The Nude Maja&quot; (1800).

Manet embarked on the canvas after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display. His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to Antonin Proust, &quot;only the precautions taken by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn&quot; by offended viewers. The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her nakedness, sexuality, and comfortable courtesan lifestyle. The orchid, upswept hair, black cat, and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus&#x27; body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting&#x27;s lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting&#x27;s flatness, inspired by Japanese wood block art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous. A fully dressed black servant is featured, exploiting the then-current theory that black people were hyper-sexed. That she is wearing the clothing of a servant to a courtesan here furthers the sexual tension of the piece.

Olympia&#x27;s body as well as her gaze is unabashedly confrontational. She defiantly looks out as her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the reference to traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously absent in this work. A contemporary critic denounced Olympia&#x27;s &quot;shamelessly flexed&quot; left hand, which seemed to him a mockery of the relaxed, shielding hand of Titian&#x27;s Venus. Likewise, the alert black cat at the foot of the bed strikes a sexually rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian&#x27;s portrayal of the goddess in his &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot;.

&quot;Olympia&quot; was the subject of caricatures in the popular press, but was championed by the French avant-garde community, and the painting&#x27;s significance was appreciated by artists such as Gustave Courbet, Paul Cézanne, Claude Monet, and later Paul Gauguin.

As with &quot;Luncheon on the Grass&quot;, the painting raised the issue of prostitution within contemporary France and the roles of women within society.

===Life and times===
After the death of his father in 1862, Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff in 1863 at a Protestant church. Leenhoff was a Dutch-born piano teacher two years Manet&#x27;s senior with whom he had been romantically involved for approximately ten years. Leenhoff initially had been employed by Manet&#x27;s father, Auguste, to teach Manet and his younger brother piano. She also may have been Auguste&#x27;s mistress. In 1852, Leenhoff gave birth, out of wedlock, to a son, Leon Koella Leenhoff.

Manet painted his wife in &quot;The Reading&quot;, among other paintings. Her son, Leon Leenhoff, whose father may have been either of the Manets, posed often for Manet. Most famously, he is the subject of the &quot;Boy Carrying a Sword&quot; of 1861 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). He also appears as the boy carrying a tray in the background of &quot;The Balcony&quot; (1868–69).

Manet became friends with the Impressionists Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Paul Cézanne, and Camille Pissarro through another painter, Berthe Morisot, who was a member of the group and drew him into their activities. They later became widely known as the Batignolles group (Le groupe des Batignolles).

The supposed grand-niece of the painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Morisot had her first painting accepted in the Salon de Paris in 1864, and she continued to show in the salon for the next ten years.

Manet became the friend and colleague of Morisot in 1868. She is credited with convincing Manet to attempt plein air painting, which she had been practicing since she was introduced to it by another friend of hers, Camille Corot. They had a reciprocating relationship and Manet incorporated some of her techniques into his paintings. In 1874, she became his sister-in-law when she married his brother, Eugène. It has been speculated that there was a repressed love between Manet and Morisot, exemplified by the numerous portraits he did of her before she married his brother.

Unlike the core Impressionist group, Manet maintained that modern artists should seek to exhibit at the Paris Salon rather than abandon it in favor of independent exhibitions. Nevertheless, when Manet was excluded from the International Exhibition of 1867, he set up his own exhibition. His mother worried that he would waste all his inheritance on this project, which was enormously expensive. While the exhibition earned poor reviews from the major critics, it also provided his first contacts with several future Impressionist painters, including Degas.

Although his own work influenced and anticipated the Impressionist style, Manet resisted involvement in Impressionist exhibitions, partly because he did not wish to be seen as the representative of a group identity, and partly because he preferred to exhibit at the Salon. Eva Gonzalès, a daughter of the novelist Emmanuel Gonzalès, was his only formal student.

He was influenced by the Impressionists, especially Monet and Morisot. Their influence is seen in Manet&#x27;s use of lighter colors: after the early 1870s he made less use of dark backgrounds but retained his distinctive use of black, uncharacteristic of Impressionist painting. He painted many outdoor (plein air) pieces, but always returned to what he considered the serious work of the studio.

Manet enjoyed a close friendship with composer Emmanuel Chabrier, painting two portraits of him; the musician owned 14 of Manet&#x27;s paintings and dedicated his &quot;Impromptu&quot; to Manet&#x27;s wife.

One of Manet&#x27;s frequent models at the beginning of the 1880s was the &quot;semimondaine&quot; Méry Laurent, who posed for seven portraits in pastel. Laurent&#x27;s salons hosted many French (and even American) writers and painters of her time; Manet had connections and influence through such events.

Throughout his life, although resisted by art critics, Manet could number as his champions Émile Zola, who supported him publicly in the press, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Charles Baudelaire, who challenged him to depict life as it was. Manet, in turn, drew or painted each of them.

=== Café scenes ===
Manet&#x27;s paintings of café scenes are observations of social life in 19th-century Paris. People are depicted drinking beer, listening to music, flirting, reading, or waiting. Many of these paintings were based on sketches executed on the spot. Manet often visited the Brasserie Reichshoffen on boulevard de Rochechourt, upon which he based &quot;At the Cafe&quot; in 1878. Several people are at the bar, and one woman confronts the viewer while others wait to be served. Such depictions represent the painted journal of a flâneur. These are painted in a style which is loose, referencing Hals and Velázquez, yet they capture the mood and feeling of Parisian night life. They are painted snapshots of bohemianism, urban working people, as well as some of the bourgeoisie.

In &quot;Corner of a Café-Concert&quot;, a man smokes while behind him a waitress serves drinks. In &quot;The Beer Drinkers&quot; a woman enjoys her beer in the company of a friend. In &quot;The Café-Concert&quot;, shown at right, a sophisticated gentleman sits at a bar while a waitress stands resolutely in the background, sipping her drink. In &quot;The Waitress&quot;, a serving woman pauses for a moment behind a seated customer smoking a pipe, while a ballet dancer, with arms extended as she is about to turn, is on stage in the background.

Manet also sat at the restaurant on the Avenue de Clichy called Pere Lathuille&#x27;s, which had a garden in addition to the dining area. One of the paintings he produced here was &quot;Chez le père Lathuille&quot; (At Pere Lathuille&#x27;s), in which a man displays an unrequited interest in a woman dining near him.

In &quot;Le Bon Bock&quot; (1873), a large, cheerful, bearded man sits with a pipe in one hand and a glass of beer in the other, looking straight at the viewer.

===Paintings of social activities===
Manet painted the upper class enjoying more formal social activities. In &quot;Masked Ball at the Opera&quot;, Manet shows a lively crowd of people enjoying a party. Men stand with top hats and long black suits while talking to women with masks and costumes. He included portraits of his friends in this picture.

His 1868 painting &quot;The Luncheon&quot; was posed in the dining room of the Manet house.

Manet depicted other popular activities in his work. In &quot;The Races at Longchamp&quot;, an unusual perspective is employed to underscore the furious energy of racehorses as they rush toward the viewer. In &quot;Skating&quot;, Manet shows a well dressed woman in the foreground, while others skate behind her. Always there is the sense of active urban life continuing behind the subject, extending outside the frame of the canvas.

In &quot;View of the International Exhibition&quot;, soldiers relax, seated and standing, prosperous couples are talking. There is a gardener, a boy with a dog, a woman on horseback—in short, a sample of the classes and ages of the people of Paris.

===War===
Manet&#x27;s response to modern life included works devoted to war, in subjects that may be seen as updated interpretations of the genre of &quot;history painting&quot;. The first such work was &quot;The Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama&quot; (1864), a sea skirmish known as the &quot;Battle of Cherbourg&quot; from the American Civil War which took place off the French coast, and may have been witnessed by the artist.

Of interest next was the French intervention in Mexico; from 1867 to 1869 Manet painted three versions of the &quot;Execution of Emperor Maximilian&quot;, an event which raised concerns regarding French foreign and domestic policy. The several versions of the &quot;Execution&quot; are among Manet&#x27;s largest paintings, which suggests that the theme was one which the painter regarded as most important. Its subject is the execution by Mexican firing squad of a Habsburg emperor who had been installed by Napoleon III. Neither the paintings nor a lithograph of the subject were permitted to be shown in France. As an indictment of formalized slaughter, the paintings look back to Goya, and anticipate Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;.

During the Franco-Prussian War, Manet served in the National Guard to help defend the city during the siege of Paris, along with Degas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manet/Degas&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1871, he traveled to Oloron-Sainte-Marie in the Pyrenees. In his absence his friends added his name to the &quot;Fédération des artistes&quot; (see: Courbet) of the Paris Commune. Manet stayed away from Paris, perhaps, until after the &quot;semaine sanglante&quot;: in a letter to Berthe Morisot at Cherbourg (10 June 1871) he writes, &quot;We came back to Paris a few days ago...&quot; (the semaine sanglante ended on 28 May).

The prints and drawings collection of the Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest) has a watercolour/gouache by Manet, &quot;The Barricade&quot;, depicting a summary execution of Communards by Versailles troops based on a lithograph of the execution of Maximilian. A similar piece, &quot;The Barricade&quot; (oil on plywood), is held by a private collector.

On 18 March 1871, he wrote to his (confederate) friend Félix Bracquemond in Paris about his visit to Bordeaux, the provisional seat of the French National Assembly of the Third French Republic where Émile Zola introduced him to the sites: &quot;I never imagined that France could be represented by such doddering old fools, not excepting that little twit Thiers...&quot; If this could be interpreted as support of the Commune, a following letter to Bracquemond (21 March 1871) expressed his idea more clearly: &quot;Only party hacks and the ambitious, the Henrys of this world following on the heels of the Milliéres, the grotesque imitators of the Commune of 1793&quot;. He knew the communard Lucien Henry to have been a former painter&#x27;s model and Millière, an insurance agent. &quot;What an encouragement all these bloodthirsty caperings are for the arts! But there is at least one consolation in our misfortunes: that we&#x27;re not politicians and have no desire to be elected as deputies&quot;.

The public figure Manet admired most was the republican Léon Gambetta. In the heat of the &quot;seize mai&quot; coup in 1877, Manet opened up his atelier to a republican electoral meeting chaired by Gambetta&#x27;s friend Eugène Spuller.

===Paris===
Manet depicted many scenes of the streets of Paris in his works. &quot;The Rue Mosnier Decked with Flags&quot; depicts red, white, and blue pennants covering buildings on either side of the street; another painting of the same title features a one-legged man walking with crutches. Again depicting the same street, but this time in a different context, is &quot;Rue Mosnier with Pavers&quot;, in which men repair the roadway while people and horses move past.
&quot;The Railway&quot;, widely known as &quot;The Gare Saint-Lazare&quot;, was painted in 1873. The setting is the urban landscape of Paris in the late 19th century. Using his favorite model in his last painting of her, a fellow painter, Victorine Meurent, also the model for &quot;Olympia&quot; and the &quot;Luncheon on the Grass&quot;, sits before an iron fence holding a sleeping puppy and an open book in her lap. Next to her is a little girl with her back to the painter, watching a train pass beneath them.

Instead of choosing the traditional natural view as background for an outdoor scene, Manet opts for the iron grating which &quot;boldly stretches across the canvas&quot;. The only evidence of the train is its white cloud of steam. In the distance, modern apartment buildings are seen. This arrangement compresses the foreground into a narrow focus. The traditional convention of deep space is ignored.

Historian Isabelle Dervaux has described the reception this painting received when it was first exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1874: &quot;Visitors and critics found its subject baffling, its composition incoherent, and its execution sketchy. Caricaturists ridiculed Manet&#x27;s picture, in which only a few recognized the symbol of modernity that it has become today&quot;. The painting is currently in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

Manet painted several boating subjects in 1874. &quot;Boating&quot;, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, exemplifies in its conciseness the lessons Manet learned from Japanese prints, and the abrupt cropping by the frame of the boat and sail adds to the immediacy of the image.

In 1875, a book-length French edition of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot; included lithographs by Manet and translation by Mallarmé.

In 1881, with pressure from his friend Antonin Proust, the French government awarded Manet the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

===Late works===

In his mid-forties Manet&#x27;s health deteriorated, and he developed severe pain and partial paralysis in his legs. In 1879 he began receiving hydrotherapy treatments at a spa near Meudon intended to improve what he believed was a circulatory problem, but in reality he was suffering from locomotor ataxia, a known side-effect of syphilis. In 1880, he painted a portrait there of the opera singer Émilie Ambre as Carmen. Ambre and her lover Gaston de Beauplan had an estate in Meudon and had organized the first exhibition of Manet&#x27;s &quot;The Execution of Emperor Maximilian&quot; in New York in December 1879.

In his last years Manet painted many small-scale still lifes of fruits and vegetables, such as &quot;A&quot; &quot;Bunch of Asparagus&quot; and &quot;The Lemon&quot; (both 1880). He completed his last major work, &quot;A Bar at the Folies-Bergère (Un Bar aux Folies-Bergère)&quot;, in 1882, and it hung in the Salon that year. Afterwards, he limited himself to small formats.

Manet&#x27;s last paintings were of flowers in glass vases. There are 20 such paintings known, with the last one painted in March 1883, barely two months before his death. Quoted in Venice thirteen years later, Manet is credited with stating that an artist can say everything he has to say with &quot;flowers, fruit, and clouds.&quot; His last flower paintings are a demonstration of that belief.

In 2023, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City exhibited a two-person exhibition of Manet with Degas.

==Death==
In April 1883, his left foot was amputated because of gangrene caused by complications from syphilis and rheumatism. He died eleven days later on 30 April in Paris. He is buried in the Passy Cemetery in the city.

==Legacy==
Manet&#x27;s public career lasted from 1861, the year of his first participation in the Salon, until his death in 1883. His known extant works, as catalogued in 1975 by Denis Rouart and Daniel Wildenstein, comprise 430 oil paintings, 89 pastels, and more than 400 works on paper.
Although harshly condemned by critics who decried its lack of conventional finish, Manet&#x27;s work had admirers from the beginning. One was Émile Zola, who wrote in 1867: &quot;We are not accustomed to seeing such simple and direct translations of reality. Then, as I said, there is such a surprisingly elegant awkwardness ... it is a truly charming experience to contemplate this luminous and serious painting which interprets nature with a gentle brutality.&quot;

The roughly painted style and photographic lighting in Manet&#x27;s paintings was seen as specifically modern, and as a challenge to the Renaissance works he copied or used as source material. He rejected the technique he had learned in the studio of Thomas Couture – in which a painting was constructed using successive layers of paint on a dark-toned ground – in favor of a direct, &quot;alla prima&quot; method using opaque paint on a light ground. Novel at the time, this method made possible the completion of a painting in a single sitting. It was adopted by the Impressionists, and became the prevalent method of painting in oils for generations that followed. Manet&#x27;s work is considered &quot;early modern&quot;, partially because of the opaque flatness of his surfaces, the frequent sketch-like passages, and the black outlining of figures, all of which draw attention to the surface of the picture plane and the material quality of paint.

The art historian Beatrice Farwell says Manet &quot;has been universally regarded as the Father of Modernism. With Courbet he was among the first to take serious risks with the public whose favour he sought, the first to make &quot;alla prima&quot; painting the standard technique for oil painting and one of the first to take liberties with Renaissance perspective and to offer &#x27;pure painting&#x27; as a source of aesthetic pleasure. He was a pioneer, again with Courbet, in the rejection of humanistic and historical subject-matter, and shared with Degas the establishment of modern urban life as acceptable material for high art.&quot;

===Art market===
The late Manet painting, &quot;Le Printemps&quot; (1881), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum for $65.1 million, setting a new auction record for Manet, exceeding its pre-sale estimate of $25–35 million at Christie&#x27;s on 5 November 2014. The previous auction record was held by &quot;Self-Portrait With Palette&quot; which sold for $33.2 million at Sotheby&#x27;s on 22 June 2010.

<text>An evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is a strategy (or set of strategies) that is &quot;impermeable&quot; when adopted by a population in adaptation to a specific environment, that is to say it cannot be displaced by an alternative strategy (or set of strategies) which may be novel or initially rare. Introduced by John Maynard Smith and George R. Price in 1972/3, it is an important concept in behavioural ecology, evolutionary psychology, mathematical game theory and economics, with applications in other fields such as anthropology, philosophy and political science.

In game-theoretical terms, an ESS is an equilibrium refinement of the Nash equilibrium, being a Nash equilibrium that is also &quot;evolutionarily stable.&quot; Thus, once fixed in a population, natural selection alone is sufficient to prevent alternative (mutant) strategies from replacing it (although this does not preclude the possibility that a better strategy, or set of strategies, will emerge in response to selective pressures resulting from environmental change).

==History==
Evolutionarily stable strategies were defined and introduced by John Maynard Smith and George R. Price in a 1973 &quot;Nature&quot; paper. Such was the time taken in peer-reviewing the paper for &quot;Nature&quot; that this was preceded by a 1972 essay by Maynard Smith in a book of essays titled &quot;On Evolution&quot;. The 1972 essay is sometimes cited instead of the 1973 paper, but university libraries are much more likely to have copies of &quot;Nature&quot;. Papers in &quot;Nature&quot; are usually short; in 1974, Maynard Smith published a longer paper in the &quot;Journal of Theoretical Biology&quot;. Maynard Smith explains further in his 1982 book &quot;Evolution and the Theory of Games&quot;. Sometimes these are cited instead. In fact, the ESS has become so central to game theory that often no citation is given, as the reader is assumed to be familiar with it.

Maynard Smith mathematically formalised a verbal argument made by Price, which he read while peer-reviewing Price&#x27;s paper. When Maynard Smith realized that the somewhat disorganised Price was not ready to revise his article for publication, he offered to add Price as co-author.

The concept was derived from R. H. MacArthur and W. D. Hamilton&#x27;s work on sex ratios, derived from Fisher&#x27;s principle, especially Hamilton&#x27;s (1967) concept of an unbeatable strategy. Maynard Smith was jointly awarded the 1999 Crafoord Prize for his development of the concept of evolutionarily stable strategies and the application of game theory to the evolution of behaviour.

Uses of ESS:
* The ESS was a major element used to analyze evolution in Richard Dawkins&#x27; bestselling 1976 book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;.
* The ESS was first used in the social sciences by Robert Axelrod in his 1984 book &quot;The Evolution of Cooperation&quot;. Since then, it has been widely used in the social sciences, including anthropology, economics, philosophy, and political science.
* In the social sciences, the primary interest is not in an ESS as the end of biological evolution, but as an end point in cultural evolution or individual learning.
* In evolutionary psychology, ESS is used primarily as a model for human biological evolution.

==Motivation==

The Nash equilibrium is the traditional solution concept in game theory. It depends on the cognitive abilities of the players. It is assumed that players are aware of the structure of the game and consciously try to predict the moves of their opponents and to maximize their own payoffs. In addition, it is presumed that all the players know this (see common knowledge). These assumptions are then used to explain why players choose Nash equilibrium strategies.

Evolutionarily stable strategies are motivated entirely differently. Here, it is presumed that the players&#x27; strategies are biologically encoded and heritable. Individuals have no control over their strategy and need not be aware of the game. They reproduce and are subject to the forces of natural selection, with the payoffs of the game representing reproductive success (biological fitness). It is imagined that alternative strategies of the game occasionally occur, via a process like mutation. To be an ESS, a strategy must be resistant to these alternatives.

Given the radically different motivating assumptions, it may come as a surprise that ESSes and Nash equilibria often coincide. In fact, every ESS corresponds to a Nash equilibrium, but some Nash equilibria are not ESSes.

== Nash equilibrium ==
An ESS is a refined or modified form of a Nash equilibrium. (See the next section for examples which contrast the two.) In a Nash equilibrium, if all players adopt their respective parts, no player can &quot;benefit&quot; by switching to any alternative strategy. In a two player game, it is a strategy pair. Let E(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;T&quot;) represent the payoff for playing strategy &quot;S&quot; against strategy &quot;T&quot;. The strategy pair (&quot;S&quot;, &quot;S&quot;) is a Nash equilibrium in a two player game if and only if for both players, for any strategy &quot;T&quot;:
:E(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot;) ≥ E(&quot;T&quot;,&quot;S&quot;)

In this definition, a strategy &quot;T&quot;≠&quot;S&quot; can be a neutral alternative to &quot;S&quot; (scoring equally well, but not better). 

A Nash equilibrium is presumed to be stable even if &quot;T&quot; scores equally, on the assumption that there is no long-term incentive for players to adopt &quot;T&quot; instead of &quot;S&quot;. This fact represents the point of departure of the ESS.

Maynard Smith and Price specify two conditions for a strategy &quot;S&quot; to be an ESS. For all &quot;T&quot;≠&quot;S&quot;, either
# E(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot;) &gt; E(&quot;T&quot;,&quot;S&quot;), or
# E(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot;) = E(&quot;T&quot;,&quot;S&quot;) and E(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;T&quot;) &gt; E(&quot;T&quot;,&quot;T&quot;)

The first condition is sometimes called a &quot;strict&quot; Nash equilibrium. The second is sometimes called &quot;Maynard Smith&#x27;s second condition&quot;. The second condition means that although strategy &quot;T&quot; is neutral with respect to the payoff against strategy &quot;S&quot;, the population of players who continue to play strategy &quot;S&quot; has an advantage when playing against &quot;T&quot;.

There is also an alternative, stronger definition of ESS, due to Thomas. This places a different emphasis on the role of the Nash equilibrium concept in the ESS concept. Following the terminology given in the first definition above, this definition requires that for all &quot;T&quot;≠&quot;S&quot;

# E(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot;) ≥ E(&quot;T&quot;,&quot;S&quot;), and
# E(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;T&quot;) &gt; E(&quot;T&quot;,&quot;T&quot;)

In this formulation, the first condition specifies that the strategy is a Nash equilibrium, and the second specifies that Maynard Smith&#x27;s second condition is met. Note that the two definitions are not precisely equivalent: for example, each pure strategy in the coordination game below is an ESS by the first definition but not the second.

In words, this definition looks like this: The payoff of the first player when both players play strategy S is higher than (or equal to) the payoff of the first player when he changes to another strategy T and the second player keeps his strategy S &quot;and&quot; the payoff of the first player when only his opponent changes his strategy to T is higher than his payoff in case that both of players change their strategies to T.

This formulation more clearly highlights the role of the Nash equilibrium condition in the ESS. It also allows for a natural definition of related concepts such as a weak ESS or an evolutionarily stable set.

===Examples of differences between Nash equilibria and ESSes===

In most simple games, the ESSes and Nash equilibria coincide perfectly. For instance, in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma there is only one Nash equilibrium, and its strategy (&quot;Defect&quot;) is also an ESS.

Some games may have Nash equilibria that are not ESSes. For example, in harm thy neighbor (whose payoff matrix is shown here) both (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) and (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) are Nash equilibria, since players cannot do better by switching away from either. However, only &quot;B&quot; is an ESS (and a strong Nash). &quot;A&quot; is not an ESS, so &quot;B&quot; can neutrally invade a population of &quot;A&quot; strategists and predominate, because &quot;B&quot; scores higher against &quot;B&quot; than &quot;A&quot; does against &quot;B&quot;. This dynamic is captured by Maynard Smith&#x27;s second condition, since E(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) = E(&quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;), but it is not the case that E(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) &gt; E(&quot;B&quot;,&quot;B&quot;).

Nash equilibria with equally scoring alternatives can be ESSes. For example, in the game &quot;Harm everyone&quot;, &quot;C&quot; is an ESS because it satisfies Maynard Smith&#x27;s second condition. &quot;D&quot; strategists may temporarily invade a population of &quot;C&quot; strategists by scoring equally well against &quot;C&quot;, but they pay a price when they begin to play against each other; &quot;C&quot; scores better against &quot;D&quot; than does &quot;D&quot;. So here although E(&quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;) = E(&quot;D&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), it is also the case that E(&quot;C&quot;,&quot;D&quot;) &gt; E(&quot;D&quot;,&quot;D&quot;). As a result, &quot;C&quot; is an ESS.

Even if a game has pure strategy Nash equilibria, it might be that none of those pure strategies are ESS. Consider the Game of chicken. There are two pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game (&quot;Swerve&quot;, &quot;Stay&quot;) and (&quot;Stay&quot;, &quot;Swerve&quot;). However, in the absence of an uncorrelated asymmetry, neither &quot;Swerve&quot; nor &quot;Stay&quot; are ESSes. There is a third Nash equilibrium, a mixed strategy which is an ESS for this game (see Hawk-dove game and Best response for explanation).

This last example points to an important difference between Nash equilibria and ESS. Nash equilibria are defined on &quot;strategy sets&quot; (a specification of a strategy for each player), while ESS are defined in terms of strategies themselves. The equilibria defined by ESS must always be symmetric, and thus have fewer equilibrium points.

== Vs. evolutionarily stable state ==
In population biology, the two concepts of an &quot;evolutionarily stable strategy&quot; (ESS) and an &quot;evolutionarily stable state&quot; are closely linked but describe different situations.

In an evolutionarily stable &quot;strategy,&quot; if all the members of a population adopt it, no mutant strategy can invade. Once virtually all members of the population use this strategy, there is no &#x27;rational&#x27; alternative. ESS is part of classical game theory.

In an evolutionarily stable &quot;state,&quot; a population&#x27;s genetic composition is restored by selection after a disturbance, if the disturbance is not too large. An evolutionarily stable state is a dynamic property of a population that returns to using a strategy, or mix of strategies, if it is perturbed from that initial state. It is part of population genetics, dynamical system, or evolutionary game theory. This is now called convergent stability.

B. Thomas (1984) applies the term ESS to an individual strategy which may be mixed, and evolutionarily stable population state to a population mixture of pure strategies which may be formally equivalent to the mixed ESS.

Whether a population is evolutionarily stable does not relate to its genetic diversity: it can be genetically monomorphic or polymorphic.

== Stochastic ESS ==
In the classic definition of an ESS, no mutant strategy can invade. In finite populations, any mutant could in principle invade, albeit at low probability, implying that no ESS can exist. In an infinite population, an ESS can instead be defined as a strategy which, should it become invaded by a new mutant strategy with probability p, would be able to counterinvade from a single starting individual with probability &gt;p, as illustrated by the evolution of bet-hedging.

== Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma ==
A common model of altruism and social cooperation is the Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. Here a group of players would collectively be better off if they could play &quot;Cooperate&quot;, but since &quot;Defect&quot; fares better each individual player has an incentive to play &quot;Defect&quot;. One solution to this problem is to introduce the possibility of retaliation by having individuals play the game repeatedly against the same player. In the so-called &quot;iterated&quot; Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, the same two individuals play the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma over and over. While the Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma has only two strategies (&quot;Cooperate&quot; and &quot;Defect&quot;), the iterated Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma has a huge number of possible strategies. Since an individual can have different contingency plan for each history and the game may be repeated an indefinite number of times, there may in fact be an infinite number of such contingency plans.

Three simple contingency plans which have received substantial attention are &quot;Always Defect&quot;, &quot;Always Cooperate&quot;, and &quot;Tit for Tat&quot;. The first two strategies do the same thing regardless of the other player&#x27;s actions, while the latter responds on the next round by doing what was done to it on the previous round—it responds to &quot;Cooperate&quot; with &quot;Cooperate&quot; and &quot;Defect&quot; with &quot;Defect&quot;.

If the entire population plays &quot;Tit-for-Tat&quot; and a mutant arises who plays &quot;Always Defect&quot;, &quot;Tit-for-Tat&quot; will outperform &quot;Always Defect&quot;. If the population of the mutant becomes too large — the percentage of the mutant will be kept small. &quot;Tit for Tat&quot; is therefore an ESS, &quot;with respect to only these two strategies&quot;. On the other hand, an island of &quot;Always Defect&quot; players will be stable against the invasion of a few &quot;Tit-for-Tat&quot; players, but not against a large number of them. If we introduce &quot;Always Cooperate&quot;, a population of &quot;Tit-for-Tat&quot; is no longer an ESS. Since a population of &quot;Tit-for-Tat&quot; players always cooperates, the strategy &quot;Always Cooperate&quot; behaves identically in this population. As a result, a mutant who plays &quot;Always Cooperate&quot; will not be eliminated. However, even though a population of &quot;Always Cooperate&quot; and &quot;Tit-for-Tat&quot; can coexist, if there is a small percentage of the population that is &quot;Always Defect&quot;, the selective pressure is against &quot;Always Cooperate&quot;, and in favour of &quot;Tit-for-Tat&quot;. This is due to the lower payoffs of cooperating than those of defecting in case the opponent defects.

This demonstrates the difficulties in applying the formal definition of an ESS to games with large strategy spaces, and has motivated some to consider alternatives.

== Human behavior ==
The fields of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology attempt to explain animal and human behavior and social structures, largely in terms of evolutionarily stable strategies. Sociopathy (chronic antisocial or criminal behavior) may be a result of a combination of two such strategies.

Evolutionarily stable strategies were originally considered for biological evolution, but they can apply to other contexts. In fact, there are stable states for a large class of adaptive dynamics. As a result, they can be used to explain human behaviours that lack any genetic influences.

<doc id="9619" wikidata="Q206912" url="?curid=9619" title="Extremophile">
<text>An extremophile () is an organism that is able to live (or in some cases thrive) in extreme environments, i.e., environments with conditions approaching or stretching the limits of what known life can adapt to, such as extreme temperature, pressure, radiation, salinity, or pH level.

Since the definition of an extreme environment is relative to an arbitrarily defined standard, often an anthropocentric one, these organisms can be considered ecologically dominant in the evolutionary history of the planet. Dating back to more than 40 million years ago, extremophiles have continued to thrive in the most extreme conditions, making them one of the most abundant lifeforms. The study of extremophiles has expanded human knowledge of the limits of life, and informs speculation about extraterrestrial life. Extremophiles are also of interest because of their potential for bioremediation of environments made hazardous to humans due to pollution or contamination.

==Characteristics==
In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that microbial life has great flexibility for surviving in extreme environments—niches that are acidic, extraordinarily hot, or with irregular air pressure for example—that would be completely inhospitable to complex organisms. Some scientists even concluded that life may have begun on Earth in hydrothermal vents far beneath the ocean&#x27;s surface.

According to astrophysicist Steinn Sigurdsson, &quot;There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth—and we know they&#x27;re very hardened to radiation.&quot; Some bacteria were found living in the cold and dark in a lake buried a half-mile deep under the ice in Antarctica, and in the Marianas Trench, the deepest place in Earth&#x27;s oceans. Expeditions of the International Ocean Discovery Program found microorganisms in sediment that is below seafloor in the Nankai Trough subduction zone. Some microorganisms have been found thriving inside rocks up to below the sea floor under of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States. According to one of the researchers, &quot;You can find microbes everywhere—they&#x27;re extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are.&quot; A key to extremophile adaptation is their amino acid composition, affecting their protein folding ability under particular conditions. Studying extreme environments on Earth can help researchers understand the limits of habitability on other worlds.

Tom Gheysens from Ghent University in Belgium and some of his colleagues have presented research findings that show spores from a species of Bacillus bacteria survived and were still viable after being heated to temperatures of .

==Classifications==
There are many classes of extremophiles that range all around the globe; each corresponding to the way its environmental niche differs from mesophilic conditions. These classifications are not exclusive. Many extremophiles fall under multiple categories and are classified as polyextremophiles. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth&#x27;s surface are thermophilic and piezophilic such as &quot;Thermococcus barophilus&quot;. A polyextremophile living at the summit of a mountain in the Atacama Desert might be a radioresistant xerophile, a psychrophile, and an oligotroph. Polyextremophiles are well known for their ability to tolerate both high and low pH levels. Note that &quot;tolerant&quot; or &quot;resistant&quot; are not the same as the &quot;-phile&quot; compounds: those organismes &quot;survive despite harsh conditions&quot; and not &quot;strive in conditions that human beings consider harsh&quot;. For example, the famous tardigrade (Tardigrada spp.), depiste it being highly resistant to many stresses, is not an extremophile properly speaking.

===Terms===
*Acidophile: an organism with optimal growth at pH levels of 3.0 or below.

*Alkaliphile: an organism with optimal growth at pH levels of 9.0 or above.

*Capnophile: an organism with optimal growth conditions in high concentrations of carbon dioxide. An example would be &quot;Mannheimia succiniciproducens,&quot; a bacterium that inhabits a ruminant animal&#x27;s digestive system.

*Halophile: an organism with optimal growth at a concentration of dissolved salts of 50 g/L (= 5% m/v) or above (for comparison, the ocean salinity is about 35 g/L (= 3.5% m/v)).

*Hyperpiezophile: an organism with optimal growth at hydrostatic pressures above 50 MPa (= 493 atm = 7,252 psi).

*Hyperthermophile: an organism with optimal growth at temperatures above .

*Metallotolerant: an organism capable of tolerating high levels of dissolved heavy metals in solution, such as copper, cadmium, arsenic, and zinc. Examples include &quot;Ferroplasma sp.&quot;, &quot;Cupriavidus metallidurans&quot; and GFAJ-1.

*Oligotroph: an organism with optimal growth in nutritionally limited environments.

*Osmophile: an organism with optimal growth in environments with a high sugar concentration.

*Piezophile or barophile: an organism with optimal growth in hydrostatic pressures above 10 MPa (= 99 atm = 1,450 psi).

*Polyextremophile (mixed Latin/Greek compound for &quot;affection for many extremes&quot;): not a well-defined category itself – an organism that qualifies as an extremophile under more than one category.

*Psychrophile or cryophile: an organism with optimal growth at temperatures of or lower.

*Radioresistant: organisms resistant to high levels of ionizing radiation, most commonly ultraviolet radiation. This category also includes organisms capable of resisting nuclear radiation, notably gamma rays.

*Sulphophile: an organism with optimal growth conditions in high concentrations of sulfur. An example would be &quot;Sulfurovum epsilonproteobacteria&quot;, a sulfur-oxidizing bacteria that inhabits deep-water sulfur vents.

*Thermophile: an organism with optimal growth at temperatures above .

*Xerophile: an organism with optimal growth at water activity below 0.8.

== In astrobiology ==
Astrobiology is the multidisciplinary field that investigates how life arises, distributes, and evolves in the universe. Astrobiology makes use of physics, chemistry, astronomy, solar physics, biology, molecular biology, ecology, planetary science, geography, and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and recognize biospheres that might be different from that on Earth. Astrobiologists are interested in extremophiles, as it allows them to map what is known about the limits of life on Earth to potential extraterrestrial environments For example, analogous deserts of Antarctica are exposed to harmful UV radiation, low temperature, high salt concentration and low mineral concentration. These conditions are similar to those on Mars. Therefore, finding viable microbes in the subsurface of Antarctica suggests that there may be microbes surviving in endolithic communities and living under the Martian surface. Research indicates it is unlikely that Martian microbes exist on the surface or at shallow depths, but may be found at subsurface depths of around 100 meters.

Recent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria including &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Paracoccus denitrificans&quot; being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an ultracentrifuge at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 g (i.e. 403,627 times the gravity experienced on Earth). &quot;P. denitrificans&quot; was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of supernovas. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful growth under hypergravity. The research has implications on the feasibility of panspermia.

On 26 April 2012, scientists reported that lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the adaptation capacity of photosynthetic activity within the simulation time of 34 days under some conditions similar to those on Mars in the Mars Simulation Laboratory (MSL) maintained by the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

On 29 April 2013, scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, funded by NASA, reported that, during spaceflight on the International Space Station, microbes seem to adapt to the space environment in ways &quot;not observed on Earth&quot; and in ways that &quot;can lead to increases in growth and virulence&quot;.

On 19 May 2014, scientists announced that some microbes, like &quot;Tersicoccus phoenicis&quot;, may be resistant to methods usually used in spacecraft assembly clean rooms, giving rise to speculation that such microbes could have withstood space travel and are present on the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover now on the planet Mars.

On 20 August 2014, scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living half a mile below the ice of Antarctica.

In September 2015, scientists from CNR-National Research Council of Italy reported that &quot;S. soflataricus&quot; survived under Martian radiation at a wavelength that was considered lethal to most bacteria. This discovery is significant because it indicates that not only bacterial spores, but also growing cells can resist to strong UV radiation.

In June 2016, scientists from Brigham Young University reported that endospores of &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; were able to survive high speed impacts up to 299±28 m/s, extreme shock, and extreme deceleration. They pointed out that this feature might allow endospores to survive and to be transferred between planets by traveling within meteorites or by experiencing atmosphere disruption. Moreover, they suggested that the landing of spacecraft may also result in interplanetary spore transfer, given that spores can survive high-velocity impact while ejected from the spacecraft onto the planet surface. This is the first study which reported that bacteria can survive in such high-velocity impact. However, the lethal impact speed is unknown, and further experiments should be done by introducing higher-velocity impact to bacterial endospores.

In August 2020 scientists reported that bacteria that feed on air discovered 2017 in Antarctica are likely not limited to Antarctica after discovering the two genes previously linked to their &quot;atmospheric chemosynthesis&quot; in soil of two other similar cold desert sites, which provides further information on this carbon sink and further strengthens the extremophile evidence that supports the potential existence of microbial life on alien planets.

The same month, scientists reported that bacteria from Earth, particularly &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot;, were found to survive for three years in outer space, based on studies on the International Space Station. These findings support the notion of panspermia.

== Bioremediation ==
Extremophiles can also be useful players in the bioremediation of contaminated sites as some species are capable of biodegradation under conditions too extreme for classic bioremediation candidate species. Anthropogenic activity causes the release of pollutants that may potentially settle in extreme environments as is the case with tailings and sediment released from deep-sea mining activity. While most bacteria would be crushed by the pressure in these environments, piezophiles can tolerate these depths and can metabolize pollutants of concern if they possess bioremediation potential.

=== Hydrocarbons ===
There are multiple potential destinations for hydrocarbons after an oil spill has settled and currents routinely deposit them in extreme environments. Methane bubbles resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill were found 1.1 kilometers below water surface level and at concentrations as high as 183 &quot;μ&quot;mol per kilogram. The combination of low temperatures and high pressures in this environment result in low microbial activity. However, bacteria that are present including species of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Aeromonas&quot; and &quot;Vibrio&quot; were found to be capable of bioremediation, albeit at a tenth of the speed they would perform at sea level pressure. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increase in solubility and bioavailability with increasing temperature. Thermophilic &quot;Thermus&quot; and &quot;Bacillus&quot; species have demonstrated higher gene expression for the alkane mono-oxygenase &quot;alkB&quot; at temperatures exceeding . The expression of this gene is a crucial precursor to the bioremediation process. Fungi that have been genetically modified with cold-adapted enzymes to tolerate differing pH levels and temperatures have been shown to be effective at remediating hydrocarbon contamination in freezing conditions in the Antarctic.

=== Metals ===
&quot;Acidithiubacillus ferroxidans&quot; has been shown to be effective in remediating mercury in acidic soil due to its &quot;merA&quot; gene making it mercury resistant. Industrial effluent contain high levels of metals that can be detrimental to both human and ecosystem health. In extreme heat environments the extremophile &quot;Geobacillus thermodenitrificans&quot; has been shown to effectively manage the concentration of these metals within twelve hours of introduction. Some acidophilic microorganisms are effective at metal remediation in acidic environments due to proteins found in their periplasm, not present in any mesophilic organisms, allowing them to protect themselves from high proton concentrations. Rice paddies are highly oxidative environments that can produce high levels of lead or cadmium. &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; are resistant to the harsh conditions of the environment and are therefore candidate species for limiting the extent of contamination of these metals.

Some bacteria are known to also use rare earth elements on their biological processes. For example, &quot;Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum&quot;, &quot;Methylorubrum extorquens,&quot; and &quot;Methylobacterium radiotolerans&quot; are known to be able to use lanthanides as cofactors to increase their methanol dehydrogenase activity.

=== Acid mine drainage ===

Acid mine drainage is a major environmental concern associated with many metal mines. This is due to the fact that this highly acidic water can mix with groundwater, streams, and lakes. The drainage turns the pH in these water sources from a more neutral pH to a pH lower than 4. This is close to the acidity levels of battery acid or stomach acid. Exposure to the polluted water can greatly affect the health of plants, humans, and animals. However, a productive method of remediation is to introduce the extremophile, &quot;Thiobacillus&quot; &quot;ferrooxidans&quot;. This extremophile is useful for its bioleaching property. It helps to break down minerals in the waste water created by the mine. By breaking down the minerals &quot;Thiobacillus ferrooxidans&quot; start to help neutralize the acidity of the waste water. This is a way to reduce the environmental impact and help remediate the damage caused by the acid mine drainage leaks.

=== Oil-based, hazardous pollutants in Arctic regions ===
Psychrophilic microbes metabolize hydrocarbons which assists in the remediation of hazardous, oil-based pollutants in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. These specific microbes are used in this region due to their ability to perform their functions at extremely cold temperatures.

=== Radioactive materials ===
Any bacteria capable of inhabiting radioactive mediums can be classified as an extremophile. Radioresistant organisms are therefore critical in the bioremediation of radionuclides. Uranium is particularly challenging to contain when released into an environment and very harmful to both human and ecosystem health. The NANOBINDERS project is equipping bacteria that can survive in uranium rich environments with gene sequences that enable proteins to bind to uranium in mining effluent, making it more convenient to collect and dispose of. Some examples are &quot;Shewanella putrefaciens&quot;, &quot;Geobacter metallireducens&quot; and some strains of &quot;Burkholderia fungorum.&quot;

Radiotrophic fungi, which use radiation as an energy source, have been found inside and around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

Radioresistance has also been observed in certain species of macroscopic lifeforms. The lethal dose required to kill up to 50% of a tortoise population is 40,000 roentgens, compared to only 800 roentgens needed to kill 50% of a human population. In experiments exposing lepidopteran insects to gamma radiation, significant DNA damage was detected only at 20 Gy and higher doses, in contrast with human cells that showed similar damage at only 2 Gy.

== Examples and recent findings==
New sub-types of extremophiles are identified frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life lives in the liquid asphalt lake, Pitch Lake. Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the asphalt lake in populations ranging between 106 and 107 cells/gram. Likewise, until recently, boron tolerance was unknown, but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria. With the recent isolation of &quot;Bacillus boroniphilus&quot;, borophiles came into discussion. Studying these borophiles may help illuminate the mechanisms of both boron toxicity and boron deficiency.

In July 2019, a scientific study of Kidd Mine in Canada discovered sulfur-breathing organisms which live below the surface, and which breathe sulfur in order to survive. These organisms are also remarkable due to eating rocks such as pyrite as their regular food source.

== Biotechnology ==

The thermoalkaliphilic catalase, which initiates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water, was isolated from an organism, &quot;Thermus brockianus&quot;, found in Yellowstone National Park by Idaho National Laboratory researchers. The catalase operates over a temperature range from 30 °C to over 94 °C and a pH range from 6–10. This catalase is extremely stable compared to other catalases at high temperatures and pH. In a comparative study, the &quot;T. brockianus&quot; catalase exhibited a half life of 15 days at 80 °C and pH 10 while a catalase derived from &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; had a half life of 15 seconds under the same conditions. The catalase will have applications for removal of hydrogen peroxide in industrial processes such as pulp and paper bleaching, textile bleaching, food pasteurization, and surface decontamination of food packaging.

DNA modifying enzymes such as &quot;Taq&quot; DNA polymerase and some &quot;Bacillus&quot; enzymes used in clinical diagnostics and starch liquefaction are produced commercially by several biotechnology companies.

==DNA transfer==
Over 65 prokaryotic species are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation, the ability to transfer DNA from one cell to another cell followed by integration of the donor DNA into the recipient cell&#x27;s chromosome. Several extremophiles are able to carry out species-specific DNA transfer, as described below. However, it is not yet clear how common such a capability is among extremophiles.

The bacterium &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; is one of the most radioresistant organisms known. This bacterium can also survive cold, dehydration, vacuum and acid and is thus known as a polyextremophile. &quot;D. radiodurans&quot; is competent to perform genetic transformation. Recipient cells are able to repair DNA damage in donor transforming DNA that had been UV irradiated as efficiently as they repair cellular DNA when the cells themselves are irradiated. The extreme thermophilic bacterium &quot;Thermus thermophilus&quot; and other related &quot;Thermus&quot; species are also capable of genetic transformation.

&quot;Halobacterium volcanii&quot;, an extreme halophilic (saline tolerant) archaeon, is capable of natural genetic transformation. Cytoplasmic bridges are formed between cells that appear to be used for DNA transfer from one cell to another in either direction.

&quot;Sulfolobus solfataricus&quot; and &quot;Sulfolobus acidocaldarius&quot; are hyperthermophilic archaea. Exposure of these organisms to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C induces species-specific cellular aggregation. UV-induced cellular aggregation of &quot;S. acidocaldarius&quot; mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency. Recombination rates exceed those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between &quot;Sulfolobus&quot; cells in order to repair damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. Van Wolferen et al. noted that this DNA exchange process may be crucial under DNA damaging conditions such as high temperatures. It has also been suggested that DNA transfer in &quot;Sulfolobus&quot; may be an early form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that involve species-specific DNA transfer leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage (and see Transformation (genetics)).

Extracellular membrane vesicles (MVs) might be involved in DNA transfer between different hyperthermophilic archaeal species. It has been shown that both plasmids and viral genomes can be transferred via MVs. Notably, a horizontal plasmid transfer has been documented between hyperthermophilic &quot;Thermococcus&quot; and &quot;Methanocaldococcus&quot; species, respectively belonging to the orders &quot;Thermococcales&quot; and &quot;Methanococcales&quot;.

<text>Education reform is the name given to the goal of changing public education. The meaning and education methods have changed through debates over what content or experiences result in an educated individual or an educated society. Historically, the motivations for reform have not reflected the current needs of society. A consistent theme of reform includes the idea that large systematic changes to educational standards will produce social returns in citizens&#x27; health, wealth, and well-being.

As part of the broader social and political processes, the term education reform refers to the chronology of significant, systematic revisions made to amend the educational legislation, standards, methodology, and policy affecting a nation&#x27;s public school system to reflect the needs and values of contemporary society. 18th century, classical education instruction from an in-home personal tutor, hired at the family&#x27;s expense, was primarily a privilege for children from wealthy families. Innovations such as encyclopedias, public libraries, and grammar schools all aimed to relieve some of the financial burden associated with the expenses of the classical education model. Motivations during the Victorian era emphasized the importance of self-improvement. Victorian education focused on teaching commercially valuable topics, such as modern languages and mathematics, rather than classical liberal arts subjects, such as Latin, art, and history.

Motivations for education reformists like Horace Mann and his proponents focused on making schooling more accessible and developing a robust state-supported common school system. John Dewey, an early 20th-century reformer, focused on improving society by advocating for a scientific, pragmatic, or democratic principle-based curriculum. Whereas Maria Montessori incorporated humanistic motivations to &quot;meet the needs of the child&quot;. In historic Prussia, a motivation to foster national unity led to formal education concentrated on teaching national language literacy to young children, resulting in Kindergarten.

The history of educational pedagogy in the United States has ranged from teaching literacy and proficiency of religious doctrine to establishing cultural literacy, assimilating immigrants into a democratic society, producing a skilled labor force for the industrialized workplace, preparing students for careers, and competing in a global marketplace. Education inequality is also a motivation for education reform, seeking to address problems of a community.

== Motivations for education reform ==
Education reform, in general, implies a continual effort to modify and improve the institution of education. Over time, as the needs and values of society change, attitudes towards public education change. As a social institution, education plays an integral role in the process of socialization. &quot;Socialization is broadly composed of distinct inter- and intra-generational processes. Both involve the harmonization of an individual&#x27;s attitudes and behaviors with that of their socio-cultural milieu.&quot; Educational matrices mean to reinforce those socially acceptable informal and formal norms, values, and beliefs that individuals need to learn in order to be accepted as good, functioning, and productive members of their society. Education reform is the process of constantly renegotiating and restructuring the educational standards to reflect the ever-evolving contemporary ideals of social, economic, and political culture. Reforms can be based on bringing education into alignment with a society&#x27;s core values. Reforms that attempt to change a society&#x27;s core values can connect alternative education initiatives with a network of other alternative institutions.

Education reform has been pursued for a variety of specific reasons, but generally most reforms aim at redressing some societal ills, such as poverty-, gender-, or class-based inequities, or perceived ineffectiveness. Current education trends in the United States represent multiple achievement gaps across ethnicities, income levels, and geographies. As McKinsey and Company reported in a 2009 analysis, &quot;These educational gaps impose on the United States the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession.&quot; Reforms are usually proposed by thinkers who aim to redress societal ills or institute societal changes, most often through a change in the education of the members of a class of people—the preparation of a ruling class to rule or a working class to work, the social hygiene of a lower or immigrant class, the preparation of citizens in a democracy or republic, etc. The idea that all children should be provided with a high level of education is a relatively recent idea, and has arisen largely in the context of Western democracy in the 20th century.

The &quot;beliefs&quot; of school districts are optimistic that quite literally &quot;all students will succeed&quot;, which in the context of high school graduation examination in the United States, all students in all groups, regardless of heritage or income will pass tests that in the introduction typically fall beyond the ability of all but the top 20 to 30 percent of students. The claims clearly renounce historical research that shows that all ethnic and income groups score differently on all standardized tests and standards based assessments and that students will achieve on a bell curve. Instead, education officials across the world believe that by setting clear, achievable, higher standards, aligning the curriculum, and assessing outcomes, learning can be increased for all students, and more students can succeed than the 50 percent who are defined to be above or below grade level by norm referenced standards.

States have tried to use state schools to increase state power, especially to make better soldiers and workers, and increase nationalism. This strategy was first adopted to unify related linguistic groups in Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Exact mechanisms are unclear, but it often fails in areas where populations are culturally segregated, as when the U.S. Indian school service failed to suppress Lakota and Navaho, or when a culture has widely respected autonomous cultural institutions, as when the Spanish failed to suppress Catalan.

Many students of democracy have desired to improve education in order to improve the quality of governance in democratic societies; the necessity of good public education follows logically if one believes that the quality of democratic governance depends on the ability of citizens to make informed, intelligent choices, and that education can improve these abilities.

Politically motivated educational reforms of the democratic type are recorded as far back as Plato in &quot;The Republic&quot;. In the United States, this lineage of democratic education reform was continued by Thomas Jefferson, who advocated ambitious reforms partly along Platonic lines for public schooling in Virginia.

Another motivation for reform is the desire to address socio-economic problems, which many people see as having significant roots in lack of education. Starting in the 20th century, people have attempted to argue that small improvements in education can have large returns in such areas as health, wealth and well-being. For example, in Kerala, India in the 1950s, increases in women&#x27;s health were correlated with increases in female literacy rates. In Iran, increased primary education was correlated with increased farming efficiencies and income. In both cases some researchers have concluded these correlations as representing an underlying causal relationship: education causes socio-economic benefits. In the case of Iran, researchers concluded that the improvements were due to farmers gaining reliable access to national crop prices and scientific farming information.

==History==

===Classical education===

As taught from the 18th to the 19th century, Western classical education curriculums focused on concrete details like &quot;Who?&quot;, &quot;What?&quot;, &quot;When?&quot;, &quot;Where?&quot;. Unless carefully taught, large group instruction naturally neglects asking the theoretical &quot;Why?&quot; and &quot;Which?&quot; questions that can be discussed in smaller groups.

Classical education in this period also did not teach local (vernacular) languages and culture. Instead, it taught high-status ancient languages (Greek and Latin) and their cultures. This produced odd social effects in which an intellectual class might be more loyal to ancient cultures and institutions than to their native vernacular languages and their actual governing authorities.

===18th century===

====Child-study====

Jean-Jacques Rousseau, father of the Child Study Movement, centered the child as an object of study.

In &quot;&quot;, Rousseau&#x27;s principal work on education lays out an educational program for a hypothetical newborn&#x27;s education through adulthood.

Rousseau provided a dual critique of the educational vision outlined in Plato&#x27;s Republic and that of his society in contemporary Europe. He regarded the educational methods contributing to the child&#x27;s development; he held that a person could either be a man or a citizen. While Plato&#x27;s plan could have brought the latter at the expense of the former, contemporary education failed at both tasks. He advocated a radical withdrawal of the child from society and an educational process that utilized the child&#x27;s natural potential and curiosity, teaching the child by confronting them with simulated real-life obstacles and conditioning the child through experience rather intellectual instruction.

Rousseau ideas were rarely implemented directly, but influenced later thinkers, particularly Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel, the inventor of the kindergarten.

====National identity====
European and Asian nations regard education as essential to maintaining national, cultural, and linguistic unity. In the late 18th century (~1779), Prussia instituted primary school reforms expressly to teach a unified version of the national language, &quot;Hochdeutsch&quot;.

One significant reform was kindergarten whose purpose was to have the children participate in supervised activities taught by instructors who spoke the national language. The concept embraced the idea that children absorb new language skills more easily and quickly when they are young

The current model of kindergarten is reflective of the Prussian model.

In other countries, such as the Soviet Union, France, Spain, and Germany, the Prussian model has dramatically improved reading and math test scores for linguistic minorities.

===19th century England===
In the 19th century, before the advent of government-funded public schools, Protestant organizations established Charity Schools to educate the lower social classes. The Roman Catholic Church and governments later adopted the model.

Designed to be inexpensive, Charity schools operated on minimal budgets and strived to serve as many needy children as possible. This led to the development of grammar schools, which primarily focused on teaching literacy, grammar, and bookkeeping skills so that the students could use books as an inexpensive resource to continue their education. &quot;Grammar&quot; was the first third of the then-prevalent system of classical education.

Educators Joseph Lancaster and Andrew Bell developed the monitorial system, also known as &quot;mutual instruction&quot; or the &quot;Bell–Lancaster method&quot;. Their contemporary, educationalist and writer Elizabeth Hamilton, suggested that in some important aspects the method had been &quot;anticipated&quot; by the Belfast schoolmaster David Manson. In the 1760s Manson had developed a peer-teaching and monitoring system within the context of what he called a &quot;play school&quot; that dispensed with &quot;the discipline of the rod&quot;. (More radically, Manson proposed the &quot;liberty of each [child] to take the quantity [of lessons] agreeable to his inclination&quot;).

Lancaster, an impoverished Quaker during the early 19th century in London and Bell at the Madras School of India developed this model independent of one another. However, by design, their model utilizes more advanced students as a resource to teach the less advanced students; achieving student-teacher ratios as small as 1:2 and educating more than 1000 students per adult. The lack of adult supervision at the Lancaster school resulted in the older children acting as disciplinary monitors and taskmasters.

To provide order and promote discipline the school implemented a unique internal economic system, inventing a currency called a &quot;Scrip.&quot; Although the currency was worthless in the outside world, it was created at a fixed exchange rate from a student&#x27;s tuition and student&#x27;s could use scrip to buy food, school supplies, books, and other items from the school store. Students could earn scrip through tutoring. To promote discipline, the school adopted a work-study model. Every job of the school was bid-for by students, with the largest bid winning. However, any student tutor could auction positions in his or her classes to earn scrip. The bids for student jobs paid for the adult supervision.
Lancaster promoted his system in a piece called Improvements in Education that spread widely throughout the English-speaking world. Lancaster schools provided a grammar-school education with fully developed internal economies for a cost per student near $40 per year in 1999 U.S. dollars. To reduce cost and motivated to save up scrip, Lancaster students rented individual pages of textbooks from the school library instead of purchasing the textbook. Student&#x27;s would read aloud their pages to groups. Students commonly exchanged tutoring and paid for items and services with receipts from &quot;down tutoring&quot;.

The schools did not teach submission to orthodox Christian beliefs or government authorities. As a result, most English-speaking countries developed mandatory publicly paid education explicitly to keep public education in &quot;responsible&quot; hands. These elites said that Lancaster schools might become dishonest, provide poor education, and were not accountable to established authorities. Lancaster&#x27;s supporters responded that any child could cheat given the opportunity, and that the government was not paying for the education and thus deserved no say in their composition.

Though motivated by charity, Lancaster claimed in his pamphlets to be surprised to find that he lived well on the income of his school, even while the low costs made it available to the most impoverished street children. Ironically, Lancaster lived on the charity of friends in his later life.

===Modern reformist===

Although educational reform occurred on a local level at various points throughout history, the modern notion of education reform is tied with the spread of compulsory education. Economic growth and the spread of democracy raised the value of education and increased the importance of ensuring that all children and adults have access to free, high-quality, effective education. Modern education reforms are increasingly driven by a growing understanding of what works in education and how to go about successfully improving teaching and learning in schools. However, in some cases, the reformers&#x27; goals of &quot;high-quality education&quot; has meant &quot;high-intensity education&quot;, with a narrow emphasis on teaching individual, test-friendly subskills quickly, regardless of long-term outcomes, developmental appropriateness, or broader educational goals.

==== Horace Mann ====

In the United States, Horace Mann (1796 – 1859) of Massachusetts used his political base and role as Secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Education to promote public education in his home state and nationwide. Advocating a substantial public investment be made in education, Mann and his proponents developed a strong system of state supported common schools..

His crusading style attracted wide middle class support. Historian Ellwood P. Cubberley asserts:
: No one did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people the conception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, free, and that its aims should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sectarian ends.
In 1852, Massachusetts passed a law making education mandatory. This model of free, accessible education spread throughout the country and in 1917 Mississippi was the final state to adopt the law.

==== John Dewey ====

John Dewey, a philosopher and educator based in Chicago and New York, helped conceptualize the role of American and international education during the first four decades of the 20th century. An important member of the American Pragmatist movement, he carried the subordination of knowledge to action into the educational world by arguing for experiential education that would enable children to learn theory and practice simultaneously; a well-known example is the practice of teaching elementary physics and biology to students while preparing a meal. He was a harsh critic of &quot;dead&quot; knowledge disconnected from practical human life.

Dewey criticized the rigidity and volume of humanistic education, and the emotional idealizations of education based on the child-study movement that had been inspired by Rousseau and those who followed him. Dewey understood that children are naturally active and curious and learn by doing. Dewey&#x27;s understanding of logic is presented in his work &quot;Logic, the Theory of Inquiry&quot; (1938). His educational philosophies were presented in &quot;My Pedagogic Creed&quot;, &quot;The School and Society&quot;, &quot;The Child and Curriculum&quot;, and &quot;Democracy and Education&quot; (1916). Bertrand Russell criticized Dewey&#x27;s conception of logic, saying &quot;What he calls &quot;logic&quot; does not seem to me to be part of logic at all; I should call it part of psychology.&quot;

Dewey left the University of Chicago in 1904 over issues relating to the Dewey School.

Dewey&#x27;s influence began to decline in the time after the Second World War and particularly in the Cold War era, as more conservative educational policies came to the fore.

====Administrative progressives====
The form of educational progressivism which was most successful in having its policies implemented has been dubbed &quot;administrative progressivism&quot; by historians. This began to be implemented in the early 20th century. While influenced particularly in its rhetoric by Dewey and even more by his popularizers, administrative progressivism was in its practice much more influenced by the Industrial Revolution and the concept economies of scale.

The administrative progressives are responsible for many features of modern American education, especially American high schools: counseling programs, the move from many small local high schools to large centralized high schools, curricular differentiation in the form of electives and tracking, curricular, professional, and other forms of standardization, and an increase in state and federal regulation and bureaucracy, with a corresponding reduction of local control at the school board level. (Cf. &quot;State, federal, and local control of education in the United States&quot;, below) (Tyack and Cuban, pp. 17–26)

These reforms have since become heavily entrenched, and many today who identify themselves as progressives are opposed to many of them, while conservative education reform during the Cold War embraced them as a framework for strengthening traditional curriculum and standards.

More recent methods, instituted by groups such as the think tank Reform&#x27;s education division, and S.E.R. have attempted to pressure the government of the U.K. into more modernist educational reform, though this has met with limited success.

== Public school reform in the United States ==
In the United States, public education is characterized as &quot;any federally funded primary or secondary school, administered to some extent by the government, and charged with educating all citizens. Although there is typically a cost to attend some public higher education institutions, they are still considered part of public education.&quot;

=== Colonial America ===
In what would become the United States, the first public school was established in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 23, 1635. Puritan schoolmaster Philemon Pormont led instruction at the Boston Latin School. During this time, post-secondary education was a commonly utilized tool to distinguish one&#x27;s social class and social status. Access to education was the &quot;privilege of white, upper-class, Christian male children&quot; in preparation for university education in ministry.

In colonial America, to maintain Puritan religious traditions, formal and informal education instruction focused on teaching literacy. All colonists needed to understand the written language on some fundamental level in order to read the Bible and the colony&#x27;s written secular laws. Religious leaders recognized that each person should be &quot;educated enough to meet the individual needs of their station in life and social harmony.&quot; The first compulsory education laws were passed in Massachusetts between 1642 and 1648 when religious leaders noticed not all parents were providing their children with &quot;proper&quot; education. These laws stated that all towns with 50 or more families were obligated to hire a schoolmaster to teach children reading, writing, and basic arithmetic.&quot;In 1642 the General Court passed a law that required heads of households to teach all their dependents — apprentices and servants as well as their own children — to read English or face a fine. Parents could provide the instruction themselves or hire someone else to do it. Selectmen were to keep &#x27;a vigilant eye over their brethren and neighbors,&#x27; young people whose education was neglected could be removed from their parents or masters.&quot;The 1647 law eventually led to establishing publicly funded district schools in all Massachusetts towns, although, despite the threat of fines, compliance and quality of public schools were less than satisfactory.&quot;Many towns were &#x27;shamefully neglectful&#x27; of children&#x27;s education. In 1718 &#x27;...by sad experience, it is found that many towns that not only are obliged by law, but are very able to support a grammar school, yet choose rather to incur and pay the fine or penalty than maintain a grammar school.&quot;When John Adams drafted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, he included provisions for a comprehensive education law that guaranteed public education to &quot;all&quot; citizens. However, access to formal education in secondary schools and colleges was reserved for free, white males. During the 17th and 18th centuries, females received little or no formal education except for home learning or attending Dame Schools. Likewise, many educational institutions maintained a policy of refusing to admit Black applicants. The Virginia Code of 1819 outlawed teaching enslaved people to read or write.

=== Post-revolution ===
Soon after the American Revolution, early leaders, like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, proposed the creation of a more &quot;formal and unified system of publicly funded schools&quot; to satiate the need to &quot;build and maintain commerce, agriculture and shipping interests&quot;. Their concept of free public education was not well received and did not begin to take hold on until the 1830s. However, in 1790, evolving socio-cultural ideals in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania led to the first significant and systematic reform in education legislation that mandated economic conditions would not inhibit a child&#x27;s access to education:&quot;Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania – 1790 &quot;ARTICLE VII Section I. The legislature shall, as soon as conveniently may be, provide, by law, for the establishment of schools throughout the state, in such manner that the poor may be taught gratis.&quot;&quot;

=== Reconstruction and the American Industrial Revolution ===
During Reconstruction, from 1865 to 1877, African Americans worked to encourage public education in the South. With the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, which held that &quot;segregated public facilities were constitutional so long as the black and white facilities were equal to each other&quot;, this meant that African American children were legally allowed to attend public schools, although these schools were still segregated based on race. However, by the mid-twentieth century, civil rights groups would challenge racial segregation.

During the second half of the nineteenth century (1870 and 1914), America&#x27;s Industrial Revolution refocused the nation&#x27;s attention on the need for a universally accessible public school system. Inventions, innovations, and improved production methods were critical to the continued growth of American manufacturing. To compete in the global economy, an overwhelming demand for literate workers that possessed practical training emerged. Citizens argued, &quot;educating children of the poor and middle classes would prepare them to obtain good jobs, thereby strengthen the nation&#x27;s economic position.&quot; Institutions became an essential tool in yielding ideal factory workers with sought-after attitudes and desired traits such as dependability, obedience, and punctuality. Vocationally oriented schools offered practical subjects like shop classes for students who were not planning to attend college for financial or other reasons. Not until the latter part of the 19th century did public elementary schools become available throughout the country. Although, it would be longer for children of color, girls, and children with special needs to attain access free public education.

===Mid 20th and early 21st century (United states)===
==== Civil rights reform ====
Systemic bias remained a formidable barrier. From the 1950s to the 1970s, many of the proposed and implemented reforms in U.S. education stemmed from the civil rights movement and related trends; examples include ending racial segregation, and busing for the purpose of desegregation, affirmative action, and banning of school prayer.

In the early 1950s, most U.S. public schools operated under a legally sanctioned racial segregation system. Civil Rights reform movements sought to address the biases that ensure unequal distribution of academic resources such as school funding, qualified and experienced teachers, and learning materials to those socially excluded communities. In the early 1950s, the NAACP lawyers brought class-action lawsuits on behalf of black schoolchildren and their families in Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware, petitioning court orders to compel school districts to let black students attend white public schools. Finally, in 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected that framework with Brown v. Board of Education and declared state-sponsored segregation of public schools unconstitutional.

In 1964, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act &quot;prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.&quot; Educational institutions could now utilize public funds to implement in-service training programs to assist teachers and administrators in establishing desegregation plans.

In 1965, the Higher Education Act (HEA) authorizes federal aid for postsecondary students.

The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) represents the federal government&#x27;s commitment to providing equal access to quality education; including those children from low-income families, limited English proficiency, and other minority groups. This legislation had positive retroactive implications for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, more commonly known as HBCUs.&quot;The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, defines an HBCU as: &quot;…any historically black college or university that was established prior to 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the education of black Americans, and that is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association determined by the Secretary [of Education] to be a reliable authority as to the quality of training offered or is, according to such an agency or association, making reasonable progress toward accreditation.&quot;Known as the Bilingual Education Act, Title VII of ESEA, offered federal aid to school districts to provide bilingual instruction for students with limited English speaking ability.

The Education Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-318, 86 Stat. 327) establishes the Education Division in the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the National Institute of Education. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 states, &quot;No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.&quot;

Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 - Civil Rights Amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965:&quot;Title I: Bilingual Education Act - Authorizes appropriations for carrying out the provisions of this Act. Establishes, in the Office of Education, an Office of Bilingual Education through which the Commissioner of Education shall carry out his functions relating to bilingual education. Authorizes appropriations for school nutrition and health services, correction education services, and ethnic heritage studies centers.

Title II: Equal Educational Opportunities and the Transportation of Students: Equal Educational Opportunities Act - Provides that no state shall deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin by means of specified practices...

Title IV: Consolidation of Certain Education Programs: Authorizes appropriations for use in various education programs including libraries and learning resources, education for use of the metric system of measurement, gifted and talented children programs, community schools, career education, consumers&#x27; education, women&#x27;s equity in education programs, and arts in education programs.

Community Schools Act - Authorizes the Commissioner to make grants to local educational agencies to assist in planning, establishing, expanding, and operating community education programs

Women&#x27;s Educational Equity Act - Establishes the Advisory Council on Women&#x27;s Educational Programs and sets forth the composition of such Council. Authorizes the Commissioner of Education to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, public agencies, private nonprofit organizations, and individuals for activities designed to provide educational equity for women in the United States.

Title V: Education Administration: Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)- Provides that no funds shall be made available under the General Education Provisions Act to any State or local educational agency or educational institution which denies or prevents the parents of students to inspect and review all records and files regarding their children.

Title VII: National Reading Improvement Program: Authorizes the Commissioner to contract with State or local educational agencies for the carrying out by such agencies, in schools having large numbers of children with reading deficiencies, of demonstration projects involving the use of innovative methods, systems, materials, or programs which show promise of overcoming such reading deficiencies.&quot;In 1975, The Education for All Handicapped Children Act (Public Law 94-142) ensured that all handicapped children (age 3-21) receive a &quot;free, appropriate public education&quot; designed to meet their special needs.

==== 1980–1989: A Nation at Risk ====

During the 1980s, some of the momentum of education reform moved from the left to the right, with the release of &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot;, Ronald Reagan&#x27;s efforts to reduce or eliminate the United States Department of Education. &quot;[T]he federal government and virtually all state governments, teacher training institutions, teachers&#x27; unions, major foundations, and the mass media have all pushed strenuously for higher standards, greater accountability, more &quot;time on task,&quot; and more impressive academic results&quot;.

Per the shift in educational motivation, families sought institutional alternatives, including &quot;charter schools, progressive schools, Montessori schools, Waldorf schools, Afrocentric schools, religious schools - or home school instruction in their communities.&quot;

In 1984 President Reagan enacted the Education for Economic Security Act

In 1989, the Child Development and Education Act of 1989 authorized funds for Head Start Programs to include child care services.

In the latter half of the decade, E. D. Hirsch put forth an influential attack on one or more versions of progressive education. Advocating an emphasis on &quot;cultural literacy&quot;—the facts, phrases, and texts.

See also Uncommon Schools.

====1990-1999: standards-based education model====
In 1994, the land grant system was expanded via the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to include tribal colleges.

Most states and districts in the 1990s adopted outcome-based education (OBE) in some form or another. A state would create a committee to adopt standards, and choose a quantitative instrument to assess whether the students knew the required content or could perform the required tasks.

In 1992 The National Commission on Time and Learning, Extension revise funding for civic education programs and those educationally disadvantaged children.&quot;

In 1994 the Improving America&#x27;s Schools Act (IASA) reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; amended as The Eisenhower Professional Development Program; IASA designated Title I funds for low income and otherwise marginalized groups; i.e., females, minorities, individuals with disabilities, individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). By tethering federal funding distributions to student achievement, IASA meant use high stakes testing and curriculum standards to hold schools accountable for their results at the same level as other students. The Act significantly increased impact aid for the establishment of the Charter School Program, drug awareness campaigns, bilingual education, and technology.

In 1998 The Charter School Expansion Act amended the Charter School Program, enacted in 1994.

==== 2000–2015: No Child Left Behind ====
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 appropriated funding to repair educational institution&#x27;s buildings as well as repair and renovate charter school facilities, reauthorized the Even Start program, and enacted the Children&#x27;s Internet Protection Act.

The standards-based National Education Goals 2000, set by the U.S. Congress in the 1990s, were based on the principles of outcomes-based education. In 2002, the standards-based reform movement culminated as the No Child left Behind Act of 2001 where achievement standard were set by each individual state. This federal policy was active until 2015 in the United States .

An article released by CBNC.com said a principal Senate Committee will take into account legislation that reauthorizes and modernizes the Carl D. Perkins Act. President George Bush approved this statute in 2006 on August 12, 2006. This new bill will emphasize the importance of federal funding for various Career and Technical (CTE) programs that will better provide learners with in-demand skills. Pell Grants are specific amount of money is given by the government every school year for disadvantaged students who need to pay tuition fees in college.

At present, there are many initiatives aimed at dealing with these concerns like innovative cooperation between federal and state governments, educators, and the business sector. One of these efforts is the Pathways to Technology Early College High School (P-TECH). This six-year program was launched in cooperation with IBM, educators from three cities in New York, Chicago, and Connecticut, and over 400 businesses. The program offers students in high school and associate programs focusing on the STEM curriculum. The High School Involvement Partnership, private and public venture, was established through the help of Northrop Grumman, a global security firm. It has given assistance to some 7,000 high school students (juniors and seniors) since 1971 by means of one-on-one coaching as well as exposure to STEM areas and careers.

==== 2016–2021: Every Student Succeeds Act ====
The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, enacted in 2009, reserved more than $85 billion in public funds to be used for education.

The 2009 Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association launch the Common Core State Standards Initiative.

In 2012 the Obama administration launched the Race to the Top competition aimed at spurring K–12 education reform through higher standards.&quot;The Race to the Top – District competition will encourage transformative change within schools, targeted toward leveraging, enhancing, and improving classroom practices and resources.

The four key areas of reform include:

* Development of rigorous standards and better assessments
* Adoption of better data systems to provide schools, teachers, and parents with information about student progress
* Support for teachers and school leaders to become more effective
* Increased emphasis and resources for the rigorous interventions needed to turn around the lowest-performing schools&quot;
In 2015, under the Obama administration, many of the more restrictive elements that were enacted under No Child Left Behind (NCLB, 2001), were removed in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, 2015) which limits the role of the federal government in school liability. Every Student Succeeds Act reformed educational standards by &quot;moving away from such high stakes and assessment based accountability models&quot; and focused on assessing student achievement from a holistic approach by utilizing qualitative measures. Some argue that giving states more authority can help prevent considerable discrepancies in educational performance across different states. ESSA was approved by former President Obama in 2015 which amended and empowered the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Department of Education has the choice to carry out measures in drawing attention to said differences by pinpointing lowest-performing state governments and supplying information on the condition and progress of each state on different educational parameters. It can also provide reasonable funding along with technical aid to help states with similar demographics collaborate in improving their public education programs.

==== Social and emotional learning: strengths-based education model ====
This uses a methodology that values purposeful engagement in activities that turn students into self-reliant and efficient learners. Holding on to the view that everyone possesses natural gifts that are unique to one&#x27;s personality (e.g. computational aptitude, musical talent, visual arts abilities), it likewise upholds the idea that children, despite their inexperience and tender age, are capable of coping with anguish, able to survive hardships, and can rise above difficult times.

==== Trump administration ====
In 2017, Betsy DeVos was instated as the 11th Secretary of Education. A strong proponent of school choice, school voucher programs, and charter schools, DeVos was a much-contested choice as her own education and career had little to do with formal experience in the US education system. In a Republican-dominated senate, she received a 50–50 vote - a tie that was broken by Vice President Mike Pence. Prior to her appointment, DeVos received a BA degree in business economics from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan and she served as chairman of an investment management firm, The Windquest Group. She supported the idea of leaving education to state governments under the new K-12 legislation. DeVos cited the interventionist approach of the federal government to education policy following the signing of the ESSA. The primary approach to that rule has not changed significantly. Her opinion was that the education movement populist politics or populism encouraged reformers to commit promises which were not very realistic and therefore difficult to deliver.

On July 31, 2018, President Donald Trump signed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (HR 2353) The Act reauthorized the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, a $1.2 billion program modified by the United States Congress in 2006. A move to change the Higher Education Act was also deferred.

The legislation enacted on July 1, 2019, replaced the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education (Perkins IV) Act of 2006. Stipulations in Perkins V enables school districts to make use of federal subsidies for all students&#x27; career search and development activities in the middle grades as well as comprehensive guidance and academic mentoring in the upper grades. At the same time, this law revised the meaning of &quot;special populations&quot; to include homeless persons, foster youth, those who left the foster care system, and children with parents on active duty in the United States armed forces.

== Barriers to reform ==

=== Education inequalities facing students of color ===
Another factor to consider in education reform is that of equity and access. Contemporary issues in the United States regarding education faces a history of inequalities that come with consequences for education attainment across different social groups.

==== Racial and socioeconomic class segregation ====
A history of racial, and subsequently class, segregation in the U.S. resulted from practices of law. Residential segregation is a direct result of twentieth century policies that separated by race using zoning and redlining practices, in addition to other housing policies, whose effects continue to endure in the United States. These neighborhoods that have been segregated de jure—by force of purposeful public policy at the federal, state, and local levels—disadvantage people of color as students must attend school near their homes.

With the inception of the New Deal between 1933 and 1939, and during and following World War II, federally funded public housing was explicitly racially segregated by the local government in conjunction with federal policies through projects that were designated for Whites or Black Americans in the South, Northeast, Midwest, and West. Following an ease on the housing shortage post-World War II, the federal government subsidized the relocation of Whites to suburbs. The Federal Housing and Veterans Administration constructed such developments on the East Coast in towns like Levittown on Long Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. On the West Coast, there was Panorama City, Lakewood, Westlake, and Seattle suburbs developed by Bertha and William Boeing. As White families left for the suburbs, Black families remained in public housing and were explicitly placed in Black neighborhoods. Policies such as public housing director, Harold Ickes&#x27;, &quot;neighborhood composition rule&quot; maintained this segregation by establishing that public housing must not interfere with pre-existing racial compositions of neighborhoods. Federal loan guarantees were given to builders who adhered to the condition that no sales were made to Black families and each deed prohibited re-sales to Black families, what the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) described as an &quot;incompatible racial element&quot;. In addition, banks and savings intuitions refused loans to Black families in White suburbs and Black families in Black neighborhoods. In the mid-twentieth century, urban renewal programs forced low-income black residents to reside in places farther from universities, hospitals, or business districts and relocation options consisted of public housing high-rises and ghettos.

This history of de jure segregation has impacted resource allocation for public education in the United States, with schools continuing to be segregated by race and class. Low-income White students are more likely than Black students to be integrated into middle-class neighborhoods and less likely to attend schools with other predominantly disadvantaged students. Students of color disproportionately attend underfunded schools and Title I schools in environments entrenched in environmental pollution and stagnant economic mobility with limited access to college readiness resources. According to research, schools attended by primarily Hispanic or African American students often have high turnover of teaching staff and are labeled high-poverty schools, in addition to having limited educational specialists, less available extracurricular opportunities, greater numbers of provisionally licensed teachers, little access to technology, and buildings that are not well maintained. With this segregation, more local property tax is allocated to wealthier communities and public schools&#x27; dependence on local property taxes has led to large disparities in funding between neighboring districts. The top 10% of wealthiest school districts spend approximately ten times more per student than the poorest 10% of school districts.

==== Racial wealth gap ====
This history of racial and socioeconomic class segregation in the U.S. has manifested into a racial wealth divide. With this history of geographic and economic segregation, trends illustrate a racial wealth gap that has impacted educational outcomes and its concomitant economic gains for minorities. Wealth or net worth—the difference between gross assets and debt—is a stock of financial resources and a significant indicator of financial security that offers a more complete measure of household capability and functioning than income. Within the same income bracket, the chance of completing college differs for White and Black students. Nationally, White students are at least 11% more likely to complete college across all four income groups. Intergenerational wealth is another result of this history, with White college-educated families three times as likely as Black families to get an inheritance of $10,000 or more. 10.6% of White children from low-income backgrounds and 2.5% of Black children from low-income backgrounds reach the top 20% of income distribution as adults. Less than 10% of Black children from low-income backgrounds reach the top 40%.

==== Access to early childhood education ====
These disadvantages facing students of color are apparent early on in early childhood education. By the age of five, children of color are impacted by opportunity gaps indicated by poverty, school readiness gap, segregated low-income neighborhoods, implicit bias, and inequalities within the justice system as Hispanic and African American boys account for as much as 60% of total prisoners within the incarceration population. These populations are also more likely to experience adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).

High-quality early care and education are less accessible to children of color, particularly African American preschoolers as findings from the National Center for Education Statistics show that in 2013, 40% of Hispanic and 36% White children were enrolled in learning center-based classrooms rated as high, while 25% of African American children were enrolled in these programs. 15% of African American children attended low ranking center-based classrooms. In home-based settings, 30% of White children and over 50% of Hispanic and African American children attended low rated programs.

==Contemporary issues (United States)==


===Overview===
In the first decade of the 21st century, several issues are salient in debates over further education reform:

* Longer school day or school year
* After-school tutoring
* Charter schools, school choice, or school vouchers
* Smaller class sizes
* Improved teacher quality
** Improved training
** Higher credential standards
** Generally higher pay to attract more qualified applicants
** Performance bonuses (&quot;merit pay&quot;)
** Firing low-performing teachers
* Internet and computer access in schools
* Track and reduce drop-out rate
* Track and reduce absenteeism
* English-only vs. bilingual education
* Mainstreaming or fully including students with special educational needs, rather than placing them in separate special schools
* Content of curriculum standards and textbooks
** What to teach, at what age, and to which students. Discussion points include the age at which children should learn to read, and the primary mathematical subject that is taught to adolescents – algebra, or statistics or personal finances.
* Funding, neglected infrastructure, and adequacy of educational supplies
* Student rights
*Education inequalities facing students of color

=== Private interest in American charter schools ===
Charter schools public independent institutions in which both the cost and risk are fully funded by the taxpayers. Some charter schools are nonprofit in name only and are structured in ways that individuals and private enterprises connected to them can make money. Other charter schools are for-profit. In many cases, the public is largely unaware of this rapidly changing educational landscape, the debate between public and private/market approaches, and the decisions that are being made that affect their children and communities. Critics have accused for-profit entities, (education management organizations, EMOs) and private foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, and the Walton Family Foundation of funding Charter school initiatives to undermine public education and turn education into a &quot;Business Model&quot; which can make a profit. In some cases a school&#x27;s charter is held by a non-profit that chooses to contract all of the school&#x27;s operations to a third party, often a for-profit, CMO. This arrangement is defined as a &quot;vendor-operated school&quot;, (&quot;VOS&quot;).

===School choice===
Economists, such as the late Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, advocate for school choice to promote excellence in education through competition and choice. Proponents claim that a competitive market for schooling provides a workable method of accountability for results. Public education vouchers permit guardians to select and pay any school, public or private, with public funds that were formerly allocated directly to local public schools. The theory is that children&#x27;s guardians will naturally shop for the best schools for their children, much as is already done at college level.

Many reforms based on school choice have led to slight to moderate improvements. Some teachers&#x27; union members see those improvements as insufficient to offset the decreased teacher pay and job security. For instance, New Zealand&#x27;s landmark reform in 1989, during which schools were granted substantial autonomy, funding was devolved to schools, and parents were given a free choice of which school their children would attend, led to moderate improvements in most schools. It was argued that the associated increases in inequity and greater racial stratification in schools nullified the educational gains. Others, however, argued that the original system created more inequity, due to lower income students being required to attend poorer performing inner city schools and not being allowed school choice or better educations that are available to higher income inhabitants of suburbs. Thus, it was argued that school choice promoted social mobility and increased test scores, especially in the cases of low income students. Similar results have been found in other jurisdictions. The small improvements produced by some school choice policies seem to reflect weaknesses in the ways that choice is implemented, rather than a failure of the basic principle itself.

===Teacher tenure===
Critics of teacher tenure claim that the laws protect ineffective teachers from being fired, which can be detrimental to student success. Tenure laws vary from state to state, but generally they set a probationary period during which the teacher proves themselves worthy of the lifelong position. Probationary periods range from one to three years. Advocates for tenure reform often consider these periods too short to make such an important decision; especially when that decision is exceptionally hard to revoke. Due process restriction protect tenured teachers from being wrongfully fired; however these restrictions can also prevent administrators from removing ineffective or inappropriate teachers. A 2008 survey conducted by the US Department of Education found that, on average, only 2.1% of teachers are dismissed each year for poor performance.

In October 2010 Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs had a consequential meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama to discuss U.S. competitiveness and the nation&#x27;s education system. During the meeting Jobs recommended pursuing policies that would make it easier for school principals to hire and fire teachers based on merit.

In 2012 tenure for school teachers was challenged in a California lawsuit called &quot;Vergara v. California&quot;. The primary issue in the case was the impact of tenure on student outcomes and on equity in education. On June 10, 2014, the trial judge ruled that California&#x27;s teacher tenure statute produced disparities that &quot;shock the conscience&quot; and violate the equal protection clause of the California Constitution.

===Funding levels===
According to a 2005 report from the OECD, the United States is tied for first place with Switzerland when it comes to annual spending per student on its public schools, with each of those two countries spending more than $11,000 (in U.S. currency).
Despite this high level of funding, U.S. public schools lag behind the schools of other rich countries in the areas of reading, math, and science. A further analysis of developed countries shows no correlation between per student spending and student performance, suggesting that there are other factors influencing education. Top performers include Singapore, Finland and Korea, all with relatively low spending on education, while high spenders including Norway and Luxembourg have relatively low performance. One possible factor is the distribution of the funding.

In the US, schools in wealthy areas tend to be over-funded while schools in poorer areas tend to be underfunded. These differences in spending between schools or districts may accentuate inequalities, if they result in the best teachers moving to teach in the most wealthy areas. The inequality between districts and schools led to 23 states instituting school finance reform based on adequacy standards that aim to increase funding to low-income districts. A 2018 study found that between 1990 and 2012, these finance reforms led to an increase in funding and test scores in the low income districts; which suggests finance reform is effective at bridging inter-district performance inequalities. It has also been shown that the socioeconomic situation of the students family has the most influence in determining success; suggesting that even if increased funds in a low income area increase performance, they may still perform worse than their peers from wealthier districts.

Starting in the early 1980s, a series of analyses by Eric Hanushek indicated that the amount spent on schools bore little relationship to student learning. This controversial argument, which focused attention on how money was spent instead of how much was spent, led to lengthy scholarly exchanges. In part the arguments fed into the class size debates and other discussions of &quot;input policies.&quot; It also moved reform efforts towards issues of school accountability (including No Child Left Behind) and the use of merit pay and other incentives.

There have been studies that show smaller class sizes and newer buildings (both of which require higher funding to implement) lead to academic improvements. It should also be noted that many of the reform ideas that stray from the traditional format require greater funding.

According to a 1999 article, William J. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, argued that increased levels of spending on public education have not made the schools better, citing the following statistics:

==Internationally==

=== Education for All ===
EDUCATION FOR ALL THROUGHOUT LIFE

 The EFA Assessment 2000 was launched in July 1998 with an aim to help countries to identify both problems and prospects for further progress of EFA, and to strengthen their capacity to improve and monitor the provision and outcomes of basic education. Some 179 countries set up National Assessment Groups which collected quantitative data focusing on eighteen core indicators and carried out case-studies to collect qualitative information. 
Education 2030 Agenda refers to the global commitment of the Education for All movement to ensure access to basic education for all. It is an essential part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The roadmap to achieve the Agenda is the Education 2030 Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action, which outlines how countries, working with UNESCO and global partners, can translate commitments into action.

The United Nations, over 70 ministers, representatives of member-countries, bilateral and multilateral agencies, regional organizations, academic institutions, teachers, civil society, and the youth supported the Framework for Action of the Education 2030 platform. The Framework was described as the outcome of continuing consultation to provide guidance for countries in implementing this Agenda. At the same time, it mobilizes various stakeholders in the new education objectives, coordination, implementation process, funding, and review of Education 2030.

=== Learning crisis ===
The learning crisis is the reality that while the majority of children around the world attend school, a large proportion of them are not learning. A World Bank study found that &quot;53 percent of children in low- and middle-income countries cannot read and understand a simple story by the end of primary school.&quot; While schooling has increased rapidly over the last few decades, learning has not followed suit. Many practitioners and academics call for education system reform in order to address the learning needs of all children.

==Digital education==

The movement to use computers more in education naturally includes many unrelated ideas, methods, and pedagogies since there are many uses for digital computers. For example, the fact that computers are naturally good at math leads to the question of the use of calculators in math education. The Internet&#x27;s communication capabilities make it potentially useful for collaboration, and foreign language learning. The computer&#x27;s ability to simulate physical systems makes it potentially useful in teaching science. More often, however, debate of digital education reform centers around more general applications of computers to education, such as electronic test-taking and online classes.

Another viable addition to digital education has been blended learning. In 2009, over 3 million K-12 students took an online course, compared to 2000 when 45,000 took an online course. Blended learning examples include pure online, blended, and traditional education. Research results show that the most effective learning takes place in a blended format. This allows children to view the lecture ahead of time and then spend class time practicing, refining, and applying what they have previously learned.

The idea of creating artificial intelligence led some computer scientists to believe that teachers could be replaced by computers, through something like an expert system; however, attempts to accomplish this have predictably proved inflexible. The computer is now more understood to be a tool or assistant for the teacher and students.

Harnessing the richness of the Internet is another goal. In some cases classrooms have been moved entirely online, while in other instances the goal is more to learn how the Internet can be more than a classroom.

Web-based international educational software is under development by students at New York University, based on the belief that current educational institutions are too rigid: effective teaching is not routine, students are not passive, and questions of practice are not predictable or standardized. The software allows for courses tailored to an individual&#x27;s abilities through frequent and automatic multiple intelligences assessments. Ultimate goals include assisting students to be intrinsically motivated to educate themselves, and aiding the student in self-actualization. Courses typically taught only in college are being reformatted so that they can be taught to any level of student, whereby elementary school students may learn the foundations of any topic they desire. Such a program has the potential to remove the bureaucratic inefficiencies of education in modern countries, and with the decreasing digital divide, help developing nations rapidly achieve a similar quality of education. With an open format similar to Wikipedia, any teacher may upload their courses online and a feedback system will help students choose relevant courses of the highest quality. Teachers can provide links in their digital courses to webcast videos of their lectures. Students will have personal academic profiles and a forum will allow students to pose complex questions, while simpler questions will be automatically answered by the software, which will bring you to a solution by searching through the knowledge database, which includes all available courses and topics.

The 21st century ushered in the acceptance and encouragement of internet research conducted on college and university campuses, in homes, and even in gathering areas of shopping centers. Addition of cyber cafes on campuses and coffee shops, loaning of communication devices from libraries, and availability of more portable technology devices, opened up a world of educational resources. Availability of knowledge to the elite had always been obvious, yet provision of networking devices, even wireless gadget sign-outs from libraries, made availability of information an expectation of most persons. Cassandra B. Whyte researched the future of computer use on higher education campuses focusing on student affairs. Though at first seen as a data collection and outcome reporting tool, the use of computer technology in the classrooms, meeting areas, and homes continued to unfold. The sole dependence on paper resources for subject information diminished and e-books and articles, as well as online courses, were anticipated to become increasingly staple and affordable choices provided by higher education institutions according to Whyte in a 2002 presentation.

Digitally &quot;flipping&quot; classrooms is a trend in digital education that has gained significant momentum. Will Richardson, author and visionary for the digital education realm, points to the not-so-distant future and the seemingly infinite possibilities for digital communication linked to improved education. Education on the whole, as a stand-alone entity, has been slow to embrace these changes. The use of web tools such as wikis, blogs, and social networking sites is tied to increasing overall effectiveness of digital education in schools. Examples exist of teacher and student success stories where learning has transcended the classroom and has reached far out into society.

The media has been instrumental in pushing formal educational institutions to become savvier in their methods. Additionally, advertising has been (and continues to be) a vital force in shaping students and parents thought patterns.

Technology is a dynamic entity that is constantly in flux. As time presses on, new technologies will continue to break paradigms that will reshape human thinking regarding technological innovation. This concept stresses a certain disconnect between teachers and learners and the growing chasm that started some time ago. Richardson asserts that traditional classroom&#x27;s will essentially enter entropy unless teachers increase their comfort and proficiency with technology.

Administrators are not exempt from the technological disconnect. They must recognize the existence of a younger generation of teachers who were born during the Digital Age and are very comfortable with technology. However, when old meets new, especially in a mentoring situation, conflict seems inevitable. Ironically, the answer to the outdated mentor may be digital collaboration with worldwide mentor webs; composed of individuals with creative ideas for the classroom.

<text>Ellensburg is a city in and the county seat of Kittitas County, Washington, United States. It is located just east of the Cascade Range near the junction of Interstate 90 and Interstate 82. The population was 18,666 at the 2020 census. and was estimated to be 18,703 in 2022.

The city is located along the Yakima River in the Kittitas Valley, an agricultural region that extends east towards the Columbia River. The valley is a major producer of timothy hay, which is processed and shipped internationally. Ellensburg is also the home of Central Washington University (CWU).

Ellensburg, originally named Ellensburgh for the wife of town founder John Alden Shoudy, was founded in 1871 and grew rapidly in the 1880s following the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway. The city was once a leading candidate to become the state capital of Washington, but its campaign was scuppered by a major fire in 1889.

==History==

John Alden Shoudy arrived in the Kittitas Valley in 1871 and purchased a small trading post from Andrew Jackson &quot;A.J.&quot; Splawn, called &quot;Robber&#x27;s Roost&quot;. Robber&#x27;s Roost was the first business in the valley, aside from the early trading that occurred among Native Americans, cattle drivers, trappers, and miners. A small stone monument to Robber&#x27;s Roost with a placard can be found at its original location, present-day 3rd Avenue, just west of Main Street near the alley.

Shoudy named the new town after his wife, Mary Ellen, thus officially starting the city of Ellensburgh around 1872. Shoudy had not been the first settler nor the first business person in the Kittitas Valley, but he was responsible for platting the city of Ellensburgh in the 1870s and also named the streets in the downtown district. Ellensburgh was officially incorporated on November 26, 1883. In 1894, the final -&quot;h&quot; was dropped under standardization pressure from the United States Postal Service and Board of Geography Names. Ellensburg was an early center of commerce in Washington and was among the first cities in the state to have electrical service.

The city launched a bid to become Washington state&#x27;s capital in 1889, preparing a site in the Capital Hill neighborhood for government offices. On July 4 that year, however, a major fire destroyed much of the downtown area and stalled the campaign, which resumed with a series of referendums, in which Washington voters chose Olympia. The state legislature selected Ellensburg as the location for the State Normal School (now Central Washington University).

There were several early newspapers in Ellensburg. &quot;The Daily Record&quot;, which started in 1909, is the publication which serves the city and county today. Concerns over the state of Ellensburg&#x27;s historic downtown led to the formation of the Ellensburg Downtown Association to work on revitalizing the area.

<text>Eugene ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Lane County, Oregon, United States. It is located at the southern end of the Willamette Valley, near the confluence of the McKenzie and Willamette rivers, about east of the Oregon Coast.

The second-most populous city in Oregon, Eugene had a population of 176,654 as of the 2020 United States census and it covers city area of . The Eugene-Springfield metropolitan statistical area is the second largest in Oregon after Portland. In 2022, Eugene&#x27;s population was estimated to have reached 179,887.

Eugene is home to the University of Oregon, Bushnell University, and Lane Community College. The city is noted for its natural environment, recreational opportunities (especially bicycling, running/jogging, rafting, and kayaking), and focus on the arts, along with its history of civil unrest, riots, and green activism. Eugene&#x27;s official motto is &quot;A Great City for the Arts and Outdoors&quot;. It is also referred to as the &quot;Emerald City&quot; and as &quot;Track Town, USA&quot;. The Nike Corporation had its beginnings in Eugene. In July 2022, the city hosted the 18th World Athletics Championship.

==History==
===Indigenous presence===

The first people to settle in the Eugene area were the Kalapuyans, also written Calapooia or Calapooya. They made &quot;seasonal rounds,&quot; moving around the countryside to collect and preserve local foods, including acorns, the bulbs of the wapato and camas plants, and berries. They stored these foods in their permanent winter village. When crop activities waned, they returned to their winter villages and took up hunting, fishing, and trading. They were known as the Chifin Kalapuyans and called the Eugene area where they lived &quot;Chifin&quot;, sometimes recorded as &quot;Chafin&quot; or &quot;Chiffin&quot;.

Other Kalapuyan tribes occupied villages that are also now within Eugene city limits. Pee-you or Mohawk Calapooians, Winefelly or Pleasant Hill Calapooians, and the Lungtum or Long Tom. They were close-neighbors to the Chifin, intermarried, and were political allies. Some authorities suggest the Brownsville Kalapuyans (Calapooia Kalapuyans) were related to the Pee-you. It is likely that since the Santiam had an alliance with the Brownsville Kalapuyans that the Santiam influence also went as far at Eugene.

According to archeological evidence, the ancestors of the Kalapuyans may have been in Eugene for as long as 10,000 years. In the 1800s their traditional way of life faced significant changes due to devastating epidemics and settlement, first by French fur traders and later by an overwhelming number of American settlers.

===Settlement and impact===
French fur traders had settled seasonally in the Willamette Valley by the beginning of the 19th century. Their settlements were concentrated in the &quot;French Prairie&quot; community in Northern Marion County but may have extended south to the Eugene area. Having already developed relationships with Native communities through intermarriage and trade, they negotiated for land from the Kalapuyans. By 1828 to 1830 they and their Native wives began year-round occupation of the land, raising crops and tending animals. In this process, the mixed race families began to impact Native access to land, food supply, and traditional materials for trade and religious practices.

In July 1830, &quot;intermittent fever&quot; struck the lower Columbia region and a year later, the Willamette Valley. Natives traced the arrival of the disease, then new to the Pacific Northwest, to the &quot;USS Owyhee&quot;, captained by John Dominis. &quot;Intermittent fever&quot; is thought by researchers now to be malaria. According to Robert T. Boyd, an anthropologist at Portland State University, the first three years of the epidemic, &quot;probably constitute the single most important epidemiological event in the recorded history of what would eventually become the state of Oregon&quot;. In his book &quot;The Coming of the Spirit Pestilence&quot; Boyd reports there was a 92% population loss for the Kalapuyans between 1830 and 1841. This catastrophic event shattered the social fabric of Kalapuyan society and altered the demographic balance in the Valley. This balance was further altered over the next few years by the arrival of Anglo-American settlers, beginning in 1840 with 13 people and growing steadily each year until within 20 years more than 11,000 American settlers, including Eugene Skinner, had arrived.

As the demographic pressure from the settlers grew, the remaining Kalapuyans were forcibly removed to Indian reservations. Though some Natives avoided transfer into the reservation, most were moved to the Grand Ronde reservation in 1856. Strict racial segregation was enforced and mixed race people, known as Métis in French, had to make a choice between the reservation and Anglo-American society. Native Americans could not leave the reservation without traveling papers and white people could not enter the reservation.

Eugene Franklin Skinner, after whom Eugene is named, arrived in the Willamette Valley in 1846 with 1,200 other settlers that year. Advised by the Kalapuyans to build on high ground to avoid flooding, he erected the first pioneer cabin on south or west slope of what the Kalapuyans called Ya-po-ah. The &quot;isolated hill&quot; is now known as Skinner&#x27;s Butte. The cabin was used as a trading post and was registered as an official post office on January 8, 1850.

At this time the settlement was known by settlers as Skinner&#x27;s Mudhole. It was relocated in 1853 and named Eugene City in 1853. Formally incorporated as a city in 1862, it was renamed to Eugene in 1889. Skinner ran a ferry service across the Willamette River where the Ferry Street Bridge now stands.

=== Educational institutions ===

The first major educational institution in the area was Columbia College, founded a few years earlier than the University of Oregon. It fell victim to two major fires in four years, and after the second fire, the college decided not to rebuild again. The part of south Eugene known as College Hill was the former location of Columbia College. There is no college there today.

The town raised the initial funding to start a public university, which later became the University of Oregon, with the hope of turning the small town into a center of learning. In 1872, the Legislative Assembly passed a bill creating the University of Oregon as a state institution. Eugene bested the nearby town of Albany in the competition for the state university. In 1873, community member J.H.D. Henderson donated the hilltop land for the campus, overlooking the city. The university first opened in 1876 with the regents electing the first faculty and naming John Wesley Johnson as president. The first students registered on October 16, 1876. The first building was completed in 1877; it was named Deady Hall in honor of the first Board of Regents President and community leader Judge Matthew P. Deady.

Other universities in Eugene include Bushnell University and New Hope Christian College.

=== Twentieth century ===

Eugene grew rapidly throughout most of the twentieth century, with the exception being the early 1980s when a downturn in the timber industry caused high unemployment. By 1985, the industry had recovered and Eugene began to attract more high-tech industries, earning it the moniker the &quot;Emerald Shire&quot;. In 2012, Eugene and the surrounding metro area was dubbed the Silicon shire.

The first Nike shoe was used in 1972 during the US Olympic trials held in Eugene.

=== Activism ===

The 1970s saw an increase in community activism. Local activists stopped a proposed freeway and lobbied for the construction of the Washington Jefferson Park beneath the Washington-Jefferson Street Bridge. Community Councils soon began to form as a result of these efforts. A notable impact of the turn to community-organized politics came with Eugene Local Measure 51, a ballot measure in 1978 that repealed a gay rights ordinance approved by the Eugene City Council in 1977 that prohibited discrimination by sexual orientation. Eugene is also home to Beyond Toxics, a nonprofit environmental justice organization founded in 2000.

One hotspot for protest activity since the 1990s has been the Whiteaker district, located in the northwest of downtown Eugene. The Whiteaker is primarily a working-class neighborhood that has become a cultural hub, center of community and activism and home to alternative artists. It saw an increase of activity in the 1990s after many young people drawn to Eugene&#x27;s political climate relocated there. Animal rights groups have had a heavy presence in the Whiteaker, and several vegan restaurants are located there. According to David Samuels, the Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front have had an underground presence in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is home to a number of communal apartment buildings, which are often organized by anarchist or environmentalist groups. Local activists have also produced independent films and started art galleries, community gardens, and independent media outlets. Copwatch, Food Not Bombs, and Critical Mass are also active in the neighborhood.

The 21st century has seen continued environmental and social justice activism. In 2011, the Occupy Eugene protests from October to December occurred in connection with the Occupy Wall Street movement, and these local protests included around 2000 participants. In 2020, George Floyd protests occurred in May and June, including peaceful demonstrations and riots. These protests in connection with the nationwide 2020 George Floyd protests resulted in increased consciousness towards Eugene&#x27;s black history and race issues and resulted in the renaming of University Hall and the toppling of the Pioneer and Pioneer mother statues at the University of Oregon. In 2023 and 2024, pro-Palestinian demonstrations were organized by many different activist groups across the city, and saw major events like marches with hundreds of participants, the April 15th, 2024 I-5 protest which blocked southbound I-5 traffic for hours and resulted in the largest mass arrests in Eugene activist history and the 2024 University of Oregon pro-Palestinian campus occupation as part of the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Eugene is at an elevation of .

To the north of downtown is Skinner Butte. Northeast of the city are the Coburg Hills. Spencer Butte is a prominent landmark south of the city. Mount Pisgah is southeast of Eugene and includes the Mount Pisgah Arboretum and the Howard Buford Recreation Area, a Lane County Park. Eugene is surrounded by foothills and forests to the south, east, and west, while to the north the land levels out into the Willamette Valley and consists of mostly farmland.

The Willamette and McKenzie Rivers run through Eugene and its neighboring city, Springfield. Another important stream is Amazon Creek, whose headwaters are near Spencer Butte. The creek discharges into the Long Tom River north Fern Ridge Reservoir, maintained for winter flood control by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Eugene Yacht Club hosts a sailing school and sailing regattas at Fern Ridge during summer months.

===Neighborhoods===
Eugene has 23 neighborhoods:

*Bethel
*Amazon
*Cal Young
*Churchill
*Downtown

*Industrial Corridor
*Jefferson Westside
*Laurel Hill
*Northeast
*River Road
*Santa Clara
*Southeast

*Trainsong
*West Eugene
*West University
*Whiteaker
The River Road and Santa Clara communities, which make up the northwestern part of the city, are neighborhoods within the urban growth boundary of Eugene. However, they are mostly outside of the city limits.

=== Climate ===
Like the rest of the Willamette Valley, Eugene lies in the Marine West Coast climate zone, with Mediterranean characteristics. Under the Köppen climate classification scheme, Eugene has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;). Temperatures can vary from cool to warm, with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Spring and fall are also moist seasons, with light rain falling for long periods. The average rainfall is , with the wettest &quot;rain year&quot; being from July 1973 to June 1974 with and the driest from July 2000 to June 2001 with . Measurements taken by NOAA over the past four decades have indicated a significant decline in average annual precipitation. From 1981 to 2010 inclusive, the reported annual average precipitation was , but for the thirty-year period ending in 2020, the annual average had declined , to . The figures from the second half of that period, or 2006 - 2020 inclusive, pointed to a further decline of more than , down to an annual average of .

Winter snowfall does occur, but it is sporadic and rarely accumulates in large amounts: the normal seasonal amount is , but the median is zero. The record snowfall was of accumulation due to a pineapple express on January 25–29, 1969. Ice storms, like snowfall, are rare, but occur sporadically.

The hottest months are July and August, with a normal monthly mean temperature of , with an average of 16 days per year reaching . The coolest month is December, with a mean temperature of , and there are 52 mornings per year with a low at or below freezing, and 2 afternoons with highs not exceeding the freezing mark. The coldest daytime high of the year averages , reaching the freezing point.

Eugene&#x27;s average annual temperature is , and annual precipitation at . Eugene is slightly cooler on average than Portland. Despite being located about south and at an only slightly higher elevation, Eugene has a more continental climate than Portland, less subject to the maritime air that blows inland from the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River. Eugene&#x27;s normal annual mean minimum is , compared to in Portland; in August, the gap in the normal mean minimum widens to for Eugene and Portland, respectively. Eugene&#x27;s warmest night annually averages a modest . Average winter temperatures (and summer high temperatures) are similar for the two cities.

Extreme temperatures range from , recorded on December 8, 1972, to on June 27, 2021; the record cold daily maximum is , recorded on December 13, 1919, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is on July 22, 2006.

====Air quality and allergies====
Eugene is downwind of Willamette Valley grass seed farms. The combination of summer grass pollen and the confining shape of the hills around Eugene make it &quot;the area of the highest grass pollen counts in the USA (&gt;1,500 pollen grains/m3 of air).&quot; These high pollen counts have led to difficulties for some track athletes who compete in Eugene. In the Olympic trials in 1972, &quot;Jim Ryun won the 1,500 after being flown in by helicopter because he was allergic to Eugene&#x27;s grass seed pollen.&quot; Further, six-time Olympian Maria Mutola abandoned Eugene as a training area &quot;in part to avoid allergies&quot;.

== Economy ==
Eugene&#x27;s largest employers are PeaceHealth Medical Group, the University of Oregon, and the Eugene School District. Eugene&#x27;s largest industries are wood products manufacturing and recreational vehicle manufacturing.

Corporate headquarters for the employee-owned Bi-Mart corporation and family-owned supermarket Market of Choice remain in Eugene.

Many multinational businesses were launched in Eugene. Some of the most famous include Nike, Taco Time, and Broderbund Software.

The footwear repair product Shoe Goo is manufactured by Eclectic Products, based in Eugene.

Run Gum, an energy gum created for runners, also began its life in Eugene. Run Gum was created by track athlete Nick Symmonds and track and field coach Sam Lapray in 2014.

Burley Design LLC produces bicycle trailers and was founded in Eugene by Alan Scholz out of a Saturday Market business in 1978. Eugene is also the birthplace and home of Bike Friday bicycle manufacturer Green Gear Cycling.

Organically Grown Company, the largest distributor of organic fruits and vegetables in the northwest, started in Eugene in 1978 as a non-profit co-op for organic farmers. Notable local food processors, many of whom manufacture certified organic products, include Golden Temple (Yogi Tea), Merry Hempsters, Springfield Creamery (Nancy&#x27;s Yogurt), and Mountain Rose Herbs.

Until July 2008, Hynix Semiconductor America had operated a large semiconductor plant in west Eugene. In late September 2009, Uni-Chem of South Korea announced its intention to purchase the Hynix site for solar cell manufacturing. However, this deal fell through and as of late 2012, is no longer planned. In 2015, semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom purchased the plant with plans to upgrade and reopen it. The company abandoned these plans and put it up for sale in November 2016.

Luckey&#x27;s Club Cigar Store is one of the oldest bars in Oregon. Tad Luckey Sr. purchased it in 1911, making it one of the oldest businesses in Eugene. The &quot;Club Cigar&quot;, as it was called in the late 19th century, was for many years a men-only salon. It survived both the Great Depression and Prohibition, partly because Eugene was a &quot;dry town&quot; before the end of Prohibition.

The city has over 25 breweries, offers a variety of dining options with a local focus; the city is surrounded by wineries. The most notable fungi here is the truffle; Eugene hosts the annual Oregon Truffle Festival in January.

In 2012, the Eugene metro region was dubbed the Silicon Shire for its growing tech industry.

===Top employers===
According to Eugene&#x27;s 2017 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the city&#x27;s top employers are:


=== Homelessness ===
Eugene has a growing problem with homelessness. The problem has been referenced in popular culture, including in the episode The 30% Iron Chef in Futurama. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the city experienced a controversy over its continuing policy of homeless removal, despite CDC guidelines to not engage in homeless removal.

== Arts and culture ==

Eugene has a significant population of people in pursuit of alternative ideas and a large original hippie population. Beginning in the 1960s, the countercultural ideas and viewpoints espoused by area native Ken Kesey became established as the seminal elements of the vibrant social tapestry that continue to define Eugene. The Merry Prankster, as Kesey was known, has arguably left the most indelible imprint of any cultural icon in his hometown. He is best known as the author of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and as the male protagonist in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;.

In 2005, the city council unanimously approved a new slogan for the city: &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest City for the Arts &amp; Outdoors&quot;. While Eugene has a vibrant arts community for a city its size, and is well situated near many outdoor opportunities, this slogan was frequently criticized by locals as embarrassing and ludicrous. In early 2010, the slogan was changed to &quot;A Great City for the Arts &amp; Outdoors.&quot;

Eugene&#x27;s Saturday Market, open every Saturday from April through November, was founded in 1970 as the first &quot;Saturday Market&quot; in the United States. It is adjacent to the Lane County Farmer&#x27;s Market in downtown Eugene. All vendors must create or grow all their own products. The market reappears as the &quot;Holiday Market&quot; between Thanksgiving and New Year&#x27;s in the Lane County Events Center at the fairgrounds.

===Community===
Eugene is noted for its &quot;community inventiveness.&quot; Many U.S. trends in community development originated in Eugene. The University of Oregon&#x27;s participatory planning process, known as The Oregon Experiment, was the result of student protests in the early 1970s. The book of the same name is a major document in modern enlightenment thinking in planning and architectural circles. The process, still used by the university in modified form, was created by Christopher Alexander, whose works also directly inspired the creation of the Wiki. Some research for the book &quot;A Pattern Language&quot;, which inspired the Design Patterns movement and Extreme Programming, was done by Alexander in Eugene. Not coincidentally, those engineering movements also had origins here. Decades after its publication, &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; is still one of the best-selling books on urban design.

In the 1970s, Eugene was packed with cooperative and community projects. It still has small natural food stores in many neighborhoods, some of the oldest student cooperatives in the country, and alternative schools have been part of the school district since 1971. The old Grower&#x27;s Market, downtown near the Amtrak depot, is the only food cooperative in the U.S. with no employees. It is possible to see Eugene&#x27;s trend-setting non-profit tendencies in much newer projects, such as Square One Villages and the Center for Appropriate Transport. In 2006, an initiative began to create a tenant-run development process for downtown Eugene.

In the fall of 2003, neighbors noticed &quot;an unassuming two-acre remnant orchard tucked into the Friendly Area Neighborhood&quot; had been put up for sale by its owner, a resident of New York City. Learning a prospective buyer had plans to build several houses on the property, they formed a nonprofit organization called Madison Meadow in June 2004 in order to buy the property and &quot;preserve it as undeveloped space in perpetuity.&quot; In 2007 their effort was named Third Best Community Effort by the &quot;Eugene Weekly&quot;, and by the end of 2008 they had raised enough money to purchase the property.

The City of Eugene has an active Neighborhood Program. Several neighborhoods are known for their green activism. Friendly Neighborhood has a highly popular neighborhood garden established on the right of way of a street never built. There are a number of community gardens on public property. Amazon Neighborhood has a former church turned into a community center. Whiteaker hosts a housing co-op that dates from the early 1970s that has re-purposed both their parking lots into food production and play space. An unusual eco-village with natural building techniques and large shared garden can be found in Jefferson Westside neighborhood. A several block area in the River Road Neighborhood is known as a permaculture hotspot with an increasing number of suburban homes trading grass for garden, installing rain water catchment systems, food producing landscapes and solar retrofits. Several sites have planted gardens by removing driveways. Citizen volunteers are working with the City of Eugene to restore a 65-tree filbert grove on public property. There are deepening social and economic networks in the neighborhood.

===Annual cultural events===
*Asian Celebration, presented by the Asian Council of Eugene and Springfield, takes place in late July at Alton Baker Park. The festival was changed to an outdoor venue after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
* The KLCC Microbrew Festival is held in February at the Lane County Fairgrounds. It provides participants with an introduction to a large range of microbrewery and craft beers, which play an important role in Pacific Northwest culture and the economy.
*Mount Pisgah Arboretum, which resides at the base of Mount Pisgah, holds a Wildflower Festival in May and a Mushroom Festival and Plant Sale in October.
*Oregon Festival of American Music, or OFAM is held annually in the early summer.
* The Oregon Bach Festival is a major international festival in July, hosted by the University of Oregon.
*The nonprofit Oregon Country Fair takes place in July in nearby Veneta.
* The Lane County Fair occurs in July at the Lane County Fairgrounds.
* The Eugene/Springfield Pride Festival is held annually on the second Saturday in August from noon to 7:00 p.m. at Alton Baker Park. A part of Eugene LGBT culture since 1993, it provides a lighthearted and supportive social venue for the LGBT community, families, and friends.
*Eugene Celebration is a three-day block party that usually takes place in the downtown area in August or September. The SLUG Queen coronation in August, a pageant with a campy spin, crowns a new SLUG Queen who &quot;rains&quot; over the Eugene Celebration Parade and is an unofficial ambassador of Eugene.

===Museums===
Eugene museums include the University of Oregon&#x27;s Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art and Museum of Natural and Cultural History, the Oregon Air and Space Museum, Lane County History Museum, Maude Kerns Art Center, Shelton McMurphey Johnson House, and the Eugene Science Center.

===Performing arts===

Eugene is home to numerous cultural organizations, including the Eugene Symphony (whose previous music directors include Marin Alsop, Giancarlo Guerrero, and Miguel Harth-Bedoya); the Eugene Ballet, a professional full-time touring company; the Eugene Opera, the Eugene Concert Choir, the Bushnell University Community Choir, the Oregon Mozart Players, the Oregon Bach Festival, the Oregon Children&#x27;s Choir, the Eugene-Springfield Youth Orchestras, Ballet Fantastique and Oregon Festival of American Music. Principal performing arts venues include the Hult Center for the Performing Arts, The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts (&quot;The Shedd&quot;), the McDonald Theatre, and W.O.W. Hall.

The University of Oregon School of Music and Dance also attracts world class performers and teaching artists throughout the year, many of whom perform at Beall Concert Hall. The university campus also frequently hosts performances at Matthew Knight Arena and the Erb Memorial Union ballroom.

A number of live theater groups are based in Eugene, including Free Shakespeare in the Park, Oregon Contemporary Theatre, The Very Little Theatre, Actors Cabaret, LCC Theatre, Rose Children&#x27;s Theatre, and University Theatre. Each has its own performance venue.

====Music====

Because of its status as a college town, Eugene has been home to many music genres, musicians and bands, ranging from electronic dance music such as dubstep and drum and bass to garage rock, hip hop, folk and heavy metal. Eugene also has growing reggae and street-performing bluegrass and jug band scenes. Multi-genre act the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies became a prominent figure in Eugene&#x27;s music scene and became the house band at Eugene&#x27;s W.O.W. Hall. In the late 1990s, their contributions to the swing revival movement propelled them to national stardom. Rock band Floater originated in Eugene as did the Robert Cray blues band. Doom metal band YOB is among the leaders of the Eugene heavy music scene.

Eugene is home to &quot;Classical Gas&quot; Composer and two-time Grammy award winner Mason Williams who spent his years as a youth living between his parents in Oakridge, Oregon and Oklahoma. Mason Williams puts on a yearly Christmas show at the Hult center for performing arts with a full orchestra produced by author, audio engineer and University of Oregon professor Don Latarski.

Dick Hyman, noted jazz pianist and musical director for many of Woody Allen&#x27;s films, designs and hosts the annual Now Hear This! jazz festival at the Oregon Festival of American Music (OFAM). OFAM and the Hult Center routinely draw major jazz talent for concerts.

Eugene is also home to a large Zimbabwean music community. Kutsinhira Cultural Arts Center, which is &quot;dedicated to the music and people of Zimbabwe,&quot; is based in Eugene. The city of Eugene is mentioned in the Johnny Cash song &quot;Lumberjack&quot;.

===Visual arts===
Eugene&#x27;s visual arts community is supported by over 20 private art galleries and several organizations, including Maude Kerns Art Center, Lane Arts Council, DIVA (the Downtown Initiative for the Visual Arts) and the Eugene Glass School.

In 2015 installations from a group of Eugene-based artists known as Light At Play were showcased in several events around the world as part of the International Year of Light, including displays at the Smithsonian and the National Academy of Sciences.

====Film====
The Eugene area has been used as a filming location for several Hollywood films, most famously for 1978&#x27;s &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, which was also filmed in nearby Cottage Grove. John Belushi had the idea for the film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; during filming of &quot;Animal House&quot; when he happened to meet Curtis Salgado at what was then the Eugene Hotel.

&quot;Getting Straight&quot;, starring Elliott Gould and Candice Bergen, was filmed at Lane Community College in 1969. As the campus was still under construction at the time, the &quot;occupation scenes&quot; were easier to shoot.

The &quot;Chicken Salad on Toast&quot; scene in the 1970 Jack Nicholson movie &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; was filmed at the Denny&#x27;s restaurant at the southern I-5 freeway interchange near Glenwood. Nicholson directed the 1971 film &quot;Drive, He Said&quot; in Eugene.

&quot;How to Beat the High Cost of Living&quot;, starring Jane Curtin, Jessica Lange and Susan St. James, was filmed in Eugene in the fall of 1979. Locations visible in the film include Valley River Center (which is a driving force in the plot), Skinner Butte and Ya-Po-Ah Terrace, the Willamette River and River Road Hardware.

Several track and field movies have used Eugene as a setting and/or a filming location. &quot;Personal Best&quot;, starring Mariel Hemingway, was filmed in Eugene in 1982. The film centered on a group of women who are trying to qualify for the Olympic track and field team. Two track and field movies about the life of Steve Prefontaine, &quot;Prefontaine&quot; and &quot;Without Limits&quot;, were released within a year of each other in 1997–1998. Kenny Moore, Eugene-trained Olympic runner and co-star in &quot;Prefontaine&quot;, co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Without Limits&quot;. &quot;Prefontaine&quot; was filmed in Washington because the &quot;Without Limits&quot; production bought out Hayward Field for the summer to prevent its competition from shooting there. Kenny Moore also wrote a biography of Bill Bowerman, played in &quot;Without Limits&quot; by Donald Sutherland back in Eugene 20 years after he had appeared in &quot;Animal House&quot;. Moore had also had a role in &quot;Personal Best&quot;.

&quot;Stealing Time&quot;, a 2003 independent film, was partially filmed in Eugene. When the film premiered in June 2001 at the Seattle International Film Festival, it was titled &quot;Rennie&#x27;s Landing&quot; after a popular bar near the University of Oregon campus. The title was changed for its DVD release. &quot;Zerophilia&quot; was filmed in Eugene in 2006.

The 2016 &quot;Tracktown&quot; was about a distance runner training for the Olympics in Eugene.

===Religion===
Religious institutions of higher learning in Eugene include Bushnell University and New Hope Christian College. Bushnell University (formerly Northwest Christian University), founded in 1895, has ties with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). New Hope Christian College (formerly Eugene Bible College) originated with the Bible Standard Conference in 1915, which joined with Open Bible Evangelistic Association to create Open Bible Standard Churches in 1932. Eugene Bible College was started from this movement by Fred Hornshuh in 1925.

There are two Eastern Orthodox Church parishes in Eugene: St John the Wonderworker Orthodox Christian Church in the Historic Whiteaker Neighborhood and Saint George Greek Orthodox Church.

There are six Roman Catholic parishes in Eugene as well: St. Mary Catholic Church, St. Jude Catholic Church, St. Mark Catholic Church, St. Peter Catholic Church, St. Paul Catholic Church, and St. Thomas More Catholic Church.

Eugene also has a Ukrainian Catholic Church named Nativity of the Mother of God.

There is a mainline Protestant contingency in the city as well—such as the largest of the Lutheran Churches, Central Lutheran near the U of O Campus and the Episcopal Church of the Resurrection.

The Eugene area has a sizeable LDS Church presence, with three stakes, consisting of 23 congregations (wards and branches). The Church of Jesus Christ announced plans in April 2020 to build a temple in Eugene.

The greater Eugene-Springfield area also has a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses presence with five Kingdom Halls, several having multiple congregations in one Kingdom Hall.

The Reconstructionist Temple Beth Israel is Eugene&#x27;s largest Jewish congregation. It was also, for many decades, Eugene&#x27;s only synagogue, until Orthodox members broke away in 1992 and formed &quot;Congregation Ahavas Torah&quot;.

Eugene has a community of some 140 Sikhs, who have established a Sikh temple.

The 340-member congregation of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Eugene (UUCE) purchased the former Eugene Scottish Rite Temple in May 2010, renovated it, and began services there in September 2012.

Saraha Nyingma Buddhist Temple in Eugene opened in 2012 in the former site of the Unitarian Universalist Church.

The First Congregational Church, UCC is a large progressive Christian Church with a long history of justice focused ministries and a very active membership. Three years ago, the congregation coordinated with the Connections Program of the St Vincent DePaul organization to provide transitional homes for two unhoused families on the church&#x27;s property. Through life - skills support and training and a more stable housing situation these families are then able to make their way into independent living.

==Sports==
Eugene markets itself as &quot;Track Town USA&quot;. There are close links between the University of Oregon&#x27;s successful track &amp; field program, the Oregon Track Club, and Nike, Inc, who were founded by University of Oregon track athlete Phil Knight and his coach, Bill Bowerman.

Eugene&#x27;s miles of running trails, through its unusually large park system, are among the most extensive in the U.S. Notable trails include Pre&#x27;s Trail in Alton Baker Park, Rexius Trail, the Adidas Oregon Trail, and the Ridgeline Trail. There is also an extensive network of trails along the Willamette River that reaches into neighboring Springfield, as well as along Amazon Creek in the southern and western parts of town.

Jogging was introduced to the U.S. through Eugene, brought from New Zealand by Bill Bowerman, who wrote the best-selling book &quot;Jogging&quot;, and coached the champion University of Oregon track and cross country teams. During Bowerman&#x27;s tenure, his &quot;Men of Oregon&quot; won 24 individual NCAA titles, including titles in 15 out of the 19 events contested. During Bowerman&#x27;s 24 years at Oregon, his track teams finished in the top ten at the NCAA championships 16 times, including four team titles (1962, &#x27;64, &#x27;65, &#x27;70), and two second-place trophies. His teams also posted a dual meet record of 114–20.

Bowerman also invented the waffle sole for running shoes in Eugene, and with Oregon alumnus Phil Knight founded shoe giant Nike. The city has dozens of running clubs. The climate is cool and temperate, good both for jogging and record-setting. Eugene is home to the University of Oregon&#x27;s Hayward Field track, which hosts numerous collegiate and amateur track and field meets throughout the year, most notably the Prefontaine Classic. Hayward Field was host to the 2004 AAU Junior Olympic Games, the 1989 World Masters Athletics Championships, the track and field events of the 1998 World Masters Games, the 2006 Pacific-10 track and field championships, the 1971, 1975, 1986, 1993, 1999, 2001, 2009, and 2011 USA Track &amp; Field Outdoor Championships and the 1972, 1976, 1980, 2008, 2012, and 2016 U.S. Olympic trials. Eugene was the host of the delayed 2021 World Athletics Championships. The city bid for the 2019 event but lost narrowly to Doha, Qatar.
Eugene&#x27;s Oregon Ducks are part of the Big Ten Conference. American football is especially popular, with intense rivalries between the Ducks and both the Oregon State University Beavers and the University of Washington Huskies. Autzen Stadium is home to Duck football, with a seating capacity of 54,000 but has had over 60,000 with standing room only. The basketball arena, McArthur Court, was built in 1926. The arena was replaced by the Matthew Knight Arena in late 2010.

The Nationwide Tour&#x27;s golfing event Oregon Classic takes place at Shadow Hills Country Club, just north of Eugene. The event has been played every year since 1998, except in 2001 when it was slated to begin the day after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The top 20 players from the Nationwide Tour are promoted to the PGA Tour for the following year.

Eugene is also home to the Eugene Emeralds, a short-season Class A minor-league baseball team. The &quot;Ems&quot; play their home games in PK Park, also the home of the University of Oregon baseball team. The Eugene Jr. Generals, a Tier III Junior &quot;A&quot; ice hockey team belonging to the Northern Pacific Hockey League (NPHL) consisting of 8 teams throughout Oregon and Washington, plays at the Lane County Ice Center. Lane United FC, a soccer club that participates in the Northwest Division of USL League Two, was founded in 2013 and plays its home games at Civic Park.

The following table lists some sports clubs in Eugene and their usual home venue:

==Parks and recreation==

Spencer Butte Park at the southern edge of town provides access to Spencer Butte, a dominant feature of Eugene&#x27;s skyline. Hendricks Park, situated on a knoll to the east of downtown, is known for its rhododendron garden and nearby memorial to Steve Prefontaine, known as Pre&#x27;s Rock, where the legendary University of Oregon runner was killed in an auto accident. Alton Baker Park, next to the Willamette River, contains Pre&#x27;s Trail. Also next to the Willamette are Skinner Butte Park and the Owen Memorial Rose Garden, which contains more than 4,500 roses of over 400 varieties, as well as the 150-year-old Black Tartarian Cherry tree, an Oregon Heritage Tree.

The city of Eugene maintains an urban forest. The University of Oregon campus is an arboretum, with over 500 species of trees. The city operates and maintains scenic hiking trails that pass through and across the ridges of a cluster of hills in the southern portion of the city, on the fringe of residential neighborhoods. Some trails allow biking, and others are for hikers and runners only.

The nearest ski resort, Willamette Pass, is one hour from Eugene by car. On the way, along Oregon Route 58, are several reservoirs and lakes, the Oakridge mountain bike trails, hot springs, and waterfalls within Willamette National Forest. Eugene residents also frequent the Hoodoo and Mount Bachelor ski resorts. The Three Sisters Wilderness, the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, and Smith Rock are just a short drive away.

== Government ==
In 1944, Eugene adopted a council–manager form of government, replacing the day-to-day management of city affairs by the part-time mayor and volunteer city council with a full-time professional city manager. The subsequent history of Eugene city government has largely been one of the dynamics—often contentious—between the city manager, the mayor and city council.

According to statute, all Eugene and Lane County elections are officially non-partisan, with a primary containing all candidates in May. If a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote in the primary, they win the election outright, otherwise the top two candidates face off in a November runoff. This allows candidates to win seats during the lower-turnout primary election.

The mayor of Eugene is Kaarin Knudson, who took office in January 2025. Recent mayors include Edwin Cone (1958–69), Les Anderson (1969–77) Gus Keller (1977–84), Brian Obie (1985–88), Jeff Miller (1989–92), Ruth Bascom (1993–96), Jim Torrey (1997–2004), Kitty Piercy (2005–2017), and Lucy Vinis (2017-25).

Eugene-Springfield Fire Department is the agency responsible for emergency medical services, fire suppression, HAZMAT operations and water/Confined spaces rescues in the combined Eugene-Springfield metropolitan area.

Eugene used to have an ordinance which prohibited car horn usage for non-driving purposes. After several residents were cited for this offense during the anti-Gulf War demonstrations in January 1991, the city was taken to court and in 1992 the Oregon Court of Appeals overturned the ordinance, finding it unconstitutionally vague. Eugene City Hall was abandoned in 2012 for reasons of structural integrity, energy efficiency, and obsolete size. Various offices of city government became tenants in eight other buildings.

===Politics===

Being the largest city by far in Lane County, Eugene&#x27;s voters almost always decide the county&#x27;s partisan tilt. While Eugene has historically been a counter-culture-heavy and left-leaning college town, the county&#x27;s partisan leanings have intensified in recent decades, mirroring the general polarization of Oregon voters along urban (pro-Democratic) and rural (pro-Republican) lines.

Lane County voted for Bernie Sanders over eventual 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton by 60.6-38.1%, and Eugene offered Sanders an even larger share of its vote.

== Infrastructure ==

===Transportation===

====Bus====
Lane Transit District (LTD), a public transportation agency formed in 1970, covers of Lane County, including Creswell, Cottage Grove, Junction City, Veneta, and Blue River. Operating more than 90 buses during peak hours, LTD carries riders on 3.7 million trips every year. LTD also operates a bus rapid transit line that runs between Eugene and Springfield—Emerald Express (EmX)—much of which runs in its own lane, with stations providing for off-board fare payment. LTD&#x27;s main terminus in Eugene is at the Eugene Station. LTD also offers paratransit.

Greyhound Lines provides service between Los Angeles and Portland on the I-5 corridor.

====Cycling====
Cycling is popular in Eugene and many people commute via bicycle. Summertime events and festivals frequently have valet bicycle parking corrals that are often filled to capacity by three hundred or more bikes. Many people commute to work by bicycle every month of the year. PeaceHealth Rides, a bike share system formerly operated by Uber subsidiary JUMP, and currently operated by non-profit Cascadia Mobility, offers 300 city-owned bicycles available to the public for a small fee. Bike trails take commuting and recreational bikers along the Willamette River past a scenic rose garden, along Amazon Creek, through the downtown, and through the University of Oregon campus. Eugene is close to many popular mountain bike trails, and Disciples of Dirt is the local mountain bike club that organizes group rides and promotes trail stewardship.

In 2009, the League of American Bicyclists cited Eugene as 1 of 10 &quot;Gold-level&quot; cities in the U.S. because of its &quot;remarkable commitments to bicycling.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Bicycling&quot; magazine named Eugene the 5th most bike-friendly city in America. The U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s annual American Community Survey reported that Eugene had a bicycle commuting mode share of 7.3% in 2011, the fifth highest percentage nationwide among U.S. cities with 65,000 people or more, and 13 times higher than the national average of 0.56%.

====Rail====
The 1908 Amtrak depot downtown was restored in 2004; it is the southern terminus for two daily runs of the Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot;, and a stop along the route in each direction for the daily &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;.

====Air travel====
Air travel is served by the Eugene Airport, also known as Mahlon Sweet Field, which is the fifth largest airport in the Northwest and second largest airport in Oregon. The Eugene Metro area also has numerous private airports. The Eugene Metro area also has several heliports, such as the Sacred Heart Medical Center Heliport and Mahlon Sweet Field Heliport, and many single helipads.

====Highways====
Highways traveling within and through Eugene include:
*Interstate 5: Interstate 5 forms much of the eastern city limit, acting as an effective, though unofficial boundary between Eugene and Springfield. To the north, I-5 leads to the Willamette Valley and Portland. To the south, I-5 leads to Roseburg, Medford, and the southwestern portion of the state. In full, Interstate 5 continues north to the Canada–US border at Blaine, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia and extends south to the Mexico–US border at Tijuana and San Diego.
*Officer Chris Kilcullen Memorial Highway: Oregon Route 126 is routed along the Eugene-Springfield Highway, a limited-access freeway. The Eugene portion of this highway begins at an interchange with Interstate 5 and ends west at a freeway terminus. This portion of Oregon Route 126 is also signed Interstate 105, a spur route of Interstate 5. Oregon Route 126 continues west, a portion shared with Oregon Route 99, and continues west to Florence. Eastward, Oregon Route 126 crosses the Cascades and leads to central and eastern Oregon.
*Randy Papé Beltline: Beltline is a limited-access freeway which runs along the northern and western edges of incorporated Eugene.
*Delta Highway: The Delta Highway forms a connector of less than between Interstate 105 and Beltline Highway.
*Oregon Route 99: Oregon Route 99 forks off Interstate 5 south of Eugene, and forms a major surface artery in Eugene. It continues north into the Willamette valley, parallel to I-5. It is sometimes called the &quot;scenic route&quot; since it has a great view of the Coast Range and also stretches through many scenic farmlands of the Willamette Valley.

===Utilities===
Eugene is the home of Oregon&#x27;s largest publicly owned water and power utility, the Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board (EWEB). EWEB got its start in the first decade of the 20th century, after an epidemic of typhoid found in the groundwater supply. The City of Eugene condemned Eugene&#x27;s private water utility and began treating river water (first the Willamette; later the McKenzie) for domestic use. EWEB got into the electric business when power was needed for the water pumps. Excess electricity generated by the EWEB&#x27;s hydropower plants was used for street lighting.

Natural gas service is provided by NW Natural.

Wastewater treatment services are provided by the Metropolitan Wastewater Management Commission, a partnership between the Cities of Eugene and Springfield and Lane County.

===Healthcare===
Two hospitals serve the Eugene-Springfield area. McKenzie-Willamette Medical Center and Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend are in Springfield. Oregon Medical Group, a primary care based multi-specialty group, operates several clinics in Eugene, as does PeaceHealth Medical Group. White Bird Clinic provides a broad range of health and human services, including low-cost clinics. The Volunteers in Medicine &amp; Occupy Medical clinics provide free medical and mental care to low-income adults without health insurance.

Eugene is one of the few municipalities in the US that does not fluoridate its water supply.

==In popular culture==
*The DC Vertigo comic book series &quot;iZombie&quot; is set in Eugene.

<doc id="9627" wikidata="Q228494" url="?curid=9627" title="Elizabeth Barrett Browning">
<text>Elizabeth Barrett Browning (née Moulton-Barrett; 6 March 1806 – 29 June 1861) was an English poet of the Victorian era, popular in Britain and the United States during her lifetime and frequently anthologised after her death. Her work received renewed attention following the feminist scholarship of the 1970s and 1980s, and greater recognition of women writers in English. Born in County Durham, the eldest of 12 children, Elizabeth Barrett wrote poetry from the age of eleven. Her mother&#x27;s collection of her poems forms one of the largest extant collections of juvenilia by any English writer. At 15, she became ill, suffering intense head and spinal pain for the rest of her life. Later in life, she also developed lung problems, possibly tuberculosis. She took laudanum for the pain from an early age, which is likely to have contributed to her frail health.

In the 1840s, Elizabeth was introduced to literary society through her distant cousin and patron John Kenyon. Her first adult collection of poems was published in 1838, and she wrote prolifically from 1841 to 1844, producing poetry, translation, and prose. She campaigned for the abolition of slavery, and her work helped influence reform in child labour legislation. Her prolific output made her a rival to Tennyson as a candidate for poet laureate on the death of Wordsworth. Elizabeth&#x27;s volume &quot;Poems&quot; (1844) brought her great success, attracting the admiration of the writer Robert Browning. Their correspondence, courtship, and marriage were carried out in secret, for fear of her father&#x27;s disapproval. Following the wedding, she was indeed disinherited by her father. In 1846, the couple moved to Italy, where she lived for the rest of her life. Elizabeth died in Florence in 1861. A collection of her later poems was published by her husband shortly after her death.

They had a son, known as &quot;Pen&quot; (Robert Barrett, 1849–1912). Pen devoted himself to painting until his eyesight began to fail later in life. He also built a large collection of manuscripts and memorabilia of his parents, but because he died intestate, it was sold by public auction to various bidders and then scattered upon his death. The Armstrong Browning Library has recovered some of his collection, and it now houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of Browning memorabilia. Elizabeth&#x27;s work had a major influence on prominent writers of the day, including the American poets Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Dickinson. She is remembered for such poems as &quot;How Do I Love Thee?&quot; (Sonnet 43, 1845) and &quot;Aurora Leigh &quot;(1856).

==Life and career==
===Family background===
Elizabeth Barrett had both maternal and paternal family who profited from slavery. Her father&#x27;s family had lived in the colony of Jamaica since 1655, though her father chose to raise his family in England, while his business enterprises remained in Jamaica. Their wealth derived primarily from the ownership of slave plantations in the British West Indies. Edward Barrett owned of land in the estates of Cinnamon Hill, Cornwall, Cambridge and Oxford in northern Jamaica. 

Elizabeth&#x27;s maternal grandfather owned sugar plantations, sugar cane mills, glassworks and merchant ships which traded between Jamaica and Newcastle upon Tyne.

The family wished to hand down their name, stipulating that Barrett always should be held as a surname. In some cases, inheritance was given on condition that the name was used by the beneficiary; the British upper class had long encouraged this sort of name changing. Given this strong tradition, Elizabeth used &quot;Elizabeth Barrett Moulton Barrett&quot; on legal documents, and before she was married, she often signed herself &quot;Elizabeth Barrett Barrett&quot; or &quot;EBB&quot; (initials which she was able to keep after her wedding). 

===Early life===
Elizabeth Barrett Moulton-Barrett was born on (it is supposed) 6 March 1806 in Coxhoe Hall, between the villages of Coxhoe and Kelloe in County Durham, England. Her parents were Edward Barrett Moulton-Barrett and Mary Graham Clarke. However, biographers have suggested that, when she was christened on 9 March, she was already three or four months old, and that this was concealed because her parents had married only on 14 May 1805. Although she had already been baptised by a family friend in that first week of her life, she was baptised again, more publicly, on 10 February 1808 at Kelloe parish church, at the same time as her younger brother, Edward (known as Bro). He had been born in June 1807, 15 months after Elizabeth&#x27;s stated date of birth. A private christening might seem unlikely for a family of standing, and while Bro&#x27;s birth was celebrated with a holiday on the family&#x27;s Caribbean plantations, Elizabeth&#x27;s was not.

Elizabeth was the eldest of 12 children (eight boys and four girls). Eleven lived to adulthood; one daughter died at the age of 3, when Elizabeth was 8. The children all had nicknames: Elizabeth was Ba. She rode her pony, went for family walks and picnics, socialised with other county families, and participated in home theatrical productions. Unlike her siblings, she immersed herself in books as often as she could get away from the social rituals of her family.

In 1809, the family moved to Hope End, a estate near the Malvern Hills in Ledbury, Herefordshire. Her father converted the Georgian house into stables and built a mansion of opulent Turkish design, which his wife described as something from the &quot;Arabian Nights&#x27; Entertainments&quot;.

The interior&#x27;s brass balustrades, mahogany doors inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and finely carved fireplaces were eventually complemented by lavish landscaping: ponds, grottos, kiosks, an ice house, a hothouse, and a subterranean passage from house to gardens. Her time at Hope End inspired her in later life to write &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot; (1856), her most ambitious work, which went through more than 20 editions by 1900, but none from 1905 to 1978.

She was educated at home and tutored by Daniel McSwiney with her oldest brother. She began writing verses at the age of four. During the Hope End period, she was an intensely studious, precocious child. She claimed that she was reading novels at age 6, having been entranced by Pope&#x27;s translations of Homer at age 8, studying Greek at age 10, and writing her own Homeric epic &quot;The Battle of Marathon: A Poem&quot; at age 11.

In 1820, Mr Barrett privately published &quot;The Battle of Marathon&quot;, an epic-style poem, but all copies remained within the family. Her mother compiled the child&#x27;s poetry into collections of &quot;Poems by Elizabeth B. Barrett&quot;. Her father called her the &quot;Poet Laureate of Hope End&quot; and encouraged her work. The result is one of the larger collections of juvenilia of any English writer. Mary Russell Mitford described the young Elizabeth at this time as having &quot;a slight, delicate figure, with a shower of dark curls falling on each side of a most expressive face; large, tender eyes, richly fringed by dark eyelashes, and a smile like a sunbeam.&quot;

At about this time, Elizabeth began to battle an illness, which the medical science of the time was unable to diagnose. All three sisters came down with the syndrome, but it lasted only with Elizabeth. She had intense head and spinal pain with loss of mobility. Various biographies link this to a riding accident at the time (she fell while trying to dismount a horse), but there is no evidence to support the link. Sent to recover at the Gloucester spa, she was treated – in the absence of symptoms supporting another diagnosis – for a spinal problem. This illness continued for the rest of her life, and it is believed to be unrelated to the lung disease which she developed in 1837.

She began to take opiates for the pain, laudanum (an opium concoction) followed by morphine, then commonly prescribed. She became dependent on them for much of her adulthood; the use from an early age may well have contributed to her frail health. Biographers such as Alethea Hayter have suggested this dependency have contributed to the wild vividness of her imagination and the poetry that it produced.

By 1821, she had read Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792), and she become a passionate supporter of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s political ideas. The child&#x27;s intellectual fascination with the classics and metaphysics was reflected in a religious intensity which she later described as &quot;not the deep persuasion of the mild Christian but the wild visions of an enthusiast.&quot; The Barretts attended services at the nearest Dissenting chapel, and Edward was active in Bible and missionary societies.

Elizabeth&#x27;s mother died in 1828, and is buried at St Michael&#x27;s Church, Ledbury, next to her daughter Mary. Sarah Graham-Clarke, Elizabeth&#x27;s aunt, helped to care for the children, and she had clashes with Elizabeth&#x27;s strong will. In 1831, Elizabeth&#x27;s grandmother, Elizabeth Moulton, died. Following lawsuits and the abolition of slavery, Mr Barrett incurred great financial and investment losses that forced him to sell Hope End. Although the family was never poor, the place was seized and sold to satisfy creditors. Always secret in his financial dealings, he would not discuss his situation, and the family was haunted by the idea that they might have to move to Jamaica.

From 1833 to 1835, she was living with her family at Belle Vue in Sidmouth. The site has now been renamed Cedar Shade and redeveloped. A blue plaque at the entrance to the site attests to its previous existence. In 1838, some years after the sale of Hope End, the family settled at 50 Wimpole Street, Marylebone, London.

During 1837–1838, the poet was struck with illness again, with symptoms today suggesting tuberculous ulceration of the lungs. The same year, at her physician&#x27;s insistence, she moved from London to Torquay on the Devonshire coast. Her former home now forms part of the Regina Hotel. Two tragedies then struck. In February 1840, her brother Samuel died of a fever in Jamaica, then her favourite brother Edward (Bro) was drowned in a sailing accident in Torquay in July. These events had a serious effect on her already fragile health. She felt guilty as her father had disapproved of Edward&#x27;s trip to Torquay. She wrote to Mitford: &quot;That was a very near escape from madness, absolute hopeless madness&quot;. The family returned to Wimpole Street in 1841.

===Success===

At Wimpole Street, Elizabeth spent most of her time in her upstairs room. Her health began to improve, but she saw few people other than her immediate family. One of those was John Kenyon, a wealthy friend and distant cousin of the family and patron of the arts. She received comfort from a spaniel named Flush, a gift from Mary Mitford. (Virginia Woolf later fictionalised the life of the dog, making him the protagonist of her 1933 novel &quot;&quot;).

From 1841 to 1844, Elizabeth was prolific in poetry, translation, and prose. The poem &quot;The Cry of the Children&quot;, published in 1843 in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot;, condemned child labour and helped bring about child-labour reforms by raising support for Lord Shaftesbury&#x27;s Ten Hours Bill (1844). About the same time, she contributed critical prose pieces to Richard Henry Horne&#x27;s &quot;A New Spirit of the Age&quot;, including a laudatory essay on Thomas Carlyle.

In 1844, she published the two-volume &quot;Poems&quot;, which included &quot;A Drama of Exile&quot;, &quot;A Vision of Poets&quot;, and &quot;Lady Geraldine&#x27;s Courtship&quot;, and two substantial critical essays for 1842 issues of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;. A self-proclaimed &quot;adorer of Carlyle&quot;, she sent a copy to him as &quot;a tribute of admiration &amp; respect&quot;, which began a correspondence between them. &quot;Since she was not burdened with any domestic duties expected of her sisters, Barrett Browning could now devote herself entirely to the life of the mind, cultivating an enormous correspondence, reading widely&quot;. Her prolific output made her a rival to Tennyson as a candidate for poet laureate in 1850 on the death of Wordsworth.

A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque now commemorates Elizabeth at 50 Wimpole Street.

===Robert Browning and Italy===
Her 1844 volume &quot;Poems&quot; made her one of the more popular writers in the country and inspired Robert Browning to write to her. He wrote &quot;I love your verses with all my heart, dear Miss Barrett,&quot; praising their &quot;fresh strange music, the affluent language, the exquisite pathos and true new brave thought.&quot;

Kenyon arranged for Browning to meet Elizabeth on 20 May 1845, in her rooms, and so began one of the most famous courtships in literature. Elizabeth had produced a large amount of work, but Browning had a great influence on her subsequent writing as did she on his: Two of Barrett&#x27;s most famous pieces were written after she met Browning, &quot;Sonnets from the Portuguese&quot; and &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot;. Robert&#x27;s &quot;Men and Women&quot; is also a product of that time.

Some critics state that her activity was, in some ways, in decay before she met Browning: &quot;Until her relationship with Robert Browning began in 1845, Barrett&#x27;s willingness to engage in public discourse about social issues and about aesthetic issues in poetry, which had been so strong in her youth, gradually diminished, as did her physical health. As an intellectual presence and a physical being, she was becoming a shadow of herself.&quot;

The courtship and marriage between Robert Browning and Elizabeth were made secretly as she knew her father would disapprove. After a private marriage at St Marylebone Parish Church, they honeymooned in Paris and then moved to Italy in September 1846, which became their home almost continuously until her death. Elizabeth&#x27;s loyal lady&#x27;s maid Elizabeth Wilson witnessed the marriage and accompanied the couple to Italy.

Mr Barrett disinherited Elizabeth as he did each of his children who married. Elizabeth had foreseen her father&#x27;s anger but had not anticipated her brothers&#x27; rejection. As Elizabeth had some money of her own, the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy. The Brownings were well respected and even famous. Elizabeth grew stronger, and in 1849, at the age of 43, between four miscarriages, she gave birth to a son, Robert Wiedeman Barrett Browning, whom they called Pen. Their son later married, but had no legitimate children.

At her husband&#x27;s insistence, Elizabeth&#x27;s second edition of &quot;Poems&quot; included her love sonnets; as a result, her popularity increased (as did critical regard), and her artistic position was confirmed. During the years of her marriage, her literary reputation far surpassed that of her poet-husband; when visitors came to their home in Florence, she was invariably the greater attraction.

The couple came to know a wide circle of artists and writers, including William Makepeace Thackeray, sculptor Harriet Hosmer (who, she wrote, seemed to be the &quot;perfectly emancipated female&quot;) and Harriet Beecher Stowe. In 1849, she met Margaret Fuller; Carlyle in 1851; French novelist George Sand in 1852, whom she had long admired. Among her intimate friends in Florence was the writer Isa Blagden, whom she encouraged to write novels. They met Alfred Tennyson in Paris, and John Forster, Samuel Rogers and the Carlyles in London, later befriending Charles Kingsley and John Ruskin.

===Decline and death===
After the death of an old friend, G. B. Hunter, and then of her father, Barrett Browning&#x27;s health started to deteriorate. The Brownings moved from Florence to Siena, residing at the &quot;Villa Alberti&quot;. Engrossed in Italian politics, she issued a small volume of political poems titled &quot;Poems before Congress&quot; (1860) &quot;most of which were written to express her sympathy with the Italian cause after the outbreak of fighting in 1859&quot;. They caused a furore in Britain, and the conservative magazines &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; labelled her a fanatic. She dedicated this book to her husband. Her last work was &quot;A Musical Instrument&quot;, published posthumously.

Barrett Browning&#x27;s sister Henrietta died in November 1860. The couple spent the winter of 1860–1861 in Rome where Barrett Browning&#x27;s health deteriorated, and they returned to Florence in early June 1861. She became gradually weaker, using morphine to ease her pain. She died on 29 June 1861 in her husband&#x27;s arms. Browning said that she died &quot;smilingly, happily, and with a face like a girl&#x27;s...Her last word was...&#x27;Beautiful&#x27; &quot;. She was buried in the Protestant English Cemetery of Florence. &quot;On Monday July 1 the shops in the area around Casa Guidi were closed, while Elizabeth was mourned with unusual demonstrations.&quot; The nature of her illness is still unclear. Some modern scientists speculate her illness may have been hypokalemic periodic paralysis, a genetic disorder that causes weakness and many of the other symptoms she described.

===Publications===

Barrett Browning&#x27;s first known poem &quot;On the Cruelty of Forcement to Man&quot; was written at the age of 6 or 8. The manuscript, which protests against impressment, is currently in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library; the exact date is controversial because the &quot;2&quot; in the date 1812 is written over something else that is scratched out.

Her first independent publication was &quot;Stanzas Excited by Reflections on the Present State of Greece&quot; in &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; of May 1821; followed two months later by &quot;Thoughts Awakened by Contemplating a Piece of the Palm which Grows on the Summit of the Acropolis at Athens&quot;.

Her first collection of poems, &quot;An Essay on Mind, with Other Poems,&quot; was published in 1826 and reflected her passion for Byron and Greek politics. Its publication drew the attention of Hugh Stuart Boyd, a blind scholar of the Greek language, and of Uvedale Price, another Greek scholar, with whom she maintained sustained correspondence. Among other neighbours was Mrs James Martin from Colwall, with whom she corresponded throughout her life. Later, at Boyd&#x27;s suggestion, she translated Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; (published in 1833; retranslated in 1850). During their friendship, Barrett studied Greek literature, including Homer, Pindar and Aristophanes.

Elizabeth opposed slavery and published two poems highlighting the barbarity of the institution and her support for the abolitionist cause: &quot;The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim&#x27;s Point&quot; and &quot;A Curse for a Nation&quot;. The first depicts an enslaved woman whipped, raped, and made pregnant cursing her enslavers. Elizabeth declared herself glad that the slaves were &quot;virtually free&quot; when the Slavery Abolition Act passed in the British Parliament despite the fact that her father believed that abolition would ruin his business.

The date of publication of these poems is in dispute, but her position on slavery in the poems is clear and may have led to a rift between Elizabeth and her father. She wrote to John Ruskin in 1855 &quot;I belong to a family of West Indian slaveholders, and if I believed in curses, I should be afraid&quot;. Her father and uncle were unaffected by the Baptist War (1831–1832) and continued to own slaves until passage of the Slavery Abolition Act.

In London, John Kenyon introduced Elizabeth to literary figures including William Wordsworth, Mary Russell Mitford, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Alfred Tennyson and Thomas Carlyle. Elizabeth continued to write, contributing &quot;The Romaunt of Margaret&quot;, &quot;The Romaunt of the Page&quot;, &quot;The Poet&#x27;s Vow&quot; and other pieces to various periodicals. She corresponded with other writers, including Mary Russell Mitford, who became a close friend and who supported Elizabeth&#x27;s literary ambitions.

In 1838 &quot;The Seraphim and Other Poems&quot; appeared, the first volume of Elizabeth&#x27;s mature poetry to appear under her own name.

&quot;Sonnets from the Portuguese&quot; was published in 1850. There is debate about the origin of the title. Some say it refers to the series of sonnets of the 16th-century Portuguese poet Luís de Camões. However, &quot;my little Portuguese&quot; was a pet name that Browning had adopted for Elizabeth and this may have some connection.

The verse-novel &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot;, her most ambitious and perhaps the most popular of her longer poems, appeared in 1856. It is the story of a female writer making her way in life, balancing work and love, and based on Elizabeth&#x27;s own experiences. &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot; was an important influence on Susan B. Anthony&#x27;s thinking about the traditional roles of women, with regard to marriage versus independent individuality. The &quot;North American Review&quot; praised Elizabeth&#x27;s poem: &quot;Mrs. Browning&#x27;s poems are, in all respects, the utterance of a woman — of a woman of great learning, rich experience, and powerful genius, uniting to her woman&#x27;s nature the strength which is sometimes thought peculiar to a man.&quot;

==Spiritual influence==
Much of Barrett Browning&#x27;s work carries a religious theme. She had read and studied such works as Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. She says in her writing, &quot;We want the sense of the saturation of Christ&#x27;s blood upon the souls of our poets, that it may cry through them in answer to the ceaseless wail of the Sphinx of our humanity, expounding agony into renovation. Something of this has been perceived in art when its glory was at the fullest. Something of a yearning after this may be seen among the Greek Christian poets, something which would have been much with a stronger faculty&quot;. She believed that &quot;Christ&#x27;s religion is essentially poetry – poetry glorified&quot;. She explored the religious aspect in many of her poems, especially in her early work, such as the sonnets.

She was interested in theological debate, had learned Hebrew and read the Hebrew Bible. Her seminal &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot;, for example, features religious imagery and allusion to the apocalypse. The critic Cynthia Scheinberg notes that female characters in &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot; and her earlier work &quot;The Virgin Mary to the Child Jesus&quot; allude to Miriam, sister and caregiver to Moses. These allusions to Miriam in both poems mirror the way in which Barrett Browning herself drew from Jewish history, while distancing herself from it, in order to maintain the cultural norms of a Christian woman poet of the Victorian Age.

In the correspondence Barrett Browning kept with the Reverend William Merry from 1843 to 1844 on predestination and salvation by works, she identifies herself as a Congregationalist: &quot;I am not a Baptist — but a Congregational Christian, — in the holding of my private opinions.&quot;

==Barrett Browning Institute==
In 1892, Ledbury, Herefordshire, held a design competition to build an Institute in honour of Barrett Browning. Brightwen Binyon beat 44 other designs. It was based on the timber-framed Market House, which was opposite the site, and was completed in 1896. However, Nikolaus Pevsner was not impressed by its style. It was used as a public library from 1938 to 2021, when new library facilities were provided for the town, and is now the headquarters of the Ledbury Poetry Festival. It has been Grade II-listed since 2007.

==Critical reception==
Barrett Browning was widely popular in the United Kingdom and the United States during her lifetime. Edgar Allan Poe was inspired by her poem &quot;Lady Geraldine&#x27;s Courtship&quot; and specifically borrowed the poem&#x27;s metre for his poem &quot;The Raven&quot;. Poe had reviewed Barrett Browning&#x27;s work in the January 1845 issue of the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot;, writing that &quot;her poetic inspiration is the highest – we can conceive of nothing more august. Her sense of Art is pure in itself.&quot; In return, she praised &quot;The Raven&quot;, and Poe dedicated his 1845 collection &quot;The Raven and Other Poems&quot; to her, referring to her as &quot;the noblest of her sex&quot;.

Barrett Browning&#x27;s poetry greatly influenced Emily Dickinson, who admired her as a woman of achievement. Her popularity in the United States and Britain was advanced by her stands against social injustice, including slavery in the United States, injustice toward Italians from their foreign rulers, and child labour.

Lilian Whiting published a biography of Barrett Browning (1899) which describes her as &quot;the most philosophical poet&quot; and depicts her life as &quot;a Gospel of applied Christianity&quot;. To Whiting, the term &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot; did not apply to Barrett Browning&#x27;s work, as each poem, distinctively purposeful, was borne of a more &quot;honest vision&quot;. In this critical analysis, Whiting portrays Barrett Browning as a poet who uses knowledge of Classical literature with an &quot;intuitive gift of spiritual divination&quot;. In &quot;Elizabeth Barrett Browning&quot;, Angela Leighton suggests that the portrayal of Barrett Browning as the &quot;pious iconography of womanhood&quot; has distracted us from her poetic achievements. Leighton cites the 1931 play by Rudolf Besier &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; as evidence that 20th-century literary criticism of Barrett Browning&#x27;s work has suffered more as a result of her popularity than poetic ineptitude. The play was popularized by actress Katharine Cornell, for whom it became a signature role. It was an enormous success, both artistically and commercially, and was revived several times and adapted twice into movies. Sampson, however, considers the play to have been the most damaging cause of false myths about Elizabeth, and particularly the relationship with her, allegedly &#x27;tyrannical&#x27;, father.

Throughout the 20th century, literary criticism of Barrett Browning&#x27;s poetry remained sparse until her poems were discovered by the women&#x27;s movement. She once described herself as being inclined to reject several women&#x27;s rights principles, suggesting in letters to Mary Russell Mitford and her husband that she believed that there was an inferiority of intellect in women. In &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot;, however, she created a strong and independent woman who embraces both work and love. Leighton writes that because Elizabeth participates in the literary world, where voice and diction are dominated by perceived masculine superiority, she &quot;is defined only in mysterious opposition to everything that distinguishes the male subject who writes...&quot; A five-volume scholarly edition of her works was published in 2010, the first in over a century.

<doc id="9628" wikidata="Q214672" url="?curid=9628" title="Enlil">
<text>Enlil, later known as Elil and Ellil, is an ancient Mesopotamian god associated with wind, air, earth, and storms. He is first attested as the chief deity of the Sumerian pantheon, but he was later worshipped by the Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Hurrians. Enlil&#x27;s primary center of worship was the Ekur temple in the city of Nippur, which was believed to have been built by Enlil himself and was regarded as the &quot;mooring-rope&quot; of heaven and earth. He is also sometimes referred to in Sumerian texts as Nunamnir. According to one Sumerian hymn, Enlil himself was so holy that not even the other gods could look upon him. Enlil rose to prominence during the twenty-fourth century BC with the rise of Nippur. His cult fell into decline after Nippur was sacked by the Elamites in 1230 BC and he was eventually supplanted as the chief god of the Mesopotamian pantheon by the Babylonian national god Marduk.

Enlil plays a vital role in the ancient near eastern cosmology; he separates An (heaven) from Ki (earth), thus making the world habitable for humans. In the Sumerian flood myth Eridu Genesis, Enlil rewards Ziusudra with immortality for having survived the flood and, in the Babylonian flood myth, Enlil is the cause of the flood himself, having sent the flood to exterminate the human race, who made too much noise and prevented him from sleeping; the cuneiform tablets of Atra-Hasis report on this connections in a comparatively well-preserved state. The myth of &quot;Enlil and Ninlil&quot; is about Enlil&#x27;s serial seduction of the goddess Ninlil in various guises, resulting in the conception of the moon-god Nanna and the Underworld deities Nergal, Ninazu, and Enbilulu. Enlil was regarded as the inventor of the mattock and the patron of agriculture. Enlil also features prominently in several myths involving his son Ninurta, including &quot;Anzû and the Tablet of Destinies&quot; and &quot;Lugale&quot;.

==Etymology==
Enlil&#x27;s name comes from ancient Sumerian EN (𒂗), meaning &quot;lord&quot; and LÍL (𒆤), the meaning of which is contentious, and which has sometimes been interpreted as meaning winds as a weather phenomenon (making Enlil a weather and sky god, &quot;Lord Wind&quot; or &quot;Lord Storm&quot;), or alternatively as signifying a spirit or phantom whose presence may be felt as stirring of the air, or possibly as representing a partial Semitic loanword rather than a Sumerian word at all. Enlil&#x27;s name is not a genitive construction, suggesting that Enlil was seen as the personification of LÍL rather than merely the cause of LÍL.

Piotr Steinkeller has written that the meaning of LÍL may not actually be a clue to a specific divine domain of Enlil&#x27;s, whether storms, spirits, or otherwise, since Enlil may have been &quot;a typical universal god [...] without any specific domain.&quot;

Piotr Steinkeller and Piotr Michalowski have doubts about the Sumerian origin of Enlil. They have questioned the true meaning of the name, and identified Enlil with the Eblaite word &quot;I-li-lu&quot;. As noted by Manfred Krebernik and M. P. Streck; Enlil being referred to as &quot;Kur-gal&quot; (the Great Mountain) in Sumerian texts suggests he might have originated in eastern Mesopotamia.

==Worship==

Enlil was the patron god of the Sumerian city-state of Nippur and his main center of worship was the Ekur temple located there. The name of the temple literally means &quot;Mountain House&quot; in ancient Sumerian. The Ekur was believed to have been built and established by Enlil himself. It was believed to be the &quot;mooring-rope&quot; of heaven and earth, meaning that it was seen as &quot;a channel of communication between earth and heaven&quot;. A hymn written during the reign of Ur-Nammu, the founder of the Third Dynasty of Ur, describes the E-kur in great detail, stating that its gates were carved with scenes of Imdugud, a lesser deity sometimes shown as a giant bird, slaying a lion and an eagle snatching up a sinner.

The Sumerians believed that the sole purpose of humanity&#x27;s existence was to serve the gods. They thought that a god&#x27;s statue was a physical embodiment of the god himself. As such, cult statues were given constant care and attention and a set of priests were assigned to tend to them. People worshipped Enlil by offering food and other human necessities to him. The food, which was ritually laid out before the god&#x27;s cult statue in the form of a feast, was believed to be Enlil&#x27;s daily meal, but, after the ritual, it would be distributed among his priests. These priests were also responsible for changing the cult statue&#x27;s clothing.

The Sumerians envisioned Enlil as a benevolent, fatherly deity, who watches over humanity and cares for their well-being. One Sumerian hymn describes Enlil as so glorious that even the other gods could not look upon him. The same hymn also states that, without Enlil, civilization could not exist. Enlil&#x27;s epithets include titles such as &quot;the Great Mountain&quot; and &quot;King of the Foreign Lands&quot;. Enlil is also sometimes described as a &quot;raging storm&quot;, a &quot;wild bull&quot;, and a &quot;merchant&quot;. The Mesopotamians envisioned him as a creator, a father, a king, and the supreme lord of the universe. He was also known as &quot;Nunamnir&quot; and is referred to in at least one text as the &quot;East Wind and North Wind&quot;.

Kings regarded Enlil as a model ruler and sought to emulate his example. Enlil was said to be supremely just and intolerant towards evil. Rulers from all over Sumer would travel to Enlil&#x27;s temple in Nippur to be legitimized. They would return Enlil&#x27;s favor by devoting lands and precious objects to his temple as offerings. Nippur was the only Sumerian city-state that never built a palace; this was intended to symbolize the city&#x27;s importance as the center of the cult of Enlil by showing that Enlil himself was the city&#x27;s king. Even during the Babylonian Period, when Marduk had superseded Enlil as the supreme god, Babylonian kings still traveled to the holy city of Nippur to seek recognition of their right to rule.

Enlil first rose to prominence during the twenty-fourth century BC, when the importance of the god An began to wane. During this time period, Enlil and An are frequently invoked together in inscriptions. Enlil remained the supreme god in Mesopotamia throughout the Amorite Period, with Amorite monarchs proclaiming Enlil as the source of their legitimacy. Enlil&#x27;s importance began to wane after the Babylonian king Hammurabi conquered Sumer. The Babylonians worshipped Enlil under the name &quot;Elil&quot; and the Hurrians syncretized him with their own god Kumarbi. In one Hurrian ritual, Enlil and Apantu are invoked as &quot;the father and mother of Išḫara&quot;. Enlil is also invoked alongside Ninlil as a member of &quot;the mighty and firmly established gods&quot;.

During the Kassite Period ( 1592–1155 BC), Nippur briefly managed to regain influence in the region and Enlil rose to prominence once again. From around 1300 BC onwards, Enlil was syncretized with the Assyrian national god Aššur, who was the most important deity in the Assyrian pantheon. Then, in 1230 BC, the Elamites attacked Nippur and the city fell into decline, taking the cult of Enlil along with it. Approximately one hundred years later, Enlil&#x27;s role as the head of the pantheon was given to Marduk, the national god of the Babylonians.

==Iconography==

Enlil was represented by the symbol of a horned cap, which consisted of up to seven superimposed pairs of ox-horns. Such crowns were an important symbol of divinity; gods had been shown wearing them ever since the third millennium BC. The horned cap remained consistent in form and meaning from the earliest days of Sumerian prehistory up until the time of the Persian conquest and beyond.

The Sumerians had a complex numerological system, in which certain numbers were believed to hold special ritual significance. Within this system, Enlil was associated with the number fifty, which was considered sacred to him. Enlil was part of a triad of deities, which also included An and Enki. These three deities together were the embodiment of all the fixed stars in the night sky. An was identified with all the stars of the equatorial sky, Enlil with those of the northern sky, and Enki with those of the southern sky. The path of Enlil&#x27;s celestial orbit was a continuous, symmetrical circle around the north celestial pole, but those of An and Enki were believed to intersect at various points. Enlil was associated with the constellation Boötes.

==Mythology==
===Origins myths===
The main source of information about Sumerian creation mythology is the prologue to the epic poem &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld&quot; (ETCSL 1.8.1.4), which briefly describes the process of creation: originally, there was only Nammu, the primeval sea. Then, Nammu gave birth to An, the sky, and Ki, the earth. An and Ki mated with each other, causing Ki to give birth to Enlil. Enlil separated An from Ki and carried off the earth as his domain, while An carried off the sky. Enlil marries his mother, Ki, and from this union all the plant and animal life on earth is produced.

&quot;Enlil and Ninlil&quot; (ETCSL 1.2.1) is a nearly complete 152-line Sumerian poem describing the affair between Enlil and the goddess Ninlil. First, Ninlil&#x27;s mother Nunbarshegunu instructs Ninlil to go bathe in the river. Ninlil goes to the river, where Enlil seduces her and impregnates her with their son, the moon-god Nanna. Because of this, Enlil is banished to Kur, the Sumerian underworld. Ninlil follows Enlil to the underworld, where he impersonates the &quot;man of the gate&quot;. Ninlil demands to know where Enlil has gone, but Enlil, still impersonating the gatekeeper, refuses to answer. He then seduces Ninlil and impregnates her with Nergal, the god of death. The same scenario repeats, only this time Enlil instead impersonates the &quot;man of the river of the nether world, the man-devouring river&quot;; once again, he seduces Ninlil and impregnates her with the god Ninazu. Finally, Enlil impersonates the &quot;man of the boat&quot;; once again, he seduces Ninlil and impregnates her with Enbilulu, the &quot;inspector of the canals&quot;.

The story of Enlil&#x27;s courtship with Ninlil is primarily a genealogical myth invented to explain the origins of the moon-god Nanna, as well as the various gods of the Underworld, but it is also, to some extent, a coming-of-age story describing Enlil and Ninlil&#x27;s emergence from adolescence into adulthood. The story also explains Ninlil&#x27;s role as Enlil&#x27;s consort; in the poem, Ninlil declares, &quot;As Enlil is your master, so am I also your mistress!&quot; The story is also historically significant because, if the current interpretation of it is correct, it is the oldest known myth in which a god changes shape.

===Flood myth===
In the Sumerian version of the flood story (ETCSL 1.7.4), the causes of the flood are unclear because the portion of the tablet recording the beginning of the story has been destroyed. Somehow, a mortal known as Ziusudra manages to survive the flood, likely through the help of the god Enki. The tablet begins in the middle of the description of the flood. The flood lasts for seven days and seven nights before it subsides. Then, Utu, the god of the Sun, emerges. Ziusudra opens a window in the side of the boat and falls down prostrate before the god. Next, he sacrifices an ox and a sheep in honor of Utu. At this point, the text breaks off again. When it picks back up, Enlil and An are in the midst of declaring Ziusudra immortal as an honor for having managed to survive the flood. The remaining portion of the tablet after this point is destroyed.

In the later Akkadian version of the flood story, recorded in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Enlil actually causes the flood, seeking to annihilate every living thing on earth because the humans, who are vastly overpopulated, make too much noise and prevent him from sleeping. In this version of the story, the hero is Utnapishtim, who is warned ahead of time by Ea, the Babylonian equivalent of Enki, that the flood is coming. The flood lasts for seven days; when it ends, Ishtar, who had mourned the destruction of humanity, promises Utnapishtim that Enlil will never cause a flood again. When Enlil sees that Utnapishtim and his family have survived, he is outraged, but his son Ninurta speaks up in favor of humanity, arguing that, instead of causing floods, Enlil should simply ensure that humans never become overpopulated by reducing their numbers using wild animals and famines. Enlil goes into the boat; Utnapishtim and his wife bow before him. Enlil, now appeased, grants Utnapishtim immortality as a reward for his loyalty to the gods.

===Chief god and arbitrator===

A nearly complete 108-line poem from the Early Dynastic Period ( 2900–2350 BC) describes Enlil&#x27;s invention of the mattock, a key agricultural pick, hoe, ax, or digging tool of the Sumerians. In the poem, Enlil conjures the mattock into existence and decrees its fate. The mattock is described as gloriously beautiful; it is made of pure gold and its head is carved from lapis lazuli. Enlil gives the tool over to the humans, who use it to build cities, subjugate their people, and pull up weeds. Enlil was believed to aid in the growth of plants.

The Sumerian poem &quot;Enlil Chooses the Farmer–God&quot; (ETCSL 5.3.3) describes how Enlil, hoping &quot;to establish abundance and prosperity&quot;, creates two gods Emesh and Enten, a shepherd and a farmer, respectively. The two gods argue and Emesh lays claim to Enten&#x27;s position. They take the dispute before Enlil, who rules in favor of Enten; the two gods rejoice and reconcile.

===Ninurta myths===
In the Sumerian poem &quot;Lugale&quot; (ETCSL 1.6.2), Enlil gives advice to his son, the god Ninurta, advising him on a strategy to slay the demon Asag. This advice is relayed to Ninurta by way of Sharur, his enchanted talking mace, which had been sent by Ninurta to the realm of the gods to seek counsel from Enlil directly.

In the Old, Middle, and Late Babylonian myth of &quot;Anzû and the Tablet of Destinies&quot;, the Anzû, a giant, monstrous bird, betrays Enlil and steals the Tablet of Destinies, a sacred clay tablet belonging to Enlil that grants him his authority, while Enlil is preparing for a bath. The rivers dry up and the gods are stripped of their powers. The gods send Adad, Girra, and Shara to defeat the Anzû, but all of them fail. Finally, Ea proposes that the gods should send Ninurta, Enlil&#x27;s son. Ninurta successfully defeats the Anzû and returns the Tablet of Destinies to his father. As a reward, Ninurta is granted a prominent seat on the council of the gods.

===War of the gods===
A badly damaged text from the Neo-Assyrian Period (911–612 BC) describes Marduk leading his army of Anunnaki into the sacred city of Nippur and causing a disturbance. The disturbance causes a flood, which forces the resident gods of Nippur under the leadership of Enlil to take shelter in the Eshumesha temple to Ninurta. Enlil is enraged at Marduk&#x27;s transgression and orders the gods of Eshumesha to take Marduk and the other Anunnaki as prisoners. The Anunnaki are captured, but Marduk appoints his front-runner Mushteshirhablim to lead a revolt against the gods of Eshumesha and sends his messenger Neretagmil to alert Nabu, the god of literacy. When the Eshumesha gods hear Nabu speak, they come out of their temple to search for him. Marduk defeats the Eshumesha gods and takes 360 of them as prisoners of war, including Enlil himself. Enlil protests that the Eshumesha gods are innocent, so Marduk puts them on trial before the Anunnaki. The text ends with a warning from Damkianna (another name for Ninhursag) to the gods and to humanity, pleading them not to repeat the war between the Anunnaki and the gods of Eshumesha.

<text>Ecology () is the natural science of the relationships among living organisms and their environment. Ecology considers organisms at the individual, population, community, ecosystem, and biosphere levels. Ecology overlaps with the closely related sciences of biogeography, evolutionary biology, genetics, ethology, and natural history.

Ecology is a branch of biology, and is the study of abundance, biomass, and distribution of organisms in the context of the environment. It encompasses life processes, interactions, and adaptations; movement of materials and energy through living communities; successional development of ecosystems; cooperation, competition, and predation within and between species; and patterns of biodiversity and its effect on ecosystem processes.

Ecology has practical applications in fields such as conservation biology, wetland management, natural resource management, and human ecology.

The word &quot;ecology&quot; () was coined in 1866 by the German scientist Ernst Haeckel. The science of ecology as we know it today began with a group of American botanists in the 1890s. Evolutionary concepts relating to adaptation and natural selection are cornerstones of modern ecological theory.

Ecosystems are dynamically interacting systems of organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living (abiotic) components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, nutrient cycling, and niche construction, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. Ecosystems have biophysical feedback mechanisms that moderate processes acting on living (biotic) and abiotic components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain life-supporting functions and provide ecosystem services like biomass production (food, fuel, fiber, and medicine), the regulation of climate, global biogeochemical cycles, water filtration, soil formation, erosion control, flood protection, and many other natural features of scientific, historical, economic, or intrinsic value.

== Levels, scope, and scale of organization ==

The scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Because ecosystems are dynamic and do not necessarily follow a linear successional route, changes might occur quickly or slowly over thousands of years before specific forest successional stages are brought about by biological processes.

An ecosystem&#x27;s area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but is critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, supports diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.

The main subdisciplines of ecology, population (or community) ecology and ecosystem ecology, exhibit a difference not only in scale but also in two contrasting paradigms in the field. The former focuses on organisms&#x27; distribution and abundance, while the latter focuses on materials and energy fluxes.

=== Hierarchy ===


The scale of ecological dynamics can operate like a closed system, such as aphids migrating on a single tree, while at the same time remaining open about broader scale influences, such as atmosphere or climate. Hence, ecologists classify ecosystems hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types, and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional, landscape, and chronological scales.

To structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework, the biological world is organized into a hierarchy, ranging in scale from (as far as ecology is concerned) organisms, to populations, to guilds, to communities, to ecosystems, to biomes, and up to the level of the biosphere. This framework forms a panarchy and exhibits non-linear behaviors; this means that &quot;effect and cause are disproportionate, so that small changes to critical variables, such as the number of nitrogen fixers, can lead to disproportionate, perhaps irreversible, changes in the system properties.&quot;

=== Biodiversity ===

Biodiversity (an abbreviation of &quot;biological diversity&quot;) describes the diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several interpretations, and there are many ways to index, measure, characterize, and represent its complex organization. Biodiversity includes species diversity, ecosystem diversity, and genetic diversity and scientists are interested in the way that this diversity affects the complex ecological processes operating at and among these respective levels. 

Biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem services which by definition maintain and improve human quality of life. Conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches and considerations to address the full ecological scope of biodiversity. Natural capital that supports populations is critical for maintaining ecosystem services and species migration (e.g., riverine fish runs and avian insect control) has been implicated as one mechanism by which those service losses are experienced. An understanding of biodiversity has practical applications for species and ecosystem-level conservation planners as they make management recommendations to consulting firms, governments, and industry.

=== Habitat ===

The habitat of a species describes the environment over which a species is known to occur and the type of community that is formed as a result. More specifically, &quot;habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly (e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal.&quot; For example, a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a montane or alpine ecosystem. 

Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population of a species of tropical lizard (&quot;Tropidurus hispidus&quot;) has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental life history of amphibians, and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. Biotope and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably, but the former applies to a community&#x27;s environment, whereas the latter applies to a species&#x27; environment.

=== Niche ===


Definitions of the niche date back to 1917, but G. Evelyn Hutchinson made conceptual advances in 1957 by introducing a widely adopted definition: &quot;the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist and maintain stable population sizes.&quot; The ecological niche is a central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub-divided into the &quot;fundamental&quot; and the &quot;realized&quot; niche. The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists. The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more technically as a &quot;Euclidean hyperspace whose &quot;dimensions&quot; are defined as environmental variables and whose &quot;size&quot; is a function of the number of values that the environmental values may assume for which an organism has &quot;positive fitness&quot;.&quot;

Biogeographical patterns and range distributions are explained or predicted through knowledge of a species&#x27; traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes play an important role in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.

===Niche construction===

Organisms are subject to environmental pressures, but they also modify their habitats. The regulatory feedback between organisms and their environment can affect conditions from local (e.g., a beaver pond) to global scales, over time and even after death, such as decaying logs or silica skeleton deposits from marine organisms. The process and concept of ecosystem engineering are related to niche construction, but the former relates only to the physical modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications of physical changes to the environment and the feedback this causes on the process of natural selection. Ecosystem engineers are defined as: &quot;organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats.&quot;

The ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated a new appreciation for the influence that organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process. The term &quot;niche construction&quot; is more often used in reference to the under-appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the abiotic niche. An example of natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs in the nests of social insects, including ants, bees, wasps, and termites. There is an emergent homeostasis or homeorhesis in the structure of the nest that regulates, maintains and defends the physiology of the entire colony. Termite mounds, for example, maintain a constant internal temperature through the design of air-conditioning chimneys. The structure of the nests themselves is subject to the forces of natural selection. Moreover, a nest can survive over successive generations, so that progeny inherit both genetic material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time.

=== Biome ===
Biomes are larger units of organization that categorize regions of the Earth&#x27;s ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather, and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, the human body is a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays a significant role in the ecological biogeochemistry of the planet&#x27;s oceans.

=== Biosphere ===
The largest scale of ecological organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. Ecological relationships regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate all the way up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere&#x27;s CO2 and O2 composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.

=== Population ecology ===

Population ecology studies the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment. A population consists of individuals of the same species that live, interact, and migrate through the same niche and habitat.

A primary law of population ecology is the Malthusian growth model which states, &quot;a population will grow (or decline) exponentially as long as the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant.&quot; Simplified population models usually starts with four variables: death, birth, immigration, and emigration.

An example of an introductory population model describes a closed population, such as on an island, where immigration and emigration does not take place. Hypotheses are evaluated with reference to a null hypothesis which states that random processes create the observed data. In these island models, the rate of population change is described by:
: formula_1

where &quot;N&quot; is the total number of individuals in the population, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are the per capita rates of birth and death respectively, and &quot;r&quot; is the per capita rate of population change.

Using these modeling techniques, Malthus&#x27; population principle of growth was later transformed into a model known as the logistic equation by Pierre Verhulst:
: formula_2

where &quot;N(t)&quot; is the number of individuals measured as biomass density as a function of time, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;r&quot; is the maximum per-capita rate of change commonly known as the intrinsic rate of growth, and formula_3 is the crowding coefficient, which represents the reduction in population growth rate per individual added. The formula states that the rate of change in population size (formula_4) will grow to approach equilibrium, where (formula_5), when the rates of increase and crowding are balanced, formula_6. A common, analogous model fixes the equilibrium, formula_6 as &quot;K&quot;, which is known as the &quot;carrying capacity.&quot;

Population ecology builds upon these introductory models to further understand demographic processes in real study populations. Commonly used types of data include life history, fecundity, and survivorship, and these are analyzed using mathematical techniques such as matrix algebra. The information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas. In cases where basic models are insufficient, ecologists may adopt different kinds of statistical methods, such as the Akaike information criterion, or use models that can become mathematically complex as &quot;several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with the data.&quot;

=== Metapopulations and migration ===
The concept of metapopulations was defined in 1969 as &quot;a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize&quot;. Metapopulation ecology is another statistical approach that is often used in conservation research. Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality, and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms. Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement because it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat. Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved an expansion of the range as plant populations expanded from one area to another. There is a larger taxonomy of movement, such as commuting, foraging, territorial behavior, stasis, and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration because it involves the one-way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population.

In metapopulation terminology, migrating individuals are classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A site is a generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favorable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favorable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.

=== Community ecology ===

Community ecology is the study of the interactions among a collection of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.

=== Ecosystem ecology ===

Ecosystems may be habitats within biomes that form an integrated whole and a dynamically responsive system having both physical and biological complexes. Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials (e.g. carbon, phosphorus) between different pools (e.g., tree biomass, soil organic material). Ecosystem ecologists attempt to determine the underlying causes of these fluxes. Research in ecosystem ecology might measure primary production (g C/m^2) in a wetland in relation to decomposition and consumption rates (g C/m^2/y). This requires an understanding of the community connections between plants (i.e., primary producers) and the decomposers (e.g., fungi and bacteria).

The underlying concept of an ecosystem can be traced back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh (&quot;Man and Nature&quot;). Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space. Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.

=== Food webs ===


A food web is the archetypal ecological network. Plants capture solar energy and use it to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. Food chains in an ecological community create a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.

Empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from small-scale studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations, e.g. into the gut contents of organisms, which can be difficult to decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.

Food webs illustrate important principles of ecology: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Such linkages explain how ecological communities remain stable over time and eventually can illustrate a &quot;complete&quot; web of life.

The disruption of food webs may have a dramatic impact on the ecology of individual species or whole ecosystems. For instance, the replacement of an ant species by another (invasive) ant species has been shown to affect how elephants reduce tree cover and thus the predation of lions on zebras.

=== Trophic levels ===


A trophic level (from Greek &quot;troph&quot;, τροφή, trophē, meaning &quot;food&quot; or &quot;feeding&quot;) is &quot;a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the lower adjacent level (according to ecological pyramids) nearer the abiotic source.&quot; Links in food webs primarily connect feeding relations or trophism among species. Biodiversity within ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids, in which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain up toward top predators, and the horizontal dimension represents the abundance or biomass at each level. When the relative abundance or biomass of each species is sorted into its respective trophic level, they naturally sort into a &#x27;pyramid of numbers&#x27;.

Species are broadly categorized as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It has been suggested that omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.

Trophic levels are part of the holistic or complex systems view of ecosystems. Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions, giving a macroscopic view of the system. While the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and top-down control within food webs, it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems. This has led some ecologists to &quot;reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete, homogeneous trophic levels is fiction.&quot; Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that real trophic levels do exist, but &quot;above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores.&quot;

=== Keystone species ===
A keystone species is a species that is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role. The many connections that a keystone species holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects (termed &quot;trophic cascades&quot;) that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species. The term keystone species was coined by Robert Paine in 1969 and is a reference to the keystone architectural feature as the removal of a keystone species can result in a community collapse just as the removal of the keystone in an arch can result in the arch&#x27;s loss of stability.

Sea otters (&quot;Enhydra lutris&quot;) are commonly cited as an example of a keystone species because they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller&#x27;s sea cow (&quot;Hydrodamalis gigas&quot;). While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.

== Complexity ==

Complexity is understood as a large computational effort needed to piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of the human mind. Global patterns of biological diversity are complex. This biocomplexity stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other, such as transitional areas or ecotones spanning landscapes. Complexity stems from the interplay among levels of biological organization as energy, and matter is integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts. &quot;What were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one.&quot; Small scale patterns do not necessarily explain large scale phenomena, otherwise captured in the expression (coined by Aristotle) &#x27;the sum is greater than the parts&#x27;.

&quot;Complexity in ecology is of at least six distinct types: spatial, temporal, structural, process, behavioral, and geometric.&quot; From these principles, ecologists have identified emergent and self-organizing phenomena that operate at different environmental scales of influence, ranging from molecular to planetary, and these require different explanations at each integrative level. Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems that transition to multiple shifting steady-states directed by random fluctuations of history. Long-term ecological studies provide important track records to better understand the complexity and resilience of ecosystems over longer temporal and broader spatial scales. These studies are managed by the International Long Term Ecological Network (LTER). The longest experiment in existence is the Park Grass Experiment, which was initiated in 1856. Another example is the Hubbard Brook study, which has been in operation since 1960.

=== Holism ===
Holism remains a critical part of the theoretical foundation in contemporary ecological studies. Holism addresses the biological organization of life that self-organizes into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to non-reducible properties. This means that higher-order patterns of a whole functional system, such as an ecosystem, cannot be predicted or understood by a simple summation of the parts. &quot;New properties emerge because the components interact, not because the basic nature of the components is changed.&quot;

Ecological studies are necessarily holistic as opposed to reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without reference to the whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without the need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.

== Relation to evolution ==
Ecology and evolutionary biology are considered sister disciplines of the life sciences. Natural selection, life history, development, adaptation, populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological and evolutionary theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study the historical development of a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principles, such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal &quot;Trends in Ecology and Evolution&quot;. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.

=== Behavioural ecology ===

All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, including memory and communication. Behavioural ecology is the study of an organism&#x27;s behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology is the study of observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants, mobile phytoplankton, zooplankton swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by weevils, the mating dance of a salamander, or social gatherings of amoeba.

Adaptation is the central unifying concept in behavioural ecology. Behaviours can be recorded as traits and inherited in much the same way that eye and hair colour can. Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive fitness.

Predator-prey interactions are an introductory concept into food-web studies as well as behavioural ecology. Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators, such as avoid, flee, or defend. Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats, organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history, such as growth, feeding, mating, socializing, or modifying their habitat. 

Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation, optimization, or efficiency. For example, &quot;[t]he threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk&quot; or &quot;[t]he optimal flight initiation distance occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which depends on the prey&#x27;s initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk.&quot;

Elaborate sexual displays and posturing are encountered in the behavioural ecology of animals. The birds-of-paradise, for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during courtship. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and desirable genes. The displays are driven by sexual selection as an advertisement of quality of traits among suitors.

=== Cognitive ecology ===

Cognitive ecology integrates theory and observations from evolutionary ecology and neurobiology, primarily cognitive science, in order to understand the effect that animal interaction with their habitat has on their cognitive systems and how those systems restrict behavior within an ecological and evolutionary framework. &quot;Until recently, however, cognitive scientists have not paid sufficient attention to the fundamental fact that cognitive traits evolved under particular natural settings. With consideration of the selection pressure on cognition, cognitive ecology can contribute intellectual coherence to the multidisciplinary study of cognition.&quot; As a study involving the &#x27;coupling&#x27; or interactions between organism and environment, cognitive ecology is closely related to enactivism, a field based upon the view that &quot;...we must see the organism and environment as bound together in reciprocal specification and selection...&quot;.

=== Social ecology ===
Social-ecological behaviours are notable in the social insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied for this type of relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members survive better than groups with predominantly selfish members.

=== Coevolution ===


Ecological interactions can be classified broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships between species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.

Indirect mutualisms occur where the organisms live apart. For example, trees living in the equatorial regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism because many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying the services of a beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.

=== Biogeography ===
Biogeography (an amalgamation of &quot;biology&quot; and &quot;geography&quot;) is the comparative study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The &quot;Journal of Biogeography&quot; was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, the theory of island biogeography, published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory.

Biogeography has a long history in the natural sciences concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explain much of the modern distribution of the Earth&#x27;s biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.

==== r/K selection theory ====
A population ecology concept is r/K selection theory, one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience &quot;density-independent&quot; forces of natural selection, which is called &quot;r&quot;-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island&#x27;s carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called &quot;K&quot;-selection.

In the &quot;r/K&quot;-selection model, the first variable &quot;r&quot; is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in population size and the second variable &quot;K&quot; is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An &quot;r&quot;-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in &quot;r&quot;-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit &quot;r&quot;-selected characteristics. In contrast, a &quot;K&quot;-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting &quot;K&quot;-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.

=== Molecular ecology ===
The important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The rise of molecular technologies and the influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication &quot;Molecular Ecology&quot; in 1992. Molecular ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, John Avise also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, &quot;Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution&quot;. 

Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology. For example, molecular ecology revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous. In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called phylogeography.

== Human ecology ==

Ecology is as much a biological science as it is a human science. Human ecology is an interdisciplinary investigation into the ecology of our species. &quot;Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bioecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bioecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three.&quot; The term was formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists, and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.

The ecological complexities human beings are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated the need for a new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all-encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.

=== Restoration Ecology ===

Ecology is an employed science of restoration, repairing disturbed sites through human intervention, in natural resource management, and in environmental impact assessments. Edward O. Wilson predicted in 1992 that the 21st century &quot;will be the era of restoration in ecology&quot;. Ecological science has boomed in the industrial investment of restoring ecosystems and their processes in abandoned sites after disturbance. Natural resource managers, in forestry, for example, employ ecologists to develop, adapt, and implement ecosystem based methods into the planning, operation, and restoration phases of land-use. 

Another example of conservation is seen on the east coast of the United States in Boston, MA. The city of Boston implemented the Wetland Ordinance, improving the stability of their wetland environments by implementing soil amendments that will improve groundwater storage and flow, and trimming or removal of vegetation that could cause harm to water quality. Ecological science is used in the methods of sustainable harvesting, disease, and fire outbreak management, in fisheries stock management, for integrating land-use with protected areas and communities, and conservation in complex geo-political landscapes.

== Relation to the environment ==
The environment of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic attributes. It is dynamically interlinked and contains resources for organisms at any time throughout their life cycle. Like ecology, the term environment has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of nature. Environment &quot;includes the physical world, the social world of human relations and the built world of human creation.&quot; The physical environment is external to the level of biological organization under investigation, including abiotic factors such as temperature, radiation, light, chemistry, climate and geology. The biotic environment includes genes, cells, organisms, members of the same species (conspecifics) and other species that share a habitat.

The distinction between external and internal environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration of cause and effect between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or &quot;holocoenotic&quot; system as it was once called. This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.

=== Disturbance and resilience ===
A disturbance is any process that changes or removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations within an ecological community. Biodiversity can protect ecosystems from disturbances.

The effect of a disturbance is often hard to predict, but there are numerous examples in which a single species can massively disturb an ecosystem. For example, a single-celled protozoan has been able to kill up to 100% of sea urchins in some coral reefs in the Red Sea and Western Indian Ocean. Sea urchins enable complex reef ecosystems to thrive by eating algae that would otherwise inhibit coral growth. Similarly, invasive species can wreak havoc on ecosystems. For instance, invasive Burmese pythons have caused a 98% decline of small mammals in the Everglades.

=== Metabolism and the early atmosphere ===


The Earth was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. As it cooled and a crust and oceans formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by hydrogen to one composed mostly of methane and ammonia. Over the next billion years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into a mixture of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth&#x27;s surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of reducing and oxidizing gasses that set the stage for primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in turn, the atmosphere also evolved.

Throughout history, the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and biogeochemical cycles have been in a dynamic equilibrium with planetary ecosystems. The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability. The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely anaerobic methanogen microbes, started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane (4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O). Anoxygenic photosynthesis reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by converting hydrogen sulfide into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H2S + CO2 + h&quot;v&quot; → CH2O + H2O + 2S). Early forms of fermentation also increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the &quot;Great Oxidation&quot;) did not begin until approximately 2.4–2.3 billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3–1 billion years prior.

=== Radiation: heat, temperature and light ===

The biology of life operates within a certain range of temperatures. Heat is a form of energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.

There is a relationship between light, primary production, and ecological energy budgets. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet&#x27;s ecosystems. Light is composed of electromagnetic energy of different wavelengths. Radiant energy from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts as a catalyst for genetic mutation. Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through photosynthesis. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of H2S are autotrophs. Autotrophs—responsible for primary production—assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical enthalpic bonds.

=== Physical environments ===

==== Water ====
Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. 

Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.

==== Gravity ====

The shape and energy of the land are significantly affected by gravitational forces. On a large scale, the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of tectonic plates as well as influencing geomorphic processes such as orogeny and erosion. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. 

On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth (gravitropism), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the biomechanics and size of animals. Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves. The cardiovascular systems of animals are functionally adapted to overcome the pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).

==== Pressure ====

Climatic and osmotic pressure places physiological constraints on organisms, especially those that fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. 

Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by osmotic pressure gradients. Water pressure in the depths of oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.

==== Wind and turbulence ====

Turbulent forces in air and water affect the environment and ecosystem distribution, form, and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running over the surface of a lake creates turbulence, mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones, affecting how fish, algae, and other parts of the aquatic ecosystem are structured. 

Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation. This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems (e.g., of the Columbia Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.

==== Fire ====


Plants convert carbon dioxide into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere. By approximately 350 million years ago (the end of the Devonian period), photosynthesis had brought the concentration of atmospheric oxygen above 17%, which allowed combustion to occur. Fire releases CO2 and converts fuel into ash and tar. Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression. While the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time, Charles Cooper brought attention to the issue of forest fires in relation to the ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the 1960s.

Native North Americans were among the first to influence fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., &quot;Pinus halepensis&quot;) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.

==== Soils ====
Soil is the living top layer of mineral and organic dirt that covers the surface of the planet. It is the chief organizing centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet&#x27;s soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth&#x27;s biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. 

Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and are fed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period played a significant role in the early development of ecological trophism in soils.

==== Biogeochemistry and climate ====

Ecologists study and measure nutrient budgets to understand how these materials are regulated, flow, and recycled through the environment. This research has led to an understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth&#x27;s geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.

The ecology of global carbon budgets gives one example of the linkage between biodiversity and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth&#x27;s oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2,070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth&#x27;s history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500 ppm.

In the Oligocene, from twenty-five to thirty-two million years ago, there was another significant restructuring of the global carbon cycle as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved in response to the drop in atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 550 ppm. The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. 

Human-driven modifications to the planet&#x27;s ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, biodiversity loss, agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. 

Large sections of permafrost are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH4) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane in the context of the global carbon cycle, because methane is a greenhouse gas that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO2 on a 100-year time scale. Hence, there is a relationship between global warming, decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.

== History ==
=== Early beginnings ===
Ecology has a complex origin, due in large part to its interdisciplinary nature. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Hippocrates and Aristotle were among the first to record observations on natural history. However, they viewed life in terms of essentialism, where species were conceptualized as static unchanging things while varieties were seen as aberrations of an idealized type. This contrasts against the modern understanding of ecological theory where varieties are viewed as the real phenomena of interest and having a role in the origins of adaptations by means of natural selection. Early conceptions of ecology, such as a balance and regulation in nature can be traced to Herodotus (died &quot;c&quot;. 425 BC), who described one of the earliest accounts of mutualism in his observation of &quot;natural dentistry&quot;. Basking Nile crocodiles, he noted, would open their mouths to give sandpipers safe access to pluck leeches out, giving nutrition to the sandpiper and oral hygiene for the crocodile. Aristotle was an early influence on the philosophical development of ecology. He and his student Theophrastus made extensive observations on plant and animal migrations, biogeography, physiology, and their behavior, giving an early analogue to the modern concept of an ecological niche.

 Ernst Haeckel (left) and Eugenius Warming (right), two founders of ecology

Ecological concepts such as food chains, population regulation, and productivity were first developed in the 1700s, through the published works of microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) and botanist Richard Bradley (1688?–1732). Biogeographer Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) was an early pioneer in ecological thinking and was among the first to recognize ecological gradients, where species are replaced or altered in form along environmental gradients, such as a cline forming along a rise in elevation. Humboldt drew inspiration from Isaac Newton, as he developed a form of &quot;terrestrial physics&quot;. In Newtonian fashion, he brought a scientific exactitude for measurement into natural history and even alluded to concepts that are the foundation of a modern ecological law on species-to-area relationships. Natural historians, such as Humboldt, James Hutton, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (among others) laid the foundations of the modern ecological sciences. The term &quot;ecology&quot; () was coined by Ernst Haeckel in his book &quot;Generelle Morphologie der Organismen&quot; (1866). Haeckel was a zoologist, artist, writer, and later in life a professor of comparative anatomy.

Opinions differ on who was the founder of modern ecological theory. Some mark Haeckel&#x27;s definition as the beginning; others say it was Eugenius Warming with the writing of Oecology of Plants: An Introduction to the Study of Plant Communities (1895), or Carl Linnaeus&#x27; principles on the economy of nature that matured in the early 18th century. Linnaeus founded an early branch of ecology that he called the economy of nature. His works influenced Charles Darwin, who adopted Linnaeus&#x27; phrase on the &quot;economy or polity of nature&quot; in &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;. Linnaeus was the first to frame the balance of nature as a testable hypothesis. Haeckel, who admired Darwin&#x27;s work, defined ecology in reference to the economy of nature, which has led some to question whether ecology and the economy of nature are synonymous.

From Aristotle until Darwin, the natural world was predominantly considered static and unchanging. Prior to &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication &quot;Natural History of Selborne&quot; by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered by some to be one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.

=== Since 1900 ===
Modern ecology is a young science that first attracted substantial scientific attention toward the end of the 19th century (around the same time that evolutionary studies were gaining scientific interest). The scientist Ellen Swallow Richards adopted the term &quot;oekology&quot; (which eventually morphed into home economics) in the U.S. as early as 1892.

In the early 20th century, ecology transitioned from a more descriptive form of natural history to a more analytical form of &quot;scientific natural history&quot;. Frederic Clements published the first American ecology book, &quot;Research Methods in Ecology&quot; in 1905, presenting the idea of plant communities as a superorganism. This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the 1970s. Clements&#x27; superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of seral development that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by Henry Gleason, who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates to the development of community associations.

The Clementsian superorganism theory was an overextended application of an idealistic form of holism. The term &quot;holism&quot; was coined in 1926 by Jan Christiaan Smuts, a South African general and polarizing historical figure who was inspired by Clements&#x27; superorganism concept. Around the same time, Charles Elton pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book &quot;Animal Ecology&quot;. Elton defined ecological relations using concepts of food chains, food cycles, and food size, and described numerical relations among different functional groups and their relative abundance. Elton&#x27;s &#x27;food cycle&#x27; was replaced by &#x27;food web&#x27; in a subsequent ecological text. Alfred J. Lotka brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology.

In 1942, Raymond Lindeman wrote a landmark paper on the trophic dynamics of ecology, which was published posthumously after initially being rejected for its theoretical emphasis. Trophic dynamics became the foundation for much of the work to follow on energy and material flow through ecosystems. Robert MacArthur advanced mathematical theory, predictions, and tests in ecology in the 1950s, which inspired a resurgent school of theoretical mathematical ecologists. Ecology has also developed through contributions from other nations, including Russia&#x27;s Vladimir Vernadsky and his founding of the biosphere concept in the 1920s and Japan&#x27;s Kinji Imanishi and his concepts of harmony in nature and habitat segregation in the 1950s. Scientific recognition of contributions to ecology from non-English-speaking cultures is hampered by language and translation barriers.

Ecology surged in popular and scientific interest during the 1960–1970s environmental movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating the protection of wild places by notable ecologists in the history of conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.

In 1962, marine biologist and ecologist Rachel Carson&#x27;s book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; helped to mobilize the environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic pesticides, such as DDT (C14H9Cl5), bioaccumulating in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and ecosystem health. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge their understanding of the degradation of the planet&#x27;s ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.

<text>An alphabetic list of modern country dance terminology:
































{{defn| A figure in which ladies dance first with each other in the center of the set and then with the gentlemen on the sides. In its simplest form, two ladies begin in {{gli|second corner}} positions (nearer the head on the women&#x27;s line and nearer the foot on the men&#x27;s line). The ladies pass each other by right hand and turn with the gentlemen by left hand, approximately once around, to end with the ladies in each other&#x27;s place and the gentlemen where they began. The figure can be extended to more couples in a ring, as long as the dancers in the ring are alternating between gentlemen and ladies. If the gentlemen turn the ladies only by left hand, that is an open ladies&#x27; chain; if they also place their right hands on the ladies&#x27; backs during the turn, that is a closed ladies&#x27; chain. In English country dance, both closed and open ladies&#x27; chains are to be found, and the gentlemen make a short {{gli|cast}} up or down the set to meet the ladies; in contra dance, only the closed ladies&#x27; chain is done, and the gentlemen sidestep to meet the ladies. The men&#x27;s chain is a simple gender reversal, but is a much rarer figure.

{{term| lead }}
{{defn| Join inside hands and walk in a certain direction. To lead up or down is to walk toward or away from the {{gli|head}} of the set; to lead out is to walk away from the other line of dancers. }}

{{term| link }}
{{defn| {{ghat| See {{gli|set and link}}.}} }}

{{term| longways set |content= longways set {{anchor|longways sets}} }}
{{defn| A line of couples dancing together. This is usually &quot;longways for as many as will&quot;, indicating that any number of couples may join the longways set—although some dances require a three- or four-couple longways set. If the longways set is not restricted to three or four couples, it will be subdivided into {{gli|minor sets}} of two or three couples each. }}

{{term| &quot;Mad Robin&quot; figure }}
{{defn| A figure in which one couple dances around their respective neighbours. Men take one step forward and then slide to the right passing in front of their neighbour, then step backward and slide left behind their neighbour. Conversely women take one step backward and then slide to the left passing behind their neighbour, then step forward and slide right in front of their neighbour. In one version, the dancer who is going outside the set at the moment casts out to begin that motion; in the other, the active couple maintains eye contact. The term &quot;Mad Robin&quot; comes from the name of the dance which originated the figure. A version involving all four dancers was developed for contra dancing and later readmitted into some modern English dances. }}

{{term| minor set |content= minor set {{anchor|minor sets|duple minor|triple minor}} }}
{{defn| A {{gli|longways set}} is subdivided into several minor sets. In a duple minor dance, every two couples form a minor set. In a triple minor dance, every three couples form a minor set. The {{gli|active couple}} is always the couple in each minor set who are closest to the {{gli|head}}. After every iteration of the dance, the {{gli|progression}} will create new minor sets for the next iteration. }}

{{term| neighbour }}
{{defn| The person you are standing beside, but not your partner. }}

{{term| opposite }}
{{defn| The person you are facing, if you are not facing your partner. }}

{{term| pass |content= pass {{anchor|passing}} }}
{{defn| {{ghat| See {{gli|cross over}}.}} }}

{{term| poussette }}
{{defn| Two dancers face, give both hands and change places as a couple with two adjacent dancers. One pair moves a {{gli|double}} toward one wall, the other toward the other wall; they shift up or down, respectively, and move into the other couple&#x27;s place with another double. This completes a half-poussette; it is repeated for a whole poussette. In a draw poussette, each couple turns instead of reversing direction, so that the same dancer in each couple is always in the {{gli|lead}}. }}

{{term| progression |content= progression {{anchor|double progression|triple progression}} }}
{{defn| The process by which every couple will eventually dance with every other couple in the set, if the dance is repeated enough times. In a {{gli|duple minor}} dance with five couples dancing, for example, the couples are initially in this order: Active (couple A)/Inactive (couple B)/Active (couple C)/Inactive (couple D)/Out (couple E). This represents two {{gli|minor sets}} (couples A-B and couples C-D) and one couple (couple E) who are &quot;standing out&quot; due to having no one to dance with. After one iteration of the dance, every active couple will have moved below the inactive couple in their minor set, which in the example would be thus: Inactive (couple B)/Active (couple A)/Inactive (couple D)/Active (couple C)/Out (couple E). For the next iteration, any inactive couple at the top (and any active couple at the bottom) will stand out, while any couple standing out will begin dancing as actives (if at the top) or inactives (if at the bottom). So the next iteration would begin as follows: Out (couple B)/Active (couple A)/Inactive (couple D)/Active (couple C)/Inactive (couple E). The minor sets now contain couples A-D and couples C-E, while couple B is &quot;standing out&quot;. Dances in other forms progress differently, though the &quot;triple minor&quot; progression is quite similar.

A {{gli|longways set|longways dance}} has a double progression if the arrangement of couples into minor sets advances twice during one iteration of the dance instead of just once. A triple progression dance advances thrice during one iteration. }}

{{term| proper |content= proper {{anchor|improper}} }}
{{defn| With the man on the left and the woman on the right, from the perspective of someone facing the music; improper is the opposite. The terms carry no value judgment, but only indicate whether one is on one&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; side. A dance in {{gli|duple-minor}} {{gli|longways set|longways form}} is termed &quot;improper&quot; if the {{gli|active couples}} are improper by default; this is the exception in English country dance, but the rule in contra dance. }}

{{term| right and left }}
{{defn| {{ghat|See {{gli|changes of right and left}}.}} }}

{{term| set }}
{{defn| A dancer steps right, closes with left foot and shifts weight to it, then steps back to the right foot ({{dfn|right-together-step}}); then repeats the process mirror-image ({{dfn|left-together-step}}). In some areas, such as the Society for Creative Anachronism, it is done starting to the left. It may be done in place or advancing. Often followed by a turn single. In Scottish country dance there are several variations; in contra dance its place is generally taken by a &quot;balance right and left&quot;. Not to be confused with terms indicating groups of dancers, like {{gli|longways set}} or {{gli|minor set}}. }}

{{term| set and link }}
{{defn| A figure done by a pair of dancers and simultaneously by another pair of dancers who are facing them. Most commonly this means that the men do it facing the women, while the women do it facing the men. First, all dancers {{gli|set}}; then the dancer on the left of each pair dances a {{gli|turn single right}}, while also moving to the right, to end in his or her neighbor&#x27;s place. Meanwhile, the dancer on the right of each pair {{gli|casts}} to the left into his or her neighbor&#x27;s place; thus the men have traded places with each other, and so have the women. This figure is most commonly found in Scottish country dance. }}

{{term| sicilian circle }}
{{defn| A type of dance formation, roughly equivalent to a {{gli|longways set}} rolled into a ring. Every couple stands along the line of a large circle, facing another couple; thus half of the couples face clockwise, while the other half face counterclockwise. Since, unlike the longways set, the Sicilian circle has no place for dancers to &quot;stand out&quot;, Sicilian circle dances must be done by an even number of couples. The {{gli|progression}} is similar to that of a {{gli|duple minor}}, but since there is nowhere for couples to reverse direction, every clockwise couple will only dance with the counterclockwise couples (and vice versa). }}

{{term| siding }}
{{defn| Two dancers go forward in four counts to meet side by side, then back in four counts to where they started the figure. As depicted by Feuillet, this is done right side by right side the first time, left by left the second time. In Cecil Sharp&#x27;s reconstruction, the dancers {{gli|pass}} by left shoulder (in some versions holding hands), turn to face each other, then return along the same path, passing by right shoulder; this is then repeated. So-called &quot;Cecil Sharp siding&quot; is no longer considered historical, but is still used on its own merits. Standard siding is sometimes called &quot;Pat Shaw siding&quot; (after its reconstructor) to distinguish it from &quot;Cecil Sharp siding&quot;. }}

{{term| single }}
{{defn| Two steps in any direction, closing feet on the second step. The second step tends to be interpreted as a closing action in which weight usually stays on the same foot as before, consistent with descriptions from Renaissance sources. }}

{{term| slipping circle |content= slipping circle (left or right) }}
{{defn| Dancers take hands in a circle (facing in) and {{gli|chassé}} left or right. }}

{{term| star |content= star {{anchor|star left|start right}} }}
{{defn| {{ghat|See {{gli|hands across}}.}} }}

{{term| straight hey for four }}
{{defn| Dancers face alternately, the two in the middle facing out. Dancers {{gli|pass}} right shoulders on either end and weave to the end opposite. If the last pass at the end is by the right, the dancer turns right and reenters the line by the same shoulder; vice versa if the last pass was to the left. Dancers end in their original places. }}

{{term| straight hey for three }}
{{defn| The first dancer faces the other two and {{gli|passes}} right shoulders with the second dancer, left shoulder with the third - the other dancers moving and passing the indicated shoulder. On making the last pass, each dancer makes a whole turn on the end, bearing right if the last pass was by the right shoulder or left if last pass was by the left, and reenters the figure returning to place. Each dancer describes a {{gli|figure of eight}} pattern. }}

{{term| swing }}
{{defn| A &quot;turn&quot; with two hands, but moving faster and making more than one revolution. Several variants exist, including the ballroom swing and the Welsh swing. }}

{{term| track figure }}
{{defn| A generic term for any composite figure where the dancers involved travel within the set. An example track figure might be &quot;Ones cast around the Twos, cross, cast around the Threes, and lead back up to place.&quot; The {{gli|figure of 8}} would be considered a track figure if it were not common enough to have its own name. }}

{{term| turn both-hands }}
{{defn| Face, give {{gli|both hands}}, and make a complete circular, clockwise turn to place. }}

{{term| turn by left }}
{{term| turn by right }}
{{defn| Dancers join right (or left) hands and turn around, separate, and {{gli|fall}} to places. }}

{{term| turn single |content= turn single {{anchor|turn single right|turn single left}} }}
{{defn| Dancers turn around in four steps. Turn single right is a clockwise turn; turn single left is a counterclockwise turn. May involve a backward motion, as after a {{gli|set|set advancing}}. }}

{{term| up a double and back }}
{{defn| Common combination in which dancers, usually having {{gli|link|linked}} hands in a line, advance a double and then retire another double. }}

<text>An ecosystem (or ecological system) is a system formed by organisms in interaction with their environment. The biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.

Ecosystems are controlled by external and internal factors. External factors such as climate, parent material which forms the soil and topography, control the overall structure of an ecosystem but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. Internal factors are controlled, for example, by decomposition, root competition, shading, disturbance, succession, and the types of species present. While the resource inputs are generally controlled by external processes, the availability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors. Therefore, internal factors not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them.

Ecosystems are entities—they are subject to periodic disturbances and are always in the process of recovering from some past disturbance. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its resistance. The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks is termed its ecological resilience. Ecosystems can be studied through a variety of approaches—theoretical studies, studies monitoring specific ecosystems over long periods of time, those that look at differences between ecosystems to elucidate how they work and direct manipulative experimentation. Biomes are general classes or categories of ecosystems. However, there is no clear distinction between biomes and ecosystems. Ecosystem classifications are specific kinds of ecological classifications that consider all four elements of the definition of ecosystems: a biotic component, an abiotic complex, the interactions between and within them, and the physical space they occupy. Biotic factors of the ecosystem are living things; such as plants, animals, and bacteria, while abiotic are non-living components; such as water, soil and atmosphere.

Plants allow energy to enter the system through photosynthesis, building up plant tissue. Animals play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through the system, by feeding on plants and on one another. They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and microbes.

Ecosystems provide a variety of goods and services upon which people depend, and may be part of. Ecosystem goods include the &quot;tangible, material products&quot; of ecosystem processes such as water, food, fuel, construction material, and medicinal plants. Ecosystem services, on the other hand, are generally &quot;improvements in the condition or location of things of value&quot;. These include things like the maintenance of hydrological cycles, cleaning air and water, the maintenance of oxygen in the atmosphere, crop pollination and even things like beauty, inspiration and opportunities for research. Many ecosystems become degraded through human impacts, such as soil loss, air and water pollution, habitat fragmentation, water diversion, fire suppression, and introduced species and invasive species. These threats can lead to abrupt transformation of the ecosystem or to gradual disruption of biotic processes and degradation of abiotic conditions of the ecosystem. Once the original ecosystem has lost its defining features, it is considered &quot;collapsed&quot;. Ecosystem restoration can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

== Definition ==
An ecosystem (or ecological system) consists of all the organisms and the abiotic pools (or physical environment) with which they interact. The biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.

&quot;Ecosystem processes&quot; are the transfers of energy and materials from one pool to another. Ecosystem processes are known to &quot;take place at a wide range of scales&quot;. Therefore, the correct scale of study depends on the question asked.

=== Origin and development of the term ===
The term &quot;ecosystem&quot; was first used in 1935 in a publication by British ecologist Arthur Tansley. The term was coined by Arthur Roy Clapham, who came up with the word at Tansley&#x27;s request. Tansley devised the concept to draw attention to the importance of transfers of materials between organisms and their environment. He later refined the term, describing it as &quot;The whole system, ... including not only the organism-complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the environment&quot;. Tansley regarded ecosystems not simply as natural units, but as &quot;mental isolates&quot;. Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term &quot;ecotope&quot;.

G. Evelyn Hutchinson, a limnologist who was a contemporary of Tansley&#x27;s, combined Charles Elton&#x27;s ideas about trophic ecology with those of Russian geochemist Vladimir Vernadsky. As a result, he suggested that mineral nutrient availability in a lake limited algal production. This would, in turn, limit the abundance of animals that feed on algae. Raymond Lindeman took these ideas further to suggest that the flow of energy through a lake was the primary driver of the ecosystem. Hutchinson&#x27;s students, brothers Howard T. Odum and Eugene P. Odum, further developed a &quot;systems approach&quot; to the study of ecosystems. This allowed them to study the flow of energy and material through ecological systems.

==Processes==

=== External and internal factors ===
Ecosystems are controlled by both external and internal factors. External factors, also called state factors, control the overall structure of an ecosystem and the way things work within it, but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. On broad geographic scales, climate is the factor that &quot;most strongly determines ecosystem processes and structure&quot;. Climate determines the biome in which the ecosystem is embedded. Rainfall patterns and seasonal temperatures influence photosynthesis and thereby determine the amount of energy available to the ecosystem.

Parent material determines the nature of the soil in an ecosystem, and influences the supply of mineral nutrients. Topography also controls ecosystem processes by affecting things like microclimate, soil development and the movement of water through a system. For example, ecosystems can be quite different if situated in a small depression on the landscape, versus one present on an adjacent steep hillside.

Other external factors that play an important role in ecosystem functioning include time and potential biota, the organisms that are present in a region and could potentially occupy a particular site. Ecosystems in similar environments that are located in different parts of the world can end up doing things very differently simply because they have different pools of species present. The introduction of non-native species can cause substantial shifts in ecosystem function.

Unlike external factors, internal factors in ecosystems not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. While the resource inputs are generally controlled by external processes like climate and parent material, the availability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors like decomposition, root competition or shading. Other factors like disturbance, succession or the types of species present are also internal factors.

===Primary production===
Primary production is the production of organic matter from inorganic carbon sources. This mainly occurs through photosynthesis. The energy incorporated through this process supports life on earth, while the carbon makes up much of the organic matter in living and dead biomass, soil carbon and fossil fuels. It also drives the carbon cycle, which influences global climate via the greenhouse effect.

Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine carbon dioxide and water to produce carbohydrates and oxygen. The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP). About half of the gross GPP is respired by plants in order to provide the energy that supports their growth and maintenance. The remainder, that portion of GPP that is not used up by respiration, is known as the net primary production (NPP). Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.

===Energy flow===

Energy and carbon enter ecosystems through photosynthesis, are incorporated into living tissue, transferred to other organisms that feed on the living and dead plant matter, and eventually released through respiration. The carbon and energy incorporated into plant tissues (net primary production) is either consumed by animals while the plant is alive, or it remains uneaten when the plant tissue dies and becomes detritus. In terrestrial ecosystems, the vast majority of the net primary production ends up being broken down by decomposers. The remainder is consumed by animals while still alive and enters the plant-based trophic system. After plants and animals die, the organic matter contained in them enters the detritus-based trophic system.

Ecosystem respiration is the sum of respiration by all living organisms (plants, animals, and decomposers) in the ecosystem. Net ecosystem production is the difference between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration. In the absence of disturbance, net ecosystem production is equivalent to the net carbon accumulation in the ecosystem.

Energy can also be released from an ecosystem through disturbances such as wildfire or transferred to other ecosystems (e.g., from a forest to a stream to a lake) by erosion.

In aquatic systems, the proportion of plant biomass that gets consumed by herbivores is much higher than in terrestrial systems. In trophic systems, photosynthetic organisms are the primary producers. The organisms that consume their tissues are called primary consumers or secondary producers—herbivores. Organisms which feed on microbes (bacteria and fungi) are termed microbivores. Animals that feed on primary consumers—carnivores—are secondary consumers. Each of these constitutes a trophic level.

The sequence of consumption—from plant to herbivore, to carnivore—forms a food chain. Real systems are much more complex than this—organisms will generally feed on more than one form of food, and may feed at more than one trophic level. Carnivores may capture some prey that is part of a plant-based trophic system and others that are part of a detritus-based trophic system (a bird that feeds both on herbivorous grasshoppers and earthworms, which consume detritus). Real systems, with all these complexities, form food webs rather than food chains which present a number of common, non random properties in the topology of their network.

===Decomposition===
The carbon and nutrients in dead organic matter are broken down by a group of processes known as decomposition. This releases nutrients that can then be re-used for plant and microbial production and returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (or water) where it can be used for photosynthesis. In the absence of decomposition, the dead organic matter would accumulate in an ecosystem, and nutrients and atmospheric carbon dioxide would be depleted.

Decomposition processes can be separated into three categories—leaching, fragmentation and chemical alteration of dead material. As water moves through dead organic matter, it dissolves and carries with it the water-soluble components. These are then taken up by organisms in the soil, react with mineral soil, or are transported beyond the confines of the ecosystem (and are considered lost to it). Newly shed leaves and newly dead animals have high concentrations of water-soluble components and include sugars, amino acids and mineral nutrients. Leaching is more important in wet environments and less important in dry ones.

Fragmentation processes break organic material into smaller pieces, exposing new surfaces for colonization by microbes. Freshly shed leaf litter may be inaccessible due to an outer layer of cuticle or bark, and cell contents are protected by a cell wall. Newly dead animals may be covered by an exoskeleton. Fragmentation processes, which break through these protective layers, accelerate the rate of microbial decomposition. Animals fragment detritus as they hunt for food, as does passage through the gut. Freeze-thaw cycles and cycles of wetting and drying also fragment dead material.

The chemical alteration of the dead organic matter is primarily achieved through bacterial and fungal action. Fungal hyphae produce enzymes that can break through the tough outer structures surrounding dead plant material. They also produce enzymes that break down lignin, which allows them access to both cell contents and the nitrogen in the lignin. Fungi can transfer carbon and nitrogen through their hyphal networks and thus, unlike bacteria, are not dependent solely on locally available resources.

==== Decomposition rates ====
Decomposition rates vary among ecosystems. The rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors—the physical environment (temperature, moisture, and soil properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers, and the nature of the microbial community itself. Temperature controls the rate of microbial respiration; the higher the temperature, the faster the microbial decomposition occurs. Temperature also affects soil moisture, which affects decomposition. Freeze-thaw cycles also affect decomposition—freezing temperatures kill soil microorganisms, which allows leaching to play a more important role in moving nutrients around. This can be especially important as the soil thaws in the spring, creating a pulse of nutrients that become available.

Decomposition rates are low under very wet or very dry conditions. Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils tend to become deficient in oxygen (this is especially true in wetlands), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth.

=== Dynamics and resilience ===
Ecosystems are dynamic entities. They are subject to periodic disturbances and are always in the process of recovering from past disturbances. When a perturbation occurs, an ecosystem responds by moving away from its initial state. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its resistance. The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks is termed its ecological resilience. Resilience thinking also includes humanity as an integral part of the biosphere where we are dependent on ecosystem services for our survival and must build and maintain their natural capacities to withstand shocks and disturbances. Time plays a central role over a wide range, for example, in the slow development of soil from bare rock and the faster recovery of a community from disturbance.

Disturbance also plays an important role in ecological processes. F. Stuart Chapin and coauthors define disturbance as &quot;a relatively discrete event in time that removes plant biomass&quot;. This can range from herbivore outbreaks, treefalls, fires, hurricanes, floods, glacial advances, to volcanic eruptions. Such disturbances can cause large changes in plant, animal and microbe populations, as well as soil organic matter content. Disturbance is followed by succession, a &quot;directional change in ecosystem structure and functioning resulting from biotically driven changes in resource supply.&quot;

The frequency and severity of disturbance determine the way it affects ecosystem function. A major disturbance like a volcanic eruption or glacial advance and retreat leave behind soils that lack plants, animals or organic matter. Ecosystems that experience such disturbances undergo primary succession. A less severe disturbance like forest fires, hurricanes or cultivation result in secondary succession and a faster recovery. More severe and more frequent disturbance result in longer recovery times.

From one year to another, ecosystems experience variation in their biotic and abiotic environments. A drought, a colder than usual winter, and a pest outbreak all are short-term variability in environmental conditions. Animal populations vary from year to year, building up during resource-rich periods and crashing as they overshoot their food supply. Longer-term changes also shape ecosystem processes. For example, the forests of eastern North America still show legacies of cultivation which ceased in 1850 when large areas were reverted to forests. Another example is the methane production in eastern Siberian lakes that is controlled by organic matter which accumulated during the Pleistocene.


===Nutrient cycling===
Ecosystems continually exchange energy and carbon with the wider environment. Mineral nutrients, on the other hand, are mostly cycled back and forth between plants, animals, microbes and the soil. Most nitrogen enters ecosystems through biological nitrogen fixation, is deposited through precipitation, dust, gases or is applied as fertilizer. Most terrestrial ecosystems are nitrogen-limited in the short term making nitrogen cycling an important control on ecosystem production. Over the long term, phosphorus availability can also be critical.

Macronutrients which are required by all plants in large quantities include the primary nutrients (which are most limiting as they are used in largest amounts): Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium. Secondary major nutrients (less often limiting) include: Calcium, magnesium, sulfur. Micronutrients required by all plants in small quantities include boron, chloride, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, zinc. Finally, there are also beneficial nutrients which may be required by certain plants or by plants under specific environmental conditions: aluminum, cobalt, iodine, nickel, selenium, silicon, sodium, vanadium.

Until modern times, nitrogen fixation was the major source of nitrogen for ecosystems. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria either live symbiotically with plants or live freely in the soil. The energetic cost is high for plants that support nitrogen-fixing symbionts—as much as 25% of gross primary production when measured in controlled conditions. Many members of the legume plant family support nitrogen-fixing symbionts. Some cyanobacteria are also capable of nitrogen fixation. These are phototrophs, which carry out photosynthesis. Like other nitrogen-fixing bacteria, they can either be free-living or have symbiotic relationships with plants. Other sources of nitrogen include acid deposition produced through the combustion of fossil fuels, ammonia gas which evaporates from agricultural fields which have had fertilizers applied to them, and dust. Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs account for about 80% of all nitrogen fluxes in ecosystems.

When plant tissues are shed or are eaten, the nitrogen in those tissues becomes available to animals and microbes. Microbial decomposition releases nitrogen compounds from dead organic matter in the soil, where plants, fungi, and bacteria compete for it. Some soil bacteria use organic nitrogen-containing compounds as a source of carbon, and release ammonium ions into the soil. This process is known as nitrogen mineralization. Others convert ammonium to nitrite and nitrate ions, a process known as nitrification. Nitric oxide and nitrous oxide are also produced during nitrification. Under nitrogen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions, nitrates and nitrites are converted to nitrogen gas, a process known as denitrification.

Mycorrhizal fungi which are symbiotic with plant roots, use carbohydrates supplied by the plants and in return transfer phosphorus and nitrogen compounds back to the plant roots. This is an important pathway of organic nitrogen transfer from dead organic matter to plants. This mechanism may contribute to more than 70 Tg of annually assimilated plant nitrogen, thereby playing a critical role in global nutrient cycling and ecosystem function.

Phosphorus enters ecosystems through weathering. As ecosystems age this supply diminishes, making phosphorus-limitation more common in older landscapes (especially in the tropics). Calcium and sulfur are also produced by weathering, but acid deposition is an important source of sulfur in many ecosystems. Although magnesium and manganese are produced by weathering, exchanges between soil organic matter and living cells account for a significant portion of ecosystem fluxes. Potassium is primarily cycled between living cells and soil organic matter.

===Function and biodiversity===

Biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem functioning. Ecosystem processes are driven by the species in an ecosystem, the nature of the individual species, and the relative abundance of organisms among these species. Ecosystem processes are the net effect of the actions of individual organisms as they interact with their environment. Ecological theory suggests that in order to coexist, species must have some level of limiting similarity—they must be different from one another in some fundamental way, otherwise, one species would competitively exclude the other. Despite this, the cumulative effect of additional species in an ecosystem is not linear: additional species may enhance nitrogen retention, for example. However, beyond some level of species richness, additional species may have little additive effect unless they differ substantially from species already present. This is the case for example for exotic species.

The addition (or loss) of species that are ecologically similar to those already present in an ecosystem tends to only have a small effect on ecosystem function. Ecologically distinct species, on the other hand, have a much larger effect. Similarly, dominant species have a large effect on ecosystem function, while rare species tend to have a small effect. Keystone species tend to have an effect on ecosystem function that is disproportionate to their abundance in an ecosystem.

An ecosystem engineer is any organism that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a habitat.

== Study approaches ==

=== Ecosystem ecology ===


Ecosystem ecology is the &quot;study of the interactions between organisms and their environment as an integrated system&quot;. The size of ecosystems can range up to ten orders of magnitude, from the surface layers of rocks to the surface of the planet.

The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study started in 1963 to study the White Mountains in New Hampshire. It was the first successful attempt to study an entire watershed as an ecosystem. The study used stream chemistry as a means of monitoring ecosystem properties, and developed a detailed biogeochemical model of the ecosystem. Long-term research at the site led to the discovery of acid rain in North America in 1972. Researchers documented the depletion of soil cations (especially calcium) over the next several decades.

Ecosystems can be studied through a variety of approaches—theoretical studies, studies monitoring specific ecosystems over long periods of time, those that look at differences between ecosystems to elucidate how they work and direct manipulative experimentation. Studies can be carried out at a variety of scales, ranging from whole-ecosystem studies to studying or mesocosms (simplified representations of ecosystems). American ecologist Stephen R. Carpenter has argued that microcosm experiments can be &quot;irrelevant and diversionary&quot; if they are not carried out in conjunction with field studies done at the ecosystem scale. In such cases, microcosm experiments may fail to accurately predict ecosystem-level dynamics.

=== Classifications ===

Biomes are general classes or categories of ecosystems. However, there is no clear distinction between biomes and ecosystems. Biomes are always defined at a very general level. Ecosystems can be described at levels that range from very general (in which case the names are sometimes the same as those of biomes) to very specific, such as &quot;wet coastal needle-leafed forests&quot;.

Biomes vary due to global variations in climate. Biomes are often defined by their structure: at a general level, for example, tropical forests, temperate grasslands, and arctic tundra. There can be any degree of subcategories among ecosystem types that comprise a biome, e.g., needle-leafed boreal forests or wet tropical forests. Although ecosystems are most commonly categorized by their structure and geography, there are also other ways to categorize and classify ecosystems such as by their level of human impact (see anthropogenic biome), or by their integration with social processes or technological processes or their novelty (e.g. novel ecosystem). Each of these taxonomies of ecosystems tends to emphasize different structural or functional properties. None of these is the &quot;best&quot; classification.

Ecosystem classifications are specific kinds of ecological classifications that consider all four elements of the definition of ecosystems: a biotic component, an abiotic complex, the interactions between and within them, and the physical space they occupy. Different approaches to ecological classifications have been developed in terrestrial, freshwater and marine disciplines, and a function-based typology has been proposed to leverage the strengths of these different approaches into a unified system.

==Human interactions with ecosystems==
Human activities are important in almost all ecosystems. Although humans exist and operate within ecosystems, their cumulative effects are large enough to influence external factors like climate.

===Ecosystem goods and services===

Ecosystems provide a variety of goods and services upon which people depend. Ecosystem goods include the &quot;tangible, material products&quot; of ecosystem processes such as water, food, fuel, construction material, and medicinal plants. They also include less tangible items like tourism and recreation, and genes from wild plants and animals that can be used to improve domestic species.

Ecosystem services, on the other hand, are generally &quot;improvements in the condition or location of things of value&quot;. These include things like the maintenance of hydrological cycles, cleaning air and water, the maintenance of oxygen in the atmosphere, crop pollination and even things like beauty, inspiration and opportunities for research. While material from the ecosystem had traditionally been recognized as being the basis for things of economic value, ecosystem services tend to be taken for granted.

The &quot;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment&quot; is an international synthesis by over 1000 of the world&#x27;s leading biological scientists that analyzes the state of the Earth&#x27;s ecosystems and provides summaries and guidelines for decision-makers. The report identified four major categories of ecosystem services: provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services. It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of the world ecosystems, reducing both their resilience and biocapacity. The report refers to natural systems as humanity&#x27;s &quot;life-support system&quot;, providing essential ecosystem services. The assessment measures 24 ecosystem services and concludes that only four have shown improvement over the last 50 years, 15 are in serious decline, and five are in a precarious condition.

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is an intergovernmental organization established to improve the interface between science and policy on issues of biodiversity and ecosystem services. It is intended to serve a similar role to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 

Ecosystem services are limited and also threatened by human activities. To help inform decision-makers, many ecosystem services are being assigned economic values, often based on the cost of replacement with anthropogenic alternatives. The ongoing challenge of prescribing economic value to nature, for example through biodiversity banking, is prompting transdisciplinary shifts in how we recognize and manage the environment, social responsibility, business opportunities, and our future as a species.

===Degradation and decline===

As human population and per capita consumption grow, so do the resource demands imposed on ecosystems and the effects of the human ecological footprint. Natural resources are vulnerable and limited. The environmental impacts of anthropogenic actions are becoming more apparent. Problems for all ecosystems include: environmental pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss. For terrestrial ecosystems further threats include air pollution, soil degradation, and deforestation. For aquatic ecosystems threats also include unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example overfishing), marine pollution, microplastics pollution, the effects of climate change on oceans (e.g. warming and acidification), and building on coastal areas.

Many ecosystems become degraded through human impacts, such as soil loss, air and water pollution, habitat fragmentation, water diversion, fire suppression, and introduced species and invasive species.

These threats can lead to abrupt transformation of the ecosystem or to gradual disruption of biotic processes and degradation of abiotic conditions of the ecosystem. Once the original ecosystem has lost its defining features, it is considered &quot;collapsed&quot; (see also IUCN Red List of Ecosystems). Ecosystem collapse could be reversible and in this way differs from species extinction. Quantitative assessments of the risk of collapse are used as measures of conservation status and trends.

=== Management ===
When natural resource management is applied to whole ecosystems, rather than single species, it is termed ecosystem management. Although definitions of ecosystem management abound, there is a common set of principles which underlie these definitions: A fundamental principle is the long-term sustainability of the production of goods and services by the ecosystem; &quot;intergenerational sustainability [is] a precondition for management, not an afterthought&quot;. While ecosystem management can be used as part of a plan for wilderness conservation, it can also be used in intensively managed ecosystems (see, for example, agroecosystem and close to nature forestry).

=== Restoration and sustainable development ===
Integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) aim to address conservation and human livelihood (sustainable development) concerns in developing countries together, rather than separately as was often done in the past.

<text>The number  is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828 that is the base of the natural logarithm and exponential function. It is sometimes called Euler&#x27;s number, after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, though this can invite confusion with Euler numbers, or with Euler&#x27;s constant, a different constant typically denoted formula_1. Alternatively, can be called Napier&#x27;s constant after John Napier. The Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli discovered the constant while studying compound interest.

The number is of great importance in mathematics, alongside 0, 1, , and . All five appear in one formulation of Euler&#x27;s identity formula_2 and play important and recurring roles across mathematics. Like the constant , is irrational, meaning that it cannot be represented as a ratio of integers, and moreover it is transcendental, meaning that it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients. To 30 decimal places, the value of is:
== Definitions ==
The number is the limit 
formula_3
an expression that arises in the computation of compound interest.

It is the sum of the infinite series
formula_4

It is the unique positive number such that the graph of the function has a slope of 1 at .

One has formula_5 where formula_6 is the (natural) exponential function, the unique function that equals its own derivative and satisfies the equation formula_7 Since the exponential function is commonly denoted as formula_8 one has also
formula_9

The logarithm of base can be defined as the inverse function of the function formula_10 Since formula_11 one has formula_12 The equation formula_13 implies therefore that is the base of the natural logarithm.

The number can also be characterized in terms of an integral:
formula_14

For other characterizations, see .

== History ==
The first references to the constant were published in 1618 in the table of an appendix of a work on logarithms by John Napier. However, this did not contain the constant itself, but simply a list of logarithms to the base formula_15. It is assumed that the table was written by William Oughtred. In 1661, Christiaan Huygens studied how to compute logarithms by geometrical methods and calculated a quantity that, in retrospect, is the base-10 logarithm of , but he did not recognize itself as a quantity of interest.

The constant itself was introduced by Jacob Bernoulli in 1683, for solving the problem of continuous compounding of interest.
In his solution, the constant occurs as the limit
formula_16
where represents the number of intervals in a year on which the compound interest is evaluated (for example, formula_17 for monthly compounding).

The first symbol used for this constant was the letter by Gottfried Leibniz in letters to Christiaan Huygens in 1690 and 1691.

Leonhard Euler started to use the letter for the constant in 1727 or 1728, in an unpublished paper on explosive forces in cannons, and in a letter to Christian Goldbach on 25 November 1731. The first appearance of in a printed publication was in Euler&#x27;s &quot;Mechanica&quot; (1736). It is unknown why Euler chose the letter . Although some researchers used the letter in the subsequent years, the letter was more common and eventually became standard.

Euler proved that is the sum of the infinite series
formula_18
where is the factorial of . The equivalence of the two characterizations using the limit and the infinite series can be proved via the binomial theorem.

== Applications ==

=== Compound interest ===
Jacob Bernoulli discovered this constant in 1683, while studying a question about compound interest:
If the interest is credited twice in the year, the interest rate for each 6 months will be 50%, so the initial $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding at the end of the year. Compounding quarterly yields , and compounding monthly yields . If there are compounding intervals, the interest for each interval will be and the value at the end of the year will be $1.00 × .

Bernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the force of interest) with larger and, thus, smaller compounding intervals. Compounding weekly () yields $2.692596..., while compounding daily () yields $2.714567... (approximately two cents more). The limit as grows large is the number that came to be known as . That is, with &quot;continuous&quot; compounding, the account value will reach $2.718281828... More generally, an account that starts at $1 and offers an annual interest rate of will, after years, yield dollars with continuous compounding. Here, is the decimal equivalent of the rate of interest expressed as a &quot;percentage&quot;, so for 5% interest, .

=== Bernoulli trials ===

The number itself also has applications in probability theory, in a way that is not obviously related to exponential growth. Suppose that a gambler plays a slot machine that pays out with a probability of one in and plays it times. As increases, the probability that gambler will lose all bets approaches . For , this is already approximately 1/2.789509...

This is an example of a Bernoulli trial process. Each time the gambler plays the slots, there is a one in chance of winning. Playing times is modeled by the binomial distribution, which is closely related to the binomial theorem and Pascal&#x27;s triangle. The probability of winning times out of trials is:
:formula_19

In particular, the probability of winning zero times () is
:formula_20

The limit of the above expression, as tends to infinity, is precisely .

=== Exponential growth and decay ===

Exponential growth is a process that increases quantity over time at an ever-increasing rate. It occurs when the instantaneous rate of change (that is, the derivative) of a quantity with respect to time is proportional to the quantity itself. Described as a function, a quantity undergoing exponential growth is an exponential function of time, that is, the variable representing time is the exponent (in contrast to other types of growth, such as quadratic growth). If the constant of proportionality is negative, then the quantity decreases over time, and is said to be undergoing exponential decay instead. The law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different base, for which the number is a common and convenient choice:
formula_21
Here, formula_22 denotes the initial value of the quantity , is the growth constant, and formula_23 is the time it takes the quantity to grow by a factor of .

=== Standard normal distribution ===
The normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation is known as the &quot;standard normal distribution&quot;, given by the probability density function
formula_24

The constraint of unit standard deviation (and thus also unit variance) results in the in the exponent, and the constraint of unit total area under the curve formula_25 results in the factor formula_26. This function is symmetric around , where it attains its maximum value formula_26, and has inflection points at .

=== Derangements ===

Another application of , also discovered in part by Jacob Bernoulli along with Pierre Remond de Montmort, is in the problem of derangements, also known as the &quot;hat check problem&quot;: guests are invited to a party and, at the door, the guests all check their hats with the butler, who in turn places the hats into boxes, each labelled with the name of one guest. But the butler has not asked the identities of the guests, and so puts the hats into boxes selected at random. The problem of de Montmort is to find the probability that &quot;none&quot; of the hats gets put into the right box. This probability, denoted by formula_28, is:

:formula_29

As tends to infinity, approaches . Furthermore, the number of ways the hats can be placed into the boxes so that none of the hats are in the right box is rounded to the nearest integer, for every positive .

=== Optimal planning problems ===
The maximum value of formula_30 occurs at formula_31. Equivalently, for any value of the base , it is the case that the maximum value of formula_32 occurs at formula_31 (Steiner&#x27;s problem, discussed below).

This is useful in the problem of a stick of length that is broken into equal parts. The value of that maximizes the product of the lengths is then either
:formula_34 or formula_35

The quantity formula_32 is also a measure of information gleaned from an event occurring with probability formula_37 (approximately formula_38 when formula_39), so that essentially the same optimal division appears in optimal planning problems like the secretary problem.

=== Asymptotics ===
The number occurs naturally in connection with many problems involving asymptotics. An example is Stirling&#x27;s formula for the asymptotics of the factorial function, in which both the numbers and  appear:
formula_40

As a consequence,
formula_41

== Properties ==

=== Calculus ===

The principal motivation for introducing the number , particularly in calculus, is to perform differential and integral calculus with exponential functions and logarithms. A general exponential has a derivative, given by a limit:

:formula_42

The parenthesized limit on the right is independent of the Its value turns out to be the logarithm of to base . Thus, when the value of is set this limit is equal and so one arrives at the following simple identity:
:formula_43

Consequently, the exponential function with base is particularly suited to doing calculus. (as opposed to some other number) as the base of the exponential function makes calculations involving the derivatives much simpler.

Another motivation comes from considering the derivative of the base- logarithm (i.e., ), for :

:formula_44

where the substitution was made. The base- logarithm of is 1, if equals . So symbolically,
:formula_45

The logarithm with this special base is called the natural logarithm, and is usually denoted as ; it behaves well under differentiation since there is no undetermined limit to carry through the calculations.

Thus, there are two ways of selecting such special numbers . One way is to set the derivative of the exponential function equal to , and solve for . The other way is to set the derivative of the base logarithm to and solve for . In each case, one arrives at a convenient choice of base for doing calculus. It turns out that these two solutions for are actually &quot;the same&quot;: the number .

The Taylor series for the exponential function can be deduced from the facts that the exponential function is its own derivative and that it equals 1 when evaluated at 0:
formula_46
Setting formula_47 recovers the definition of as the sum of an infinite series.

The natural logarithm function can be defined as the integral from 1 to formula_48 of formula_49, and the exponential function can then be defined as the inverse function of the natural logarithm. The number is the value of the exponential function evaluated at formula_47, or equivalently, the number whose natural logarithm is 1. It follows that is the unique positive real number such that
formula_51

Because is the unique function (up to multiplication by a constant ) that is equal to its own derivative,

formula_52

it is therefore its own antiderivative as well:

formula_53

Equivalently, the family of functions

formula_54

where is any real or complex number, is the full solution to the differential equation

formula_55

=== Inequalities ===

The number is the unique real number such that
formula_56
for all positive .

Also, we have the inequality
formula_57
for all real , with equality if and only if . Furthermore, is the unique base of the exponential for which the inequality holds for all . This is a limiting case of Bernoulli&#x27;s inequality.

=== Exponential-like functions ===
Steiner&#x27;s problem asks to find the global maximum for the function

formula_58

This maximum occurs precisely at . (One can check that the derivative of is zero only for this value of .)

Similarly, is where the global minimum occurs for the function

formula_59

The infinite tetration

:formula_60 or formula_61

converges if and only if , shown by a theorem of Leonhard Euler.

=== Number theory ===
The real number is irrational. Euler proved this by showing that its simple continued fraction expansion does not terminate. (See also Fourier&#x27;s proof that is irrational.)

Furthermore, by the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, is transcendental, meaning that it is not a solution of any non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. It was the first number to be proved transcendental without having been specifically constructed for this purpose (compare with Liouville number); the proof was given by Charles Hermite in 1873. The number is one of only a few transcendental numbers for which the exact irrationality exponent is known (given by formula_62).

An unsolved problem thus far is the question of whether or not the numbers and are algebraically independent. This would be resolved by Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture – a currently unproven generalization of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem.

It is conjectured that is normal, meaning that when is expressed in any base the possible digits in that base are uniformly distributed (occur with equal probability in any sequence of given length).

In algebraic geometry, a &quot;period&quot; is a number that can be expressed as an integral of an algebraic function over an algebraic domain. The constant is a period, but it is conjectured that is not.

=== Complex numbers ===
The exponential function may be written as a Taylor series

formula_63

Because this series is convergent for every complex value of , it is commonly used to extend the definition of to the complex numbers. This, with the Taylor series for and, allows one to derive Euler&#x27;s formula:

formula_64

which holds for every complex . The special case with is Euler&#x27;s identity:

formula_65
which is considered to be an exemplar of mathematical beauty as it shows a profound connection between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics. In addition, it is directly used in a proof that is transcendental, which implies the impossibility of squaring the circle. Moreover, the identity implies that, in the principal branch of the logarithm,

formula_66

Furthermore, using the laws for exponentiation,

formula_67

for any integer , which is de Moivre&#x27;s formula.

The expressions of and in terms of the exponential function can be deduced from the Taylor series:
formula_68

The expression
formula_69
is sometimes abbreviated as .

== Representations ==
The number can be represented in a variety of ways: as an infinite series, an infinite product, a continued fraction, or a limit of a sequence. In addition to the limit and the series given above, there is also the simple continued fraction
:formula_70

which written out looks like

:formula_71

The following infinite product evaluates to :
formula_72

Many other series, sequence, continued fraction, and infinite product representations of have been proved.

=== Stochastic representations ===
In addition to exact analytical expressions for representation of , there are stochastic techniques for estimating . One such approach begins with an infinite sequence of independent random variables , ..., drawn from the uniform distribution on [0, 1]. Let be the least number such that the sum of the first observations exceeds 1:

:formula_73

Then the expected value of is : .

=== Known digits ===
The number of known digits of has increased substantially since the introduction of the computer, due both to increasing performance of computers and to algorithmic improvements.

Since around 2010, the proliferation of modern high-speed desktop computers has made it feasible for amateurs to compute trillions of digits of within acceptable amounts of time. On Dec 5, 2020, a record-setting calculation was made, giving to 31,415,926,535,897 (approximately ) digits.

== Computing the digits ==
One way to compute the digits of is with the series
formula_74

A faster method involves two recursive functions formula_75 and formula_76. The functions are defined as formula_77

The expression formula_78 produces the th partial sum of the series above. This method uses binary splitting to compute with fewer single-digit arithmetic operations and thus reduced bit complexity. Combining this with fast Fourier transform-based methods of multiplying integers makes computing the digits very fast.

== In computer culture ==

During the emergence of internet culture, individuals and organizations sometimes paid homage to the number .

In an early example, the computer scientist Donald Knuth let the version numbers of his program Metafont approach . The versions are 2, 2.7, 2.71, 2.718, and so forth.

In another instance, the IPO filing for Google in 2004, rather than a typical round-number amount of money, the company announced its intention to raise 2,718,281,828 USD, which is billion dollars rounded to the nearest dollar.

Google was also responsible for a billboard
that appeared in the heart of Silicon Valley, and later in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Seattle, Washington; and Austin, Texas. It read &quot;{first 10-digit prime found in consecutive digits of }.com&quot;. The first 10-digit prime in is 7427466391, which starts at the 99th digit. Solving this problem and visiting the advertised (now defunct) website led to an even more difficult problem to solve, which consisted in finding the fifth term in the sequence 7182818284, 8182845904, 8747135266, 7427466391. It turned out that the sequence consisted of 10-digit numbers found in consecutive digits of whose digits summed to 49. The fifth term in the sequence is 5966290435, which starts at the 127th digit.
Solving this second problem finally led to a Google Labs webpage where the visitor was invited to submit a résumé.

The last release of the official Python 2 interpreter has version number 2.7.18, a reference to &quot;e&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the Euler–Maclaurin formula is a formula for the difference between an integral and a closely related sum. It can be used to approximate integrals by finite sums, or conversely to evaluate finite sums and infinite series using integrals and the machinery of calculus. For example, many asymptotic expansions are derived from the formula, and Faulhaber&#x27;s formula for the sum of powers is an immediate consequence.

The formula was discovered independently by Leonhard Euler and Colin Maclaurin around 1735. Euler needed it to compute slowly converging infinite series while Maclaurin used it to calculate integrals. It was later generalized to Darboux&#x27;s formula.

==The formula==
If and are natural numbers and is a real or complex valued continuous function for real numbers in the interval , then the integral
formula_1
can be approximated by the sum (or vice versa)
formula_2
(see rectangle method). The Euler–Maclaurin formula provides expressions for the difference between the sum and the integral in terms of the higher derivatives evaluated at the endpoints of the interval, that is to say and .

Explicitly, for a positive integer and a function that is times continuously differentiable on the interval , we have
formula_3
where is the th Bernoulli number (with ) and is an error term which depends on , , , and and is usually small for suitable values of .

The formula is often written with the subscript taking only even values, since the odd Bernoulli numbers are zero except for . In this case we have
formula_4
or alternatively
formula_5

===The remainder term===
The remainder term arises because the integral is usually not exactly equal to the sum. The formula may be derived by applying repeated integration by parts to successive intervals for . The boundary terms in these integrations lead to the main terms of the formula, and the leftover integrals form the remainder term.

The remainder term has an exact expression in terms of the periodized Bernoulli functions . The Bernoulli polynomials may be defined recursively by and, for ,
formula_6
The periodized Bernoulli functions are defined as
formula_7
where denotes the largest integer less than or equal to , so that always lies in the interval .

With this notation, the remainder term equals
formula_8

When , it can be shown that for ,
formula_9
where denotes the Riemann zeta function; one approach to prove this inequality is to obtain the Fourier series for the polynomials . The bound is achieved for even when is zero. The term may be omitted for odd but the proof in this case is more complex (see Lehmer). Using this inequality, the size of the remainder term can be estimated as
formula_10

===Low-order cases===

The Bernoulli numbers from to are . Therefore, the low-order cases of the Euler–Maclaurin formula are:
formula_11

==Applications==

===The Basel problem===
The Basel problem is to determine the sum
formula_12

Euler computed this sum to 20 decimal places with only a few terms of the Euler–Maclaurin formula in 1735. This probably convinced him that the sum equals , which he proved in the same year.

===Sums involving a polynomial===

If is a polynomial and is big enough, then the remainder term vanishes. For instance, if , we can choose to obtain, after simplification,
formula_13

===Approximation of integrals===
The formula provides a means of approximating a finite integral. Let be the endpoints of the interval of integration. Fix , the number of points to use in the approximation, and denote the corresponding step size by . Set , so that and . Then:
formula_14

This may be viewed as an extension of the trapezoid rule by the inclusion of correction terms. Note that this asymptotic expansion is usually not convergent; there is some , depending upon and , such that the terms past order increase rapidly. Thus, the remainder term generally demands close attention.

The Euler–Maclaurin formula is also used for detailed error analysis in numerical quadrature. It explains the superior performance of the trapezoidal rule on smooth periodic functions and is used in certain extrapolation methods. Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature is essentially a change of variables to cast an arbitrary integral in terms of integrals of periodic functions where the Euler–Maclaurin approach is very accurate (in that particular case the Euler–Maclaurin formula takes the form of a discrete cosine transform). This technique is known as a periodizing transformation.

===Asymptotic expansion of sums===
In the context of computing asymptotic expansions of sums and series, usually the most useful form of the Euler–Maclaurin formula is
formula_15

where and are integers. Often the expansion remains valid even after taking the limits or or both. In many cases the integral on the right-hand side can be evaluated in closed form in terms of elementary functions even though the sum on the left-hand side cannot. Then all the terms in the asymptotic series can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. For example,
formula_16

Here the left-hand side is equal to , namely the first-order polygamma function defined by
:formula_17
the gamma function is equal to when is a positive integer. This results in an asymptotic expansion for . That expansion, in turn, serves as the starting point for one of the derivations of precise error estimates for Stirling&#x27;s approximation of the factorial function.

====Examples====
If is an integer greater than 1 we have:
formula_18

Collecting the constants into a value of the Riemann zeta function, we can write an asymptotic expansion:
formula_19

For equal to 2 this simplifies to
formula_20
or
formula_21

When , the corresponding technique gives an asymptotic expansion for the harmonic numbers:
formula_22
where is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

== Proofs ==

=== Derivation by mathematical induction ===
We outline the argument given in Apostol.

The Bernoulli polynomials and the periodic Bernoulli functions for were introduced above.

The first several Bernoulli polynomials are
formula_23

The values are the Bernoulli numbers . Notice that for we have
formula_24
and for ,
formula_25

The functions agree with the Bernoulli polynomials on the interval and are periodic with period 1. Furthermore, except when , they are also continuous. Thus,
formula_26

Let be an integer, and consider the integral
formula_27
where
formula_28

Integrating by parts, we get
formula_29

Using , , and summing the above from to , we get
formula_30

Adding to both sides and rearranging, we have
formula_31

This is the case of the summation formula. To continue the induction, we apply integration by parts to the error term:
formula_32
where
formula_33

The result of integrating by parts is
formula_34

Summing from to and substituting this for the lower order error term results in the case of the formula,
formula_35

This process can be iterated. In this way we get a proof of the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula which can be formalized by mathematical induction, in which the induction step relies on integration by parts and on identities for periodic Bernoulli functions.

<doc id="9638" wikidata="Q990068" url="?curid=9638" title="Epimenides paradox">
<text>The Epimenides paradox reveals a problem with self-reference in logic. It is named after the Cretan philosopher Epimenides of Knossos (alive circa 600 BC) who is credited with the original statement. A typical description of the problem is given in the book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;, by Douglas Hofstadter:

A paradox of self-reference arises when one considers whether it is possible for Epimenides to have spoken the truth.

==Mythology of lying Cretans==
According to Ptolemaeus Chennus, Thetis and Medea had once argued in Thessaly over which was the most beautiful; they appointed the Cretan Idomeneus as the judge, who gave the victory to Thetis. In her anger, Medea called all Cretans liars, and cursed them to never say the truth.

== Logical paradox ==

Thomas Fowler (1869) states the paradox as follows: &quot;Epimenides the Cretan says, &#x27;that all the Cretans are liars,&#x27; but Epimenides is himself a Cretan; therefore he is himself a liar. But if he is a liar, what he says is untrue, and consequently, the Cretans are veracious; but Epimenides is a Cretan, and therefore what he says is true; saying the Cretans are liars, Epimenides is himself a liar, and what he says is untrue. Thus we may go on alternately proving that Epimenides and the Cretans are truthful and untruthful.&quot;

If we assume the statement is false and that Epimenides is lying about all Cretans being liars, then there must exist at least one Cretan who is honest. This does not lead to a contradiction since it is not required that this Cretan be Epimenides. This means that Epimenides can say the false statement that all Cretans are liars while knowing at least one honest Cretan and lying about this particular Cretan. Hence, from the assumption that the statement is false, it does not follow that the statement is true. So we can avoid a paradox as seeing the statement &quot;all Cretans are liars&quot; as a false statement, which is made by a lying Cretan, Epimenides. The mistake made by Thomas Fowler (and many other people) above is to think that the negation of &quot;all Cretans are liars&quot; is &quot;all Cretans are honest&quot; (a paradox) when in fact the negation is &quot;there exists a Cretan who is honest&quot;, or &quot;not all Cretans are liars&quot;. The Epimenides paradox can be slightly modified as to not allow the kind of solution described above, as it was in the first paradox of Eubulides but instead leading to a non-avoidable self-contradiction. Paradoxical versions of the Epimenides problem are closely related to a class of more difficult logical problems, including the liar paradox, Socratic paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox, all of which have self-reference in common with Epimenides. The Epimenides paradox is usually classified as a variation on the liar paradox, and sometimes the two are not distinguished. The study of self-reference led to important developments in logic and mathematics in the twentieth century.

In other words, it is not a paradox once one realizes &quot;All Cretans are liars&quot; being untrue only means &quot;Not all Cretans are liars&quot; instead of the assumption that &quot;All Cretans are honest&quot;.

Perhaps better put, for &quot;All Cretans are liars&quot; to be a true statement, it does not mean that all Cretans must lie all the time. In fact, Cretans could tell the truth quite often, but still all be liars in the sense that liars are people prone to deception for dishonest gain. Considering that &quot;All Cretans are liars&quot; has been seen as a paradox only since the 19th century, this seems to resolve the alleged paradox. If &#x27;all Cretans are continuous liars&#x27; is actually true, then asking a Cretan if they are honest would always elicit the dishonest answer &#x27;yes&#x27;. So arguably the original proposition is not so much paradoxical as invalid.

A contextual reading of the contradiction may also provide an answer to the paradox. The original phrase, &quot;The Cretans, always liars, evil beasts, idle bellies!&quot; asserts not an intrinsic paradox, but rather an opinion of the Cretans from Epimenides. A stereotyping of his people not intended to be an absolute statement about the people as a whole. Rather it is a claim made about their position regarding their religious beliefs and socio-cultural attitudes. Within the context of his poem the phrase is specific to a certain belief, a context that Callimachus repeats in his poem regarding Zeus. Further, a more poignant answer to the paradox is simply that to be a &quot;liar&quot; is to state falsehoods, nothing in the statement asserts everything said is false, but rather they&#x27;re &quot;always&quot; lying. This is not an absolute statement of fact and thus we cannot conclude there&#x27;s a true contradiction made by Epimenides with this statement.

== Origin of the phrase ==
Epimenides was a 6th-century BC philosopher and religious prophet who, against the general sentiment of Crete, proposed that Zeus was immortal, as in the following poem:
Denying the immortality of Zeus, then, was the lie of the Cretans.

The phrase &quot;Cretans, always liars&quot; was quoted by the poet Callimachus in his &quot;Hymn to Zeus&quot;, with the same theological intent as Epimenides:

==Emergence as a logical contradiction==
The logical inconsistency of a Cretan asserting all Cretans are always liars may not have occurred to Epimenides, nor to Callimachus, who both used the phrase to emphasize their point, without irony, perhaps meaning that all Cretans lie routinely, but not exclusively.

In the 1st century AD, the quote is mentioned by the author of the Epistle to Titus as having been spoken truly by &quot;one of their own prophets.&quot;

Clement of Alexandria, in the late 2nd century AD, fails to indicate that the concept of logical paradox is an issue:

During the early 4th century, Saint Augustine restates the closely related liar paradox in &quot;Against the Academicians&quot; (III.13.29), but without mentioning Epimenides.

In the Middle Ages, many forms of the liar paradox were studied under the heading of insolubilia, but these were not explicitly associated with Epimenides.

Finally, in 1740, the second volume of Pierre Bayle&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire Historique et Critique&quot; explicitly connects Epimenides with the paradox, though Bayle labels the paradox a &quot;sophisme&quot;.

== References by other authors==
All of the works of Epimenides are now lost, and known only through quotations by other authors. The quotation from the &quot;Cretica&quot; of Epimenides is given by R.N. Longenecker, &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;, in volume 9 of &quot;The Expositor&#x27;s Bible Commentary&quot;, Frank E. Gaebelein, editor (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Corporation, 1976–1984), page 476. Longenecker in turn cites M.D. Gibson, &quot;Horae Semiticae X&quot; (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1913), page 40, &quot;in Syriac&quot;. Longenecker states the following in a footnote:

An oblique reference to Epimenides in the context of logic appears in &quot;The Logical Calculus&quot; by W. E. Johnson, &quot;Mind&quot; (New Series), volume 1, number 2 (April, 1892), pages 235–250. Johnson writes in a footnote,

The Epimenides paradox appears explicitly in &quot;Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types&quot;, by Bertrand Russell, in the &quot;American Journal of Mathematics&quot;, volume 30, number 3 (July, 1908), pages 222–262, which opens with the following:

In that article, Russell uses the Epimenides paradox as the point of departure for discussions of other problems, including the Burali-Forti paradox and the paradox now called Russell&#x27;s paradox. Since Russell, the Epimenides paradox has been referenced repeatedly in logic. Typical of these references is &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; by Douglas Hofstadter, which accords the paradox a prominent place in a discussion of self-reference.

It is also believed that the &quot;Cretan tales&quot; told by Odysseus in &quot;The Odyssey&quot; by Homer are a reference to this paradox.

In &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (1949) Simone de Beauvoir writes &quot;I think certain women are still best suited to elucidate the situation of women. It is a sophism to claim that Epimenides should be enclosed within the concept of Cretan and all Cretans within the concept of liar: it is not a mysterious essence that dictates good or bad faith to men and women&quot;.

<text>An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one or more forms of energy into mechanical energy.

Available energy sources include potential energy (e.g. energy of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field as exploited in hydroelectric power generation), heat energy (e.g. geothermal), chemical energy, electric potential and nuclear energy (from nuclear fission or nuclear fusion). Many of these processes generate heat as an intermediate energy form; thus heat engines have special importance. Some natural processes, such as atmospheric convection cells convert environmental heat into motion (e.g. in the form of rising air currents). Mechanical energy is of particular importance in transportation, but also plays a role in many industrial processes such as cutting, grinding, crushing, and mixing.

Mechanical heat engines convert heat into work via various thermodynamic processes. The internal combustion engine is perhaps the most common example of a mechanical heat engine in which heat from the combustion of a fuel causes rapid pressurisation of the gaseous combustion products in the combustion chamber, causing them to expand and drive a piston, which turns a crankshaft. Unlike internal combustion engines, a reaction engine (such as a jet engine) produces thrust by expelling reaction mass, in accordance with Newton&#x27;s third law of motion.

Apart from heat engines, electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, pneumatic motors use compressed air, and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and ultimately motion (a chemical engine, but not a heat engine).

Chemical heat engines which employ air (ambient atmospheric gas) as a part of the fuel reaction are regarded as airbreathing engines. Chemical heat engines designed to operate outside of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (e.g. rockets, deeply submerged submarines) need to carry an additional fuel component called the oxidizer (although there exist super-oxidizers suitable for use in rockets, such as fluorine, a more powerful oxidant than oxygen itself); or the application needs to obtain heat by non-chemical means, such as by means of nuclear reactions.

==Emission/Byproducts==
All chemically fueled heat engines emit exhaust gases. The cleanest engines emit water only. Strict zero-emissions generally means zero emissions other than water and water vapour. Only heat engines which combust pure hydrogen (fuel) and pure oxygen (oxidizer) achieve zero-emission by a strict definition (in practice, one type of rocket engine). If hydrogen is burnt in combination with air (all airbreathing engines), a side reaction occurs between atmospheric oxygen and atmospheric nitrogen resulting in small emissions of . If a hydrocarbon (such as alcohol or gasoline) is burnt as fuel, , a greenhouse gas, is emitted. Hydrogen and oxygen from air can be reacted into water by a fuel cell without side production of , but this is an electrochemical engine not a heat engine.

== Terminology ==
The word &quot;engine&quot; derives from Old French , from the Latin –the root of the word . Pre-industrial weapons of war, such as catapults, trebuchets and battering rams, were called &quot;siege engines&quot;, and knowledge of how to construct them was often treated as a military secret. The word &quot;gin&quot;, as in &quot;cotton gin&quot;, is short for &quot;engine&quot;. Most mechanical devices invented during the Industrial Revolution were described as engines—the steam engine being a notable example. However, the original steam engines, such as those by Thomas Savery, were not mechanical engines but pumps. In this manner, a fire engine in its original form was merely a water pump, with the engine being transported to the fire by horses.

In modern usage, the term &quot;engine&quot; typically describes devices, like steam engines and internal combustion engines, that burn or otherwise consume fuel to perform mechanical work by exerting a torque or linear force (usually in the form of thrust). Devices converting heat energy into motion are commonly referred to simply as &quot;engines&quot;. Examples of engines which exert a torque include the familiar automobile gasoline and diesel engines, as well as turboshafts. Examples of engines which produce thrust include turbofans and rockets.

When the internal combustion engine was invented, the term &quot;motor&quot; was initially used to distinguish it from the steam engine—which was in wide use at the time, powering locomotives and other vehicles such as steam rollers. The term &quot;&quot; derives from the Latin verb which means &#x27;to set in motion&#x27;, or &#x27;maintain motion&#x27;. Thus a motor is a device that imparts motion.

&quot;Motor&quot; and &quot;engine&quot; are interchangeable in standard English. In some engineering jargons, the two words have different meanings, in which &quot;&quot; is a device that burns or otherwise consumes fuel, changing its chemical composition, and a motor is a device driven by electricity, air, or hydraulic pressure, which does not change the chemical composition of its energy source. However, rocketry uses the term rocket motor, even though they consume fuel.

A heat engine may also serve as a &quot;&quot;—a component that transforms the flow or changes in pressure of a fluid into mechanical energy. An automobile powered by an internal combustion engine may make use of various motors and pumps, but ultimately all such devices derive their power from the engine. Another way of looking at it is that a motor receives power from an external source, and then converts it into mechanical energy, while an engine creates power from pressure (derived directly from the explosive force of combustion or other chemical reaction, or secondarily from the action of some such force on other substances such as air, water, or steam).

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===
Simple machines, such as the club and oar (examples of the lever), are prehistoric. More complex engines using human power, animal power, water power, wind power and even steam power date back to antiquity. Human power was focused by the use of simple engines, such as the capstan, windlass or treadmill, and with ropes, pulleys, and block and tackle arrangements; this power was transmitted usually with the forces multiplied and the speed reduced. These were used in cranes and aboard ships in Ancient Greece, as well as in mines, water pumps and siege engines in Ancient Rome. The writers of those times, including Vitruvius, Frontinus and Pliny the Elder, treat these engines as commonplace, so their invention may be more ancient. By the 1st century AD, cattle and horses were used in mills, driving machines similar to those powered by humans in earlier times.

According to Strabo, a water-powered mill was built in Kaberia of the kingdom of Mithridates during the 1st century BC. Use of water wheels in mills spread throughout the Roman Empire over the next few centuries. Some were quite complex, with aqueducts, dams, and sluices to maintain and channel the water, along with systems of gears, or toothed-wheels made of wood and metal to regulate the speed of rotation. More sophisticated small devices, such as the Antikythera Mechanism used complex trains of gears and dials to act as calendars or predict astronomical events. In a poem by Ausonius in the 4th century AD, he mentions a stone-cutting saw powered by water. Hero of Alexandria is credited with many such wind and steam powered machines in the 1st century AD, including the Aeolipile and the vending machine, often these machines were associated with worship, such as animated altars and automated temple doors.

=== Medieval ===
Medieval Muslim engineers employed gears in mills and water-raising machines, and used dams as a source of water power to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. In the medieval Islamic world, such advances made it possible to mechanize many industrial tasks previously carried out by manual labour.

In 1206, al-Jazari employed a crank-conrod system for two of his water-raising machines. A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi al-Din in 1551 and by Giovanni Branca in 1629.

In the 13th century, the solid rocket motor was invented in China. Driven by gunpowder, this simplest form of internal combustion engine was unable to deliver sustained power, but was useful for propelling weaponry at high speeds towards enemies in battle and for fireworks. After invention, this innovation spread throughout Europe.

=== Industrial Revolution ===

The Watt steam engine was the first type of steam engine to make use of steam at a pressure just above atmospheric to drive the piston helped by a partial vacuum. Improving on the design of the 1712 Newcomen steam engine, the Watt steam engine, developed sporadically from 1763 to 1775, was a great step in the development of the steam engine. Offering a dramatic increase in fuel efficiency, James Watt&#x27;s design became synonymous with steam engines, due in no small part to his business partner, Matthew Boulton. It enabled rapid development of efficient semi-automated factories on a previously unimaginable scale in places where waterpower was not available. Later development led to steam locomotives and great expansion of railway transportation.

As for internal combustion piston engines, these were tested in France in 1807 by de Rivaz and independently, by the Niépce brothers. They were theoretically advanced by Carnot in 1824. In 1853–57 Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci invented and patented an engine using the free-piston principle that was possibly the first 4-cycle engine.

The invention of an internal combustion engine which was later commercially successful was made during 1860 by Etienne Lenoir.

In 1877, the Otto cycle was capable of giving a far higher power-to-weight ratio than steam engines and worked much better for many transportation applications such as cars and aircraft.

=== Automobiles ===
The first commercially successful automobile, created by Karl Benz, added to the interest in light and powerful engines. The lightweight gasoline internal combustion engine, operating on a four-stroke Otto cycle, has been the most successful for light automobiles, while the thermally more-efficient Diesel engine is used for trucks and buses. However, in recent years, turbocharged Diesel engines have become increasingly popular in automobiles, especially outside of the United States, even for quite small cars.

==== Horizontally-opposed pistons ====
In 1896, Karl Benz was granted a patent for his design of the first engine with horizontally opposed pistons. His design created an engine in which the corresponding pistons move in horizontal cylinders and reach top dead center simultaneously, thus automatically balancing each other with respect to their individual momentum. Engines of this design are often referred to as “flat” or “boxer” engines due to their shape and low profile. They were used in the Volkswagen Beetle, the Citroën 2CV, some Porsche and Subaru cars, many BMW and Honda motorcycles. Opposed four- and six-cylinder engines continue to be used as a power source in small, propeller-driven aircraft.

==== Advancement ====
The continued use of internal combustion engines in automobiles is partly due to the improvement of engine control systems, such as on-board computers providing engine management processes, and electronically controlled fuel injection. Forced air induction by turbocharging and supercharging have increased the power output of smaller displacement engines that are lighter in weight and more fuel-efficient at normal cruise power.. Similar changes have been applied to smaller Diesel engines, giving them almost the same performance characteristics as gasoline engines. This is especially evident with the popularity of smaller diesel engine-propelled cars in Europe. Diesel engines produce lower hydrocarbon and emissions, but greater particulate and pollution, than gasoline engines. Diesel engines are also 40% more fuel efficient than comparable gasoline engines.

==== Increasing power ====
In the first half of the 20th century, a trend of increasing engine power occurred, particularly in the U.S. models. Design changes incorporated all known methods of increasing engine capacity, including increasing the pressure in the cylinders to improve efficiency, increasing the size of the engine, and increasing the rate at which the engine produces work. The higher forces and pressures created by these changes created engine vibration and size problems that led to stiffer, more compact engines with V and opposed cylinder layouts replacing longer straight-line arrangements.

==== Combustion efficiency ====
Optimal combustion efficiency in passenger vehicles is reached with a coolant temperature of around .

==== Engine configuration ====
Earlier automobile engine development produced a much larger range of engines than is in common use today. Engines have ranged from 1- to 16-cylinder designs with corresponding differences in overall size, weight, engine displacement, and cylinder bores. Four cylinders and power ratings from 19 to 120 hp (14 to 90 kW) were followed in a majority of the models. Several three-cylinder, two-stroke-cycle models were built while most engines had straight or in-line cylinders. There were several V-type models and horizontally opposed two- and four-cylinder makes too. Overhead camshafts were frequently employed. The smaller engines were commonly air-cooled and located at the rear of the vehicle; compression ratios were relatively low. The 1970s and 1980s saw an increased interest in improved fuel economy, which caused a return to smaller V-6 and four-cylinder layouts, with as many as five valves per cylinder to improve efficiency. The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 operates with a W16 engine, meaning that two V8 cylinder layouts are positioned next to each other to create the W shape sharing the same crankshaft.

The largest internal combustion engine ever built is the Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C, a 14-cylinder, 2-stroke turbocharged diesel engine that was designed to power the &quot;Emma Mærsk&quot;, the largest container ship in the world when launched in 2006. This engine has a mass of 2,300 tonnes, and when running at 102 rpm (1.7 Hz) produces over 80 MW, and can use up to 250 tonnes of fuel per day.

== Types ==
An engine can be put into a category according to two criteria: the form of energy it accepts in order to create motion, and the type of motion it outputs.

=== Heat engine ===
==== Combustion engine ====
Combustion engines are heat engines driven by the heat of a combustion process.

==== Internal combustion engine ====

The &quot;internal combustion engine&quot; is an engine in which the combustion of a fuel (generally, fossil fuel) occurs with an oxidizer (usually air) in a combustion chamber. In an internal combustion engine the expansion of the high temperature and high pressure gases, which are produced by the combustion, directly applies force to components of the engine, such as the pistons or turbine blades or a nozzle, and by moving it over a distance, generates mechanical work.

==== External combustion engine ====

An &quot;external combustion engine&quot; (EC engine) is a heat engine where an internal working fluid is heated by combustion of an external source, through the engine wall or a heat exchanger. The fluid then, by expanding and acting on the mechanism of the engine produces motion and usable work. The fluid is then cooled, compressed and reused (closed cycle), or (less commonly) dumped, and cool fluid pulled in (open cycle air engine).

&quot;Combustion&quot; refers to burning fuel with an oxidizer, to supply the heat. Engines of similar (or even identical) configuration and operation may use a supply of heat from other sources such as nuclear, solar, geothermal or exothermic reactions not involving combustion; but are not then strictly classed as external combustion engines, but as external thermal engines.

The working fluid can be a gas as in a Stirling engine, or steam as in a steam engine or an organic liquid such as n-pentane in an Organic Rankine cycle. The fluid can be of any composition; gas is by far the most common, although even single-phase liquid is sometimes used. In the case of the steam engine, the fluid changes phases between liquid and gas.

==== Air-breathing combustion engines ====

&quot;Air-breathing combustion engines&quot; are combustion engines that use the oxygen in atmospheric air to oxidise (&#x27;burn&#x27;) the fuel, rather than carrying an oxidiser, as in a rocket. Theoretically, this should result in a better specific impulse than for rocket engines.

A continuous stream of air flows through the air-breathing engine. This air is compressed, mixed with fuel, ignited and expelled as the exhaust gas. In reaction engines, the majority of the combustion energy (heat) exits the engine as exhaust gas, which provides thrust directly.

;Examples
Typical air-breathing engines include:
* Reciprocating engine
* Steam engine
* Gas turbine
* Airbreathing jet engine
* Turbo-propeller engine
* Pulse detonation engine
* Pulse jet
* Ramjet
* Scramjet
* Liquid air cycle engine/Reaction Engines SABRE.

==== Environmental effects ====
The operation of engines typically has a negative impact upon air quality and ambient sound levels. There has been a growing emphasis on the pollution producing features of automotive power systems. This has created new interest in alternate power sources and internal-combustion engine refinements. Though a few limited-production battery-powered electric vehicles have appeared, they have not proved competitive owing to costs and operating characteristics. In the 21st century the diesel engine has been increasing in popularity with automobile owners. However, the gasoline engine and the Diesel engine, with their new emission-control devices to improve emission performance, have not yet been significantly challenged. A number of manufacturers have introduced hybrid engines, mainly involving a small gasoline engine coupled with an electric motor and with a large battery bank, these are starting to become a popular option because of their environment awareness.

==== Air quality ====
Exhaust gas from a spark ignition engine consists of the following: nitrogen 70 to 75% (by volume), water vapor 10 to 12%, carbon dioxide 10 to 13.5%, hydrogen 0.5 to 2%, oxygen 0.2 to 2%, carbon monoxide: 0.1 to 6%, unburnt hydrocarbons and partial oxidation products (e.g. aldehydes) 0.5 to 1%, nitrogen monoxide 0.01 to 0.4%, nitrous oxide &lt;100 ppm, sulfur dioxide 15 to 60 ppm, traces of other compounds such as fuel additives and lubricants, also halogen and metallic compounds, and other particles. Carbon monoxide is highly toxic, and can cause carbon monoxide poisoning, so it is important to avoid any build-up of the gas in a confined space. Catalytic converters can reduce toxic emissions, but not eliminate them. Also, resulting greenhouse gas emissions, chiefly carbon dioxide, from the widespread use of engines in the modern industrialized world is contributing to the global greenhouse effect – a primary concern regarding global warming.

==== Non-combusting heat engines ====

Some engines convert heat from noncombustive processes into mechanical work, for example a nuclear power plant uses the heat from the nuclear reaction to produce steam and drive a steam engine, or a gas turbine in a rocket engine may be driven by decomposing hydrogen peroxide. Apart from the different energy source, the engine is often engineered much the same as an internal or external combustion engine.

Another group of noncombustive engines includes thermoacoustic heat engines (sometimes called &quot;TA engines&quot;) which are thermoacoustic devices that use high-amplitude sound waves to pump heat from one place to another, or conversely use a heat difference to induce high-amplitude sound waves. In general, thermoacoustic engines can be divided into standing wave and travelling wave devices.

Stirling engines can be another form of non-combustive heat engine. They use the Stirling thermodynamic cycle to convert heat into work. An example is the alpha type Stirling engine, whereby gas flows, via a recuperator, between a hot cylinder and a cold cylinder, which are attached to reciprocating pistons 90° out of phase. The gas receives heat at the hot cylinder and expands, driving the piston that turns the crankshaft. After expanding and flowing through the recuperator, the gas rejects heat at the cold cylinder and the ensuing pressure drop leads to its compression by the other (displacement) piston, which forces it back to the hot cylinder.

=== Non-thermal chemically powered motor ===
Non-thermal motors usually are powered by a chemical reaction, but are not heat engines. Examples include:
* Molecular motor – motors found in living things
* Synthetic molecular motor.

=== Electric motor ===

An &quot;electric motor&quot; uses electrical energy to produce mechanical energy, usually through the interaction of magnetic fields and current-carrying conductors. The reverse process, producing electrical energy from mechanical energy, is accomplished by a generator or dynamo. Traction motors used on vehicles often perform both tasks. Electric motors can be run as generators and vice versa, although this is not always practical.
Electric motors are ubiquitous, being found in applications as diverse as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives. They may be powered by direct current (for example a battery powered portable device or motor vehicle), or by alternating current from a central electrical distribution grid. The smallest motors may be found in electric wristwatches. Medium-size motors of highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial uses. The very largest electric motors are used for propulsion of large ships, and for such purposes as pipeline compressors, with ratings in the thousands of kilowatts. Electric motors may be classified by the source of electric power, by their internal construction, and by their application.

The physical principle of production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field was known as early as 1821. Electric motors of increasing efficiency were constructed throughout the 19th century, but commercial exploitation of electric motors on a large scale required efficient electrical generators and electrical distribution networks.

To reduce the electric energy consumption from motors and their associated carbon footprints, various regulatory authorities in many countries have introduced and implemented legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher efficiency electric motors. A well-designed motor can convert over 90% of its input energy into useful power for decades. When the efficiency of a motor is raised by even a few percentage points, the savings, in kilowatt hours (and therefore in cost), are enormous. The electrical energy efficiency of a typical industrial induction motor can be improved by: 1) reducing the electrical losses in the stator windings (e.g., by increasing the cross-sectional area of the conductor, improving the winding technique, and using materials with higher electrical conductivities, such as copper), 2) reducing the electrical losses in the rotor coil or casting (e.g., by using materials with higher electrical conductivities, such as copper), 3) reducing magnetic losses by using better quality magnetic steel, 4) improving the aerodynamics of motors to reduce mechanical windage losses, 5) improving bearings to reduce friction losses, and 6) minimizing manufacturing tolerances. &quot;For further discussion on this subject, see Premium efficiency).&quot;

By convention, &quot;electric engine&quot; refers to a railroad electric locomotive, rather than an electric motor.

=== Physically powered motor ===
Some motors are powered by potential or kinetic energy, for example some funiculars, gravity plane and ropeway conveyors have used the energy from moving water or rocks, and some clocks have a weight that falls under gravity. Other forms of potential energy include compressed gases (such as pneumatic motors), springs (clockwork motors) and elastic bands.

Historic military siege engines included large catapults, trebuchets, and (to some extent) battering rams were powered by potential energy.

==== Pneumatic motor ====

A &quot;pneumatic motor&quot; is a machine that converts potential energy in the form of compressed air into mechanical work. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion. Linear motion can come from either a diaphragm or a piston actuator, while rotary motion is supplied by either a vane type air motor or piston air motor. Pneumatic motors have found widespread success in the hand-held tool industry and continual attempts are being made to expand their use to the transportation industry. However, pneumatic motors must overcome efficiency deficiencies before being seen as a viable option in the transportation industry.

==== Hydraulic motor ====

A &quot;hydraulic motor&quot; derives its power from a pressurized liquid. This type of engine is used to move heavy loads and drive machinery.

====Hybrid====
Some motor units can have multiple sources of energy. For example, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle&#x27;s electric motor could source electricity from either a battery or from fossil fuels inputs via an internal combustion engine and a generator.

== Performance ==
The following are used in the assessment of the performance of an engine.

=== Speed ===
Speed refers to crankshaft rotation in piston engines and the speed of compressor/turbine rotors and electric motor rotors. It is typically measured in revolutions per minute (rpm).

=== Thrust ===
Thrust is the force exerted on an airplane as a consequence of its propeller or jet engine accelerating the air passing through it. It is also the force exerted on a ship as a consequence of its propeller accelerating the water passing through it.

=== Torque ===
Torque is a turning moment on a shaft and is calculated by multiplying the force causing the moment by its distance from the shaft.

=== Power ===
Power is the measure of how fast work is done.

=== Efficiency ===

Efficiency is a proportion of useful energy output compared to total input.

=== Sound levels ===
Vehicle noise is predominantly from the engine at low vehicle speeds and from tires and the air flowing past the vehicle at higher speeds. Electric motors are quieter than internal combustion engines. Thrust-producing engines, such as turbofans, turbojets and rockets emit the greatest amount of noise due to the way their thrust-producing, high-velocity exhaust streams interact with the surrounding stationary air.
Noise reduction technology includes intake and exhaust system mufflers (silencers) on gasoline and diesel engines and noise attenuation liners in turbofan inlets.

<doc id="9643" wikidata="Q825026" url="?curid=9643" title="Economic and monetary union">
<text>An economic and monetary union (EMU) is a type of trade bloc that features a combination of a common market, customs union, and monetary union. Established via a trade pact, an EMU constitutes the sixth of seven stages in the process of economic integration. An EMU agreement usually combines a customs union with a common market. A typical EMU establishes free trade and a common external tariff throughout its jurisdiction. It is also designed to protect freedom in the movement of goods, services, and people. This arrangement is distinct from a monetary union (e.g., the Latin Monetary Union), which does not usually involve a common market. As with the economic and monetary union established among the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), an EMU may affect different parts of its jurisdiction in different ways. Some areas are subject to separate customs regulations from other areas subject to the EMU. These various arrangements may be established in a formal agreement, or they may exist on a &quot;de facto&quot; basis. For example, not all EU member states use the Euro established by its currency union, and not all EU member states are part of the Schengen Area. Some EU members participate in both unions, and some in neither.

Territories of the United States, Australian External Territories and New Zealand territories each share a currency and, for the most part, the market of their respective mainland states. However, they are generally not part of the same customs territories.

== History ==
Several countries initially attempted to form an EMU at the Hague Summit in 1969. Afterward, a &quot;draft plan&quot; was announced. During this time, the main member presiding over this decision was Pierre Werner, Prime Minister of Luxembourg. The decision to form the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU) was accepted in which later became part of the Maastricht Treaty (the Treaty on European Union).

== Processes in the European EMU ==

The EMU involves four main activities.

The first responsibility is to be in charge of implementing effective monetary policy for the euro area with price stability. There is a group of economists whose only role is studying how to improve the monetary policy while maintaining price stability. They conduct research, and their results are presented to the leaders of the EMU. Thereafter, the role of the leaders is to find a suitable way to implement the economists&#x27; work into their country&#x27;s policies. Maintaining price stability is a long-term goal for all states in the EU, due to the effects it might have on the Euro as a currency.

Secondly, the EMU must coordinate economic and fiscal policies in EU countries. They must find an equilibrium between the implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. They will advise countries to have greater coordination, even if that means having countries tightly coupled with looser monetary and tighter fiscal policy. Not coordinating the monetary market could result in risking an unpredictable situation. The EMU also deliberates on a mixed policy option, which has been shown to be beneficial in some empirical studies.

Thirdly, the EMU ensures that the single market runs smoothly. The member countries respect the decisions made by the EMU and ensure that their actions will be in favor of a stable market.

Finally, regulations of the EMU aid in supervising and monitoring financial institutions. There is an imperative need for all members of the EMU to act in unison. Therefore, the EMU has to have institutions supervising all the member states to protect the main aim of the EMU.

===Roles of national governments===
The economic roles of nations within the EMU are to:
* control fiscal policy that concerns government budgets
* control tax policies that determine how income is raised
* control structural policies that determine pension systems, labor, and capital-market regulations

== List of economic and monetary unions ==

* Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU) (1999/2002) with the Euro for the Eurozone members
* &quot;de facto&quot; the sovereign states in the OECS Eastern Caribbean Currency Union with the East Caribbean dollar in the CSME (2006)
* &quot;de facto&quot; Switzerland–Liechtenstein

===Proposed===
===Previous EMUs===

* Monetary union of the Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union (1922–2002), superseded by the European EMU.

<text>The European Environment Agency (EEA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) which provides independent information on the environment.

==Definition==
The European Environment Agency (EEA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) which provides independent information on the environment. 
Its goal is to help those involved in developing, implementing and evaluating environmental policy, and to inform the general public.

==Organization==
The EEA was established by the European Economic Community (EEC) Regulation 1210/1990 (amended by EEC Regulation 933/1999 and EC Regulation 401/2009) and became operational in 1994, headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The agency is governed by a management board composed of representatives of the governments of its 32 member states, a European Commission representative and two scientists appointed by the European Parliament, assisted by its Scientific Committee.

The current Executive Director of the agency is Leena Ylä-Mononen, who has been appointed for a five-year term, starting on 1 June 2023. Ms Ylä-Mononen is the successor of professor Hans Bruyninckx.

==Member countries==
The member states of the European Union are members; however other states may become members of it by means of agreements concluded between them and the EU.

It was the first EU body to open its membership to the 13 candidate countries (pre-2004 enlargement).

The EEA has 32 member countries and six cooperating countries. The members are the 27 European Union member states together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.

Since Brexit in 2020, the UK is not a member of the EU anymore and therefore not a member state of the EEA.

The six Western Balkan countries are cooperating countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia as well as Kosovo under the UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99. These cooperation activities are integrated into Eionet and are supported by the EU under the &quot;Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance&quot;.

The EEA is an active member of the EPA Network.


== Reports, data and knowledge ==
The European Environment Agency (EEA) produces assessments based on quality-assured data on a wide range of issues from biodiversity, air quality, transport to climate change. These assessments are closely linked to the European Union&#x27;s environment policies and legislation and help monitor progress in some areas and indicate areas where additional efforts are needed.

As required in its founding regulation, the EEA publishes its flagship report the State and Outlook of Europe&#x27;s environment (SOER), which is an integrated assessment, analysing trends, progress to targets as well as outlook for the mid- to long-term. The agency publishes annually a report on Europe&#x27;s most polluted provinces for air quality, detailing fine particulate matter PM 2.5.

The EEA shares this information, including the datasets used in its assessments, through its main website and a number of thematic information platforms such as Biodiversity Information System for Europe (BISE), Water Information System for Europe (WISE) and ClimateADAPT. The Climate-ADAPT knowledge platform presents information and data on expected climatic changes, the vulnerability of regions and sectors, adaptation case studies, and adaptation options, adaptation planning tools, and EU policy.

===European Nature Information System===
The European Nature Information System (EUNIS) provides access to the publicly available data in the EUNIS database for species, habitat types and protected sites across Europe. It is part of the European Biodiversity data centre (BDC), and is maintained by the EEA.

The database contains data
* on species, habitat types and designated sites from the framework of Natura 2000,
* from material compiled by the European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity
* mentioned in relevant international conventions and in the IUCN Red Lists,
* collected in the framework of the EEA&#x27;s reporting activities.

==European environment information and observation network==

The European Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet) is a collaboration network between EEA member countries and non-member, cooperating nations. Cooperation is facilitated through different national environmental agencies, ministries, or offices. Eionet encourages the sharing of data and highlights specific topics for discussion and cooperation among participating countries.

Eionet currently includes covers seven European Topic Centres (ETCs):
* ETC on Biodiversity and Ecosystems (ETC BE)
* ETC on Climate Change Adaptation and LULUCF (ETC CA)
* ETC on Climate Change Mitigation (ETC CM)
* ETC on Data Integration and Digitalisation (ETC DI)
* ETC on Human Health and the Environment (ETC HE)
* ETC on Circular Economy and Resource Use (ETC CE)
* ETC on Sustainability Transitions (ETC ST)

The European Environment Agency (EEA) implements the &quot;Shared Environmental Information System&quot; principles and best practices via projects such as the &quot;ENI SEIS II EAST PROJECT&quot; &amp; the &quot;ENI SEIS II SOUTH PROJECT&quot; to support environmental protection within the six eastern partnership countries (ENP) &amp; to contribute to the reduction in marine pollution in the Mediterranean through the shared availability and access to relevant environmental information.

==Budget management and discharge==
As for every EU body and institution, the EEA&#x27;s budget is subject to a discharge process, consisting of external examination of its budget execution and financial management, to ensure sound financial management of its budget. Since its establishment, the EEA has been granted discharge for its budget without exception. The EEA provides full access to its administrative and budgetary documents in its public documents register.

The discharge process for the 2010 budget required additional clarifications. In February 2012, the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Budgetary Control published a draft report, identifying areas of concern in the use of funds and its influence for the 2010 budget such as a 26% budget increase from 2009 to 2010 to €50 600 000. and questioned that maximum competition and value-for-money principles were honored in hiring, also possible fictitious employees.

The EEA&#x27;s Executive Director refuted allegations of irregularities in a public hearing. On 27 March 2012 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted on the report and commended the cooperation between the Agency and NGOs working in the environmental area. On 23 October 2012, the European Parliament voted and granted the discharge to the European Environment Agency for its 2010 budget.

==Executive directors==
==International cooperation==
In addition to its 32 members and six Balkan cooperating countries, the EEA also cooperates and fosters partnerships with its neighbours and other countries and regions, mostly in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy:

<doc id="9646" wikidata="Q334879" url="?curid=9646" title="Erlang (programming language)">
<text>Erlang ( ) is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional high-level programming language, and a garbage-collected runtime system. The term Erlang is used interchangeably with Erlang/OTP, or Open Telecom Platform (OTP), which consists of the Erlang runtime system, several ready-to-use components (OTP) mainly written in Erlang, and a set of design principles for Erlang programs.

The Erlang runtime system is designed for systems with these traits:

*Distributed
*Fault-tolerant
*Soft real-time
*Highly available, non-stop applications
*Hot swapping, where code can be changed without stopping a system.

The Erlang programming language has immutable data, pattern matching, and functional programming. The sequential subset of the Erlang language supports eager evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing.

A normal Erlang application is built out of hundreds of small Erlang processes.

It was originally proprietary software within Ericsson, developed by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, and Mike Williams in 1986, but was released as free and open-source software in 1998. Erlang/OTP is supported and maintained by the Open Telecom Platform (OTP) product unit at Ericsson.

==History==
The name &quot;Erlang&quot;, attributed to Bjarne Däcker, has been presumed by those working on the telephony switches (for whom the language was designed) to be a reference to Danish mathematician and engineer Agner Krarup Erlang and a syllabic abbreviation of &quot;Ericsson Language&quot;. Erlang was designed with the aim of improving the development of telephony applications. The initial version of Erlang was implemented in Prolog and was influenced by the programming language PLEX used in earlier Ericsson exchanges. By 1988 Erlang had proven that it was suitable for prototyping telephone exchanges, but the Prolog interpreter was far too slow. One group within Ericsson estimated that it would need to be 40 times faster to be suitable for production use. In 1992, work began on the BEAM virtual machine (VM), which compiles Erlang to C using a mix of natively compiled code and threaded code to strike a balance between performance and disk space. According to co-inventor Joe Armstrong, the language went from laboratory product to real applications following the collapse of the next-generation AXE telephone exchange named &quot;AXE-N&quot; in 1995. As a result, Erlang was chosen for the next Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) exchange &quot;AXD&quot;.
In February 1998, Ericsson Radio Systems banned the in-house use of Erlang for new products, citing a preference for non-proprietary languages. The ban caused Armstrong and others to make plans to leave Ericsson. In March 1998 Ericsson announced the AXD301 switch, containing over a million lines of Erlang and reported to achieve a high availability of nine &quot;9&quot;s. In December 1998, the implementation of Erlang was open-sourced and most of the Erlang team resigned to form a new company, Bluetail AB. Ericsson eventually relaxed the ban and re-hired Armstrong in 2004.

In 2006, native symmetric multiprocessing support was added to the runtime system and VM.

===Processes===
Erlang applications are built of very lightweight Erlang processes in the Erlang runtime system. Erlang processes can be seen as &quot;living&quot; objects (object-oriented programming), with data encapsulation and message passing, but capable of changing behavior during runtime. The Erlang runtime system provides strict process isolation between Erlang processes (this includes data and garbage collection, separated individually by each Erlang process) and transparent communication between processes (see Location transparency) on different Erlang nodes (on different hosts).

Joe Armstrong, co-inventor of Erlang, summarized the principles of processes in his PhD thesis:

*Everything is a process.
*Processes are strongly isolated.
*Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.
*Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.
*Processes have unique names.
*If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.
*Processes share no resources.
*Error handling is non-local.
*Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.

Joe Armstrong remarked in an interview with Rackspace in 2013: &quot;If Java is &#x27;write once, run anywhere&#x27;, then Erlang is &#x27;write once, run forever&#x27;.&quot;

===Usage===
In 2014, Ericsson reported Erlang was being used in its support nodes, and in GPRS, 3G and LTE mobile networks worldwide and also by Nortel and Deutsche Telekom.

Erlang is used in RabbitMQ. As Tim Bray, director of Web Technologies at Sun Microsystems, expressed in his keynote at O&#x27;Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCON) in July 2008:
Erlang is the programming language used to code WhatsApp.

It is also the language of choice for Ejabberd – an XMPP messaging server.

Elixir is a programming language that compiles into BEAM byte code (via Erlang Abstract Format).

Since being released as open source, Erlang has been spreading beyond telecoms, establishing itself in other vertical markets such as FinTech, gaming, healthcare, automotive, Internet of Things and blockchain. Apart from WhatsApp, there are other companies listed as Erlang&#x27;s success stories, including Vocalink (a MasterCard company), Goldman Sachs, Nintendo, AdRoll, Grindr, BT Mobile, Samsung, OpenX, and SITA.

==Functional programming examples==

===Factorial===
A factorial algorithm implemented in Erlang:

-module(fact). % This is the file &#x27;fact.erl&#x27;, the module and the filename must match
-export([fac/1]). % This exports the function &#x27;fac&#x27; of arity 1 (1 parameter, no type, no name)

fac(0) -&gt; 1; % If 0, then return 1, otherwise (note the semicolon ; meaning &#x27;else&#x27;)
fac(N) when N &gt; 0, is_integer(N) -&gt; N * fac(N-1).
% Recursively determine, then return the result
% (note the period . meaning &#x27;endif&#x27; or &#x27;function end&#x27;)
%% This function will crash if anything other than a nonnegative integer is given.
%% It illustrates the &quot;Let it crash&quot; philosophy of Erlang.
===Fibonacci sequence===

A tail recursive algorithm that produces the Fibonacci sequence:
%% The module declaration must match the file name &quot;series.erl&quot; 
-module(series).

%% The export statement contains a list of all those functions that form
%% the module&#x27;s public API. In this case, this module exposes a single
%% function called fib that takes 1 argument (I.E. has an arity of 1)
%% The general syntax for -export is a list containing the name and
%% arity of each public function
-export([fib/1]).
%% Public API

%% Handle cases in which fib/1 receives specific values
%% The order in which these function signatures are declared is a vital
%% part of this module&#x27;s functionality

%% If fib/1 receives a negative number, then return the atom err_neg_val
%% Normally, such defensive coding is discouraged due to Erlang&#x27;s &#x27;Let
%% it Crash&#x27; philosophy, but here the result would be an infinite loop.
fib(N) when N &lt; 0 -&gt; err_neg_val;

%% If fib/1 is passed precisely the integer 0, then return 0
fib(0) -&gt; 0;

%% For all other values, call the private function fib_int/3 to perform
%% the calculation
fib(N) -&gt; fib_int(N-1, 0, 1).
%% Private API

%% If fib_int/3 receives 0 as its first argument, then we&#x27;re done, so
%% return the value in argument B. The second argument is denoted _ to
%% to disregard its value.
fib_int(0, _, B) -&gt; B;

%% For all other argument combinations, recursively call fib_int/3
%% where each call does the following:
%% - decrement counter N
%% - pass the third argument as the new second argument
%% - pass the sum of the second and third arguments as the new
%% third argument
fib_int(N, A, B) -&gt; fib_int(N-1, B, A+B).
Omitting the comments gives a much shorter program.
-module(series).
-export([fib/1]).

fib(N) when N &lt; 0 -&gt; err_neg_val;
fib(0) -&gt; 0;
fib(N) -&gt; fib_int(N-1, 0, 1).

fib_int(0, _, B) -&gt; B;
fib_int(N, A, B) -&gt; fib_int(N-1, B, A+B).
===Quicksort===
Quicksort in Erlang, using list comprehension:
%% qsort:qsort(List)
%% Sort a list of items
-module(qsort). % This is the file &#x27;qsort.erl&#x27;
-export([qsort/1]). % A function &#x27;qsort&#x27; with 1 parameter is exported (no type, no name)

qsort([]) -&gt; []; % If the list [] is empty, return an empty list (nothing to sort)
qsort([Pivot|Rest]) -&gt;
 % Compose recursively a list with &#x27;Front&#x27; for all elements that should be before &#x27;Pivot&#x27;
 % then &#x27;Pivot&#x27; then &#x27;Back&#x27; for all elements that should be after &#x27;Pivot&#x27;
 qsort([Front || Front &lt;- Rest, Front &lt; Pivot]) ++ 
 [Pivot] ++
 qsort([Back || Back &lt;- Rest, Back &gt;= Pivot]).
The above example recursively invokes the function codice_1 until nothing remains to be sorted. The expression codice_2 is a list comprehension, meaning &quot;Construct a list of elements codice_3 such that codice_3 is a member of codice_5, and codice_3 is less than codice_7.&quot; codice_8 is the list concatenation operator.

A comparison function can be used for more complicated structures for the sake of readability.

The following code would sort lists according to length:

% This is file &#x27;listsort.erl&#x27; (the compiler is made this way)
-module(listsort).
% Export &#x27;by_length&#x27; with 1 parameter (don&#x27;t care about the type and name)
-export([by_length/1]).

by_length(Lists) -&gt; % Use &#x27;qsort/2&#x27; and provides an anonymous function as a parameter
 qsort(Lists, fun(A,B) -&gt; length(A) &lt; length(B) end).

qsort([], _)-&gt; []; % If list is empty, return an empty list (ignore the second parameter)
qsort([Pivot|Rest], Smaller) -&gt;
 % Partition list with &#x27;Smaller&#x27; elements in front of &#x27;Pivot&#x27; and not-&#x27;Smaller&#x27; elements
 % after &#x27;Pivot&#x27; and sort the sublists.
 qsort([X || X &lt;- Rest, Smaller(X,Pivot)], Smaller)
 ++ [Pivot] ++
 qsort([Y || Y &lt;- Rest, not(Smaller(Y, Pivot))], Smaller).
A codice_7 is taken from the first parameter given to codice_10 and the rest of codice_11 is named codice_5. Note that the expression

[X || X &lt;- Rest, Smaller(X,Pivot)]

is no different in form from

[Front || Front &lt;- Rest, Front &lt; Pivot]

(in the previous example) except for the use of a comparison function in the last part, saying &quot;Construct a list of elements codice_13 such that codice_13 is a member of codice_5, and codice_16 is true&quot;, with codice_16 being defined earlier as

fun(A,B) -&gt; length(A) &lt; length(B) end

The anonymous function is named codice_16 in the parameter list of the second definition of codice_1 so that it can be referenced by that name within that function. It is not named in the first definition of codice_1, which deals with the base case of an empty list and thus has no need of this function, let alone a name for it.

==Data types==
Erlang has eight primitive data types:

;Integers: Integers are written as sequences of decimal digits, for example, 12, 12375 and -23427 are integers. Integer arithmetic is exact and only limited by available memory on the machine. (This is called arbitrary-precision arithmetic.)
;Atoms: Atoms are used within a program to denote distinguished values. They are written as strings of consecutive alphanumeric characters, the first character being lowercase. Atoms can contain any character if they are enclosed within single quotes and an escape convention exists which allows any character to be used within an atom. Atoms are never garbage collected and should be used with caution, especially if using dynamic atom generation.
;Floats: Floating point numbers use the IEEE 754 64-bit representation.
;References: References are globally unique symbols whose only property is that they can be compared for equality. They are created by evaluating the Erlang primitive codice_21.
;Binaries: A binary is a sequence of bytes. Binaries provide a space-efficient way of storing binary data. Erlang primitives exist for composing and decomposing binaries and for efficient input/output of binaries.
;Pids: Pid is short for &quot;process identifier&quot;a Pid is created by the Erlang primitive codice_22 Pids are references to Erlang processes.
;Ports: Ports are used to communicate with the external world. Ports are created with the built-in function codice_23. Messages can be sent to and received from ports, but these messages must obey the so-called &quot;port protocol.&quot;
;Funs: Funs are function closures. Funs are created by expressions of the form: codice_24.

And three compound data types:

;Tuples: Tuples are containers for a fixed number of Erlang data types. The syntax codice_25 denotes a tuple whose arguments are codice_26 The arguments can be primitive data types or compound data types. Any element of a tuple can be accessed in constant time.
;Lists: Lists are containers for a variable number of Erlang data types. The syntax codice_27 denotes a list whose first element is codice_28, and whose remaining elements are the list codice_29. The syntax codice_30 denotes an empty list. The syntax codice_31 is short for codice_32. The first element of a list can be accessed in constant time. The first element of a list is called the &quot;head&quot; of the list. The remainder of a list when its head has been removed is called the &quot;tail&quot; of the list.
;Maps: Maps contain a variable number of key-value associations. The syntax iscodice_33.

Two forms of syntactic sugar are provided:

;Strings: Strings are written as doubly quoted lists of characters. This is syntactic sugar for a list of the integer Unicode code points for the characters in the string. Thus, for example, the string &quot;cat&quot; is shorthand for codice_34.
;Records: Records provide a convenient way for associating a tag with each of the elements in a tuple. This allows one to refer to an element of a tuple by name and not by position. A pre-compiler takes the record definition and replaces it with the appropriate tuple reference.

Erlang has no method to define classes, although there are external libraries available.

==&quot;Let it crash&quot; coding style==

Erlang is designed with a mechanism that makes it easy for external processes to monitor for crashes (or hardware failures), rather than an in-process mechanism like exception handling used in many other programming languages. Crashes are reported like other messages, which is the only way processes can communicate with each other, and subprocesses can be spawned cheaply (see below). The &quot;let it crash&quot; philosophy prefers that a process be completely restarted rather than trying to recover from a serious failure. Though it still requires handling of errors, this philosophy results in less code devoted to defensive programming where error-handling code is highly contextual and specific.

===Supervisor trees===
A typical Erlang application is written in the form of a supervisor tree. This architecture is based on a hierarchy of processes in which the top level process is known as a &quot;supervisor&quot;. The supervisor then spawns multiple child processes that act either as workers or more, lower level supervisors. Such hierarchies can exist to arbitrary depths and have proven to provide a highly scalable and fault-tolerant environment within which application functionality can be implemented.

Within a supervisor tree, all supervisor processes are responsible for managing the lifecycle of their child processes, and this includes handling situations in which those child processes crash. Any process can become a supervisor by first spawning a child process, then calling codice_35 on that process. If the monitored process then crashes, the supervisor will receive a message containing a tuple whose first member is the atom codice_36. The supervisor is responsible firstly for listening for such messages and for taking the appropriate action to correct the error condition.

==Concurrency and distribution orientation==
Erlang&#x27;s main strength is support for concurrency. It has a small but powerful set of primitives to create processes and communicate among them. Erlang is conceptually similar to the language occam, though it recasts the ideas of communicating sequential processes (CSP) in a functional framework and uses asynchronous message passing. Processes are the primary means to structure an Erlang application. They are neither operating system processes nor threads, but lightweight processes that are scheduled by BEAM. Like operating system processes (but unlike operating system threads), they share no state with each other. The estimated minimal overhead for each is 300 words. Thus, many processes can be created without degrading performance. In 2005, a benchmark with 20 million processes was successfully performed with 64-bit Erlang on a machine with 16 GB random-access memory (RAM; total 800 bytes/process). Erlang has supported symmetric multiprocessing since release R11B of May 2006.

While threads need external library support in most languages, Erlang provides language-level features to create and manage processes with the goal of simplifying concurrent programming. Though all concurrency is explicit in Erlang, processes communicate using message passing instead of shared variables, which removes the need for explicit locks (a locking scheme is still used internally by the VM).

Inter-process communication works via a shared-nothing asynchronous message passing system: every process has a &quot;mailbox&quot;, a queue of messages that have been sent by other processes and not yet consumed. A process uses the codice_37 primitive to retrieve messages that match desired patterns. A message-handling routine tests messages in turn against each pattern, until one of them matches. When the message is consumed and removed from the mailbox the process resumes execution. A message may comprise any Erlang structure, including primitives (integers, floats, characters, atoms), tuples, lists, and functions.

The code example below shows the built-in support for distributed processes:
 % Create a process and invoke the function web:start_server(Port, MaxConnections)
 ServerProcess = spawn(web, start_server, [Port, MaxConnections]),

 % Create a remote process and invoke the function
 % web:start_server(Port, MaxConnections) on machine RemoteNode
 RemoteProcess = spawn(RemoteNode, web, start_server, [Port, MaxConnections]),

 % Send a message to ServerProcess (asynchronously). The message consists of a tuple
 % with the atom &quot;pause&quot; and the number &quot;10&quot;.
 ServerProcess ! {pause, 10},

 % Receive messages sent to this process
 receive
 a_message -&gt; do_something;
 {data, DataContent} -&gt; handle(DataContent);
 {hello, Text} -&gt; io:format(&quot;Got hello message: ~s&quot;, [Text]);
 {goodbye, Text} -&gt; io:format(&quot;Got goodbye message: ~s&quot;, [Text])
 end.
As the example shows, processes may be created on remote nodes, and communication with them is transparent in the sense that communication with remote processes works exactly as communication with local processes.

Concurrency supports the primary method of error-handling in Erlang. When a process crashes, it neatly exits and sends a message to the controlling process which can then take action, such as starting a new process that takes over the old process&#x27;s task.

==Implementation==
The official reference implementation of Erlang uses BEAM. BEAM is included in the official distribution of Erlang, called Erlang/OTP. BEAM executes bytecode which is converted to threaded code at load time. It also includes a native code compiler on most platforms, developed by the High Performance Erlang Project (HiPE) at Uppsala University. Since October 2001 the HiPE system is fully integrated in Ericsson&#x27;s Open Source Erlang/OTP system. It also supports interpreting, directly from source code via abstract syntax tree, via script as of R11B-5 release of Erlang.

==Hot code loading and modules==
Erlang supports language-level Dynamic Software Updating. To implement this, code is loaded and managed as &quot;module&quot; units; the module is a compilation unit. The system can keep two versions of a module in memory at the same time, and processes can concurrently run code from each. The versions are referred to as the &quot;new&quot; and the &quot;old&quot; version. A process will not move into the new version until it makes an external call to its module.

An example of the mechanism of hot code loading:
 %% A process whose only job is to keep a counter.
 %% First version
 -module(counter).
 -export([start/0, codeswitch/1]).

 start() -&gt; loop(0).

 loop(Sum) -&gt;
 receive
 {increment, Count} -&gt;
 loop(Sum+Count);
 {counter, Pid} -&gt;
 Pid ! {counter, Sum},
 loop(Sum);
 code_switch -&gt;
 ?MODULE:codeswitch(Sum)
 % Force the use of &#x27;codeswitch/1&#x27; from the latest MODULE version
 end.

 codeswitch(Sum) -&gt; loop(Sum).
For the second version, we add the possibility to reset the count to zero.
 %% Second version
 -module(counter).
 -export([start/0, codeswitch/1]).

 start() -&gt; loop(0).

 loop(Sum) -&gt;
 receive
 {increment, Count} -&gt;
 loop(Sum+Count);
 reset -&gt;
 loop(0);
 {counter, Pid} -&gt;
 Pid ! {counter, Sum},
 loop(Sum);
 code_switch -&gt;
 ?MODULE:codeswitch(Sum)
 end.

 codeswitch(Sum) -&gt; loop(Sum).
Only when receiving a message consisting of the atom codice_38 will the loop execute an external call to codeswitch/1 (codice_39 is a preprocessor macro for the current module). If there is a new version of the &quot;counter&quot; module in memory, then its codeswitch/1 function will be called. The practice of having a specific entry-point into a new version allows the programmer to transform state to what is needed in the newer version. In the example, the state is kept as an integer.

In practice, systems are built up using design principles from the Open Telecom Platform, which leads to more code upgradable designs. Successful hot code loading is exacting. Code must be written with care to make use of Erlang&#x27;s facilities.

==Distribution==
In 1998, Ericsson released Erlang as free and open-source software to ensure its independence from a single vendor and to increase awareness of the language. Erlang, together with libraries and the real-time distributed database Mnesia, forms the OTP collection of libraries. Ericsson and a few other companies support Erlang commercially.

Since the open source release, Erlang has been used by several firms worldwide, including Nortel and Deutsche Telekom. Although Erlang was designed to fill a niche and has remained an obscure language for most of its existence, its popularity is growing due to demand for concurrent services.
Erlang has found some use in fielding massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) servers.

<text>Euphoria is a programming language created by Robert Craig of Rapid Deployment Software in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Initially developed (though not publicly released) on the Atari ST, the first commercial release was for MS-DOS as proprietary software. In 2006, with the release of version 3, Euphoria became open-source software. The openEuphoria Group continues to administer and develop the project. In December 2010, the openEuphoria Group released version 4 of openEuphoria along with a new identity and mascot for the project. OpenEuphoria is currently available for Windows, Linux, macOS and three flavors of *BSD.

Euphoria is a general-purpose high-level imperative-procedural interpreted language. A translator generates C source code and the GNU compiler collection (GCC) and Open Watcom compilers are supported. Alternatively, Euphoria programs may be bound with the interpreter to create stand-alone executables. A number of graphical user interface (GUI) libraries are supported including Win32lib and wrappers for wxWidgets, GTK+ and IUP. Euphoria has a simple built-in database and wrappers for a variety of other databases.

==Overview==
The Euphoria language is a general purpose procedural language that focuses on simplicity, legibility, rapid development and performance via several means.
*&quot;Simplicity&quot; – It uses just four built-in data types (see below) and implements automatic garbage collection.
*&quot;Legibility&quot; – The syntax favors simple English keywords over the use of punctuation to delineate constructs.
*&quot;Rapid development&quot; – An interpreter encourages prototyping and incremental development.
*&quot;Performance&quot; – An efficient reference-counting garbage collector correctly handles cyclic references.

==History==
Developed as a personal project to invent a programming language from scratch, Euphoria was created by Robert Craig on an Atari Mega-ST. Many design ideas for the language came from Craig&#x27;s Master&#x27;s thesis in computer science at the University of Toronto. Craig&#x27;s thesis was heavily influenced by the work of John Backus on functional programming (FP) languages.

Craig ported his original Atari implementation to the 16-bit DOS platform and Euphoria was first released, version 1.0, in July 1993 under a proprietary licence. The original Atari implementation is described by Craig as &quot;primitive&quot; and has not been publicly released. Euphoria continued to be developed and released by Craig via his company Rapid Deployment Software (RDS) and website rapideuphoria.com. In October 2006 RDS released version 3 of Euphoria and announced that henceforth Euphoria would be freely distributed under an open-source software licence.

RDS continued to develop Euphoria, culminating with the release of version 3.1.1 in August, 2007. Subsequently, RDS ceased unilateral development of Euphoria and the openEuphoria Group took over ongoing development. The openEuphoria Group released version 4 in December, 2010 along with a new logo and mascot for the openEuphoria project.

Version 3.1.1 remains an important milestone release, being the last version of Euphoria which supports the DOS platform.

Euphoria is an acronym for &quot;End-User Programming with Hierarchical Objects for Robust Interpreted Applications&quot; although there is some suspicion that this is a backronym.

The Euphoria interpreter was originally written in C. With the release of version 2.5 in November 2004 the Euphoria interpreter was split into two parts: a front-end parser, and a back-end interpreter. The front-end is now written in Euphoria (and used with the Euphoria-to-C translator and the Binder). The main back-end and run time library are written in C.

==Features==
Euphoria was conceived and developed with the following design goals and features:

* Ease of learning and with consistent high-level constructs (more so than, for example, the BASIC language)
* Implementation of flat-form 32-bit memory to avoid complex memory management and size-addressing limits
* Debugging support and run-time error-handling
* Subscript and type checking
* Loose and strict variable typing
* Programming via objects as types (user-defined or otherwise)
* Interpreted, with automatic memory management and garbage collection
* Heterogeneous collection types (sequences)
* DOS graphics library (Euphoria language versions up to and including 3.1.1)
* Debugger
* Integrated database system
* Low-level memory handling
* Straightforward wrapping of (or access to) C libraries

==Execution modes==
* Interpreter
* C translator (E2C) for standalone executables or dynamic linking
* Bytecode compiler and interpreter (shrouder)
* The Binder binds the Euphoria source code to the interpreter to create an executable.
* A read–eval–print loop (REPL) version is on the openEuphoria roadmap.

==Use==
Euphoria is designed to readily facilitate handling of dynamic sets of data of varying types and is particularly useful for string and image processing. Euphoria has been used in artificial intelligence experiments, the study of mathematics, for teaching programming, and to implement fonts involving thousands of characters. A large part of the Euphoria interpreter is written in Euphoria.

==Data types==
Euphoria has two basic data types:
:Atom – A number, implemented as a 31-bit signed integer or a 64-bit IEEE floating-point. Euphoria dynamically changes between integer and floating point representation according to the current value.
:Sequence – A vector (array) with zero or more elements. Each element may be an &quot;atom&quot; or another &quot;sequence&quot;. The number of elements in a sequence is not fixed (i.e., the size of the vector/array does not have to be declared). The program may add or remove elements as needed during run-time. Memory allocation-deallocation is automatically handled by reference counting. Individual elements are referenced using an index value enclosed in square brackets. The first element in a sequence has an index of one [1]. Elements inside embedded sequences are referenced by additional bracked index values, thus X[3][2] refers to the second element contained in the sequence that is the third element of X. Each element of a sequence is an &quot;object&quot; type (see below).

Euphoria has two additional data types predefined:
:Integer – An &quot;atom&quot;, restricted to 31-bit signed integer values in the range to ( to ). &quot;Integer&quot; data types are more efficient than the &quot;atom&quot; data types, but cannot contain the same range of values. Characters are stored as integers, e.g., coding ASCII-&#x27;A&#x27; is exactly the same as coding 65.
:Object – A generic datatype which may contain any of the above (i.e., &quot;atom&quot;, &quot;sequence&quot; or &quot;integer&quot;) and which may be changed to another type during run-time.

There is no character string data type. Strings are represented by a &quot;sequence&quot; of &quot;integer&quot; values. However, because literal strings are so commonly used in programming, Euphoria interprets double-quote enclosed characters as a sequence of integers. Thus
 &quot;ABC&quot;
is seen as if the coder had written:
 {&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;}
which is the same as:
 {65, 66, 67}

==Hello, World!==
 puts(1, &quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;)

==Examples==
Program comments start with a double hyphen codice_1 and go through the end of line.

The following code looks for an old item in a group of items. If found, it removes it by concatenating all the elements before it with all the elements after it. Note that the first element in a sequence has the index one [1] and that $ refers to the length (i.e., total number of elements) of the sequence.

 global function delete_item( object old, sequence group )
 integer pos
 -- Code begins --
 pos = find( old, group )
 if pos &gt; 0 then
 group = group[1 .. pos-1] &amp; group[pos+1 .. $]
 end if
 return group
 end function

The following modification to the above example replaces an old item with a new item. As the variables &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; have been defined as objects, they could be &quot;atoms&quot; or &quot;sequences&quot;. Type checking is not needed as the function will work with any sequence of data of any type and needs no external libraries.

 global function replace_item( object old, object new, sequence group )
 integer pos
 -- Code begins --
 pos = find( old, group )
 if pos &gt; 0 then
 group[pos] = new
 end if
 return group
 end function

Furthermore, no pointers are involved and subscripts are automatically checked. Thus the function cannot access memory out-of-bounds. There is no need to allocate or deallocate memory explicitly and no chance of a memory leak.

The line

 group = group[1 .. pos-1] &amp; group[pos+1 .. $]

shows some of the &quot;sequence&quot; handling facilities. A &quot;sequence&quot; may contain a set of any types, and this can be sliced (to take a subset of the data in a &quot;sequence&quot;) and concatenated in expressions with no need for special functions.

==Parameter passing==
Arguments to routines are always passed by value; there is no pass-by-reference facility. However, parameters are allowed to be modified &quot;locally&quot; (i.e., within the callee) which is implemented very efficiently as sequences have automatic copy-on-write semantics. In other words, when you pass a sequence to a routine, initially only a reference to it is passed, but at the point the routine modifies this sequence parameter the sequence is copied and the routine updates only a copy of the original.

<doc id="9649" wikidata="Q11379" url="?curid=9649" title="Energy">
<text>Energy () is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work and in the form of heat and light. Energy is a conserved quantity—the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The unit of measurement for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J).

Forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object (for instance due to its position in a field), the elastic energy stored in a solid object, chemical energy associated with chemical reactions, the radiant energy carried by electromagnetic radiation, the internal energy contained within a thermodynamic system, and rest energy associated with an object&#x27;s rest mass. These are not mutually exclusive.

All living organisms constantly take in and release energy. The Earth&#x27;s climate and ecosystems processes are driven primarily by radiant energy from the sun. The energy industry provides the energy required for human civilization to function, which it obtains from energy resources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, and renewable energy.

== Forms ==

The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. Kinetic energy is determined by the movement of an object – or the composite motion of the object&#x27;s components – while potential energy reflects the potential of an object to have motion, generally being based upon the object&#x27;s position within a field or what is stored within the field itself.

While these two categories are sufficient to describe all forms of energy, it is often convenient to refer to particular combinations of potential and kinetic energy as its own form. For example, the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy within a system is referred to as mechanical energy, whereas nuclear energy refers to the combined potentials within an atomic nucleus from either the nuclear force or the weak force, among other examples.

== History ==
The word &quot;energy&quot; derives from the , which possibly appears for the first time in the work of Aristotle in the 4th century BC. In contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept, broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.

In the late 17th century, Gottfried Leibniz proposed the idea of the , or living force, which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total &quot;vis viva&quot; was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the motions of the constituent parts of matter, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. The modern analog of this property, kinetic energy, differs from &quot;vis viva&quot; only by a factor of two. Writing in the early 18th century, Émilie du Châtelet proposed the concept of conservation of energy in the marginalia of her French language translation of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, which represented the first formulation of a conserved measurable quantity that was distinct from momentum, and which would later be called &quot;energy&quot;.

In 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term &quot;energy&quot; instead of &quot;vis viva&quot;, in its modern sense. Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described &quot;kinetic energy&quot; in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, William Rankine coined the term &quot;potential energy&quot;. The law of conservation of energy was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any isolated system. It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance, dubbed the caloric, or merely a physical quantity, such as momentum. In 1845 James Prescott Joule discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat.

These developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, formalized largely by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) as the field of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Walther Nernst. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of radiant energy by Jožef Stefan. According to Noether&#x27;s theorem, the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time. Thus, since 1918, theorists have understood that the law of conservation of energy is the direct mathematical consequence of the translational symmetry of the quantity conjugate to energy, namely time.

== Units of measure ==

In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of energy is the joule. It is a derived unit that is equal to the energy expended, or work done, in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre. However energy can also be expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as ergs, calories, British thermal units, kilowatt-hours and kilocalories, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units.

The SI unit of power, defined as energy per unit of time, is the watt, which is a joule per second. Thus, one joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal one watt-hour. The CGS energy unit is the erg and the imperial and US customary unit is the foot pound. Other energy units such as the electronvolt, food calorie or thermodynamic kcal (based on the temperature change of water in a heating process), and BTU are used in specific areas of science and commerce.

In 1843, English physicist James Prescott Joule, namesake of the unit of measure, discovered that the gravitational potential energy lost by a descending weight attached via a string was equal to the internal energy gained by the water through friction with the paddle.

== Scientific use ==

=== Classical mechanics ===

In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property, as it is a conserved quantity. Several formulations of mechanics have been developed using energy as a core concept.

Work, a function of energy, is force times distance.
: formula_1

This says that the work (formula_2) is equal to the line integral of the force F along a path &quot;C&quot;; for details see the mechanical work article. Work and thus energy is frame dependent. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball.

The total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian, after William Rowan Hamilton. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.

Another energy-related concept is called the Lagrangian, after Joseph-Louis Lagrange. This formalism is as fundamental as the Hamiltonian, and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them. It was invented in the context of classical mechanics, but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy &quot;minus&quot; the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction).

Noether&#x27;s theorem (1918) states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. Noether&#x27;s theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. A generalisation of the seminal formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian; for example, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.

=== Chemistry ===

In the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular, or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is usually accompanied by a decrease, and sometimes an increase, of the total energy of the substances involved. Some energy may be transferred between the surroundings and the reactants in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction have sometimes more but usually less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be exothermic or exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the less common case of endothermic reactions the situation is the reverse.

Chemical reactions are usually not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy. The &quot;speed&quot; of a chemical reaction (at a given temperature &quot;T&quot;) is related to the activation energy &quot;E&quot; by the Boltzmann&#x27;s population factor e−&quot;E&quot;/&quot;kT&quot;; that is, the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to &quot;E&quot; at a given temperature &quot;T&quot;. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be provided in the form of thermal energy.

=== Biology ===

In biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems, from the biosphere to the smallest living organism. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or organelle of a biological organism. Energy used in respiration is stored in substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins stored by cells. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, using as a standard an average human energy expenditure of 6,900 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts.

For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds&#x27; duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum. The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a &quot;feel&quot; for the use of a given amount of energy.

Sunlight&#x27;s radiant energy is also captured by plants as &quot;chemical potential energy&quot; in photosynthesis, when carbon dioxide and water (two low-energy compounds) are converted into carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and oxygen. Release of the energy stored during photosynthesis as heat or light may be triggered suddenly by a spark in a forest fire, or it may be made available more slowly for animal or human metabolism when organic molecules are ingested and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action.

All living creatures rely on an external source of energy to be able to grow and reproduce – radiant energy from the Sun in the case of green plants and chemical energy (in some form) in the case of animals. The daily 1500–2000 Calories (6–8 MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as food molecules, mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which glucose (C6H12O6) and stearin (C57H110O6) are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water in the mitochondria
&lt;chem display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;C6H12O6 + 6O2 -&gt; 6CO2 + 6H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
&lt;chem display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;C57H110O6 + (81 1/2) O2 -&gt; 57CO2 + 55H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
and some of the energy is used to convert ADP into ATP:

The rest of the chemical energy of the carbohydrate or fat are converted into heat: the ATP is used as a sort of &quot;energy currency&quot;, and some of the chemical energy it contains is used for other metabolism when ATP reacts with OH groups and eventually splits into ADP and phosphate (at each stage of a metabolic pathway, some chemical energy is converted into heat). Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work:
: gain in kinetic energy of a sprinter during a 100 m race: 4 kJ
: gain in gravitational potential energy of a 150 kg weight lifted through 2 metres: 3 kJ
: daily food intake of a normal adult: 6–8 MJ

It would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient (in the physical sense) in their use of the energy they receive (chemical or radiant energy); most machines manage higher efficiencies. In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (&quot;the surroundings&quot;). Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology. As an example, to take just the first step in the food chain: of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat.

=== Earth sciences ===
In geology, continental drift, mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the Earth&#x27;s interior, while meteorological phenomena like wind, rain, hail, snow, lightning, tornadoes and hurricanes are all a result of energy transformations in our atmosphere brought about by solar energy.

Sunlight is the main input to Earth&#x27;s energy budget which accounts for its temperature and climate stability. Sunlight may be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example when) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbines or generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives most weather phenomena, save a few exceptions, like those generated by volcanic events for example. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, suddenly give up some of their thermal energy to power a few days of violent air movement.

In a slower process, radioactive decay of atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives plate tectonics and may lift mountains, via orogenesis. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may later be transformed into active kinetic energy during landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars (which created these atoms).

=== Cosmology ===

In cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars and gamma-ray bursts are the universe&#x27;s highest-output energy transformations of matter. All phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen).

The nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.
=== Quantum mechanics ===

In quantum mechanics, energy is defined in terms of the energy operator
(Hamiltonian) as a time derivative of the wave function. The Schrödinger equation equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. Its results can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of a slowly changing (non-relativistic) wave function of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an energy level) which results in the concept of quanta. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by Planck&#x27;s relation: formula_3 (where formula_4 is the Planck constant and formula_5 the frequency). In the case of an electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or photons.

=== Relativity ===
When calculating kinetic energy (work to accelerate a massive body from zero speed to some finite speed) relativistically – using Lorentz transformations instead of Newtonian mechanics – Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it rest energy: energy which every massive body must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of the body:
formula_6
where
* &quot;m&quot;0 is the rest mass of the body,
* &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum,
* formula_7 is the rest energy.

For example, consider electron–positron annihilation, in which the rest energy of these two individual particles (equivalent to their rest mass) is converted to the radiant energy of the photons produced in the process. In this system the matter and antimatter (electrons and positrons) are destroyed and changed to non-matter (the photons). However, the total mass and total energy do not change during this interaction. The photons each have no rest mass but nonetheless have radiant energy which exhibits the same inertia as did the two original particles. This is a reversible process – the inverse process is called pair creation – in which the rest mass of particles is created from the radiant energy of two (or more) annihilating photons.

In general relativity, the stress–energy tensor serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.

Energy and mass are manifestations of one and the same underlying physical property of a system. This property is responsible for the inertia and strength of gravitational interaction of the system (&quot;mass manifestations&quot;), and is also responsible for the potential ability of the system to perform work or heating (&quot;energy manifestations&quot;), subject to the limitations of other physical laws.

In classical physics, energy is a scalar quantity, the canonical conjugate to time. In special relativity energy is also a scalar (although not a Lorentz scalar but a time component of the energy–momentum 4-vector). In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of space, but not invariant with respect to rotations of spacetime (= boosts).

== Transformation ==


Energy may be transformed between different forms at various efficiencies. Items that transform between these forms are called transducers. Examples of transducers include a battery (from chemical energy to electric energy), a dam (from gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy of moving water (and the blades of a turbine) and ultimately to electric energy through an electric generator), and a heat engine (from heat to work).

Examples of energy transformation include generating electric energy from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor. Lifting against gravity performs mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object. If the object falls to the ground, gravity does mechanical work on the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground. The Sun transforms nuclear potential energy to other forms of energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that itself (since it still contains the same total energy even in different forms) but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as radiant energy.

There are strict limits to how efficiently heat can be converted into work in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as described by Carnot&#x27;s theorem and the second law of thermodynamics. However, some energy transformations can be quite efficient. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by entropy (equal energy spread among all available degrees of freedom) considerations. In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.

Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy, that has been available since the Big Bang, being &quot;released&quot; (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy) when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nucleosynthesis, a process ultimately using the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse of supernovae to &quot;store&quot; energy in the creation of heavy isotopes (such as uranium and thorium), and nuclear decay, a process in which energy is released that was originally stored in these heavy elements, before they were incorporated into the Solar System and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear fission bombs or in civil nuclear power generation. Similarly, in the case of a chemical explosion, chemical potential energy is transformed to kinetic and thermal energy in a very short time.

Yet another example is that of a pendulum. At its highest points the kinetic energy is zero and the gravitational potential energy is at its maximum. At its lowest point the kinetic energy is at its maximum and is equal to the decrease in potential energy. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no friction or other losses, the conversion of energy between these processes would be perfect, and the pendulum would continue swinging forever.

Energy is also transferred from potential energy (formula_8) to kinetic energy (formula_9) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this isolated system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:
The equation can then be simplified further since formula_10 (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and formula_11 (half mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding formula_12.

=== Conservation of energy and mass in transformation ===
Energy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero momentum, where it can be weighed. It is also equivalent to mass, and this mass is always associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a certain amount of energy, and likewise always appears associated with it, as described in mass–energy equivalence. The formula &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2, derived by Albert Einstein (1905) quantifies the relationship between relativistic mass and energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by J.J. Thomson (1881), Henri Poincaré (1900), Friedrich Hasenöhrl (1904) and others (see Mass–energy equivalence#History for further information).

Part of the rest energy (equivalent to rest mass) of matter may be converted to other forms of energy (still exhibiting mass), but neither energy nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant during any process. However, since formula_13 is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of an everyday amount of rest mass (for example, 1 kg) from rest energy to other forms of energy (such as kinetic energy, thermal energy, or the radiant energy carried by light and other radiation) can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~ , equivalent to 21 megatons of TNT), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons.

Conversely, the mass equivalent of an everyday amount energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure on a weighing scale, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of large transformations between rest energy (of matter) and other forms of energy (e.g., kinetic energy into particles with rest mass) are found in nuclear physics and particle physics. Often, however, the complete conversion of matter (such as atoms) to non-matter (such as photons) is forbidden by conservation laws.

=== Reversible and non-reversible transformations ===
Thermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds: reversible processes and irreversible processes. An irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above.

In processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as thermal energy and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomization in a crystal).

As the universe evolves with time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or as other kinds of increases in disorder). This has led to the hypothesis of the inevitable thermodynamic heat death of the universe. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work through a heat engine, or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), continues to decrease.

== Conservation of energy ==

The fact that energy can be neither created nor destroyed is called the law of conservation of energy. In the form of the first law of thermodynamics, this states that a closed system&#x27;s energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out as work or heat, and that no energy is lost in transfer. The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.

While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in heat engines the second law of thermodynamics states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat. This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the available energy. Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into thermal energy without such limitations. The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system.

Richard Feynman said during a 1961 lecture:
Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception) are subject to strict local conservation laws as well. In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa.

This law is a fundamental principle of physics. As shown rigorously by Noether&#x27;s theorem, the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of translational symmetry of time, a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle – it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval (though this is practically significant only for very short time intervals). The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation – rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured.

Each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy, and all types of potential energy (like all other types of energy) appear as system mass, whenever present. For example, a compressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was compressed. Likewise, whenever energy is transferred between systems by any mechanism, an associated mass is transferred with it.

In quantum mechanics energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian operator. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by
: formula_14
which is similar in form to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since &quot;H&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).

In particle physics, this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of virtual particles, which carry momentum. The exchange of virtual particles with real particles is responsible for the creation of all known fundamental forces (more accurately known as fundamental interactions). Virtual photons are also responsible for the electrostatic interaction between electric charges (which results in Coulomb&#x27;s law), for spontaneous radiative decay of excited atomic and nuclear states, for the Casimir force, for the Van der Waals force and some other observable phenomena.

== Energy transfer ==
=== Closed systems ===
Energy transfer can be considered for the special case of systems which are closed to transfers of matter. The portion of the energy which is transferred by conservative forces over a distance is measured as the work the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called heat. Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples include the transmission of electromagnetic energy via photons, physical collisions which transfer kinetic energy, tidal interactions, and the conductive transfer of thermal energy.

Energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved wherever it can be defined. In thermodynamics, for closed systems, the process of energy transfer is described by the first law:

where formula_15 is the amount of energy transferred, formula_2  represents the work done on or by the system, and formula_17 represents the heat flow into or out of the system. As a simplification, the heat term, formula_17, can sometimes be ignored, especially for fast processes involving gases, which are poor conductors of heat, or when the thermal efficiency of the transfer is high. For such adiabatic processes,

This simplified equation is the one used to define the joule, for example.

=== Open systems ===
Beyond the constraints of closed systems, open systems can gain or lose energy in association with matter transfer (this process is illustrated by injection of an air-fuel mixture into a car engine, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Denoting this energy by formula_19, one may write

== Thermodynamics ==

=== Internal energy ===
Internal energy is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is the energy needed to create the system. It is related to the potential energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other geometric aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinetic energy. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with changes in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is impossible to determine with thermodynamics alone.

=== First law of thermodynamics ===
The first law of thermodynamics asserts that the total energy of a system and its surroundings (but not necessarily thermodynamic free energy) is always conserved and that heat flow is a form of energy transfer. For homogeneous systems, with a well-defined temperature and pressure, a commonly used corollary of the first law is that, for a system subject only to pressure forces and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-full of gas) without chemical changes, the differential change in the internal energy of the system (with a &quot;gain&quot; in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given as
: formula_20
where the first term on the right is the heat transferred into the system, expressed in terms of temperature &quot;T&quot; and entropy &quot;S&quot; (in which entropy increases and its change d&quot;S&quot; is positive when heat is added to the system), and the last term on the right hand side is identified as work done on the system, where pressure is &quot;P&quot; and volume &quot;V&quot; (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, d&quot;V&quot;, is negative when work is done on the system).

This equation is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electrical, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as advection of any form of energy other than heat and &quot;PV&quot;-work. The general formulation of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which the system is not homogeneous. For these cases the change in internal energy of a &quot;closed&quot; system is expressed in a general form by
: formula_21
where formula_22 is the heat supplied to the system and formula_23 is the work applied to the system.

=== Equipartition of energy ===
The energy of a mechanical harmonic oscillator (a mass on a spring) is alternately kinetic and potential energy. At two points in the oscillation cycle it is entirely kinetic, and at two points it is entirely potential. Over a whole cycle, or over many cycles, average energy is equally split between kinetic and potential. This is an example of the equipartition principle: the total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom, on average.

This principle is vitally important to understanding the behavior of a quantity closely related to energy, called entropy. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available energy states that are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; degrees. This mathematical result is part of the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics is simple only for systems which are near or in a physical equilibrium state. For non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing the systems&#x27; behavior are still debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the principle of maximum entropy production. It states that nonequilibrium systems behave in such a way as to maximize their entropy production.

<text>In probability theory, the expected value (also called expectation, expectancy, expectation operator, mathematical expectation, mean, expectation value, or first [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]]) is a generalization of the weighted average. Informally, the expected value is the mean of the possible values a random variable can take, weighted by the probability of those outcomes. Since it is obtained through arithmetic, the expected value sometimes may not even be included in the sample data set; it is not the value you would expect to get in reality.

The expected value of a random variable with a finite number of outcomes is a weighted average of all possible outcomes. In the case of a continuum of possible outcomes, the expectation is defined by integration. In the axiomatic foundation for probability provided by measure theory, the expectation is given by Lebesgue integration.

The expected value of a random variable is often denoted by , , or , with also often stylized as formula_1 or .

== History==
The idea of the expected value originated in the middle of the 17th century from the study of the so-called problem of points, which seeks to divide the stakes &quot;in a fair way&quot; between two players, who have to end their game before it is properly finished. This problem had been debated for centuries. Many conflicting proposals and solutions had been suggested over the years when it was posed to Blaise Pascal by French writer and amateur mathematician Chevalier de Méré in 1654. Méré claimed that this problem could not be solved and that it showed just how flawed mathematics was when it came to its application to the real world. Pascal, being a mathematician, was provoked and determined to solve the problem once and for all.

He began to discuss the problem in the famous series of letters to Pierre de Fermat. Soon enough, they both independently came up with a solution. They solved the problem in different computational ways, but their results were identical because their computations were based on the same fundamental principle. The principle is that the value of a future gain should be directly proportional to the chance of getting it. This principle seemed to have come naturally to both of them. They were very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution, and this in turn made them absolutely convinced that they had solved the problem conclusively; however, they did not publish their findings. They only informed a small circle of mutual scientific friends in Paris about it.

In Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens&#x27; book, he considered the problem of points, and presented a solution based on the same principle as the solutions of Pascal and Fermat. Huygens published his treatise in 1657, (see Huygens (1657)) &quot;De ratiociniis in ludo aleæ&quot; on probability theory just after visiting Paris. The book extended the concept of expectation by adding rules for how to calculate expectations in more complicated situations than the original problem (e.g., for three or more players), and can be seen as the first successful attempt at laying down the foundations of the theory of probability.

In the foreword to his treatise, Huygens wrote:

In the mid-nineteenth century, Pafnuty Chebyshev became the first person to think systematically in terms of the expectations of random variables.

===Etymology===
Neither Pascal nor Huygens used the term &quot;expectation&quot; in its modern sense. In particular, Huygens writes:

More than a hundred years later, in 1814, Pierre-Simon Laplace published his tract &quot;Théorie analytique des probabilités&quot;, where the concept of expected value was defined explicitly:

==Notations==
The use of the letter to denote &quot;expected value&quot; goes back to W. A. Whitworth in 1901. The symbol has since become popular for English writers. In German, stands for &quot;Erwartungswert&quot;, in Spanish for &quot;esperanza matemática&quot;, and in French for &quot;espérance mathématique.&quot;

When &quot;E&quot; is used to denote &quot;expected value&quot;, authors use a variety of stylizations: the expectation operator can be stylized as (upright), (italic), or formula_1 (in blackboard bold), while a variety of bracket notations (such as , , and ) are all used.

Another popular notation is . , , and formula_3 are commonly used in physics. is used in Russian-language literature.

==Definition==
As discussed above, there are several context-dependent ways of defining the expected value. The simplest and original definition deals with the case of finitely many possible outcomes, such as in the flip of a coin. With the theory of infinite series, this can be extended to the case of countably many possible outcomes. It is also very common to consider the distinct case of random variables dictated by (piecewise-)continuous probability density functions, as these arise in many natural contexts. All of these specific definitions may be viewed as special cases of the general definition based upon the mathematical tools of measure theory and Lebesgue integration, which provide these different contexts with an axiomatic foundation and common language.

Any definition of expected value may be extended to define an expected value of a multidimensional random variable, i.e. a random vector . It is defined component by component, as . Similarly, one may define the expected value of a random matrix with components by .

===Random variables with finitely many outcomes===
Consider a random variable with a &quot;finite&quot; list of possible outcomes, each of which (respectively) has probability of occurring. The expectation of is defined as
formula_4

Since the probabilities must satisfy , it is natural to interpret as a weighted average of the values, with weights given by their probabilities .

In the special case that all possible outcomes are equiprobable (that is, ), the weighted average is given by the standard average. In the general case, the expected value takes into account the fact that some outcomes are more likely than others.

====Examples====
* Let formula_5 represent the outcome of a roll of a fair six-sided die. More specifically, formula_5 will be the number of pips showing on the top face of the die after the toss. The possible values for formula_5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, all of which are equally likely with a probability of . The expectation of formula_5 is formula_9 If one rolls the die formula_10 times and computes the average (arithmetic mean) of the results, then as formula_10 grows, the average will almost surely converge to the expected value, a fact known as the strong law of large numbers.
* The roulette game consists of a small ball and a wheel with 38 numbered pockets around the edge. As the wheel is spun, the ball bounces around randomly until it settles down in one of the pockets. Suppose random variable formula_5 represents the (monetary) outcome of a $1 bet on a single number (&quot;straight up&quot; bet). If the bet wins (which happens with probability in American roulette), the payoff is $35; otherwise the player loses the bet. The expected profit from such a bet will be formula_13 That is, the expected value to be won from a $1 bet is −$. Thus, in 190 bets, the net loss will probably be about $10.

===Random variables with countably infinitely many outcomes===
Informally, the expectation of a random variable with a countably infinite set of possible outcomes is defined analogously as the weighted average of all possible outcomes, where the weights are given by the probabilities of realizing each given value. This is to say that
formula_14
where are the possible outcomes of the random variable and are their corresponding probabilities. In many non-mathematical textbooks, this is presented as the full definition of expected values in this context.

However, there are some subtleties with infinite summation, so the above formula is not suitable as a mathematical definition. In particular, the Riemann series theorem of mathematical analysis illustrates that the value of certain infinite sums involving positive and negative summands depends on the order in which the summands are given. Since the outcomes of a random variable have no naturally given order, this creates a difficulty in defining expected value precisely.

For this reason, many mathematical textbooks only consider the case that the infinite sum given above converges absolutely, which implies that the infinite sum is a finite number independent of the ordering of summands. In the alternative case that the infinite sum does not converge absolutely, one says the random variable &quot;does not have finite expectation.&quot;

====Examples====
* Suppose formula_15 and formula_16 for formula_17 where formula_18 is the scaling factor which makes the probabilities sum to 1. Then we have formula_19

===Random variables with density===
Now consider a random variable which has a probability density function given by a function on the real number line. This means that the probability of taking on a value in any given open interval is given by the integral of over that interval. The expectation of is then given by the integral
formula_20
A general and mathematically precise formulation of this definition uses measure theory and Lebesgue integration, and the corresponding theory of &quot;absolutely continuous random variables&quot; is described in the next section. The density functions of many common distributions are piecewise continuous, and as such the theory is often developed in this restricted setting. For such functions, it is sufficient to only consider the standard Riemann integration. Sometimes &quot;continuous random variables&quot; are defined as those corresponding to this special class of densities, although the term is used differently by various authors.

Analogously to the countably-infinite case above, there are subtleties with this expression due to the infinite region of integration. Such subtleties can be seen concretely if the distribution of is given by the Cauchy distribution , so that . It is straightforward to compute in this case that
formula_21
The limit of this expression as and does not exist: if the limits are taken so that , then the limit is zero, while if the constraint is taken, then the limit is .

To avoid such ambiguities, in mathematical textbooks it is common to require that the given integral converges absolutely, with left undefined otherwise. However, measure-theoretic notions as given below can be used to give a systematic definition of for more general random variables .

===Arbitrary real-valued random variables===
All definitions of the expected value may be expressed in the language of measure theory. In general, if is a real-valued random variable defined on a probability space , then the expected value of , denoted by , is defined as the Lebesgue integral
formula_22
Despite the newly abstract situation, this definition is extremely similar in nature to the very simplest definition of expected values, given above, as certain weighted averages. This is because, in measure theory, the value of the Lebesgue integral of is defined via weighted averages of &quot;approximations&quot; of which take on finitely many values. Moreover, if given a random variable with finitely or countably many possible values, the Lebesgue theory of expectation is identical to the summation formulas given above. However, the Lebesgue theory clarifies the scope of the theory of probability density functions. A random variable is said to be &quot;absolutely continuous&quot; if any of the following conditions are satisfied:
* there is a nonnegative measurable function on the real line such that formula_23 for any Borel set , in which the integral is Lebesgue.
* the cumulative distribution function of is absolutely continuous.
* for any Borel set of real numbers with Lebesgue measure equal to zero, the probability of being valued in is also equal to zero
* for any positive number there is a positive number such that: if is a Borel set with Lebesgue measure less than , then the probability of being valued in is less than .
These conditions are all equivalent, although this is nontrivial to establish. In this definition, is called the &quot;probability density function&quot; of (relative to Lebesgue measure). According to the change-of-variables formula for Lebesgue integration, combined with the law of the unconscious statistician, it follows that
formula_24
for any absolutely continuous random variable . The above discussion of continuous random variables is thus a special case of the general Lebesgue theory, due to the fact that every piecewise-continuous function is measurable.
The expected value of any real-valued random variable formula_5 can also be defined on the graph of its cumulative distribution function formula_26 by a nearby equality of areas. In fact, formula_27 with a real number formula_28 if and only if the two surfaces in the formula_29-formula_30-plane, described by
formula_31
respectively, have the same finite area, i.e. if
formula_32
and both improper Riemann integrals converge. Finally, this is equivalent to the representation

formula_33
also with convergent integrals.

===Infinite expected values===
Expected values as defined above are automatically finite numbers. However, in many cases it is fundamental to be able to consider expected values of . This is intuitive, for example, in the case of the St. Petersburg paradox, in which one considers a random variable with possible outcomes , with associated probabilities , for ranging over all positive integers. According to the summation formula in the case of random variables with countably many outcomes, one has
formula_34
It is natural to say that the expected value equals .

There is a rigorous mathematical theory underlying such ideas, which is often taken as part of the definition of the Lebesgue integral. The first fundamental observation is that, whichever of the above definitions are followed, any &quot;nonnegative&quot; random variable whatsoever can be given an unambiguous expected value; whenever absolute convergence fails, then the expected value can be defined as . The second fundamental observation is that any random variable can be written as the difference of two nonnegative random variables. Given a random variable , one defines the positive and negative parts by and . These are nonnegative random variables, and it can be directly checked that . Since and are both then defined as either nonnegative numbers or , it is then natural to define:
formula_35

According to this definition, exists and is finite if and only if and are both finite. Due to the formula , this is the case if and only if is finite, and this is equivalent to the absolute convergence conditions in the definitions above. As such, the present considerations do not define finite expected values in any cases not previously considered; they are only useful for infinite expectations.
* In the case of the St. Petersburg paradox, one has and so as desired.
* Suppose the random variable takes values with respective probabilities . Then it follows that takes value with probability for each positive integer , and takes value with remaining probability. Similarly, takes value with probability for each positive integer and takes value with remaining probability. Using the definition for non-negative random variables, one can show that both and (see Harmonic series). Hence, in this case the expectation of is undefined.
* Similarly, the Cauchy distribution, as discussed above, has undefined expectation.

==Expected values of common distributions==
The following table gives the expected values of some commonly occurring probability distributions. The third column gives the expected values both in the form immediately given by the definition, as well as in the simplified form obtained by computation therefrom. The details of these computations, which are not always straightforward, can be found in the indicated references.
==Properties==
The basic properties below (and their names in bold) replicate or follow immediately from those of Lebesgue integral. Note that the letters &quot;a.s.&quot; stand for &quot;almost surely&quot;—a central property of the Lebesgue integral. Basically, one says that an inequality like formula_36 is true almost surely, when the probability measure attributes zero-mass to the complementary event formula_37
* Non-negativity: If formula_36 (a.s.), then formula_39
* of expectation: The expected value operator (or &quot;expectation operator&quot;) formula_40 is linear in the sense that, for any random variables formula_5 and formula_42 and a constant formula_43 formula_44 whenever the right-hand side is well-defined. By induction, this means that the expected value of the sum of any finite number of random variables is the sum of the expected values of the individual random variables, and the expected value scales linearly with a multiplicative constant. Symbolically, for formula_45 random variables formula_46 and constants formula_47 we have formula_48 If we think of the set of random variables with finite expected value as forming a vector space, then the linearity of expectation implies that the expected value is a linear form on this vector space.
* Monotonicity: If formula_49 (a.s.), and both formula_50 and formula_51 exist, then formula_52 Proof follows from the linearity and the non-negativity property for formula_53 since formula_54 (a.s.).
* Non-degeneracy: If formula_55 then formula_56 (a.s.).
* If formula_57 (a.s.), then formula_58 In other words, if X and Y are random variables that take different values with probability zero, then the expectation of X will equal the expectation of Y.
* If formula_59 (a.s.) for some real number , then formula_60 In particular, for a random variable formula_5 with well-defined expectation, formula_62 A well defined expectation implies that there is one number, or rather, one constant that defines the expected value. Thus follows that the expectation of this constant is just the original expected value.
* As a consequence of the formula as discussed above, together with the triangle inequality, it follows that for any random variable formula_5 with well-defined expectation, one has formula_64
* Let denote the indicator function of an event , then is given by the probability of . This is nothing but a different way of stating the expectation of a Bernoulli random variable, as calculated in the table above.
* Formulas in terms of CDF: If formula_65 is the cumulative distribution function of a random variable , then formula_66 where the values on both sides are well defined or not well defined simultaneously, and the integral is taken in the sense of Lebesgue-Stieltjes. As a consequence of integration by parts as applied to this representation of , it can be proved that formula_67 with the integrals taken in the sense of Lebesgue. As a special case, for any random variable valued in the nonnegative integers , one has formula_68 where denotes the underlying probability measure.
* Non-multiplicativity: In general, the expected value is not multiplicative, i.e. formula_69 is not necessarily equal to formula_70 If formula_5 and formula_72 are independent, then one can show that formula_73 If the random variables are dependent, then generally formula_74 although in special cases of dependency the equality may hold.
* Law of the unconscious statistician: The expected value of a measurable function of formula_75 formula_76 given that formula_5 has a probability density function formula_78 is given by the inner product of formula_79 and formula_80: formula_81 This formula also holds in multidimensional case, when formula_80 is a function of several random variables, and formula_79 is their joint density.

=== Inequalities===
Concentration inequalities control the likelihood of a random variable taking on large values. Markov&#x27;s inequality is among the best-known and simplest to prove: for a &quot;nonnegative&quot; random variable and any positive number , it states that formula_84

If is any random variable with finite expectation, then Markov&#x27;s inequality may be applied to the random variable to obtain Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality formula_85
where is the variance. These inequalities are significant for their nearly complete lack of conditional assumptions. For example, for any random variable with finite expectation, the Chebyshev inequality implies that there is at least a 75% probability of an outcome being within two standard deviations of the expected value. However, in special cases the Markov and Chebyshev inequalities often give much weaker information than is otherwise available. For example, in the case of an unweighted dice, Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality says that odds of rolling between 1 and 6 is at least 53%; in reality, the odds are of course 100%. The Kolmogorov inequality extends the Chebyshev inequality to the context of sums of random variables.

The following three inequalities are of fundamental importance in the field of mathematical analysis and its applications to probability theory.
* Jensen&#x27;s inequality: Let be a convex function and a random variable with finite expectation. Then formula_86 Part of the assertion is that the negative part of has finite expectation, so that the right-hand side is well-defined (possibly infinite). Convexity of can be phrased as saying that the output of the weighted average of &quot;two&quot; inputs under-estimates the same weighted average of the two outputs; Jensen&#x27;s inequality extends this to the setting of completely general weighted averages, as represented by the expectation. In the special case that for positive numbers , one obtains the Lyapunov inequality formula_87 This can also be proved by the Hölder inequality. In measure theory, this is particularly notable for proving the inclusion of , in the special case of probability spaces.
* Hölder&#x27;s inequality: if and are numbers satisfying , then formula_88 for any random variables and . The special case of is called the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, and is particularly well-known.
* Minkowski inequality: given any number , for any random variables and with and both finite, it follows that is also finite and formula_89
The Hölder and Minkowski inequalities can be extended to general measure spaces, and are often given in that context. By contrast, the Jensen inequality is special to the case of probability spaces.

===Expectations under convergence of random variables===
In general, it is not the case that formula_90 even if formula_91 pointwise. Thus, one cannot interchange limits and expectation, without additional conditions on the random variables. To see this, let formula_92 be a random variable distributed uniformly on formula_93 For formula_94 define a sequence of random variables
formula_95
with formula_96 being the indicator function of the event formula_97 Then, it follows that formula_98 pointwise. But, formula_99 for each formula_100 Hence, formula_101

Analogously, for general sequence of random variables formula_102 the expected value operator is not formula_103-additive, i.e.
formula_104

An example is easily obtained by setting formula_105 and formula_106 for formula_107 where formula_108 is as in the previous example.

A number of convergence results specify exact conditions which allow one to interchange limits and expectations, as specified below.
* Monotone convergence theorem: Let formula_109 be a sequence of random variables, with formula_110 (a.s) for each formula_111 Furthermore, let formula_112 pointwise. Then, the monotone convergence theorem states that formula_113 Using the monotone convergence theorem, one can show that expectation indeed satisfies countable additivity for non-negative random variables. In particular, let formula_114 be non-negative random variables. It follows from the monotone convergence theorem that formula_115
* Fatou&#x27;s lemma: Let formula_116 be a sequence of non-negative random variables. Fatou&#x27;s lemma states that formula_117 Corollary. Let formula_118 with formula_119 for all formula_111 If formula_112 (a.s), then formula_122 Proof is by observing that formula_123 (a.s.) and applying Fatou&#x27;s lemma.
* Dominated convergence theorem: Let formula_124 be a sequence of random variables. If formula_91 pointwise (a.s.), formula_126 (a.s.), and formula_127 Then, according to the dominated convergence theorem,
** formula_128;
** formula_129
** formula_130
* Uniform integrability: In some cases, the equality formula_131 holds when the sequence formula_132 is &quot;uniformly integrable.&quot;

===Relationship with characteristic function===
The probability density function formula_133 of a scalar random variable formula_5 is related to its characteristic function formula_135 by the inversion formula:
formula_136

For the expected value of formula_137 (where formula_138 is a Borel function), we can use this inversion formula to obtain
formula_139

If formula_140 is finite, changing the order of integration, we get, in accordance with Fubini–Tonelli theorem,
formula_141
where
formula_142
is the Fourier transform of formula_143 The expression for formula_140 also follows directly from the Plancherel theorem.

==Uses and applications==
The expectation of a random variable plays an important role in a variety of contexts.

In statistics, where one seeks estimates for unknown parameters based on available data gained from samples, the sample mean serves as an estimate for the expectation, and is itself a random variable. In such settings, the sample mean is considered to meet the desirable criterion for a &quot;good&quot; estimator in being unbiased; that is, the expected value of the estimate is equal to the true value of the underlying parameter. 

For a different example, in decision theory, an agent making an optimal choice in the context of incomplete information is often assumed to maximize the expected value of their utility function.

It is possible to construct an expected value equal to the probability of an event by taking the expectation of an indicator function that is one if the event has occurred and zero otherwise. This relationship can be used to translate properties of expected values into properties of probabilities, e.g. using the law of large numbers to justify estimating probabilities by frequencies.

The expected values of the powers of &quot;X&quot; are called the moments of &quot;X&quot;; the moments about the mean of &quot;X&quot; are expected values of powers of . The moments of some random variables can be used to specify their distributions, via their moment generating functions.

To empirically estimate the expected value of a random variable, one repeatedly measures observations of the variable and computes the arithmetic mean of the results. If the expected value exists, this procedure estimates the true expected value in an unbiased manner and has the property of minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (the sum of the squared differences between the observations and the estimate). The law of large numbers demonstrates (under fairly mild conditions) that, as the size of the sample gets larger, the variance of this estimate gets smaller.

This property is often exploited in a wide variety of applications, including general problems of statistical estimation and machine learning, to estimate (probabilistic) quantities of interest via Monte Carlo methods, since most quantities of interest can be written in terms of expectation, e.g. formula_145 where formula_146 is the indicator function of the set formula_147
In classical mechanics, the center of mass is an analogous concept to expectation. For example, suppose &quot;X&quot; is a discrete random variable with values &quot;xi&quot; and corresponding probabilities &quot;pi.&quot; Now consider a weightless rod on which are placed weights, at locations &quot;xi&quot; along the rod and having masses &quot;pi&quot; (whose sum is one). The point at which the rod balances is E[&quot;X&quot;].

Expected values can also be used to compute the variance, by means of the computational formula for the variance
formula_148

A very important application of the expectation value is in the field of quantum mechanics. The expectation value of a quantum mechanical operator formula_149 operating on a quantum state vector formula_150 is written as formula_151 The uncertainty in formula_149 can be calculated by the formula formula_153.
