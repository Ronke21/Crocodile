<text>The European Economic Community (EEC) was a regional organisation created by the Treaty of Rome of 1957, aiming to foster economic integration among its member states. It was subsequently renamed the European Community (EC) upon becoming integrated into the first pillar of the newly formed European Union (EU) in 1993. In the popular language, the singular &quot;European Community&quot; was sometimes inaccurately used in the wider sense of the plural &quot;European Communities&quot;, in spite of the latter designation covering all the three constituent entities of the first pillar. The EEC was also known as the European Common Market (ECM) in the English-speaking countries, and sometimes referred to as the European Community even before it was officially renamed as such in 1993. In 2009, the EC formally ceased to exist and its institutions were directly absorbed by the EU. This made the Union the formal successor institution of the Community.

The Community&#x27;s initial aim was to bring about economic integration, including a common market and customs union, among its six founding members: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. It gained a common set of institutions along with the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) as one of the European Communities under the 1965 Merger Treaty (Treaty of Brussels). In 1993 a complete single market was achieved, known as the internal market, which allowed for the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within the EEC. In 1994 the internal market was formalised by the EEA agreement. This agreement also extended the internal market to include most of the member states of the European Free Trade Association, forming the European Economic Area, which encompasses 15 countries.

Upon the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, the EEC was renamed the European Community to reflect that it covered a wider range than economic policy. This was also when the three European Communities, including the EC, were collectively made to constitute the first of the three pillars of the European Union, which the treaty also founded. The EC existed in this form until it was abolished by the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon, which incorporated the EC&#x27;s institutions into the EU&#x27;s wider framework and provided that the EU would &quot;replace and succeed the European Community&quot;.

==History==
===Background===
In April 1951, the Treaty of Paris was signed, creating the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). This was an international community based on supranationalism and international law, designed to help the economy of Europe and prevent future war by integrating its members.

With the aim of creating a federal Europe two further communities were proposed: a European Defence Community and a European Political Community. While the treaty for the latter was being drawn up by the Common Assembly, the ECSC parliamentary chamber, the proposed defence community was rejected by the French Parliament. ECSC President Jean Monnet, a leading figure behind the communities, resigned from the High Authority in protest and began work on alternative communities, based on economic integration rather than political integration. Following the Messina Conference in 1955, Paul-Henri Spaak was given the task to prepare a report on the idea of a customs union. The so-called Spaak Report of the Spaak Committee formed the cornerstone of the intergovernmental negotiations at Val Duchesse conference centre in 1956. Together with the Ohlin Report the Spaak Report would provide the basis for the Treaty of Rome.

In 1956, Paul-Henri Spaak led the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at the Val Duchesse conference centre, which prepared for the Treaty of Rome in 1957. The conference led to the signature, on 25 March 1957, of the Treaty of Rome establishing a European Economic Community.

===Creation and early years===
The resulting communities were the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM or sometimes EAEC). These were markedly less supranational than the previous communities, due to protests from some countries that their sovereignty was being infringed (however there would still be concerns with the behaviour of the Hallstein Commission). Germany became a founding member of the EEC, and Konrad Adenauer was made leader in a very short time. The first formal meeting of the Hallstein Commission was held on 16 January 1958 at the Chateau de Val-Duchesse. The EEC (direct ancestor of the modern Community) was to create a customs union while Euratom would promote co-operation in the nuclear power sphere. The EEC rapidly became the most important of these and expanded its activities. The first move towards political developments came at the end of 1959 when the foreign ministers of the six members announced that would be meeting quarterly to discuss political issues and international problems. One of the first important accomplishments of the EEC was the establishment (1962) of common price levels for agricultural products. In 1968, internal tariffs (tariffs on trade between member nations) were removed on certain products.
Another crisis was triggered in regard to proposals for the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, which came into force in 1962. The transitional period whereby decisions were made by unanimity had come to an end, and majority-voting in the council had taken effect. Then-French President Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s opposition to supranationalism and fear of the other members challenging the CAP led to an &quot;empty chair policy&quot; whereby French representatives were withdrawn from the European institutions until the French veto was reinstated. Eventually, a compromise was reached with the Luxembourg compromise on 29 January 1966 whereby a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement permitted members to use a veto on areas of national interest.

On 1 July 1967, when the Merger Treaty came into operation, combining the institutions of the ECSC and Euratom into that of the EEC, they already shared a Parliamentary Assembly and Courts. Collectively they were known as the &quot;European Communities&quot;. The Communities still had independent personalities although were increasingly integrated. Future treaties granted the community new powers beyond simple economic matters which had achieved a high level of integration. As it got closer to the goal of political integration and a peaceful and united Europe, what Mikhail Gorbachev described as a &quot;Common European Home&quot;.

===Enlargement and elections===
The 1960s saw the first attempts at enlargement. In 1961, Denmark, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Norway (in 1962), applied to join the three Communities. However, President Charles de Gaulle saw British membership as a Trojan Horse for U.S. influence and vetoed membership, and the applications of all four countries were suspended. Greece became the first country to join the EC in 1961 as an associate member, however its membership was suspended in 1967 after a coup d&#x27;Ã©tat established a military dictatorship called the Regime of the Colonels.

A year later, in February 1962, Spain attempted to join the European Community. However, because Francoist Spain was not a democracy, all members rejected the request in 1964.

The four countries resubmitted their applications on 11 May 1967 and with Georges Pompidou succeeding Charles de Gaulle as French president in 1969, the veto was lifted. Negotiations began in 1970 under the pro-European UK government of Edward Heath, who had to deal with disagreements relating to the Common Agricultural Policy and the UK&#x27;s relationship with the Commonwealth of Nations. Nevertheless, two years later the accession treaties were signed so that Denmark, Ireland and the UK joined the Community effective 1 January 1973. The Norwegian people had rejected membership in a referendum on 25 September 1972.

The Treaties of Rome had stated that the European Parliament must be directly elected, however this required the Council to agree on a common voting system first. The Council procrastinated on the issue and the Parliament remained appointed, French President Charles de Gaulle was particularly active in blocking the development of the Parliament, with it only being granted Budgetary powers following his resignation.

Parliament pressured for agreement and on 20 September 1976 the Council agreed part of the necessary instruments for election, deferring details on electoral systems which remain varied to this day. During the tenure of President Jenkins, in June 1979, the elections were held in all the then-members (see 1979 European Parliament election). The new Parliament, galvanised by direct election and new powers, started working full-time and became more active than the previous assemblies.

Shortly after its election, the Parliament proposed that the Community adopt the flag of Europe design used by the Council of Europe. The European Council in 1984 appointed an &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee for this purpose. The European Council in 1985 largely followed the committee&#x27;s recommendations, but as the adoption of a flag was strongly reminiscent of a national flag representing statehood, was controversial, the &quot;flag of Europe&quot; design was adopted only with the status of a &quot;logo&quot; or &quot;emblem&quot;.

The European Council, or European summit, had developed since the 1960s as an informal meeting of the Council at the level of heads of state. It had originated from then-French President Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (e.g. the commission) over the integration process. It was mentioned in the treaties for the first time in the Single European Act (see below).

===Toward Maastricht===
Greece re-applied to join the community on 12 June 1975, following the restoration of democracy, and joined on 1 January 1981. Following on from Greece, and after their own democratic restoration, Spain and Portugal applied to the communities in 1977 and joined on 1 January 1986. In 1987, Turkey formally applied to join the Community and began the longest application process for any country.

With the prospect of further enlargement, and a desire to increase areas of co-operation, the Single European Act was signed by the foreign ministers on 17 and 28 February 1986 in Luxembourg and The Hague respectively. In a single document it dealt with reform of institutions, extension of powers, foreign policy cooperation and the single market. It came into force on 1 July 1987. The act was followed by work on what would be the Maastricht Treaty, which was agreed on 10 December 1991, signed the following year and coming into force on 1 November 1993 establishing the European Union, and paving the way for the European Monetary Union.

===European Community===

The EU absorbed the European Communities as one of its three pillars. The EEC&#x27;s areas of activities were enlarged and were renamed the &quot;European Community&quot;, continuing to follow the supranational structure of the EEC. The EEC institutions became those of the EU, however the Court, Parliament and Commission had only limited input in the new pillars, as they worked on a more intergovernmental system than the European Communities. This was reflected in the names of the institutions, the council was formally the &quot;Council of the &quot;European Union&quot;&quot; while the commission was formally the &quot;Commission of the &quot;European Communities&quot;&quot;.

There are more competencies listed in Article 3 of the European Communities pillar than there are in Article 3 of the Treaty of Rome. This is due to the fact that some competencies were already inherent in the Treaty of Tome, some were referred to in the Treaty of Rome, and some were extended under Article 235 of the Treaty of Rome. Competencies were added to cover trans-European networks, and the work of the Culture Committee and Education Committee that were previously sharing existing competencies. The only entry in Article 3 that represented something new is the competence covering the entry and movement of persons in the internal market.

However, after the Treaty of Maastricht, Parliament gained a more formal role. Maastricht brought in the codecision procedure, which gave it equal legislative power with the Council on Community matters. This replaced the informal parliamentary blocking powers established by the 1979 Isoglucose decision.

It also abolished any existing state like Simple Majority voting in the EEC, replacing it with Qualified Majority Voting, a procedure more commonly used in international organisations.

The Treaty of Amsterdam transferred responsibility for free movement of persons (e.g., visas, illegal immigration, asylum) from the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) pillar to the European Community (JHA was renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCC) as a result). Both Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice also extended codecision procedure to nearly all policy areas, giving Parliament equal power to the Council in the Community.

In 2002, the Treaty of Paris which established the ECSC expired, having reached its 50-year limit (as the first treaty, it was the only one with a limit). No attempt was made to renew its mandate; instead, the Treaty of Nice transferred certain of its elements to the Treaty of Rome and hence its work continued as part of the EC area of the European Community&#x27;s remit.

After the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 the pillar structure ceased to exist. The European Community, together with its legal personality, was absorbed into the newly consolidated European Union which merged in the other two pillars (however Euratom remained distinct). This was originally proposed under the European Constitution but that treaty failed ratification in 2005.

==Aims and achievements==

The main aim of the EEC, as stated in its preamble, was to &quot;preserve peace and liberty and to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe&quot;. Calling for balanced economic growth, this was to be accomplished through:

# The establishment of a customs union with a common external tariff
# Common policies for agriculture, transport and trade, including standardization (for example, the CE marking designates standards compliance)
# Enlargement of the EEC to the rest of Europe

Citing Article 2 from the original text of the Treaty of Rome of 25 March 1957, the EEC aimed at &quot;a harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expansion, an increase in stability, an accelerated raising of the standard of living and closer relations between the States belonging to it&quot;. Given the fear of the Cold War, many Western Europeans were afraid that poverty would make &quot;the population vulnerable to communist propaganda&quot; (Meurs 2018, p.Â 68), meaning that increasing prosperity would be beneficial to harmonise power between the Western and Eastern blocs, other than reconcile Member States such as France and Germany after WW2. 

The tasks entrusted to the Community were divided among an assembly, the European Parliament, Council, Commission, and Court of Justice. Moreover, restrictions to market were lifted to further liberate trade among Member States. Citizens of Member States (other than goods, services, and capital) were entitled to freedom of movement. The CAP, Common Agricultural Policy, regulated and subsided the agricultural sphere. A European Social Fund was implemented in favour of employees who lost their jobs. A European Investment Bank was established to &quot;facilitate the economic expansion of the Community by opening up fresh resources&quot; (Art. 3 Treaty of Rome 25 March 1957). All these implementations included overseas territories. Competition was to be kept alive to make products cheaper for European consumers.

For the customs union, the treaty provided for a 10% reduction in custom duties and up to 20% of global import quotas. Progress on the customs union proceeded much faster than the twelve years planned. However, France faced some setbacks due to their war with Algeria.

==Members==
The six states that founded the EEC and the other two Communities were known as the &quot;inner six&quot; (the &quot;outer seven&quot; were those countries who formed the European Free Trade Association). The six were France, West Germany, Italy and the three Benelux countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The first enlargement was in 1973, with the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Greece, Spain and Portugal joined in the 1980s. The former East Germany became part of the EEC upon German reunification in 1990. Following the creation of the EU in 1993, it has enlarged to include an additional sixteen countries by 2013.

Member states are represented in some form in each institution. The Council is also composed of one national minister who represents their national government. Each state also has a right to one European Commissioner each, although in the European Commission they are not supposed to represent their national interest but that of the Community. Prior to 2004, the larger members (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) have had two Commissioners. In the European Parliament, members are allocated a set number seats related to their population, however these (since 1979) have been directly elected and they sit according to political allegiance, not national origin. Most other institutions, including the European Court of Justice, have some form of national division of its members.

==Institutions==

There were three political institutions which held the executive and legislative power of the EEC, plus one judicial institution and a fifth body created in 1975. These institutions (except for the auditors) were created in 1957 by the EEC but from 1967 onwards they applied to all three Communities. The Council represents the member state governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest. Essentially, the council, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the council for approval and the Parliament for an opinion (in some cases it had a veto, depending upon the legislative procedure in use). The commission&#x27;s duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply. After the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, these institutions became those of the European Union, though limited in some areas due to the pillar structure. Despite this, Parliament in particular has gained more power over legislation and security of the commission. The Court of Justice was the highest authority in the law, settling legal disputes in the Community, while the Auditors had no power but to investigate.

===Background===

The EEC inherited some of the Institutions of the ECSC in that the Common Assembly and Court of Justice of the ECSC had their authority extended to the EEC and Euratom in the same role. However the EEC, and Euratom, had different executive bodies to the ECSC. In place of the ECSC&#x27;s Council of Ministers was the Council of the European Economic Community, and in place of the High Authority was the Commission of the European Communities.

There was greater difference between these than name: the French government of the day had grown suspicious of the supranational power of the High Authority and sought to curb its powers in favour of the intergovernmental style Council. Hence the council had a greater executive role in the running of the EEC than was the situation in the ECSC. By virtue of the Merger Treaty in 1967, the executives of the ECSC and Euratom were merged with that of the EEC, creating a single institutional structure governing the three separate Communities. From here on, the term &quot;European Communities&quot; were used for the institutions (for example, from &quot;Commission of the European Economic Community&quot; to the &quot;Commission of the European Communities&quot;).

===Council===
The Council of the European Communities was a body holding legislative and executive powers and was thus the main decision-making body of the Community. Its Presidency rotated between the member states every six months and it is related to the European Council, which was an informal gathering of national leaders (started in 1961) on the same basis as the council.

The council was composed of one national minister from each member state. However the Council met in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture was being discussed, the council would be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represented their governments and were accountable to their national political systems. Votes were taken either by majority (with votes allocated according to population) or unanimity. In these various forms they share some legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament. Since the 1960s the council also began to meet informally at the level of heads of government and heads of state; these European summits followed the same presidency system and secretariat as the council but was not a formal formation of it.

===Commission===
The Commission of the European Communities was the executive arm of the community, drafting Community law, dealing with the day to running of the Community and upholding the treaties. It was designed to be independent, representing the interest of the Community as a whole. Every member state submitted one commissioner (two from each of the larger states, one from the smaller states). One of its members was the President, appointed by the council, who chaired the body and represented it.

===Parliament===

Under the Community, the European Parliament (formerly the European Parliamentary Assembly) had an advisory role to the Council and Commission. There were a number of Community legislative procedures, at first there was only the consultation procedure, which meant Parliament had to be consulted, although it was often ignored. The Single European Act gave Parliament more power, with the assent procedure giving it a right to veto proposals and the cooperation procedure giving it equal power with the Council if the council was not unanimous.

In 1970 and 1975, the Budgetary treaties gave Parliament power over the Community budget. The Parliament&#x27;s members, up-until 1980 were national MPs serving part-time in the Parliament. The Treaties of Rome had required elections to be held once the council had decided on a voting system, but this did not happen and elections were delayed until 1979 (see 1979 European Parliament election). After that, Parliament was elected every five years. In the following 20 years, it gradually won co-decision powers with the Council over the adoption of legislation, the right to approve or reject the appointment of the Commission President and the commission as a whole, and the right to approve or reject international agreements entered into by the Community.

===Court===
The Court of Justice of the European Communities was the highest court of on matters of Community law and was composed of one judge per state with a president elected from among them. Its role was to ensure that Community law was applied in the same way across all states and to settle legal disputes between institutions or states. It became a powerful institution as Community law overrides national law.

===Auditors===
The fifth institution is the &quot;European Court of Auditors&quot;. Its ensured that taxpayer funds from the Community budget had been correctly spent by the Community&#x27;s institutions. The ECA provided an audit report for each financial year to the Council and Parliament and gave opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions. It is the only institution not mentioned in the original treaties, having been set up in 1975.

<text>The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is a regional trade organization and free trade area consisting of four European states: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The organization operates in parallel with the European Union (EU), and all four member states participate in the European single market and are part of the Schengen Area. They are not, however, party to the European Union Customs Union.

EFTA was historically one of the two dominant western European trade blocs, but is now much smaller and closely associated with its historical competitor, the European Union. It was established on 3 May 1960 to serve as an alternative trade bloc for those European states that were unable or unwilling to join the then European Economic Community (EEC), the main predecessor of the EU. The Stockholm Convention (1960), to establish the EFTA, was signed on 4 January 1960 in the Swedish capital by seven countries (known as the &quot;Outer Seven&quot;: Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). A revised Convention, the Vaduz Convention, was signed on 21 June 2001 and entered into force on 1 June 2002.

After 1995 only two founding members remained, namely Norway and Switzerland. The other five, Austria, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, had joined the EU at some point in the intervening years. The initial Stockholm Convention was superseded by the Vaduz Convention, which aimed to provide a successful framework for continuing the expansion and liberalization of trade, both among the organization&#x27;s member states and with the rest of the world.

While the EFTA is not a customs union and member states have full rights to enter into bilateral third-country trade arrangements, it does have a coordinated trade policy. As a result, its member states have jointly concluded free trade agreements with the EU and a number of other countries. To participate in the EU&#x27;s single market, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway are parties to the Agreement on a European Economic Area (EEA), with compliances regulated by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court. Switzerland has a set of multilateral agreements with the EU and its member states instead.

===History===

On 12 January 1960, the Convention establishing the European Free Trade Association was initiated in the Golden Hall of the Stockholm City Hall. This established the progressive elimination of customs duties on industrial products, but did not affect agricultural or fisheries products.

The main difference between the early EEC and the EFTA was that the latter did not operate common external customs tariffs unlike the former: each EFTA member was free to establish its individual customs duties against, or its individual free trade agreements with, non-EFTA countries.

The founding members of the EFTA were: Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. During the 1960s, these countries were often referred to as the &quot;Outer Seven&quot;, as opposed to the Inner Six of the then European Economic Community (EEC).

Finland became an associate member in 1961 and a full member in 1986, and Iceland joined in 1970. The United Kingdom and Denmark joined the EEC in 1973 and hence ceased to be EFTA members. Portugal also left EFTA for the European Community in 1986. Liechtenstein joined the EFTA in 1991 (previously its interests had been represented by Switzerland). Austria, Sweden, and Finland joined the EU in 1995 and thus ceased to be EFTA members.

Twice, in 1972 and in 1994, the Norwegian government had tried to join the EU (still the EEC, in 1973) and by doing so, leave the EFTA. However, both the times, the membership of the EU was rejected in national referendums, keeping Norway in the EFTA. Iceland applied for EU membership in 2009 due to the 2008â2011 Icelandic financial crisis, but has since dropped its bid.

===Other negotiations===
Between 1994 and 2011, EFTA memberships for Andorra, San Marino, Monaco, the Isle of Man, Turkey, Israel, Morocco, and other European Neighbourhood Policy partners were discussed.

====Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino====
In November 2012, after the Council of the European Union had called for an evaluation of the EU&#x27;s relations with Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino, which they described as &quot;fragmented&quot;, the European Commission published a report outlining the options for their further integration into the EU. Unlike Liechtenstein, which is a member of the EEA via the EFTA and the Schengen Agreement, relations with these three states are based on a collection of agreements covering specific issues. The report examined four alternatives to the current situation: 
# A Sectoral Approach with separate agreements with each state covering an entire policy area. 
# A comprehensive, multilateral Framework Association Agreement (FAA) with the three states. 
# EEA membership, and 
# EU membership. 
However, the Commission argued that the sectoral approach did not address the major issues and was still needlessly complicated, while EU membership was dismissed in the near future because &quot;the EU institutions are currently not adapted to the accession of such small-sized countries&quot;. The remaining options, EEA membership and a FAA with the states, were found to be viable and were recommended by the commission. In response, the Council requested that negotiations with the three microstates on further integration continue, and that a report be prepared by the end of 2013 detailing the implications of the two viable alternatives and recommendations on how to proceed.

As EEA membership is currently only open to EFTA or EU member states, the consent of existing EFTA member states is required for the microstates to join the EEA without becoming members of the EU. In 2011, Jonas Gahr StÃ¸re, then Foreign Minister of Norway which is an EFTA member state, said that EFTA/EEA membership for the microstates was not the appropriate mechanism for their integration into the internal market due to their different requirements from those of larger countries such as Norway, and suggested that a simplified association would be better suited for them. Espen Barth Eide, StÃ¸re&#x27;s successor, responded to the commission&#x27;s report in late 2012 by questioning whether the microstates have sufficient administrative capabilities to meet the obligations of EEA membership. However, he stated that Norway would be open to the possibility of EFTA membership for the microstates if they decided to submit an application, and that the country had not made a final decision on the matter. Pascal Schafhauser, the Counsellor of the Liechtenstein Mission to the EU, said that Liechtenstein, another EFTA member state, was willing to discuss EEA membership for the microstates provided their joining did not impede the functioning of the organization. However, he suggested that the option of direct membership in the EEA for the microstates, outside of both the EFTA and the EU, should be considered. On 18 November 2013, the EU Commission concluded that &quot;the participation of the small-sized countries in the EEA is not judged to be a viable option at present due to the political and institutional reasons&quot;, and that Association Agreements were a more feasible mechanism to integrate the microstates into the internal market.

====Norway====
The Norwegian electorate had rejected treaties of accession to the EU in two referendums. At the time of the first referendum in 1972, their neighbour, Denmark joined. Since the second referendum in 1994, two other Nordic neighbours, Sweden and Finland, have joined the EU. The last two governments of Norway have not advanced the question, as they have both been coalition governments consisting of proponents and opponents of EU membership.

====Switzerland====
Since Switzerland rejected the EEA membership in a referendum in 1992, more referendums on EU membership have been initiated, the last time being in 2001. These were all rejected. Switzerland has been in a customs union with fellow EFTA member state and neighbour Liechtenstein since 1924.

====Iceland====
On 16 July 2009, the government of Iceland formally applied for EU membership, but the negotiation process was suspended in mid-2013, and in 2015 the foreign ministers wrote to withdraw its application.

====Faroe Islands (Kingdom of Denmark)====

Denmark was a founding member of EFTA in 1960, but its membership ended in 1973, when it joined the European Communities. The autonomous territories of the Kingdom of Denmark were covered by Denmark&#x27;s EFTA membership: Greenland from 1961 and the Faroe Islands from 1968. In mid-2005, representatives of the Faroe Islands raised the possibility of their territory re-joining the EFTA. Because Article 56 of the EFTA Convention only allows sovereign states to become members of the EFTA, the Faroes considered the possibility that the &quot;Kingdom of Denmark in respect of the Faroes&quot; could join the EFTA on their behalf. The Danish Government has stated that this mechanism would not allow the Faroes to become a member of the EEA because Denmark was already a party to the EEA Agreement.

The Faroes already have an extensive bilateral free trade agreement with Iceland, known as the HoyvÃ­k Agreement.

====United Kingdom====

The United Kingdom was a co-founder of EFTA in 1960, but ceased to be a member upon joining the European Economic Community. The country held a referendum in 2016 on withdrawing from the EU (popularly referred to as &quot;Brexit&quot;), resulting in a 51.9% vote in favour of withdrawing. A 2013 research paper presented to the Parliament of the United Kingdom proposed a number of alternatives to EU membership which would continue to allow it access to the EU&#x27;s internal market, including continuing EEA membership as an EFTA member state, or the Swiss model of a number of bilateral treaties covering the provisions of the single market.

In the first meeting since the Brexit vote, EFTA reacted by saying both that they were open to a UK return, and that Britain has many issues to work through. The president of Switzerland Johann Schneider-Ammann stated that its return would strengthen the association. However, in August 2016 the Norwegian Government expressed reservations. Norway&#x27;s European affairs minister, Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, told the &quot;Aftenposten&quot; newspaper: &quot;It&#x27;s not certain that it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organization. It would shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norway&#x27;s interests.&quot;

In late 2016, the Scottish First Minister said that her priority was to keep the whole of the UK in the European single market but that taking Scotland alone into the EEA was an option being &quot;looked at&quot;. However, other EFTA states have stated that only sovereign states are eligible for membership, so it could only join if it became independent from the UK, unless the solution scouted for the Faroes in 2005 were to be adopted (see above).

In early 2018, British MPs Antoinette Sandbach, Stephen Kinnock and Stephen Hammond called for the UK to rejoin EFTA.

==Relationship with the European Union: the European Economic Area==

In 1992, the EU, its member states, and the EFTA member states signed the Agreement on the European Economic Area in Porto, Portugal. However, the proposal that Switzerland ratify its participation was rejected by referendum. (Nevertheless, Switzerland has multiple bilateral treaties with the EU that allow it to participate in the European Single Market, the Schengen Agreement and other programmes). Thus, except for Switzerland, the EFTA members are also members of the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA comprises three member states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and 27 member states of the European Union (EU). It was established on 1 January 1994 following an agreement with the European Economic Community (which had become the European Community two months earlier). It allows the EFTA-EEA states to participate in the EU&#x27;s Internal Market without being members of the EU. They adopt almost all EU legislation related to the single market, except laws on agriculture and fisheries. However, they also contribute to and influence the formation of new EEA relevant policies and legislation at an early stage as part of a formal decision-shaping process. One EFTA member, Switzerland, has not joined the EEA but has a series of bilateral agreements, including a free trade agreement, with the EU.

The following table summarises the various components of EU laws applied in the EFTA countries and their sovereign territories. Some territories of EU member states also have a special status in regard to EU laws applied as is the case with some European microstates.

===EEA institutions===
A Joint Committee consisting of the EEA-EFTA States plus the European Commission (representing the EU) has the function of extending relevant EU law to the non-EU members. An EEA Council meets twice yearly to govern the overall relationship between the EEA members.

Rather than setting up pan-EEA institutions, the activities of the EEA are regulated by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court. The EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court regulate the activities of the EFTA members in respect of their obligations in the European Economic Area (EEA). Since Switzerland is not an EEA member, it does not participate in these institutions.

The EFTA Surveillance Authority performs a role for EFTA members that is equivalent to that of the European Commission for the EU, as &quot;guardian of the treaties&quot; and the EFTA Court performs the European Court of Justice-equivalent role.

The original plan for the EEA lacked the EFTA Court: the European Court of Justice was to exercise those roles. However, during the negotiations for the EEA agreement, the European Court of Justice ruled by the Opinion 1/91 that it would be a violation of the treaties to give to the EU institutions these powers with respect to non-EU member states. Therefore, the current arrangement was developed instead.

===EEA and Norway Grants===
The EEA and Norway Grants are the financial contributions of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to reduce social and economic disparities in Europe. They were established in conjunction with the 2004 enlargement of the European Economic Area (EEA), which brought together the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway in the Internal Market. In the period from 2004 to 2009, â¬1.3Â billion of project funding was made available for project funding in the 15 beneficiary states in Central and Southern Europe. The EEA and Norway Grants are administered by the Financial Mechanism Office, which is affiliated to the EFTA Secretariat in Brussels.

==International conventions==
EFTA also originated the Hallmarking Convention and the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention, both of which are open to non-EFTA states.

==International trade relations==
EFTA has 29 free trade agreements with non-EU countries as well as declarations on cooperation and joint workgroups to improve trade. Currently, the EFTA States have established preferential trade relations with 40 states and territories, in addition to the 27 member states of the European Union.

EFTA&#x27;s interactive Free Trade Map gives an overview of the partners worldwide.

==Travel policies==
===Free movement of people within EFTA and the EU/EEA===

EFTA member states&#x27; citizens enjoy freedom of movement in each other&#x27;s territories in accordance with the EFTA convention. EFTA &amp; EEA nationals also enjoy freedom of movement in the European Union (EU). EFTA nationals and EU citizens are not only visa-exempt but are legally entitled to enter and reside in each other&#x27;s countries. The Citizens&#x27; Rights Directive (also sometimes called the &quot;Free Movement Directive&quot;) defines the right of free movement for citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the three EFTA members Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein plus the member states of the EU. Switzerland, which is a member of EFTA but not of the EEA, is not bound by the Directive but rather has a separate multilateral agreement on free movement with the EU and its member states.

As a result, a citizen of an EFTA country can live and work in all the other EFTA countries and in all the EU countries, and a citizen of an EU country can live and work in all the EFTA countries (but for voting and working in sensitive fields, such as government / police / military, citizenship is often required, and non-citizens may not have the same rights to welfare and unemployment benefits as citizens).

==General secretaries==
==Portugal Fund==
The Portugal Fund came into operation in February 1977 when Portugal was still a member of EFTA. It was to provide funding for the development of Portugal after the Carnation Revolution and the consequential restoration of democracy and the decolonization of the country&#x27;s overseas possessions. This followed a period of economic sanctions by most of the international community, which left Portugal economically underdeveloped compared to the rest of the western Europe. When Portugal left EFTA in 1985 in order to join the EEC, the remaining EFTA members decided to continue the Portugal Fund so that Portugal would continue to benefit from it. The Fund originally took the form of a low-interest loan from the EFTA member states to the value of US$100 million. Repayment was originally to commence in 1988, however, EFTA then decided to postpone the start of repayments until 1998. The Portugal Fund was dissolved in January 2002.

<text>The European Parliament (EP) is one of the two legislative bodies of the European Union and one of its seven institutions. Together with the Council of the European Union (known as the Council and informally as the Council of Ministers), it adopts European legislation, following a proposal by the European Commission. The Parliament is composed of 720 members (MEPs), after the June 2024 European elections, from a previous 705 MEPs. It represents the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India), with an electorate of around 375Â million eligible voters in 2024.

Since 1979, the Parliament has been directly elected every five years by the citizens of the European Union through universal suffrage. Voter turnout in parliamentary elections decreased each time after 1979 until 2019, when voter turnout increased by eight percentage points, and rose above 50% for the first time since 1994. The voting age is 18 in all EU member states except for Malta, Belgium, Austria and Germany, where it is 16, and Greece, where it is 17.

The European Parliament has legislative power in that the adoption of EU legislation normally requires its approval, and that of the Council, in what amounts to a bicameral legislature. However, it does not formally possess the right of initiative (i.e. the right to formally initiate the legislative procedure) in the way that most national parliaments of the member states do, as the right of initiative is a prerogative of the European Commission. Nonetheless, the Parliament and the Council each have the right to request the Commission to initiate the legislative procedure and put forward a proposal.

The Parliament is, in protocol terms, the &quot;first institution&quot; of the European Union (mentioned first in its treaties and having ceremonial precedence over the other EU institutions), and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council (except on a few issues where special legislative procedures apply). It likewise has equal control over the EU budget. Ultimately, the European Commission, which serves as the executive branch of the EU, is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament can decide whether or not to approve the European Council&#x27;s nominee for President of the Commission, and is further tasked with approving (or rejecting) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the current Commission to resign by adopting a motion of censure.

The president of the European Parliament is the body&#x27;s speaker and presides over the multi-party chamber. The five largest political groups are the European People&#x27;s Party Group (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), Patriots for Europe (PfE), the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), and Renew Europe (Renew). The last EU-wide election was held in 2024.

The Parliament&#x27;s headquarters are officially in Strasbourg, France, and has its administrative offices in Luxembourg City. Plenary sessions are normally held in Strasbourg for four days a month, but sometimes there are additional sessions in Brussels, while the Parliament&#x27;s committee meetings are held primarily in Brussels, Belgium. In practice, the Parliament works three weeks per month in Brussels and one week (four days) in Strasbourg.
==History==
The Parliament, like the other EU institutions, was not designed in its current form when it first met on 10 September 1952. One of the oldest common institutions, it began as the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It was a consultative assembly of 78 appointed parliamentarians drawn from the national parliaments of member states, having no legislative powers. The change since its foundation was highlighted by Professor David Farrell of the University of Manchester: &quot;For much of its life, the European Parliament could have been justly labelled a &#x27;multi-lingual talking shop&#x27;.&quot;

Its development since its foundation shows how the European Union&#x27;s structures have evolved without a clear &#x27;master plan&#x27;. Tom Reid of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has said of the union that &quot;nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU&quot;. Even the Parliament&#x27;s three working locations, which have switched several times, are a result of various agreements or lack of agreements. Although most MEPs would prefer to be based just in Brussels, where it conducts the bulk of its work, at John Major&#x27;s 1992 Edinburgh summit, France engineered a treaty amendment whereby the European Parliament&#x27;s official seat is in Strasbourg.

===Consultative assembly===
The body was not mentioned in the original Schuman Declaration. It was assumed or hoped that difficulties with the British would be resolved to allow the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to perform legislative tasks. A separate Assembly was introduced during negotiations on the Treaty as an institution to counterbalance and monitor the executive while providing democratic legitimacy. The wording of the ECSC Treaty demonstrated leaders&#x27; desire for more than a normal consultative assembly by allowing for direct election and using the term &quot;representatives of the people&quot;. Its early importance was highlighted when the Assembly was given the task of drawing up the draft treaty to establish a European Political Community. By this document, the Ad Hoc Assembly was established on 13 September 1952 with extra members, but after the failure of the negotiated and proposed European Defence Community (French parliament veto), the project was dropped.

Instead, the European Economic Community and Euratom were established in 1958 by the Treaties of Rome. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the European Parliamentary Assembly. The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg City, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality. This is seen as the birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament&#x27;s 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.

The three communities merged their remaining organs as the European Communities in 1967, and the body&#x27;s name was changed to the current &quot;European Parliament&quot; in 1962. In 1970 the Parliament was granted power over areas of the Communities&#x27; budget, which were expanded to the whole budget in 1975. Under the Rome Treaties, the Parliament should have become elected. However, the Council was required to agree a uniform voting system beforehand, which it failed to do. The Parliament threatened to take the Council to the European Court of Justice; this led to a compromise whereby the Council would agree to elections, but with each Member State using its own electoral system, leaving the issue of a uniform voting systems to be decided at a later date.

For its sessions the assembly, and later the parliament, until 1999 convened in the same premises as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe: the House of Europe until 1977, and the Palace of Europe until 1999.

===Elected Parliament===
In 1979, its members were directly elected for the first time. This sets it apart from similar institutions such as those of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe or Pan-African Parliament which are appointed. After that first election, the parliament held its first session on 17 July 1979, electing Simone Veil MEP as its president. Veil was also the first female president of the Parliament since it was formed as the Common Assembly.

As an elected body, the Parliament began to draft proposals addressing the functioning of the EU. For example, in 1984, inspired by its previous work on the Political Community, it drafted the &quot;draft Treaty establishing the European Union&quot; (also known as the &#x27;Spinelli Plan&#x27; after its rapporteur Altiero Spinelli MEP). Although it was not adopted, many ideas were later taken up in other treaties. Furthermore, the Parliament began holding votes on proposed Commission Presidents from the 1980s, before it was given any formal right to veto their appointment.

Since it became an elected body, the membership of the European Parliament has expanded when new nations have joined (the membership was also adjusted upwards in 1994 after German reunification). Following this, the Treaty of Nice imposed a cap on the number of members to be elected: 732, later raised to 751 by the Treaty of Lisbon.

Like the other institutions, the Parliament&#x27;s seat was not yet fixed. The provisional arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution&#x27;s locations are a source of contention.

The Parliament gained more powers from successive revisions of the EU treaties, notably through the extension of the ordinary legislative procedure (originally called the codecision procedure), and the right to approve international agreements through the consent procedure.

In 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, in the face of an impending censure from the Parliament.

===Commission accountability to the Parliament===

The Parliament had always had the right to dismiss the European Commission in a vote of censure, but it initially had no role in its appointment. In the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht, the Member States gave the Parliament the right to approve or reject an incoming Commission. In the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam, they gave it the right to approve or reject an incoming President of the Commission.

In 2004, following the largest trans-national election in history, the European Council proposed as Commission President a candidate, JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, from the largest political party (the EPP). The Parliament approved him by 431 votes to 251. However, when it came to the vote on the Commission as a whole, MEPs raised doubts about some of the nominees following their performance in the public hearings of them conducted by Parliament&#x27;s committees. Most notably, the Civil Liberties committee rejected Rocco Buttiglione for the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That was the first time the Parliament had ever opposed an incoming Commissioner and, despite Barroso&#x27;s initial insistence upon Buttiglione, the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament voted to allow the Barroso Commission to take office.

The Parliament also became more assertive in amending legislative proposals put forward by the European Commission. A notable example was on the Bolkestein directive in 2006, when the Parliament voted by a large majority for over 400 amendments that changed the fundamental principle of the law. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; described it in the following terms:

In 2007, for the first time, Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini included Parliament in talks on the second Schengen Information System even though, in this field at the time, MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated he would like to include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they were due to gain in 2009 as part of the Treaty of Lisbon.

===Recent history===
Between 2007 and 2009, a special working group on parliamentary reform implemented a series of changes to modernise the institution such as more speaking time for rapporteurs, increased committee co-operation and other efficiency reforms.

The Lisbon Treaty came into force on 1 December 2009, granting Parliament powers over the entire EU budget, making Parliament&#x27;s legislative powers equal to the Council&#x27;s in nearly all areas and describing Parliament&#x27;s vote on an incoming Commission President Commission President as an &quot;election&quot;, with the European Council having to make its proposal to Parliament in light of the results of the European elections.

Barroso gained the support of the European Council for a second term and secured majority support from the Parliament in September 2009. Parliament voted 382 votes in favour and 219 votes against (117 abstentions) with support of the European People&#x27;s Party, European Conservatives and Reformists Party and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. The liberals gave support after Barroso gave them a number of concessions; the liberals previously joined the socialists&#x27; call for a delayed vote (the EPP had wanted to approve Barroso in July of that year).

Once Barroso put forward the candidates for his next Commission, another case of MEPs opposing a particular nominee arose. Bulgarian nominee Rumiana Jeleva was forced to step down by Parliament due to concerns over her experience and financial interests. She only had the support of the EPP which began to retaliate on left wing candidates before Jeleva gave in and was replaced (setting back the final vote further).

Before the final vote on the Commission, Parliament demanded a number of concessions as part of a future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament&#x27;s president will attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have an observer seat in the EU&#x27;s Commission-led international negotiations and have a right to information on agreements. Parliament did not secure an explicit vote over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy, but it was agreed that they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the High Representative. Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would automatically put forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission&#x27;s powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.

During the setting up of the European External Action Service (EEAS), Parliament used its control over the EU budget to influence the shape of the EEAS. MEPs had aimed at getting greater oversight over the EEAS by linking it to the Commission and having political deputies to the High Representative. MEPs did not manage to get everything they demanded. However, they got broader financial control over the new body.

In December 2017, Politico denounced the insufficient racial diversity among Members of the European Parliament. The subsequent news coverage contributed to create the Brussels So White movement to campaign to rectify this situation.

On gender balance, some 37 percent of MEPs were women in the 2014-19 Parliament and 40 percent in the 2019-24 Parliament, a greater proposition than in most national Parliaments in Member States In January 2019, MEPs supported proposals to boost opportunities for women and tackle sexual harassment in the European Parliament.

In 2022, four people were arrested because of corruption. This came to be known as the Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament.

In October 2023, the Parliament adopted a resolution to condemn &quot;Hamas&#x27; despicable terrorist attacks against Israel&quot;.

==Powers and functions==
The Parliament and Council have been compared to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (except for the fact that the Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law. The value of a right of initiative has anyway been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament&#x27;s proposals more and more Parliament does have a &quot;de facto&quot; right of legislative initiative.

The Parliament also has a great deal of indirect influence, through non-binding resolutions and committee hearings, as a &quot;pan-European soapbox&quot; with the ear of thousands of Brussels-based journalists. There is also an indirect effect on foreign policy; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for post-war Iraq reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of Iranian nuclear development, must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal with the United States. Finally, Parliament holds a non-binding vote on new EU treaties but cannot veto it. However, when Parliament threatened to vote down the Nice Treaty, the Belgian and Italian Parliaments said that if it did so, they would veto the treaty on the European Parliament&#x27;s behalf.

===Legislative procedure===
With each new treaty, the powers of the Parliament, in terms of its role in the Union&#x27;s legislative procedures, have expanded. The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the &quot;ordinary legislative procedure&quot; (previously named &quot;codecision procedure&quot;), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a &quot;common position&quot;. That position may either be approved by Parliament, or it may reject the text by an absolute majority, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a &quot;Conciliation Committee&quot; is formed. The committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority. This is also aided by Parliament&#x27;s mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the Bolkestein directive in 2006.

In practice, most legislation is adopted at the first reading stage after the Parliament and the Council, having set out their initial positions, then negotiate a compromise text. These negotiations take place in so-called &quot;trilogue&quot; meetings, in which the Commission is also present.

In a few areas, &quot;special legislative procedures&quot; apply. These include justice and home affairs, budget and taxation, and certain aspects of other policy areas, such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone after consulting the other (or with its consent).

There are different types of European Union law#Legislation. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind member states to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is applicable to a particular person or group. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding, declarations.

===Budget===
The Parliament and the Council are also the Union&#x27;s budgetary authority since the Budgetary Treaties of the 1970s and the Lisbon Treaty. The EU budget is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (before 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. If the joint conciliation text is not approved by the Council, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively, but only by a three-fifths majority.

The Parliament is also responsible for discharging the implementation of previous budgets based on the annual report of the European Court of Auditors. It has refused to grant discharge only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion it led to the resignation of the Santer Commission; highlighting how the discharge power gives Parliament a great deal of power over the Commission. Parliament also makes extensive use of its budgetary, and other powers, elsewhere; for example in the setting up of the European External Action Service, Parliament had a de facto veto over its design as it has to approve the budgetary and staff changes.

===Control of the executive===
The President of the European Commission is proposed by the European Council on the basis of the European elections to Parliament. That proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a majority of members of the Parliament) who thereby &quot;elect&quot; the President according to the treaties. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament.

In practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but the threat to do so has produced concessions to Parliament on the Commission&#x27;s composition or on policy commitments. As described above, when the Barroso Commission was put forward, the Parliament forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to Parliament. That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Furthermore, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also vote along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament&#x27;s power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public reversing the previous decline in turnout for the Parliament&#x27;s elections.

The Parliament also has the power to censure the Commission by a two-thirds majority which will force the resignation of the entire Commission from office. As with approval, this power has never been explicitly used, but when faced with such a vote, the Santer Commission then resigned of their own accord.

There are other control instruments, such as: the requirement of Commission to submit reports to the Parliament and answer written and oral questions from MEPs; the requirement of the President-in-office of the Council to present its programme at the start of their presidency; the obligation on the President of the European Council to report to Parliament after each of its meetings; the right of MEPs to make requests for legislation and policy to the Commission; and the right to question members of those institutions (e.g. &quot;Commission Question Time&quot; every Tuesday). Regarding written and oral questions, MEPs voted in July 2008 to limit questions to those within the EU&#x27;s mandate and ban offensive or personal questions.

===Supervisory and scrutiny powers===
The Parliament also has other powers of general supervision, mainly granted by the Maastricht Treaty. The Parliament has the power to set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over mad cow disease or CIA detention flights the former led to the creation of the European veterinary agency. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to court if they break EU law or treaties. Furthermore, it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors and the president and executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECB president is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.

The European Ombudsman is elected by the Parliament to deal with public complaints about maladministration (administrative irregularities, unfairness, discrimination, abuse of power, failure to reply, refusal of information or unnecessary delay) by any EU institution or body.

Petitions can be brought to the Parliament by any EU citizen on a matter within the EU&#x27;s sphere of activities. The Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Petitions hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament. While the Parliament attempts to resolve the issue as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary to resolve the citizens dispute.

==Members==


The parliamentarians are known in English as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance. About 40 percent are women. Before the first direct elections, in 1979, they were appointed by their national parliaments.

The Parliament has been criticized for underrepresentation of minority groups. In 2017, an estimated 17 MEPs were non-white, and of these, three were black, a disproportionately low number. According to activist organization European Network Against Racism, while an estimated 10% of Europe is composed of racial and ethnic minorities, only 5% of MEPs were members of such groups following the 2019 European Parliament election.

Under the Lisbon Treaty, seats are allocated to each state according to population and the maximum number of members is set at 751. Since 1 February 2020 and the United Kingdom&#x27;s leaving the EU, 705 MEPs sit in the European Parliament. It rose to 720 after the 2024 elections.

Representation is currently limited to a maximum of 96 seats and a minimum of 6 seats per state and the seats are distributed according to &quot;degressive proportionality&quot;, i.e., the larger the state, the more citizens are represented per MEP. As a result, Maltese and Luxembourgish voters have roughly 10x more influence per voter than citizens of the six largest countries.

, Germany (80.9 million inhabitants) has 96 seats (previously 99 seats), i.e. one seat for 843,000 inhabitants. Malta (0.4 million inhabitants) has 6 seats, i.e. one seat for 70,000 inhabitants.

The new system implemented under the Lisbon Treaty, including revising the seating well before elections, was intended to avoid political horse trading when the allocations have to be revised to reflect demographic changes.

Pursuant to this apportionment, the constituencies are formed. In four EU member states (Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Poland), the national territory is divided into a number of constituencies. In the remaining member states, the whole country forms a single constituency. All member states hold elections to the European Parliament using various forms of proportional representation.

===Transitional arrangements===
Due to the delay in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh parliament was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A small scale treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011. This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was the only state to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats were not removed until the 2014 election.

===Salaries and expenses===
Before 2009, members received the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of â¬8,484.05 each in 2016, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs are entitled to a pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. They may then only be prosecuted after the European Parliament waives their immunity. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.

===Political groups===
MEPs in Parliament are organised into eight different parliamentary groups; members who do not join a group are known as &quot;non-attached members&quot; or &quot;non-inscrits&quot;.

The two largest groups are the European People&#x27;s Party Group (EPP) and the Socialists &amp; Democrats (S&amp;D). These two groups have dominated the Parliament for much of its existence, jointly holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats until 2019. No single group has ever held an absolute majority in Parliament.

As a result of being broad alliances of national parties, political groups in the European Parliament are decentralised and have more in common with parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than with unitary states, like the majority of the EU member states. Nevertheless, the political groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.

Half of the groups are based on a single European political party, such as the European People&#x27;s Party, with the addition of MEPs from national parties not members of a European party and independent MEPs. The others, such as the GreensâEuropean Free Alliance group or the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, center on two European parties, as well as other national parties and independents.

Groups need 23 MEPs from seven different member states to register. Following registration, groups receive public funding from the budget of the European Parliament.

===Coalitions===
Given that the Parliament does not form the government in the traditional sense of many parliamentary systems, majorities are built issue by issue. Generally, this is along broadly consensual lines with dynamic coalitions rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions.

These coalitions usually involve the European People&#x27;s Party and the Socialist and Democrat Group of the Party of European Socialists who tend to co-operate to find compromises between them and then bring in others. Their relationship has been described as a grand coalition. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing groups. Sometimes, the Liberal (Renew Europe) Group is then in the pivotal position.

There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission. When the initial allegations against the Commission emerged, they were directed primarily against Ãdith Cresson and Manuel MarÃ­n, both socialist members. When the parliament was considering refusing to discharge the Community budget, President Jacques Santer stated that a no vote would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence. The Socialist Group initially supported the Commission and saw the issue as an attempt by the EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. Socialist leader, Pauline Green MEP, attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward counter motions. During this period the two parties took on similar roles to a government-opposition dynamic, with the Socialists supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down. Politicisation such as this has been increasing, in 2007 Simon Hix of the London School of Economics noted that:
During the fifth term, 1999 to 2004, there was a break in the grand coalition resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People&#x27;s parties. This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the Liberals (then called ELDR), rather than the EPP and Socialists. In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament. The EPP-S&amp;D coalition lost their majority after the 2019 European Parliament election, requiring support by at least one other political group for a majority, most frequently the liberal Renew Group or the Greens.

===Elections===
Elections have taken place, directly in every member state, every five years since 1979. there have been nine elections. When a nation joins mid-term, a by-election will be held to elect their representatives. This has happened six times, most recently when Croatia joined in 2013. Elections take place on over a four-day period from a Thursday to a Sunday (each Member State votes on the day of its choice). Member States choose their electoral system within common guidelines, notably that the suffrage must be universal and that seats are allocated by proportional. This includes determining constituencies: while most Member States have a national constituencies, some divide their allocation between regions. Seats are allocated to member states according to their population, since 2014 with no state having more than 96, but no fewer than 6, to maintain proportionality.

The most recent Union-wide elections to the European Parliament were the European elections of 2019, held from 23 to 26 May 2019. They were the largest simultaneous transnational elections ever held anywhere in the world.
The first session of the ninth parliament started 2 July 2019.

European political parties have the exclusive right to campaign during the European elections (as opposed to their corresponding EP groups). There have been a number of proposals designed to attract greater public attention to the elections. One such innovation in the 2014 elections was that the pan-European political parties announced, ahead of the elections, their candidates for president of the Commission, the so-called &quot;Spitzenkandidaten&quot; (German, &quot;leading candidates&quot; or &quot;top candidates&quot;). The President of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council, representing the governments of the member states, and while there is no obligation for them to nominate the successful &quot;candidate&quot;, the Lisbon Treaty states that they should take account of the results of the elections when choosing whom to nominate, and the candidate they propose must be endorsed by a majority of members of the European Parliament.

The &quot;Spitzenkandidaten&quot; in 2014 were Jean-Claude Juncker for the European People&#x27;s Party, Martin Schulz for the Party of European Socialists, Guy Verhofstadt for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, Ska Keller and JosÃ© BovÃ© jointly for the European Green Party and Alexis Tsipras for the Party of the European Left. The EPP won the most seats and Jean-Claude Juncker was nominated by the European Council and elected by the Parliament.

In 2019, the parties again announced their candidates for President of the Commission ahead of the European elections, notably Manfred Weber for the EPP and Frans Timmermans for the Party of European Socialists. However, after the election, there was no agreement among the parties after the election to back any of them. After a period of deadlock, the European Council proposed Ursula von der Leyen as a compromise and Parliament elected her, albeit by a narrow majority.

In 2024, the EPP decided to back Von der Leyen for a second term of office and put her forward as their &quot;Spitzenkandidat&quot; while the PES put forward Nicolas Schmit.

Until 2014, turnout dropped consistently in every election since the first election, and from 1999 until 2014 was below 50%. In 2007 both Bulgaria and Romania elected their MEPs in by-elections, having joined at the beginning of 2007. The Bulgarian and Romanian elections saw two of the lowest turnouts for European elections, just 28.6% and 28.3% respectively. This trend was interrupted in the 2019 election, when turnout increased by 8% EU-wide, rising to 50.6%, the highest since 1994.

In England, Scotland and Wales, EP elections were originally held for a constituency MEP on a first-past-the-post basis. In 1999 the system was changed to a form of proportional representation where parties put up a team of candidates in regional constituencies. One could vote for a party&#x27;s list of candidates, but not for an individual candidate (unless that party had a single candidate).

==Proceedings==
Formally, the European Parliament has an annual &quot;session&quot;, divided into monthly &quot;part-sessions&quot; and daily &quot;sittings&quot;. In practice, this entails a monthly cycle with two committee weeks where matters are discussed in committees, political group weeks for members to discuss work within their political groups, and session weeks where members spend days in Strasbourg for part-sessions. In addition six 2-day part sessions are organised in Brussels throughout the year. Four weeks a year are allocated as constituency week to allow members to do exclusively constituency work, which they otherwise have to do at weekends. Finally there are no meetings planned during the summer weeks.

The Parliament has the power to meet without being convened by another authority. Its meetings are partly set out by the treaties but are otherwise up to Parliament according to its own &quot;Rules of Procedure&quot; (the regulations governing the parliament).

During sittings, members may speak after being called on by the President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due to the need for interpretation, and the politics of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the &quot;Official Journal of the European Union&quot; and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.

Members sit in a hemicycle according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for listening to interpretation, and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the Groups sit on the front benches, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are taken up by the Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other.

Access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who also aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited in the same manner as the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.

===President and organisation===

The President is essentially the speaker of the Parliament and presides over the plenary when it is in session. The President&#x27;s signature is required for all acts adopted by co-decision, including the EU budget. The President is also responsible for representing the Parliament externally, including in legal matters, and for the application of the rules of procedure. The President is elected for two-and-a-half-year terms, meaning two elections per parliamentary term. The current President of the European Parliament is Roberta Metsola, who was elected in January 2022.

In most countries, the protocol of the head of state comes before all others; however, in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence the protocol ranking of its president comes before any other European, or national, protocol. The gifts given to numerous visiting dignitaries depend upon the President. President Josep Borrell MEP of Spain gave his counterparts a crystal cup created by an artist from Barcelona who had engraved upon it parts of the Charter of Fundamental Rights among other things.

A number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was Paul-Henri Spaak MEP, one of the founding fathers of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The three female Presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament), Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen, and Roberta Metsola from Malta in 2022. The previous president, Jerzy Buzek was the first East-Central European to lead an EU institution, a former Prime Minister of Poland who rose out of the Solidarity movement in Poland that helped overthrow communism in the Eastern Bloc.

During the election of a President, the previous President (or, if unable to, one of the previous vice-presidents) presides over the chamber. Prior to 2009, the oldest member fulfilled this role but the rule was changed to prevent far-right French MEP Jean-Marie Le Pen taking the chair.

The Parliament also elects 14 Vice-Presidents who chair debates when the President is not in the chamber. There are a number of bodies responsible for the running of Parliament. The two main ones are the Bureau, which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues and is composed of the President and the Vice-Presidents, and the Conference of Presidents which is the political governing body and is composed of the Presidents of the Parliament and the leaders of each of the Parliament&#x27;s political groups. Looking after the financial and administrative interests of members are five Quaestors.

, the European Parliament budget was EUR 1.756 billion. A 2008 report on the Parliament&#x27;s finances highlighted certain overspending and miss-payments. Despite some MEPs calling for the report to be published, Parliamentary authorities had refused until an MEP broke confidentiality and leaked it.

===Committees and delegations===

The Parliament has 20 Standing Committees ranging in size from 25 to 88 MEPs (each reflecting the political make-up of the whole Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to be presented to the plenary. The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case: in the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee&#x27;s narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.

The Parliament can also set up sub-committees (e.g. the Subcommittee on Human Rights) and temporary committees to deal with a specific topic (e.g. the Special Committee on Foreign Interference in Democratic Processes in the European Union, 2020â23). The chairs of the Committees co-ordinate their work through the &quot;Conference of Committee Chairmen&quot;.

The nature of the committees differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison to those of the United States Congress, the European Parliament&#x27;s committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.

Delegations of the Parliament are formed in a similar manner and are responsible for relations with Parliaments outside the EU. There are 44 delegations, mostly small (around 15 MEPs) but some larger. Chairpersons of the delegations also cooperate in a conference like the committee chairs do. Delegations include &quot;Interparliamentary delegations&quot; (maintain relations with Parliament outside the EU), &quot;joint parliamentary committees&quot; (maintaining relations with parliaments of states which are candidates or associates of the EU), the delegation to the ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. MEPs also participate in other international activities such as the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, the NATO Assembly, the Transatlantic Legislators&#x27; Dialogue and through election observation in third countries.

===Intergroups===
The Intergroups in the European Parliament are informal fora which gather MEPs from various political groups around any topic. They do not express the view of the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example), must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also Intergroups are established or renewed at the beginning of each legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups who can each support a limited number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014â2019, the EPP or S&amp;D political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).

===Translation and interpretation===

Speakers in the European Parliament are entitled to speak in any of the 24 official languages of the European Union, ranging from French and German to Maltese and Irish. Simultaneous interpreting is offered in all plenary sessions, and all final texts of legislation are translated. With twenty-four languages, the European Parliament is the most multilingual parliament in the world and the biggest employer of interpreters in the world (employing 350 full-time and 400 freelancers when there is higher demand). Citizens may also address the Parliament in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician.

Usually a language is translated from a foreign tongue into a translator&#x27;s native tongue. Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter&#x27;s native tongue (the &quot;retour&quot; system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters (&quot;relay&quot; interpreting) for example, when interpreting out of Estonian into Maltese. Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes and word play or speak too fast.

While some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by Alexander Stubb MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from â¬118,000 per day (for 21 languages then Romanian, Bulgarian and Croatian having not yet been included) to â¬8,900 per day. There has also been a small-scale campaign to make French the reference language for all legal texts, on the basis of an argument that it is more clear and precise for legal purposes.

Because the proceedings are translated into all of the official EU languages, they have been used to make a multilingual corpus known as Europarl. It is widely used to train statistical machine translation systems.

== Corruption scandals ==

On 12 December 2022, President Metsola announced that all work with Qatar would be suspended.

A European Union correspondent, Jack Parrock confirmed on the basis of close sources to Qatar that the UAE was involved in plotting the corruption scandal. Parrock said the official investigations, leaked documents and a number of European sources have confirmed the Emirati involvement in planning the alleged bribery case against Qatar. In a separate report by The European Microscope, documents revealed that the UAE made extensive efforts to woo multiple members of the European Parliament. Abu Dhabi intensified the lobbying campaign to build its support within the European Parliament and to push its members to speak in favour of the Emirates. After Qatari officials, an Italian web publisher, Dagospia alleged that the UAE&#x27;s plan against Qatar involved Tahnoun bin Zayed. It is alleged that the brother of UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan gave Belgium the tips that lead to the investigations against Qatar.

At the same meeting the GreensâEuropean Free Alliance and Renew Europe both called for an inquiry committee to be set up by the European Parliament. The suspension of Parliamentary business at this time was significant as it came just three days before the Parliament was due to vote on introducing a visa-free travel agreement with Qatar and other countries. This resulted in the vote on visa-free travel to Ecuador, Kuwait, and Oman also being canceled. In addition, a major and controversial air transit agreement that would have allowed Qatar Airways unlimited access to the EU market was put on hold after warning that Qatar may have interfered in Parliament&#x27;s internal deliberations on the agreement. During the negotiations there was criticism by EU member states that the agreement, negotiated by the Parliament&#x27;s transport committee, was unduly favourable of Qatar.

On 16 December 2022, an article published by Politico, elucidate the connection between Antonio Panzeri and Abderrahim Atmoun. Panzeri, a former Italian member of the European Parliament who headed the assembly of Maghreb delegation and Abderrahim Atmoun, and his co-president of the EU-Morocco joint parliamentary committee attended an award ceremony in 2014 where they were awarded by the king Mohammed VI of Morocco. Atmoun, now Morocco&#x27;s ambassador to Warsaw posted some pictures from the ceremony with the king and also posted the series of pictures showcasing the long-term association between him and Panzeri a man whom he publicly claims as his friend from as long as 2011. The later pictures also involved Francesco Giorgi where three of them can be seen sitting together in the meeting room. Later in 2022, the three men caught in the biggest corruption scandal as Belgium launches an investigation into whether Qatar and Morocco bought the influence in the European Parliament. Panzeri and Giorgi, along with his partner Eva Kaili are in jail facing preliminary charges of corruption. Warrants were also issued against Panzeri&#x27;s wife and daughter in connection with influence buying which mentions the Atmoun giving gifts to them. The lawyers have declined to comment and Morocco&#x27;s embassies in Warsaw and Brussel are not responding to calls. Panzeri&#x27;s wife and daughter also denied any wrongdoings.

President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola issued a statement in January 2023 stating that she had moved to remove parliamentary immunity from two MEPs implicated in the ongoing corruption scandal after receiving a request from the Belgian police.

The European Parliament has had criticism over its prodigality and for being too complacent with conflicts of interest. Its refusal to become full member of the GRECO like all its member states is also a matter of criticism.

A January 2024 report published by investigative outlet &quot;Follow the Money&quot; found that 1 in 4 EU lawmakers have been implicated in judicial cases or scandals. Out of 253 cases highlighted in the report, only 23 have resulted in convictions.

There are also ongoing concerns related to allegations that members of the European Parliament were illegally or unethically influenced by Russia. Such concerns have been raised several times in 2023 and 2024 and dubbed &quot;Russiagate&quot;.

Panzeri&#x27;s lobbying group, Fight Impunity, was largely funded by Iqbal SurvÃ©, a controversial South African billionaire. SurvÃ©&#x27;s Sekunjalo Development Foundation was found to be the &quot;most important donor&quot; having donated â¬250,000 to the group.

==Annual costs==
According to the European Parliament website, the annual parliament budget for 2021 was â¬2.064 billion, which corresponds to 1.2% of EU budget. The main cost categories were:
* 45% staff (staff expenses, contract agents, linguistic services)
* 22% operational costs (buildings, IT, administration)
* 26% political activities (members, activities of political groups, parties and foundations)
* 6% communications

According to a European Parliament study prepared in 2013, the Strasbourg seat costs an extra â¬103 million over maintaining a single location and according to the Court of Auditors an additional â¬5 million is related to travel expenses caused by having two seats.

As a comparison, the German lower house of parliament (Bundestag) is estimated to cost â¬517 million in total for 2018, for a parliament with 709 members. The British House of Commons reported total annual costs in 2016-2017 of Â£249 million (â¬279 million). It had 650 seats.

According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, the European Parliament costs more than the British, French and German parliaments combined. A quarter of the costs is estimated to be related to translation and interpretation costs (c. â¬460 million) and the double seats are estimated to add an additional â¬180 million a year. For a like-for-like comparison, these two cost blocks can be excluded.

On 2 July 2018, MEPs rejected proposals to tighten the rules around the General Expenditure Allowance (GEA), which &quot;is a controversial â¬4,416 per month payment that MEPs are given to cover office and other expenses, but they are not required to provide any evidence of how the money is spent&quot;.

==Seat==


The Parliament is based in three different cities with numerous buildings. The Member States attached a protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam that requires 12 plenary sessions to be held in Strasbourg (in practice, none in August but two in October), which is described as the Parliament&#x27;s official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in Brussels. Luxembourg City hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is one of at least two assemblies in the world with more than one meeting place (another being the parliament of the Isle of Man, Tynwald) and one of the few that does not have the power to decide its own location.

The Strasbourg seat is considered a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany, two countries that previously fought over the region. However, the cost and inconvenience of having two seats is questioned. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the Council of Europe, Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions, with the majority of Parliament&#x27;s work being carried out there. Critics have described the two-seat arrangement as a &quot;travelling circus&quot;, and there is a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. This is because the other political institutions (the Commission, Council and European Council) are located there, and hence Brussels is treated as the &#x27;capital&#x27; of the EU. This movement has received strong backing from numerous figures, including Margot WallstrÃ¶m, Commission First-Vice President from 2004 to 2010, who stated that &quot;something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol of wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions&quot;. The Green Party has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by Jean Lambert MEP and Caroline Lucas MEP; in addition to the extra 200Â million euro spent on the extra seat, there are over 20,268Â tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union. The campaign is further backed by a million-strong online petition started by Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m MEP. In August 2014, an assessment by the European Court of Auditors calculated that relocating the Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament to Brussels would save â¬113.8 million per year. In 2006, there were allegations of irregularities in the charges made by the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament rented, thus further harming the case for the Strasbourg seat.

Most MEPs prefer Brussels as a single base. A poll of MEPs found 89% of the respondents wanting a single seat, and 81% preferring Brussels. Another survey found 68% support. In July 2011, an absolute majority of MEPs voted in favour of a single seat. In early 2011, the Parliament voted to scrap one of the Strasbourg sessions by holding two within a single week. The mayor of Strasbourg officially reacted by stating &quot;we will counter-attack by upturning the adversary&#x27;s strength to our own profit, as a judoka would do&quot;. However, as Parliament&#x27;s seat is now fixed by the treaties, it can only be changed by the Member States, acting unanimously and with national ratification, meaning that France could veto any move. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy stated that the Strasbourg seat is &quot;non-negotiable&quot; and that France has no intention of surrendering the only EU Institution on French soil. Given France&#x27;s declared intention to veto any relocation to Brussels, some MEPs have advocated civil disobedience by refusing to take part in the monthly exodus to Strasbourg.

However, the main building in Brussels has been suffering for more than a decade from a state of degradation. Renovation or reconstruction works including an hemicycle were estimated to cost at least â¬500 million in 2017 with fear that the cost would be even higher and possibly escalate up to â¬1 billion, whereas the seat in Strasbourg already offers a fully-fledged hemicycle.

==Channels of dialogue, information, and communication with European civil society==

Individual MEPs are the main point of contact for citizens with the Parliament. They normally have an office in their constituency and travel back at the end of every week (and during weeks without parliamentary meetings) to participate in an array of meetings, events, interviews, visits and suchlike with voters, businesses, trade unions, local authorities and media.

The Parliament itself maintains a detailed website, receives around one million visitors a year, and streamlines debates and committee meetings.

Over the last few years, European institutions have committed to promoting transparency, openness, and the availability of information about their work. In particular, transparency is regarded as pivotal to the action of European institutions and a general principle of EU law, to be applied to the activities of EU institutions in order to strengthen the Union&#x27;s democratic foundation. The general principles of openness and transparency are reaffirmed in the articles 8 A, point 3 and 10.3 of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Maastricht Treaty respectively, stating that &quot;every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen&quot;. Furthermore, both treaties acknowledge the value of dialogue between citizens, representative associations, civil society, and European institutions.

===Dialogue with religious and non-confessional organisations===

Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) lays the juridical foundation for an open, transparent dialogue between European institutions and churches, religious associations, and non-confessional and philosophical organisations. In July 2014, in the beginning of the 8th term, then President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz tasked Antonio Tajani, then vice-president, with implementing the dialogue with the religious and confessional organisations included in article 17. In this framework, the European Parliament hosts high-level conferences on inter-religious dialogue, also with focus on current issues and in relation with parliamentary works.

===European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction===

The chair of European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was established in 1987 by initiative of British MEP Charles Henry Plumb, with the goal of helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinness (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009â2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004â2009), Mary Banotti (1995â2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987â1994). The Mediator&#x27;s main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor&#x27;s best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.

==European Parliamentary Research Service==
The European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) is the European Parliament&#x27;s in-house research department and think tank. It provides Members of the European Parliament and, where appropriate, parliamentary committees with independent, objective and authoritative analysis of, and research on, policy issues relating to the European Union, in order to assist them in their parliamentary work. It is also designed to increase Members&#x27; and EP committees&#x27; capacity to scrutinise and oversee the European Commission and other EU executive bodies.

EPRS aims to provide a comprehensive range of products and services, backed by specialist internal expertise and knowledge sources in all policy fields, so empowering Members and committees through knowledge and contributing to the Parliament&#x27;s effectiveness and influence as an institution. In undertaking this work, the EPRS supports and promotes parliamentary outreach to the wider public, including dialogue with relevant stakeholders in the EU&#x27;s system of multi-level governance. All EPRS publications are publicly available on the EP Think Tank platform.

==Eurobarometer of the European Parliament==
The European Parliament periodically commissions opinion polls and studies on public opinion trends in Member States to survey perceptions and expectations of citizens about its work and the overall activities of the European Union. Topics include citizens&#x27; perception of the European Parliament&#x27;s role, their knowledge of the institution, their sense of belonging in the European Union, opinions on European elections and European integration, identity, citizenship, political values, but also on current issues such as climate change, current economy and politics, etc. Eurobarometer analyses seek to provide an overall picture of national situations, regional specificities, socio-demographic cleavages, and historical trends.

==Prizes==
===Sakharov Prize===

With the Sakharov Prize, created in 1988, the European Parliament supports human rights by awarding individuals that contribute to promoting human rights worldwide, thus raising awareness on human rights violations. Priorities include: protection of human rights and fundamental liberties, with particular focus on freedom of expression; protection of minority rights; compliance with international law; and development of democracy and authentic rule of law.

===European Charlemagne Youth Prize===

The European Charlemagne Youth Prize seeks to encourage youth participation in the European integration process. It is awarded by the European Parliament and the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen to youth projects aimed at nurturing common European identity and European citizenship.

===European Citizens&#x27; Prize===

The European Citizens&#x27; Prize is awarded by the European Parliament to activities and actions carried out by citizens and associations to promote integration between the citizens of EU member states and transnational cooperation projects in the EU.

===LUX Prize===

Since 2007, the LUX Prize is awarded by the European Parliament to films dealing with current topics of public European interest that encourage reflection on Europe and its future. Over time, the Lux Prize has become a prestigious cinema award which supports European film and production also outside the EU.

===Daphne Caruana Galizia Journalism Prize===

From 2021, the Daphne Caruana Galizia Journalism prize shall be awarded by the European Parliament to outstanding journalism that reflect EU values. The prize consists in an award of 20,000 euros and the very first winner will be revealed in October 2021. This award is named after the late Maltese journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia who was assassinated in Malta on 16 October 2017. In 2021 the prize was awarded to the Pegasus Project.

<text>The European Council (informally EUCO) is a collegiate body (directorial system) that defines the overall political direction and priorities of the European Union (EU). The European Council is part of the executive of the EU, beside the European Commission. It is composed of the heads of state or of government of the EU member states, the President of the European Council, and the President of the European Commission. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy also takes part in its meetings.

Established as an informal summit in 1975, the European Council was formalised as an institution in 2009 upon the commencement of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its current president is AntÃ³nio Costa, former Prime Minister of Portugal.

==Scope==
While the European Council has no legislative power, it is a strategic (and crisis-solving) body that provides the union with general political directions and priorities, and acts as a collective presidency. The European Commission remains the sole initiator of legislation, but the European Council provides a guide to legislative policy.

The meetings of the European Council, still commonly referred to as EU summits, are chaired by its president and take place at least twice every six months; usually in the Europa building in Brussels. Decisions of the European Council are taken by consensus, except where the Treaties provide otherwise.

==History==

The European Council officially gained the status of an EU institution after the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, distinct from the Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers). Before that, the first summits of EU heads of state or government were held in February and July 1961 (in Paris and Bonn respectively). They were informal summits of the leaders of the European Community, and were started due to then-French President Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (notably the European Commission) over the integration process, but petered out. The first influential summit held, after the departure of de Gaulle, was the Hague summit of 1969, which reached an agreement on the admittance of the United Kingdom into the Community and initiated foreign policy cooperation (the European Political Cooperation) taking integration beyond economics.

The summits were only formalised in the period between 1974 and 1988. At the December summit in Paris in 1974, following a proposal from then-French president ValÃ©ry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, it was agreed that more high-level, political input was needed following the &quot;empty chair crisis&quot; and economic problems. The inaugural &quot;European Council&quot;, as it became known, was held in Dublin on 10 and 11 March 1975 during Ireland&#x27;s first Presidency of the Council of Ministers. In 1987, it was included in the treaties for the first time (the Single European Act) and had a defined role for the first time in the Maastricht Treaty. At first only a minimum of two meetings per year were required, which resulted in an average of three meetings per year being held for the 1975â1995 period. Since 1996, the number of meetings were required to be minimum four per year. For the latest 2008â2014 period, this minimum was well exceeded, by an average of seven meetings being held per year. The seat of the Council was formalised in 2002, basing it in Brussels. Three types of European Councils exist: Informal, Scheduled and Extraordinary. While the informal meetings are also scheduled 1Â½ years in advance, they differ from the scheduled ordinary meetings by not ending with official &quot;Council conclusions&quot;, as they instead end by more broad political &quot;Statements&quot; on some cherry-picked policy matters. The extraordinary meetings always end with official &quot;Council conclusions&quot; but differ from the scheduled meetings by not being scheduled more than a year in advance, as for example in 2001 when the European Council gathered to lead the European Union&#x27;s response to the 11 September attacks.

Some meetings of the European Councilâand, before the European Council was formalised, meetings of the heads of governmentâare seen by some as turning points in the history of the European Union. For example:
* 1969, &quot;The Hague&quot;: Foreign policy and enlargement.
* 1974, &quot;Paris&quot;: Creation of the council.
* 1985, &quot;Milan&quot;: Initiate IGC leading to the Single European Act.

* 1991, &quot;Maastricht&quot;: Agreement on the Maastricht Treaty.
* 1992, &quot;Edinburgh&quot;: Agreement (by treaty provision) to retain at Strasbourg the plenary seat of the European Parliament.
* 1993, &quot;Copenhagen&quot;: Leading to the definition of the Copenhagen Criteria.
* 1997, &quot;Amsterdam&quot;: Agreement on the Amsterdam Treaty.
* 1998, &quot;Brussels&quot;: Selected member states to adopt the euro.
* 1999; &quot;Cologne&quot;: Declaration on military forces.
* 1999, &quot;Tampere&quot;: Institutional reform
* 2000, &quot;Lisbon&quot;: Lisbon Strategy
* 2002, &quot;Copenhagen&quot;: Agreement for May 2004 enlargement.
* 2007, &quot;Lisbon&quot;: Agreement on the Lisbon Treaty.
* 2009, &quot;Brussels&quot;: Appointment of first president and merged High Representative.
* 2010, European Financial Stability Facility

As such, the European Council had already existed before it gained the status as an institution of the European Union with the entering into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, but even after it had been mentioned in the treaties (since the Single European Act) it could only take political decisions, not formal legal acts. However, when necessary, the Heads of State or Government could also meet as the Council of Ministers and take formal decisions in that role. Sometimes, this was even compulsory, e.g. Article 214(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community provided (before it was amended by the Treaty of Lisbon) that &#x27;the Council, meeting &quot;in the composition of Heads of State or Government&quot; and acting by a qualified majority, shall nominate the person it intends to appoint as President of the Commission&#x27; (emphasis added); the same rule applied in some monetary policy provisions introduced by the Maastricht Treaty (e.g. Article 109j TEC). In that case, what was politically part of a European Council meeting was legally a meeting of the Council of Ministers. When the European Council, already introduced into the treaties by the Single European Act, became an institution by virtue of the Treaty of Lisbon, this was no longer necessary, and the &quot;Council [of the European Union] meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government&quot;, was replaced in these instances by the European Council now taking formal legally binding decisions in these cases (Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union).

The Treaty of Lisbon made the European Council a formal institution distinct from the (ordinary) Council of the EU, and created the present longer term and full-time presidency. As an outgrowth of the Council of the EU, the European Council had previously followed the same Presidency, rotating between each member state. While the Council of the EU retains that system, the European Council established, with no change in powers, a system of appointing an individual (without them being a national leader) for a two-and-a-half-year termâwhich can be renewed for the same person only once. Following the ratification of the treaty in December 2009, the European Council elected the then-Prime Minister of Belgium Herman Van Rompuy as its first permanent president; he resigned the prime ministerial position.

==Powers and functions==
The European Council is an official institution of the EU, described in the Lisbon Treaty as a body which &quot;shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development&quot;. Essentially it defines the EU&#x27;s policy agenda and has thus been considered to be the motor of European integration. Beyond the need to provide &quot;impetus&quot;, the council has developed further roles: to &quot;settle issues outstanding from discussions at a lower level&quot;, to lead in foreign policyÂ â acting externally as a &quot;collective Head of State&quot;, &quot;formal ratification of important documents&quot; and &quot;involvement in the negotiation of the treaty changes&quot;.

Since the institution is composed of national leaders, it gathers the executive power of the member states and has thus a great influence in high-profile policy areas as for example foreign policy. It also exercises powers of appointment, such as appointment of its own President, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the President of the European Central Bank. It proposes, to the European Parliament, a candidate for President of the European Commission. Moreover, the European Council influences police and justice planning, the composition of the commission, matters relating to the organisation of the rotating Council presidency, the suspension of membership rights, and changing the voting systems through the Passerelle Clause. Although the European Council has no direct legislative power, under the &quot;emergency brake&quot; procedure, a state outvoted in the Council of Ministers may refer contentious legislation to the European Council. However, the state may still be outvoted in the European Council. Hence with powers over the supranational executive of the EU, in addition to its other powers, the European Council has been described by some as the Union&#x27;s &quot;supreme political authority&quot;.

==Composition==
The European Council consists of the heads of state or government of the member states, alongside its own President and the Commission President (both non-voting). The meetings used to be regularly attended by the national foreign minister as well, and the Commission President likewise accompanied by another member of the commission. However, since the Treaty of Lisbon, this has been discontinued, as the size of the body had become somewhat large following successive accessions of new Member States to the Union.
Meetings can also include other invitees, such as the President of the European Central Bank, as required. The Secretary-General of the Council attends, and is responsible for organisational matters, including minutes. The President of the European Parliament also attends to give an opening speech outlining the European Parliament&#x27;s position before talks begin.

Additionally, the negotiations involve a large number of other people working behind the scenes. Most of those people, however, are not allowed to the conference room, except for two delegates per state to relay messages. At the push of a button members can also call for advice from a Permanent Representative via the &quot;Antici Group&quot; in an adjacent room. The group is composed of diplomats and assistants who convey information and requests. Interpreters are also required for meetings as members are permitted to speak in their own languages.

As the composition is not precisely defined, some states which have a considerable division of executive power can find it difficult to decide who should attend the meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued that there was no need for the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the Prime Minister of Finland (who was head of European foreign policy). In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis because the President wanted to attend the high-profile summit as well as the Prime Minister (only two people from each country could attend the meetings). This was despite Stubb being Chair-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis. Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the Prime Minister of Poland were of different parties and had a different foreign policy response to the crisis. A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian BÄsescu and Prime Minister CÄlin Popescu-TÄriceanu in 2007â2008 and again in 2012 with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.

===Eurozone summits===

A number of ad hoc meetings of heads of state or government of the member states of the euro area were held in 2010 and 2011 to discuss the Sovereign Debt crisis. It was agreed in October 2011 that they should meet regularly twice a year (with extra meetings if needed). This will normally be at the end of a European Council meeting and according to the same format (chaired by the President of the European Council and including the President of the Commission), but usually restricted to the (currently 20) heads of state or government of the member states of the eurozone.

===President===

The President of the European Council is elected by its members through a qualified majority vote for a once-renewable term of two and a half years. Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) identifies his duties. It is the Heads of State or Government who vote for this office. The President must report to the European Parliament after each European Council meeting. The post was created by the Treaty of Lisbon and was subject to a debate over its exact role. Prior to Lisbon, the Presidency rotated in accordance with the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The role of that President-in-Office was in no sense (other than protocol) equivalent to an office of a head of state, merely a &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (first among equals) role among other European heads of government. The President-in-Office was primarily responsible for preparing and chairing the Council meetings, and had no executive powers other than the task of representing the Union externally. Now the leader of the Council Presidency country can still act as president when the permanent president is absent.

===Members===


===Political alliances===
Almost all members of the European Council are members of a political party at the national level. Most of them are also members of political alliances at the European level such as European political parties and political groups of the European Parliament.

These alliances frequently hold pre-meetings with their European Council members, prior to their meetings. However, the members of the European Council represent their member states rather than political alliances, and decisions are generally made along national lines, though ideological alignment can colour political agreements and appointments (such as the president of the European Council).

The charts below outline the number of leaders affiliated to each alliance and their total voting weight. The map indicates the political group of the member representing each individual country.

==Seat and meetings==
The European Council is required by Article 15.3 TEU to meet at least twice every six months, but convenes more frequently in practice. Despite efforts to contain business, meetings typically last for at least two days, and run long into the night.

Until 2002, the venue for European Council summits was the member state that held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. However, European leaders agreed during ratification of the Nice Treaty to forego this arrangement at such a time as the total membership of the European Union surpassed 18 member states. An advanced implementation of this agreement occurred in 2002, with certain states agreeing to waive their right to host meetings, favouring Brussels as the location. Following the growth of the EU to 25 member states, with the 2004 enlargement, all subsequent official summits of the European Council have been in Brussels, with the exception of punctuated ad hoc meetings, such as the 2017 informal European Council in Malta. The logistical, environmental, financial and security arrangements of hosting large summits are usually cited as the primary factors in the decision by EU leaders to move towards a permanent seat for the European Council. Additionally, some scholars argue that the move, when coupled with the formalisation of the European Council in the Lisbon Treaty, represents an institutionalisation of an ad hoc EU organ that had its origins in Luxembourg compromise, with national leaders reasserting their dominance as the EU&#x27;s &quot;supreme political authority&quot;.

Originally, both the European Council and the Council of the European Union utilised the Justus Lipsius building as their Brussels venue. In order to make room for additional meeting space a number of renovations were made, including the conversion of an underground carpark into additional press briefing rooms. However, in 2004 leaders decided the logistical problems created by the outdated facilities warranted the construction of a new purpose built seat able to cope with the nearly 6,000 meetings, working groups, and summits per year. This resulted in the Europa building, which opened its doors in 2017. The focal point of the new building, the distinctive multi-storey &quot;lantern-shaped&quot; structure in which the main meeting room is located, is utilised in both the European Council&#x27;s and Council of the European Union&#x27;s official logos.

<text>Euthanasia (from : + ) is the practice of intentionally ending life to eliminate pain and suffering.

Different countries have different euthanasia laws. The British House of Lords select committee on medical ethics defines euthanasia as &quot;a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life to relieve intractable suffering&quot;. In the Netherlands and Belgium, euthanasia is understood as &quot;termination of life by a doctor at the request of a patient&quot;. The Dutch law, however, does not use the term &#x27;euthanasia&#x27; but includes the concept under the broader definition of &quot;assisted suicide and termination of life on request&quot;.

Euthanasia is categorised in different ways, which include voluntary, non-voluntary, and involuntary. Voluntary euthanasia is when a person wishes to have their life ended and is legal in a growing number of countries. Non-voluntary euthanasia occurs when a patient&#x27;s consent is unavailable and is legal in some countries under certain limited conditions, in both active and passive forms. Involuntary euthanasia, which is done without asking for consent or against the patient&#x27;s will, is illegal in all countries and is usually considered murder.

, euthanasia had become the most active area of research in bioethics.
In some countries, divisive public controversy occurs over the moral, ethical, and legal issues associated with euthanasia. Passive euthanasia (known as &quot;pulling the plug&quot;) is legal under some circumstances in many countries. Active euthanasia, however, is legal or &quot;de facto&quot; legal in only a handful of countries (for example, Belgium, Canada, and Switzerland), which limit it to specific circumstances and require the approval of counsellors, doctors, or other specialists. In some countriesâsuch as Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistanâsupport for active euthanasia is almost nonexistent.

==Definition==
===Current usage===
As of 2024, dictionary definitions focus on euthanasia as the act of killing someone to prevent further suffering. There is no sense of whether the person agrees or is proactive in the situation.

===Past discussions on key elements===
In 1974 euthanasia was defined as the &quot;painless inducement of a quick death&quot;. However, it is argued that this approach fails to properly define euthanasia, as it leaves open a number of possible actions that would meet the requirements of the definition but would not be seen as euthanasia. In particular, these include situations where a person kills another, painlessly, but for no reason beyond that of personal gain, or accidental deaths that are quick and painless but not intentional.

Another approach incorporated the notion of suffering into the definition. The definition offered by the Oxford English Dictionary incorporates suffering as a necessary condition with &quot;the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or in an irreversible coma&quot;, This approach is included in Marvin Khol and Paul Kurtz&#x27;s definition of it as &quot;a mode or act of inducing or permitting death painlessly as a relief from suffering&quot;. Counterexamples can be given: such definitions may encompass killing a person suffering from an incurable disease for personal gain (such as to claim an inheritance), and commentators such as Tom Beauchamp and Arnold Davidson have argued that doing so would constitute &quot;murder simpliciter&quot; rather than euthanasia.

The third element incorporated into many definitions is that of intentionality: the death must be intended rather than accidental, and the intent of the action must be a &quot;merciful death&quot;. Michael Wreen argued that &quot;the principal thing that distinguishes euthanasia from intentional killing simpliciter is the agent&#x27;s motive: it must be a good motive insofar as the good of the person killed is concerned.&quot; Similarly, Heather Draper speaks to the importance of motive, arguing that &quot;the motive forms a crucial part of arguments for euthanasia, because it must be in the best interests of the person on the receiving end.&quot; Definitions such as those offered by the House of Lords Select committee on Medical Ethics take this path, where euthanasia is defined as &quot;a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering.&quot; Beauchamp and Davidson also highlight Baruch Brody&#x27;s &quot;an act of euthanasia is one in which one personÂ ... (A) kills another person (B) for the benefit of the second person, who actually does benefit from being killed&quot;.

Draper argued that any definition of euthanasia must incorporate four elements: an agent and a subject; an intention; causal proximity, such that the actions of the agent lead to the outcome; and an outcome. Based on this, she offered a definition incorporating those elements, stating that euthanasia &quot;must be defined as death that results from the intention of one person to kill another person, using the most gentle and painless means possible, that is motivated solely by the best interests of the person who dies.&quot; Prior to Draper, Beauchamp and Davidson had also offered a definition that included these elements. Their definition specifically discounts fetuses to distinguish between abortions and euthanasia:

Wreen, in part responding to Beauchamp and Davidson, offered a six-part definition:

Wreen also considered a seventh requirement: &quot;(7) The good specified in (6) is, or at least includes, the avoidance of evil&quot;, although, as Wreen noted in the paper, he was not convinced that the restriction was required.

In discussing his definition, Wreen noted the difficulty of justifying euthanasia when faced with the notion of the subject&#x27;s &quot;right to life&quot;. In response, Wreen argued that euthanasia has to be voluntary and that &quot;involuntary euthanasia is, as such, a great wrong&quot;. Other commentators incorporate consent more directly into their definitions. For example, in a discussion of euthanasia presented in 2003 by the European Association of Palliative Care (EPAC) Ethics Task Force, the authors offered: &quot;Medicalized killing of a person without the person&#x27;s consent, whether nonvoluntary (where the person is unable to consent) or involuntary (against the person&#x27;s will), is not euthanasia: it is murder. Hence, euthanasia can be voluntary only.&quot; Although the EPAC Ethics Task Force argued that both non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia could not be included in the definition of euthanasia, there is discussion in the literature about excluding one but not the other.

===Historical use===
&quot;Euthanasia&quot; has had different meanings depending on usage. The first apparent usage of the term &quot;euthanasia&quot; belongs to the historian Suetonius, who described how the Emperor Augustus, &quot;dying quickly and without suffering in the arms of his wife, Livia, experienced the &#x27;euthanasia&#x27; he had wished for.&quot; The word &quot;euthanasia&quot; was first used in a medical context by Francis Bacon in the 17th century to refer to an easy, painless, happy death, during which it was a &quot;physician&#x27;s responsibility to alleviate the &#x27;physical sufferings&#x27; of the body.&quot; Bacon referred to an &quot;outward euthanasia&quot;âthe term &quot;outward&quot; he used to distinguish from a spiritual conceptâthe euthanasia &quot;which regards the preparation of the soul.&quot;

==Classification==
Euthanasia may be classified into three types, according to whether a person gives informed consent: voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary.

There is a debate within the medical and bioethics literature about whether or not the non-voluntary (and by extension, involuntary) killing of patients can be regarded as euthanasia, irrespective of intent or the patient&#x27;s circumstances. In the definitions offered by Beauchamp and Davidson and, later, by Wreen, consent on the part of the patient was not considered one of their criteria, although it may have been required to justify euthanasia. However, others see consent as essential.

===Voluntary euthanasia===

Voluntary euthanasia is conducted with the consent of the patient. Active voluntary euthanasia is legal in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Passive voluntary euthanasia is legal throughout the US per &quot;Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health&quot;. When the patient brings about their own death with the assistance of a physician, the term assisted suicide is often used instead. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland and the U.S. states of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont.

===Non-voluntary euthanasia===
Non-voluntary euthanasia is conducted when the consent of the patient is unavailable. Examples include child euthanasia, which is illegal worldwide but decriminalised under certain specific circumstances in the Netherlands under the Groningen Protocol. Passive forms of non-voluntary euthanasia (i.e. withholding treatment) are legal in a number of countries under specified conditions.

===Involuntary euthanasia===
Involuntary euthanasia is conducted against the will of the patient.

===Passive and active euthanasia===
Voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary types can be further divided into passive or active variants. Passive euthanasia entails the withholding treatment necessary for the continuance of life. Active euthanasia entails the use of lethal substances or forces (such as administering a lethal injection), and is more controversial. While some authors consider these terms to be misleading and unhelpful, they are nonetheless commonly used. In some cases, such as the administration of increasingly necessary, but toxic doses of painkillers, there is a debate whether or not to regard the practice as active or passive.

== History ==

Euthanasia was practiced in Ancient Greece and Rome: for example, hemlock was employed as a means of hastening death on the island of Kea, a technique also employed in Massalia. Euthanasia, in the sense of the deliberate hastening of a person&#x27;s death, was supported by Socrates, Plato and Seneca the Elder in the ancient world, although Hippocrates appears to have spoken against the practice, writing &quot;I will not prescribe a deadly drug to please someone, nor give advice that may cause his death&quot; (noting there is some debate in the literature about whether or not this was intended to encompass euthanasia).

=== Early modern period ===
The term &quot;euthanasia&quot;, in the earlier sense of supporting someone as they died, was used for the first time by Francis Bacon. In his work, &quot;Euthanasia medica&quot;, he chose this ancient Greek word and, in doing so, distinguished between &quot;euthanasia interior&quot;, the preparation of the soul for death, and &quot;euthanasia exterior&quot;, which was intended to make the end of life easier and painless, in exceptional circumstances by shortening life. That the ancient meaning of an easy death came to the fore again in the early modern period can be seen from its definition in the 18th century &quot;Zedlers Universallexikon&quot;:

Euthanasia: a very gentle and quiet death, which happens without painful convulsions. The word comes from ÎµÏ, &quot;bene&quot;, well, and Î¸Î±Î½Î±ÏÎ¿Ï, &quot;mors&quot;, death.

The concept of euthanasia in the sense of alleviating the process of death goes back to the medical historian Karl Friedrich Heinrich Marx, who drew on Bacon&#x27;s philosophical ideas. According to Marx, a doctor had a moral duty to ease the suffering of death through encouragement, support and mitigation using medication. Such an &quot;alleviation of death&quot; reflected the contemporary &quot;zeitgeist&quot;, but was brought into the medical canon of responsibility for the first time by Marx. Marx also stressed the distinction of the theological care of the soul of sick people from the physical care and medical treatment by doctors.

Euthanasia in its modern sense has always been strongly opposed in the Judeo-Christian tradition. Thomas Aquinas opposed both and argued that the practice of euthanasia contradicted our natural human instincts of survival, as did Francois Ranchin (1565â1641), a French physician and professor of medicine, and Michael Boudewijns (1601â1681), a physician and teacher. Other voices argued for euthanasia, such as John Donne in 1624, and euthanasia continued to be practised. In 1678, the publication of Caspar Questel&#x27;s &quot;De pulvinari morientibus non-subtrahend&quot;, (&quot;On the pillow of which the dying should not be deprived&quot;), initiated debate on the topic. Questel described various customs which were employed at the time to hasten the death of the dying, (including the sudden removal of a pillow, which was believed to accelerate death), and argued against their use, as doing so was &quot;against the laws of God and Nature&quot;. This view was shared by others who followed, including Philipp Jakob Spener, Veit Riedlin and Johann Georg KrÃ¼nitz. Despite opposition, euthanasia continued to be practised, involving techniques such as bleeding, suffocation, and removing people from their beds to be placed on the cold ground.

Suicide and euthanasia became more accepted during the Age of Enlightenment. Thomas More wrote of euthanasia in &quot;Utopia&quot;, although it is not clear if More was intending to endorse the practice. Other cultures have taken different approaches: for example, in Japan suicide has not traditionally been viewed as a sin, as it is used in cases of honor, and accordingly, the perceptions of euthanasia are different from those in other parts of the world.

===Beginnings of the contemporary euthanasia debate===
In the mid-1800s, the use of morphine to treat &quot;the pains of death&quot; emerged, with John Warren recommending its use in 1848. A similar use of chloroform was revealed by Joseph Bullar in 1866. However, in neither case was it recommended that the use should be to hasten death. In 1870 Samuel Williams, a schoolteacher, initiated the contemporary euthanasia debate through a speech given at the Birmingham Speculative Club in England, which was subsequently published in a one-off publication entitled &quot;Essays of the Birmingham Speculative Club&quot;, the collected works of a number of members of an amateur philosophical society. Williams&#x27; proposal was to use chloroform to deliberately hasten the death of terminally ill patients:

The essay was favourably reviewed in &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;, but an editorial against the essay appeared in &quot;The Spectator&quot;. From there it proved to be influential, and other writers came out in support of such views: Lionel Tollemache wrote in favour of euthanasia, as did Annie Besant, the essayist and reformer who later became involved with the National Secular Society, considering it a duty to society to &quot;die voluntarily and painlessly&quot; when one reaches the point of becoming a &#x27;burden&#x27;. &quot;Popular Science&quot; analyzed the issue in May 1873, assessing both sides of the argument. Kemp notes that at the time, medical doctors did not participate in the discussion; it was &quot;essentially a philosophical enterpriseÂ ... tied inextricably to a number of objections to the Christian doctrine of the sanctity of human life&quot;.

=== Early euthanasia movement in the United States ===

The rise of the euthanasia movement in the United States coincided with the so-called Gilded Age, a time of social and technological change that encompassed an &quot;individualistic conservatism that praised laissez-faire economics, scientific method, and rationalism&quot;, along with major depressions, industrialisation and conflict between corporations and labour unions. It was also the period in which the modern hospital system was developed, which has been seen as a factor in the emergence of the euthanasia debate.

Robert Ingersoll argued for euthanasia, stating in 1894 that where someone is suffering from a terminal illness, such as terminal cancer, they should have a right to end their pain through suicide. Felix Adler offered a similar approach, although, unlike Ingersoll, Adler did not reject religion. In fact, he argued from an Ethical Culture framework. In 1891, Adler argued that those suffering from overwhelming pain should have the right to commit suicide, and, furthermore, that it should be permissible for a doctor to assist â thus making Adler the first &quot;prominent American&quot; to argue for suicide in cases where people were suffering from chronic illness. Both Ingersoll and Adler argued for voluntary euthanasia of adults suffering from terminal ailments. Dowbiggin argues that by breaking down prior moral objections to euthanasia and suicide, Ingersoll and Adler enabled others to stretch the definition of euthanasia.

The first attempt to legalise euthanasia took place in the United States, when Henry Hunt introduced legislation into the General Assembly of Ohio in 1906. Hunt did so at the behest of Anna Sophina Hall, a wealthy heiress who was a major figure in the euthanasia movement during the early 20th century in the United States. Hall had watched her mother die after an extended battle with liver cancer, and had dedicated herself to ensuring that others would not have to endure the same suffering. Towards this end she engaged in an extensive letter writing campaign, recruited Lurana Sheldon and Maud Ballington Booth, and organised a debate on euthanasia at the annual meeting of the American Humane Association in 1905 â described by Jacob Appel as the first significant public debate on the topic in the 20th century.

Hunt&#x27;s bill called for the administration of an anesthetic to bring about a patient&#x27;s death, so long as the person is of lawful age and sound mind, and was suffering from a fatal injury, an irrevocable illness, or great physical pain. It also required that the case be heard by a physician, required informed consent in front of three witnesses, and required the attendance of three physicians who had to agree that the patient&#x27;s recovery was impossible. A motion to reject the bill outright was voted down, but the bill failed to pass, 79 to 23.

Along with the Ohio euthanasia proposal, in 1906 Assemblyman Ross Gregory introduced a proposal to permit euthanasia to the Iowa legislature. However, the Iowa legislation was broader in scope than that offered in Ohio. It allowed for the death of any person of at least ten years of age who suffered from an ailment that would prove fatal and cause extreme pain, should they be of sound mind and express a desire to artificially hasten their death. In addition, it allowed for infants to be euthanised if they were sufficiently deformed, and permitted guardians to request euthanasia on behalf of their wards. The proposed legislation also imposed penalties on physicians who refused to perform euthanasia when requested: a 6â12-month prison term and a fine of between $200 and $1,000. The proposal proved to be controversial. It engendered considerable debate and failed to pass, having been withdrawn from consideration after being passed to the Committee on Public Health.

After 1906 the euthanasia debate reduced in intensity, resurfacing periodically, but not returning to the same level of debate until the 1930s in the United Kingdom.

Euthanasia opponent Ian Dowbiggin argues that the early membership of the Euthanasia Society of America (ESA) reflected how many perceived euthanasia at the time, often seeing it as a eugenics matter rather than an issue concerning individual rights. Dowbiggin argues that not every eugenist joined the ESA &quot;solely for eugenic reasons&quot;, but he postulates that there were clear ideological connections between the eugenics and euthanasia movements.

===1930s in Britain===
The Voluntary Euthanasia Legalisation Society was founded in 1935 by Charles Killick Millard (now called Dignity in Dying). The movement campaigned for the legalisation of euthanasia in Great Britain.

In January 1936, King George V was given a fatal dose of morphine and cocaine to hasten his death. At the time he was suffering from cardio-respiratory failure, and the decision to end his life was made by his physician, Lord Dawson. Although this event was kept a secret for over 50 years, the death of George V coincided with proposed legislation in the House of Lords to legalise euthanasia.

=== Nazi Euthanasia Program ===
A 24 July 1939 killing of a severely disabled infant in Nazi Germany was described in a BBC &quot;Genocide Under the Nazis Timeline&quot; as the first &quot;state-sponsored euthanasia&quot;. Parties that consented to the killing included Hitler&#x27;s office, the parents, and the Reich Committee for the Scientific Registration of Serious and Congenitally Based Illnesses. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; noted that the killing of the disabled infantâwhose name was Gerhard Kretschmar, born blind, with missing limbs, subject to convulsions, and reportedly &quot;an idiot&quot;â provided &quot;the rationale for a secret Nazi decree that led to &#x27;mercy killings&#x27; of almost 300,000 mentally and physically handicapped people&quot;. While Kretchmar&#x27;s killing received parental consent, most of the 5,000 to 8,000 children killed afterwards were forcibly taken from their parents.

The &quot;euthanasia campaign&quot; of mass murder gathered momentum on 14 January 1940 when the &quot;handicapped&quot; were killed with gas vans and at killing centres, eventually leading to the deaths of 70,000 adult Germans. was a campaign of mass murder by involuntary euthanasia in Nazi Germany. Its code name Aktion T4 is derived from Â 4, a street address of the Chancellery department which recruited and paid personnel associated with the program. Professor Robert Jay Lifton, author of &quot;The Nazi Doctors&quot; and a leading authority on the T4 program, contrasts this program with what he considers to be a genuine euthanasia. He explains that the Nazi version of &quot;euthanasia&quot; was based on the work of Adolf Jost, who published &quot;The Right to Death&quot; (Das Recht auf den Tod) in 1895. Lifton writes:

Jost argued that control over the death of the individual must ultimately belong to the social organism, the state. This concept is in direct opposition to the Anglo-American concept of euthanasia, which emphasizes the &quot;individual&#x27;s&quot; &#x27;right to die&#x27; or &#x27;right to death&#x27; or &#x27;right to his or her own death,&#x27; as the ultimate human claim. In contrast, Jost was pointing to the state&#x27;s right to kill.Â ... Ultimately the argument was biological: &#x27;The rights to death [are] the key to the fitness of life.&#x27; The state must own deathâmust killâin order to keep the social organism alive and healthy.

In modern terms, the use of &quot;euthanasia&quot; in the context of Aktion T4 is seen to be a to disguise a program of genocide, in which people were killed on the grounds of &quot;disabilities, religious beliefs, and discordant individual values&quot;. Compared to the discussions of euthanasia that emerged post-war, the Nazi program may have been worded in terms that appear similar to the modern use of &quot;euthanasia&quot;, but there was no &quot;mercy&quot; and the patients were not necessarily terminally ill. Despite these differences, historian and euthanasia opponent Ian Dowbiggin writes that &quot;the origins of Nazi euthanasia, like those of the American euthanasia movement, predate the Third Reich and were intertwined with the history of eugenics and Social Darwinism, and with efforts to discredit traditional morality and ethics.&quot;

=== 1949 New York State Petition for Euthanasia and Catholic opposition ===
On 6 January 1949, the Euthanasia Society of America presented to the New York State Legislature a petition to legalize euthanasia, signed by 379 leading Protestant and Jewish ministers, the largest group of religious leaders ever to have taken this stance. A similar petition had been sent to the New York Legislature in 1947, signed by approximately 1,000 New York physicians. Roman Catholic religious leaders criticized the petition, saying that such a bill would &quot;legalize a suicide-murder pact&quot; and a &quot;rationalization of the fifth commandment of God, &#x27;Thou Shalt Not Kill. The Right Reverend Robert E. McCormick stated that:

The petition brought tensions between the American Euthanasia Society and the Catholic Church to a head that contributed to a climate of anti-Catholic sentiment generally, regarding issues such as birth control, eugenics, and population control. However, the petition did not result in any legal changes.

==Debate==
Historically, the euthanasia debate has tended to focus on a number of key concerns. According to euthanasia opponent Ezekiel Emanuel, proponents of euthanasia have presented four main arguments: a) that people have a right to self-determination, and thus should be allowed to choose their own fate; b) assisting a subject to die might be a better choice than requiring that they continue to suffer; c) the distinction between passive euthanasia, which is often permitted, and active euthanasia, which is not substantive (or that the underlying principleâthe doctrine of double effectâis unreasonable or unsound); and d) permitting euthanasia will not necessarily lead to unacceptable consequences. Pro-euthanasia activists often point to countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, and states like Oregon, where euthanasia has been legalized, to argue that it is mostly unproblematic.

Similarly, Emanuel argues that there are four major arguments presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined with the use of effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is morally significant; and d) legalising euthanasia will place society on a slippery slope, which will lead to unacceptable consequences. In fact, in Oregon, in 2013, pain was not one of the top five reasons people sought euthanasia. Top reasons were a loss of dignity, and a fear of burdening others.

In the United States in 2013, 47% nationwide supported doctor-assisted suicide. This included 32% of Latinos, 29% of African-Americans. Some US disability rights organizations have also opposed bills legalizing assisted suicide.

A 2015 Populus poll in the United Kingdom found broad public support for assisted dying; 82% of people supported the introduction of assisted dying laws, including 86% of people with disabilities.

An alternative approach to the question is seen in the hospice movement which promotes palliative care for the dying and terminally ill. This has pioneered the use of pain-relieving drugs in a holistic atmosphere in which the patient&#x27;s spiritual care ranks alongside physical care. It &#x27;intends neither to hasten nor postpone death&#x27;.

==Legal status==

Eligibility for euthanasia varies across jurisdictions where it is legal. Some countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands allow euthanasia for mental illness.

West&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of American Law&quot; states that &quot;a &#x27;mercy killing&#x27; or euthanasia is generally considered to be a criminal homicide&quot; and is normally used as a synonym of homicide committed at a request made by the patient.

The judicial sense of the term &quot;homicide&quot; includes any intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, even to relieve intractable suffering. Not all homicide is unlawful. Two designations of homicide that carry no criminal punishment are justifiable and excusable homicide. In most countries this is not the status of euthanasia. The term &quot;euthanasia&quot; is usually confined to the active variety; the University of Washington website states that &quot;euthanasia generally means that the physician would act directly, for instance by giving a lethal injection, to end the patient&#x27;s life&quot;. Physician-assisted suicide is thus not classified as euthanasia by the US State of Oregon, where it is legal under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, and despite its name, it is not legally classified as suicide either. Unlike physician-assisted suicide, withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments with patient consent (voluntary) is almost unanimously considered, at least in the United States, to be legal. The use of pain medication to relieve suffering, even if it hastens death, has been held as legal in several court decisions.

Some governments around the world have legalized voluntary euthanasia but most commonly it is still considered to be criminal homicide. In the Netherlands and Belgium, where euthanasia has been legalized, it still remains homicide although it is not prosecuted and not punishable if the perpetrator (the doctor) meets certain legal conditions.

In a historic judgment, the Supreme Court of India legalized passive euthanasia. The apex court remarked in the judgment that the Constitution of India values liberty, dignity, autonomy, and privacy. A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra delivered a unanimous judgment.

==Health professionals&#x27; sentiment==
A 2010 survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians found that 16.3% of physicians would consider halting life-sustaining therapy because the family demanded it, even if they believed that it was premature. Approximately 54.5% would not, and the remaining 29.2% responded &quot;it depends&quot;. The study also found that 45.8% of physicians agreed that physician-assisted suicide should be allowed in some cases; 40.7% did not, and the remaining 13.5% felt it depended.

In the United Kingdom, the assisted dying campaign group Dignity in Dying cites research in which 54% of general practitioners support or are neutral towards a law change on assisted dying. Similarly, a 2017 Doctors.net.uk poll reported in the British Medical Journal stated that 55% of doctors believe assisted dying, in defined circumstances, should be legalised in the UK.

In 2019, the World Medical Association issued a statement during its 70th Assembly declaring itself opposed to euthanasia and assisted suicide.

==Religious views==
===Christianity===

====Broadly against====
The Roman Catholic Church condemns euthanasia and assisted suicide as morally wrong. As paragraph 2324 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states, &quot;Intentional euthanasia, whatever its forms or motives, is murder. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God, his Creator&quot;. Because of this, per the Declaration on Euthanasia, the practice is unacceptable within the Church. The Orthodox Church in America, along with other Eastern Orthodox Churches, also opposes euthanasia stating that &quot;euthanasia is the deliberate cessation of human life, and, as such, must be condemned as murder.&quot;

Many non-Catholic churches in the United States take a stance against euthanasia. Among Protestant denominations, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution in 1991 opposing euthanasia and assisted suicide stating that it is &quot;morally wrong and unacceptable to take a human life to relieve the suffering caused by incurable illnesses.&quot; Protestant and other non-Catholic churches which oppose euthanasia include:
* Assemblies of God
* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
* Church of the Nazarene
* Evangelical Lutheran Church in America 
* Presbyterian Church in America 
* Lutheran ChurchâMissouri Synod
* Reformed Church in America
* Salvation Army 
* Seventh-day Adventist Church 
* Southern Baptist Convention 
* United Methodist Church 
====Partially in favor of====
The Church of England accepts passive euthanasia under some circumstances, but is strongly against active euthanasia, and has led opposition against recent attempts to legalise it. The United Church of Canada accepts passive euthanasia under some circumstances, but is in general against active euthanasia, with growing acceptance now that active euthanasia has been partly legalised in Canada. The Waldensians take a liberal stance on euthanasia and allow the decision to lie with individuals.

===Islam===
Euthanasia is a complex issue in Islamic theology; however, in general it is considered contrary to Islamic law and holy texts. Among interpretations of the Qur&#x27;an and Hadith, the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide or helping one commit suicide. The various positions on the cessation of medical treatment are mixed and considered a different class of action than direct termination of life, especially if the patient is suffering. Suicide and euthanasia are both crimes in almost all Muslim majority countries.

===Judaism===

There is much debate on the topic of euthanasia in Judaic theology, ethics, and general opinion (especially in Israel and the United States). Passive euthanasia was declared legal by Israel&#x27;s highest court under certain conditions and has reached some level of acceptance. Active euthanasia remains illegal; however, the topic is actively under debate with no clear consensus through legal, ethical, theological and spiritual perspectives.

=== Hinduism ===
Although there is no absolute consensus, Hinduism generally views euthanasia as a serious act that conflicts with core principles such as Dharma (duty), Karma (actions and their consequences), and Ahimsa (non-violence).

<doc id="9588" wikidata="Q181508" url="?curid=9588" title="Extraterrestrial life">
<text>Extraterrestrial life, or alien life (colloquially, alien), is life that originates from another world rather than on Earth. No extraterrestrial life has yet been scientifically conclusively detected. Such life might range from simple forms such as prokaryotes to intelligent beings, possibly bringing forth civilizations that might be far more, or far less, advanced than humans. The Drake equation speculates about the existence of sapient life elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as astrobiology.

Speculation about the possibility of inhabited worlds beyond Earth dates back to antiquity. Early Christian writers discussed the idea of a &quot;plurality of worlds&quot; as proposed by earlier thinkers such as Democritus; Augustine references Epicurus&#x27;s idea of innumerable worlds &quot;throughout the boundless immensity of space&quot; in &quot;The City of God&quot;.

Pre-modern writers typically assumed extraterrestrial &quot;worlds&quot; were inhabited by living beings. William Vorilong, in the 15th century, acknowledged the possibility Jesus could have visited extraterrestrial worlds to redeem their inhabitants. Nicholas of Cusa wrote in 1440 that Earth is &quot;a brilliant star&quot; like other celestial objects visible in space; which would appear similar to the Sun, from an exterior perspective, due to a layer of &quot;fiery brightness&quot; in the outer layer of the atmosphere. He theorized all extraterrestrial bodies could be inhabited by men, plants, and animals, including the Sun. Descartes wrote that there were no means to prove the stars were not inhabited by &quot;intelligent creatures&quot;, but their existence was a matter of speculation.

When considering the atmospheric composition and ecosystems hosted by extraterrestrial bodies, extraterrestrial life can seem more speculation than reality, due to the harsh conditions and disparate chemical composition of the atmospheres, when compared to the life-abundant Earth. However, there are many extreme and chemically harsh ecosystems on Earth that do support forms of life and are often hypothesized to be the origin of life on Earth. Hydrothermal vents, acidic hot springs, and volcanic lakes are examples of life forming under difficult circumstances, provide parallels to the extreme environments on other planets and support the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

Since the mid-20th century, active research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life, encompassing searches for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Depending on the category of search, methods range from analysis of telescope and specimen data to radios used to detect and transmit communications.

The concept of extraterrestrial life, particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, especially extraterrestrials in fiction. Science fiction has communicated scientific ideas, imagined a range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives on extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to try to contact intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others â citing the tendency of technologically advanced human societies to enslave or destroy less advanced societies â argue it may be dangerous to actively draw attention to Earth.

==Context==

Initially, after the Big Bang, the universe was too hot to allow life. It is estimated that the temperature of the universe was around 10 billion K at the one second mark. 15 million years later, it cooled to temperate levels, but the elements that make up living things did not exist yet. The only freely available elements at that point were hydrogen and helium. Carbon and oxygen (and later, water) would not appear until 50 million years later, created through stellar fusion. At that point, the difficulty for life to appear was not the temperature, but the scarcity of free heavy elements. Planetary systems emerged, and the first organic compounds may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains that would eventually create rocky planets like Earth. Although Earth was in a molten state after its birth and may have burned any organics that fell in it, it would have been more receptive once it cooled down. Once the right conditions on Earth were met, life started by a chemical process known as abiogenesis. Alternatively, life may have formed less frequently, then spread â by meteoroids, for example â between habitable planets in a process called panspermia.

During most of its stellar evolution stars combine hydrogen nuclei to make helium nuclei by stellar fusion, and the comparatively lighter weight of helium allows the star to release the extra energy. The process continues until the star uses all of its available fuel, with the speed of consumption being related to the size of the star. During its last stages, stars start combining helium nuclei to form carbon nuclei. The higher-sized stars can further combine carbon nuclei to create oxygen and silicon, oxygen into neon and sulfur, and so on until iron. In the end, the star blows much of its content back into the stellar medium, where it would join clouds that would eventually become new generations of stars and planets. Many of those materials are the raw components of life on Earth. As this process takes place in all the universe, said materials are ubiquitous in the cosmos and not a rarity from the Solar System. 

Earth is a planet in the Solar System, a planetary system formed by a star at the center, the Sun, and the objects that orbit it: other planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The sun is part of the Milky Way, a galaxy. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, a galaxy group that is in turn part of the Laniakea Supercluster. The universe is composed of all similar structures in existence. The immense distances between celestial objects is a difficulty for the study of extraterrestrial life. So far, humans have only set foot on the Moon and sent robotic probes to other planets and moons in the Solar System. Although probes can withstand conditions that may be lethal to humans, the distances cause time delays: the &quot;New Horizons&quot; took nine years after launch to reach Pluto. No probe has ever reached extrasolar planetary systems. The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; has left the Solar System at a speed of 50,000 kilometers per hour, if it headed towards the Alpha Centauri system, the closest one to Earth at 4.4 light years, it would reach it in 100,000 years. Under current technology, such systems can only be studied by telescopes, which have limitations. It is estimated that dark matter has a larger amount of combined matter than stars and gas clouds, but as it plays no role on the stellar evolution of stars and planets, it is usually not taken into account by astrobiology. 

There is an area around a star, the circumstellar habitable zone or &quot;Goldilocks zone&quot;, where water may be at the right temperature to exist in liquid form at a planetary surface. This area is neither too close to the star, where water would become steam, nor too far away, where water would be frozen as ice. However, although useful as an approximation, planetary habitability is complex and defined by several factors. Being in the habitable zone is not enough for a planet to be habitable, not even to actually have such liquid water. Venus is located in the habitable zone of the Solar System but does not have liquid water because of the conditions of its atmosphere. Jovian planets or gas giants are not considered habitable even if they orbit close enough to their stars as hot Jupiters, due to crushing atmospheric pressures. The actual distances for the habitable zones vary according to the type of star, and even the solar activity of each specific star influences the local habitability. The type of star also defines the time the habitable zone will exist, as its presence and limits will change along with the star&#x27;s stellar evolution.

The Big Bang took place 13.8 billion years ago, the Solar System was formed 4.6 billion years ago, and the first hominids appeared 6 million years ago. Life on other planets may have started, evolved, given birth to extraterrestrial intelligences, and perhaps even faced a planetary extinction event millions or even billions of years ago. The brief times of existence of Earth&#x27;s species, when considered from a cosmic perspective, may suggest that extraterrestrial life may be equally fleeting under such a scale. 

During a period of about 7 million years, from about 10 to 17 million after the Big Bang, the background temperature was between , allowing the possibility of liquid water if any planets existed. 
Avi Loeb (2014) speculated that primitive life might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called &quot;the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe&quot;.

Life on Earth is quite ubiquitous across the planet and has adapted over time to almost all the available environments in it, extremophiles and the deep biosphere thrive at even the most hostile ones. As a result, it is inferred that life in other celestial bodies may be equally adaptive. However, the origin of life is unrelated to its ease of adaptation and may have stricter requirements. A celestial body may not have any life on it, even if it were habitable.

==Likelihood of existence==

It is unclear if life, and more importantly, intelligent life in the cosmos is ubiquitous or rare. The hypothesis of ubiquitous extraterrestrial life relies on three main ideas. The first one, the size of the universe allows for plenty of planets to have a similar habitability to Earth, and the age of the universe gives enough time for a long process analog to the history of Earth to happen there. The second is that the chemical elements that make up life, such as carbon and water, are ubiquitous in the universe. The third is that the physical laws are universal, which means that the forces that would facilitate or prevent the existence of life would be the same ones as on Earth. According to this argument, made by scientists such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, it would be improbable for life &quot;not&quot; to exist somewhere else other than Earth. This argument is embodied in the Copernican principle, which states that Earth does not occupy a unique position in the Universe, and the mediocrity principle, which states that there is nothing special about life on Earth.

Other authors consider instead that life in the cosmos, or at least multicellular life, may be actually rare. The Rare Earth hypothesis maintains that life on Earth is possible because of a series of factors that range from the location in the galaxy and the configuration of the Solar System to local characteristics of the planet, and that it is unlikely that all such requirements are simultaneously met by another planet. The proponents of this hypothesis consider that very little evidence suggests the existence of extraterrestrial life and that at this point it is just a desired result and not a reasonable scientific explanation for any gathered data.

In 1961, astronomer and astrophysicist Frank Drake devised the Drake equation as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The Drake equation is:
:formula_1
where:
:&quot;N&quot; = the number of Milky Way galaxy civilizations already capable of communicating across interplanetary space

and
:&quot;R&quot;* = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy
:&quot;f&quot;&quot;p&quot; = the fraction of those stars that have planets
:&quot;n&quot;&quot;e&quot; = the average number of planets that can potentially support life
:&quot;f&quot;&quot;l&quot; = the fraction of planets that actually support life
:&quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; = the fraction of planets with life that evolves to become intelligent life (civilisations)
:&quot;f&quot;&quot;c&quot; = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology to broadcast detectable signs of their existence into space
:&quot;L&quot; = the length of time over which such civilizations broadcast detectable signals into space

Drake&#x27;s proposed estimates are as follows, but numbers on the right side of the equation are agreed as speculative and open to substitution:

formula_2

The Drake equation has proved controversial since, although it is written as a math equation, none of its values were known at the time. Although some values may eventually be measured, others are based on social sciences and are not knowable by their very nature. This does not allow one to make noteworthy conclusions from the equation.

Based on observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, there are nearly 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. It is estimated that at least ten percent of all Sun-like stars have a system of planets, i.e. there are stars with planets orbiting them in the observable universe. Even if it is assumed that only one out of a billion of these stars has planets supporting life, there would be some 6.25Â  billion life-supporting planetary systems in the observable universe. A 2013 study based on results from the &quot;Kepler&quot; spacecraft estimated that the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100â400Â  billion exoplanets. The Nebular hypothesis that explains the formation of the Solar System and other planetary systems would suggest that those can have several configurations, and not all of them may have rocky planets within the habitable zone. 

The apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilisations and the lack of evidence for such civilisations is known as the Fermi paradox. Dennis W. Sciama claimed that life&#x27;s existence in the universe depends on various fundamental constants. Zhi-Wei Wang and Samuel L. Braunstein suggest that a random universe capable of supporting life is likely to be just barely able to do so, giving a potential explanation to the Fermi paradox.

==Biochemical basis==
If extraterrestrial life exists, it could range from simple microorganisms and multicellular organisms similar to animals or plants, to complex alien intelligences akin to humans. When scientists talk about extraterrestrial life, they consider all those types. Although it is possible that extraterrestrial life may have other configurations, scientists use the hierarchy of lifeforms from Earth for simplicity, as it is the only one known to exist.

The first basic requirement for life is an environment with non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which means that the thermodynamic equilibrium must be broken by a source of energy. The traditional sources of energy in the cosmos are the stars, such as for life on Earth, which depends on the energy of the sun. However, there are other alternative energy sources, such as volcanoes, plate tectonics, and hydrothermal vents. There are ecosystems on Earth in deep areas of the ocean that do not receive sunlight, and take energy from black smokers instead. Magnetic fields and radioactivity have also been proposed as sources of energy, although they would be less efficient ones.

Life on Earth requires water in a liquid state as a solvent in which biochemical reactions take place. It is highly unlikely that an abiogenesis process can start within a gaseous or solid medium: the atom speeds, either too fast or too slow, make it difficult for specific ones to meet and start chemical reactions. A liquid medium also allows the transport of nutrients and substances required for metabolism. Sufficient quantities of carbon and other elements, along with water, might enable the formation of living organisms on terrestrial planets with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth. Life based on ammonia rather than water has been suggested as an alternative, though this solvent appears less suitable than water. It is also conceivable that there are forms of life whose solvent is a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane, ethane or propane.

Another unknown aspect of potential extraterrestrial life would be the chemical elements that would compose it. Life on Earth is largely composed of carbon, but there could be other hypothetical types of biochemistry. A replacement for carbon would need to be able to create complex molecules, store information required for evolution, and be freely available in the medium. To create DNA, RNA, or a close analog, such an element should be able to bind its atoms with many others, creating complex and stable molecules. It should be able to create at least three covalent bonds: two for making long strings and at least a third to add new links and allow for diverse information. Only nine elements meet this requirement: boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony (three bonds), carbon, silicon, germanium and tin (four bonds). As for abundance, carbon, nitrogen, and silicon are the most abundant ones in the universe, far more than the others. On Earth&#x27;s crust the most abundant of those elements is silicon, in the Hydrosphere it is carbon and in the atmosphere, it is carbon and nitrogen. Silicon, however, has disadvantages over carbon. The molecules formed with silicon atoms are less stable, and more vulnerable to acids, oxygen, and light. An ecosystem of silicon-based lifeforms would require very low temperatures, high atmospheric pressure, an atmosphere devoid of oxygen, and a solvent other than water. The low temperatures required would add an extra problem, the difficulty to kickstart a process of abiogenesis to create life in the first place. Norman Horowitz, head of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory bioscience section for the Mariner and Viking missions from 1965 to 1976 considered that the great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide solutions, even exotic solutions, to the problems of survival of life on other planets. However, he also considered that the conditions found on Mars were incompatible with carbon based life. 

Even if extraterrestrial life is based on carbon and uses water as a solvent, like Earth life, it may still have a radically different biochemistry. Life is generally considered to be a product of natural selection. It has been proposed that to undergo natural selection a living entity must have the capacity to replicate itself, the capacity to avoid damage/decay, and the capacity to acquire and process resources in support of the first two capacities. Life on Earth started with an RNA world and later evolved to its current form, where some of the RNA tasks were transferred to DNA and proteins. Extraterrestrial life may still be stuck using RNA, or evolve into other configurations. It is unclear if our biochemistry is the most efficient one that could be generated, or which elements would follow a similar pattern. However, it is likely that, even if cells had a different composition to those from Earth, they would still have a cell membrane. Life on Earth jumped from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and from unicellular organisms to multicellular organisms through evolution. So far no alternative process to achieve such a result has been conceived, even if hypothetical. Evolution requires life to be divided into individual organisms, and no alternative organisation has been satisfactorily proposed either. At the basic level, membranes define the limit of a cell, between it and its environment, while remaining partially open to exchange energy and resources with it.

The evolution from simple cells to eukaryotes, and from them to multicellular lifeforms, is not guaranteed. The Cambrian explosion took place thousands of millions of years after the origin of life, and its causes are not fully known yet. On the other hand, the jump to multicellularity took place several times, which suggests that it could be a case of convergent evolution, and so likely to take place on other planets as well. Palaeontologist Simon Conway Morris considers that convergent evolution would lead to kingdoms similar to our plants and animals, and that many features are likely to develop in alien animals as well, such as bilateral symmetry, limbs, digestive systems and heads with sensory organs. Scientists from the University of Oxford analysed it from the perspective of evolutionary theory and wrote in a study in the International Journal of Astrobiology that aliens may be similar to humans. The planetary context would also have an influence: a planet with higher gravity would have smaller animals, and other types of stars can lead to non-green photosynthesizers. The amount of energy available would also affect biodiversity, as an ecosystem sustained by black smokers or hydrothermal vents would have less energy available than those sustained by a star&#x27;s light and heat, and so its lifeforms would not grow beyond a certain complexity. There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence. It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential niches a planet contains, and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments, which in turn can be computed from its niches.

=== Harsh environmental conditions on Earth harboring life ===
It is common knowledge that the conditions on other planets in the solar system, in addition to the many galaxies outside of the Milky Way galaxy, are very harsh and seem to be too extreme to harbor any life. The environmental conditions on these planets can have intense UV radiation paired with extreme temperatures, lack of water, and much more that can lead to conditions that don&#x27;t seem to favor the creation or maintenance of extraterrestrial life. However, there has been much historical evidence that some of the earliest and most basic forms of life on Earth originated in some extreme environments that seem unlikely to have harbored life at least at one point in Earth&#x27;s history. Fossil evidence as well as many historical theories backed up by years of research and studies have marked environments like hydrothermal vents or acidic hot springs as some of the first places that life could have originated on Earth. These environments can be considered extreme when compared to the typical ecosystems that the majority of life on Earth now inhabit, as hydrothermal vents are scorching hot due to the magma escaping from the Earth&#x27;s mantle and meeting the much colder oceanic water. Even in today&#x27;s world, there can be a diverse population of bacteria found inhabiting the area surrounding these hydrothermal vents which can suggest that some form of life can be supported even in the harshest of environments like the other planets in the solar system.

The aspects of these harsh environments that make them ideal for the origin of life on Earth, as well as the possibility of creation of life on other planets, is the chemical reactions forming spontaneously. For example, the hydrothermal vents found on the ocean floor are known to support many chemosynthetic processes which allow organisms to utilize energy through reduced chemical compounds that fix carbon. In return, these reactions will allow for organisms to live in relatively low oxygenated environments while maintaining enough energy to support themselves. The early Earth environment was reducing and therefore, these carbon fixing compounds were necessary for the survival and possible origin of life on Earth. With the little amount of information that scientists have found regarding the atmosphere on other planets in the Milky Way galaxy and beyond, the atmospheres are most likely reducing or with very low oxygen levels, especially when compared with Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. If there were the necessary elements and ions on these planets, the same carbon fixing, reduced chemical compounds occurring around hydrothermal vents could also occur on these planets&#x27; surfaces and possibly result in the origin of extraterrestrial life.

==Planetary habitability in the Solar System==
The Solar System has a wide variety of planets, dwarf planets, and moons, and each one is studied for its potential to host life. Each one has its own specific conditions that may benefit or harm life. So far, the only lifeforms found are those from Earth. No extraterrestrial intelligence other than humans exists or has ever existed within the Solar System. Astrobiologist Mary Voytek points out that it would be unlikely to find large ecosystems, as they would have already been detected by now.

The inner Solar System is likely devoid of life. However, Venus is still of interest to astrobiologists, as it is a terrestrial planet that was likely similar to Earth in its early stages and developed in a different way. There is a greenhouse effect, the surface is the hottest in the Solar System, sulfuric acid clouds, all surface liquid water is lost, and it has a thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere with huge pressure. Comparing both helps to understand the precise differences that lead to beneficial or harmful conditions for life. And despite the conditions against life on Venus, there are suspicions that microbial life-forms may still survive in high-altitude clouds.

Mars is a cold and almost airless desert, inhospitable to life. However, recent studies revealed that water on Mars used to be quite abundant, forming rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans. Mars may have been habitable back then, and life on Mars may have been possible. But when the planetary core ceased to generate a magnetic field, solar winds removed the atmosphere and the planet became vulnerable to solar radiation. Ancient life-forms may still have left fossilised remains, and microbes may still survive deep underground.

As mentioned, the gas giants and ice giants are unlikely to contain life. The most distant solar system bodies, found in the Kuiper Belt and outwards, are locked in permanent deep-freeze, but cannot be ruled out completely.

Although the giant planets themselves are highly unlikely to have life, there is much hope to find it on moons orbiting these planets. Europa, from the Jovian system, has a subsurface ocean below a thick layer of ice. Ganymede and Callisto also have subsurface oceans, but life is less likely in them because water is sandwiched between layers of solid ice. Europa would have contact between the ocean and the rocky surface, which helps the chemical reactions. It may be difficult to dig so deep in order to study those oceans, though. Enceladus, a tiny moon of Saturn with another subsurface ocean, may not need to be dug, as it releases water to space in eruption columns. The space probe &quot;Cassini&quot; flew inside one of these, but could not make a full study because NASA did not expect this phenomenon and did not equip the probe to study ocean water. Still, &quot;Cassini&quot; detected complex organic molecules, salts, evidence of hydrothermal activity, hydrogen, and methane.

Titan is the only celestial body in the Solar System besides Earth that has liquid bodies on the surface. It has rivers, lakes, and rain of hydrocarbons, methane, and ethane, and even a cycle similar to Earth&#x27;s water cycle. This special context encourages speculations about lifeforms with different biochemistry, but the cold temperatures would make such chemistry take place at a very slow pace. Water is rock-solid on the surface, but Titan does have a subsurface water ocean like several other moons. However, it is of such a great depth that it would be very difficult to access it for study.

==Scientific search==

The science that searches and studies life in the universe, both on Earth and elsewhere, is called astrobiology. With the study of Earth&#x27;s life, the only known form of life, astrobiology seeks to study how life starts and evolves and the requirements for its continuous existence. This helps to determine what to look for when searching for life in other celestial bodies. This is a complex area of study, and uses the combined perspectives of several scientific disciplines, such as astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric sciences.

The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly. , 3,667 exoplanets in 2,747 systems have been identified, and other planets and moons in the Solar System hold the potential for hosting primitive life such as microorganisms. As of 8 February 2021, an updated status of studies considering the possible detection of lifeforms on Venus (via phosphine) and Mars (via methane) was reported.

===Search for basic life===
Scientists search for biosignatures within the Solar System by studying planetary surfaces and examining meteorites. Some claim to have identified evidence that microbial life has existed on Mars. In 1996, a controversial report stated that structures resembling nanobacteria were discovered in a meteorite, ALH84001, formed of rock ejected from Mars. Although all the unusual properties of the meteorite were eventually explained as the result of inorganic processes, the controversy over its discovery laid the groundwork for the development of astrobiology.

An experiment on the two Viking Mars landers reported gas emissions from heated Martian soil samples that some scientists argue are consistent with the presence of living microorganisms. Lack of corroborating evidence from other experiments on the same samples suggests that a non-biological reaction is a more likely hypothesis.

In February 2005 NASA scientists reported they may have found some evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars. The two scientists, Carol Stoker and Larry Lemke of NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center, based their claim on methane signatures found in Mars&#x27;s atmosphere resembling the methane production of some forms of primitive life on Earth, as well as on their own study of primitive life near the Rio Tinto river in Spain. NASA officials soon distanced NASA from the scientists&#x27; claims, and Stoker herself backed off from her initial assertions.

In November 2011, NASA launched the Mars Science Laboratory that landed the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover on Mars. It is designed to assess the past and present habitability on Mars using a variety of scientific instruments. The rover landed on Mars at Gale Crater in August 2012.

A group of scientists at Cornell University started a catalog of microorganisms, with the way each one reacts to sunlight. The goal is to help with the search for similar organisms in exoplanets, as the starlight reflected by planets rich in such organisms would have a specific spectrum, unlike that of starlight reflected from lifeless planets. If Earth was studied from afar with this system, it would reveal a shade of green, as a result of the abundance of plants with photosynthesis.

In August 2011, NASA studied meteorites found on Antarctica, finding adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine and xanthine. Adenine and guanine are components of DNA, and the others are used in other biological processes. The studies ruled out pollution of the meteorites on Earth, as those components would not be freely available the way they were found in the samples. This discovery suggests that several organic molecules that serve as building blocks of life may be generated within asteroids and comets. In October 2011, scientists reported that cosmic dust contains complex organic compounds (&quot;amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure&quot;) that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. It is still unclear if those compounds played a role in the creation of life on Earth, but Sun Kwok, of the University of Hong Kong, thinks so. &quot;If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life.&quot;

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at Copenhagen University reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, glycolaldehyde, in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary &quot;IRAS 16293-2422&quot;, which is located 400 light years from Earth. Glycolaldehyde is needed to form ribonucleic acid, or RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation.

In December 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the plumes of Enceladus, moon of the planet Saturn, of hydrogen cyanide, a possible chemical essential for life as we know it, as well as other organic molecules, some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, &quot;these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant microbial communities or drive complex organic synthesis leading to the origin of life.&quot;

===Search for extraterrestrial intelligences===
Although most searches are focused on the biology of extraterrestrial life, an extraterrestrial intelligence capable enough to develop a civilization may be detectable by other means as well. Technology may generate technosignatures, effects on the native planet that may not be caused by natural causes. There are three main types of techno-signatures considered: interstellar communications, effects on the atmosphere, and planetary-sized structures such as Dyson spheres.

Organizations such as the SETI Institute search the cosmos for potential forms of communication. They started with radio waves, and now search for laser pulses as well. The challenge for this search is that there are natural sources of such signals as well, such as gamma-ray bursts and supernovae, and the difference between a natural signal and an artificial one would be in its specific patterns. Astronomers intend to use artificial intelligence for this, as it can manage large amounts of data and is devoid of biases and preconceptions. Besides, even if there is an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, there is no guarantee that it is transmitting radio communications in the direction of Earth. The length of time required for a signal to travel across space means that a potential answer may arrive decades or centuries after the initial message.

The atmosphere of Earth is rich in nitrogen dioxide as a result of air pollution, which can be detectable. The natural abundance of carbon, which is also relatively reactive, makes it likely to be a basic component of the development of a potential extraterrestrial technological civilization, as it is on Earth. Fossil fuels may likely be generated and used on such worlds as well. The abundance of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere can also be a clear technosignature, considering their role in ozone depletion. Light pollution may be another technosignature, as multiple lights on the night side of a rocky planet can be a sign of advanced technological development. However, modern telescopes are not strong enough to study exoplanets with the required level of detail to perceive it.

The Kardashev scale proposes that a civilization may eventually start consuming energy directly from its local star. This would require giant structures built next to it, called Dyson spheres. Those speculative structures would cause an excess infrared radiation, that telescopes may notice. The infrared radiation is typical of young stars, surrounded by dusty protoplanetary disks that will eventually form planets. An older star such as the Sun would have no natural reason to have excess infrared radiation. The presence of heavy elements in a star&#x27;s light-spectrum is another potential biosignature; such elements would (in theory) be found if the star were being used as an incinerator/repository for nuclear waste products.

===Extrasolar planets===

Some astronomers search for extrasolar planets that may be conducive to life, narrowing the search to terrestrial planets within the habitable zones of their stars. Since 1992, over four thousand exoplanets have been discovered ( planets in planetary systems including multiple planetary systems as of ).

The extrasolar planets so far discovered range in size from that of terrestrial planets similar to Earth&#x27;s size to that of gas giants larger than Jupiter. The number of observed exoplanets is expected to increase greatly in the coming years. The Kepler space telescope has also detected a few thousand candidate planets, of which about 11% may be false positives.

There is at least one planet on average per star. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an &quot;Earth-sized&quot; planet in the habitable zone, with the nearest expected to be within 12 light-years distance from Earth. Assuming 200Â billion stars in the Milky Way, that would be 11Â billion potentially habitable Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, rising to 40Â billion if red dwarfs are included. The rogue planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the trillions.

The nearest known exoplanet is Proxima Centauri b, located from Earth in the southern constellation of Centaurus.

, the least massive exoplanet known is PSR B1257+12 A, which is about twice the mass of the Moon. The most massive planet listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive is DENIS-P J082303.1â491201 b, about 29 times the mass of Jupiter, although according to most definitions of a planet, it is too massive to be a planet and may be a brown dwarf instead. Almost all of the planets detected so far are within the Milky Way, but there have also been a few possible detections of extragalactic planets. The study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.

One sign that a planet probably already contains life is the presence of an atmosphere with significant amounts of oxygen, since that gas is highly reactive and generally would not last long without constant replenishment. This replenishment occurs on Earth through photosynthetic organisms. One way to analyse the atmosphere of an exoplanet is through spectrography when it transits its star, though this might only be feasible with dim stars like white dwarfs.

==History and cultural impact==

===Cosmic pluralism===

The modern concept of extraterrestrial life is based on assumptions that were not commonplace during the early days of astronomy. The first explanations for the celestial objects seen in the night sky were based on mythology. Scholars from Ancient Greece were the first to consider that the universe is inherently understandable and rejected explanations based on supernatural incomprehensible forces, such as the myth of the Sun being pulled across the sky in the chariot of Apollo. They had not developed the scientific method yet and based their ideas on pure thought and speculation, but they developed precursor ideas to it, such as that explanations had to be discarded if they contradict observable facts. The discussions of those Greek scholars established many of the pillars that would eventually lead to the idea of extraterrestrial life, such as Earth being round and not flat. The cosmos was first structured in a geocentric model that considered that the sun and all other celestial bodies revolve around Earth. However, they did not consider them as worlds. In Greek understanding, the world was composed by both Earth and the celestial objects with noticeable movements. Anaximander thought that the cosmos was made from &quot;apeiron&quot;, a substance that created the world, and that the world would eventually return to the cosmos.

Eventually two groups emerged, the &quot;atomists&quot; that thought that matter at both Earth and the cosmos was equally made of small atoms of the classical elements (earth, water, fire and air), and the &quot;Aristotelians&quot; who thought that those elements were exclusive of Earth and that the cosmos was made of a fifth one, the &quot;aether&quot;. Atomist Epicurus thought that the processes that created the world, its animals and plants should have created other worlds elsewhere, along with their own animals and plants. Aristotle thought instead that all the earth element naturally fell towards the center of the universe, and that would make it impossible for other planets to exist elsewhere. Under that reasoning, Earth was not only in the center, it was also the only planet in the universe.

Cosmic pluralism, the plurality of worlds, or simply pluralism, describes the philosophical belief in numerous &quot;worlds&quot; in addition to Earth, which might harbor extraterrestrial life. The earliest recorded assertion of extraterrestrial human life is found in ancient scriptures of Jainism. There are multiple &quot;worlds&quot; mentioned in Jain scriptures that support human life. These include, among others, &quot;Bharat Kshetra&quot;, &quot;Mahavideh Kshetra&quot;, &quot;Airavat Kshetra&quot;, and &quot;Hari kshetra&quot;. Medieval Muslim writers like Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Muhammad al-Baqir supported cosmic pluralism on the basis of the Qur&#x27;an. Chaucer&#x27;s poem &quot;The House of Fame&quot; engaged in medieval thought experiments that postulated the plurality of worlds. However, those ideas about other worlds were different from the current knowledge about the structure of the universe, and did not postulate the existence of planetary systems other than the Solar System. When those authors talk about other worlds, they talk about places located at the center of their own systems, and with their own stellar vaults and cosmos surrounding them.

The Greek ideas and the disputes between atomists and Aristotelians outlived the fall of the Greek empire. The Great Library of Alexandria compiled information about it, part of which was translated by Islamic scholars and thus survived the end of the Library. Baghdad combined the knowledge of the Greeks, the Indians, the Chinese and its own scholars, and the knowledge expanded through the Byzantine Empire. From there it eventually returned to Europe by the time of the Middle Ages. However, as the Greek atomist doctrine held that the world was created by random movements of atoms, with no need for a creator deity, it became associated with atheism, and the dispute intertwined with religious ones. Still, the Church did not react to those topics in a homogeneous way, and there were stricter and more permissive views within the church itself.

The first known mention of the term &#x27;panspermia&#x27; was in the writings of the 5th-century BC Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. He proposed the idea that life exists everywhere.

===Early modern period===

By the time of the late Middle Ages there were many known inaccuracies in the geocentric model, but it was kept in use because naked eye observations provided limited data. Nicolaus Copernicus started the Copernican Revolution by proposing that the planets revolve around the sun rather than Earth. His proposal had little acceptance at first because, as he kept the assumption that orbits were perfect circles, his model led to as many inaccuracies as the geocentric one. Tycho Brahe improved the available data with naked-eye observatories, which worked with highly complex sextants and quadrants. Tycho could not make sense of his observations, but Johannes Kepler did: orbits were not perfect circles, but ellipses. This knowledge benefited the Copernican model, which worked now almost perfectly. The invention of the telescope a short time later, perfected by Galileo Galilei, clarified the final doubts, and the paradigm shift was completed. Under this new understanding, the notion of extraterrestrial life became feasible: if Earth is but just a planet orbiting around a star, there may be planets similar to Earth elsewhere. The astronomical study of distant bodies also proved that physical laws are the same elsewhere in the universe as on Earth, with nothing making the planet truly special.

The new ideas were met with resistance from the Catholic church. Galileo was tried for the heliocentric model, which was considered heretical, and forced to recant it. The best-known early-modern proponent of ideas of extraterrestrial life was the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own planetary system. Bruno wrote that other worlds &quot;have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth&quot; and, like Earth, &quot;contain animals and inhabitants&quot;. Bruno&#x27;s belief in the plurality of worlds was one of the charges leveled against him by the Venetian Holy Inquisition, which trialed and executed him.

The heliocentric model was further strengthened by the postulation of the theory of gravity by Sir Isaac Newton. This theory provided the mathematics that explains the motions of all things in the universe, including planetary orbits. By this point, the geocentric model was definitely discarded. By this time, the use of the scientific method had become a standard, and new discoveries were expected to provide evidence and rigorous mathematical explanations. Science also took a deeper interest in the mechanics of natural phenomena, trying to explain not just the way nature works but also the reasons for working that way.

There was very little actual discussion about extraterrestrial life before this point, as the Aristotlean ideas remained influential while geocentrism was still accepted. When it was finally proved wrong, it not only meant that Earth was not the center of the universe, but also that the lights seen in the sky were not just lights, but physical objects. The notion that life may exist in them as well soon became an ongoing topic of discussion, although one with no practical ways to investigate.

The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. William Herschel, the discoverer of Uranus, was one of many 18thâ19th-century astronomers who believed that the Solar System is populated by alien life. Other scholars of the period who championed &quot;cosmic pluralism&quot; included Immanuel Kant and Benjamin Franklin. At the height of the Enlightenment, even the Sun and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants.

===19th century===

Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation of apparent Martian canals â which soon, however, turned out to be optical illusions. Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer Percival Lowell published his book &quot;Mars,&quot; followed by &quot;Mars and its Canals&quot; in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilisation. 

Spectroscopic analysis of Mars&#x27;s atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer William Wallace Campbell showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the Martian atmosphere. By 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.

As a consequence of the belief in the spontaneous generation there was little thought about the conditions of each celestial body: it was simply assumed that life would thrive anywhere. This theory was disproved by Louis Pasteur in the 19th century. Popular belief in thriving alien civilisations elsewhere in the solar system still remained strong until Mariner 4 and Mariner 9 provided close images of Mars, which debunked forever the idea of the existence of Martians and decreased the previous expectations of finding alien life in general. The end of the spontaneous generation belief forced to investigate the origin of life. Although abiogenesis is the more accepted theory, a number of authors reclaimed the term &quot;panspermia&quot; and proposed that life was brought to Earth from elsewhere. Some of those authors are JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius (1834), Kelvin (1871), Hermann von Helmholtz (1879) and, somewhat later, by Svante Arrhenius (1903).

The science fiction genre, although not so named during the time, developed during the late 19th century. The expansion of the genre of extraterrestrials in fiction influenced the popular perception over the real-life topic, making people eager to jump to conclusions about the discovery of aliens. Science marched at a slower pace, some discoveries fueled expectations and others dashed excessive hopes. For example, with the advent of telescopes, most structures seen on the Moon or Mars were immediately attributed to Selenites or Martians, and later ones (such as more powerful telescopes) revealed that all such discoveries were natural features. A famous case is the Cydonia region of Mars, first imaged by the &quot;Viking 1&quot; orbiter. The low-resolution photos showed a rock formation that resembled a human face, but later spacecraft took photos in higher detail that showed that there was nothing special about the site.

===Recent history===
The search and study of extraterrestrial life became a science of its own, astrobiology. Also known as &quot;exobiology&quot;, this discipline is studied by the NASA, the ESA, the INAF, and others. Astrobiology studies life from Earth as well, but with a cosmic perspective. For example, abiogenesis is of interest to astrobiology, not because of the origin of life on Earth, but for the chances of a similar process taking place in other celestial bodies. Many aspects of life, from its definition to its chemistry, are analyzed as either likely to be similar in all forms of life across the cosmos or only native to Earth. Astrobiology, however, remains constrained by the current lack of extraterrestrial life-forms to study, as all life on Earth comes from the same ancestor, and it is hard to infer general characteristics from a group with a single example to analyse.

The 20th century came with great technological advances, speculations about future hypothetical technologies, and an increased basic knowledge of science by the general population thanks to science divulgation through the mass media. The public interest in extraterrestrial life and the lack of discoveries by mainstream science led to the emergence of pseudosciences that provided affirmative, if questionable, answers to the existence of aliens. Ufology claims that many unidentified flying objects (UFOs) would be spaceships from alien species, and ancient astronauts hypothesis claim that aliens would have visited Earth in antiquity and prehistoric times but people would have failed to understand it by then. Most UFOs or UFO sightings can be readily explained as sightings of Earth-based aircraft (including top-secret aircraft), known astronomical objects or weather phenomenons, or as hoaxes.

Looking beyond the pseudosciences, Lewis White Beck strove to elevate the level of public discourse on the topic of extraterrestrial life by tracing the evolution of philosophical thought over the centuries from ancient times into the modern era. His review of the contributions made by Lucretius, Plutarch, Aristotle, Copernicus, Immanuel Kant, John Wilkins, Charles Darwin and Karl Marx demonstrated that even in modern times, humanity could be profoundly influenced in its search for extraterrestrial life by subtle and comforting archetypal ideas which are largely derived from firmly held religious, philosophical and existential belief systems. On a positive note, however, Beck further argued that even if the search for extraterrestrial life proves to be unsuccessful, the endeavor itself could have beneficial consequences by assisting humanity in its attempt to actualize superior ways of living here on Earth.
By the 21st century, it was accepted that multicellular life in the Solar System can only exist on Earth, but the interest in extraterrestrial life increased regardless. This is a result of the advances in several sciences. The knowledge of planetary habitability allows to consider on scientific terms the likelihood of finding life at each specific celestial body, as it is known which features are beneficial and harmful for life. Astronomy and telescopes also improved to the point exoplanets can be confirmed and even studied, increasing the number of search places. Life may still exist elsewhere in the Solar System in unicellular form, but the advances in spacecraft allow to send robots to study samples in situ, with tools of growing complexity and reliability. Although no extraterrestrial life has been found and life may still be just a rarity from Earth, there are scientific reasons to suspect that it can exist elsewhere, and technological advances that may detect it if it does.

Many scientists are optimistic about the chances of finding alien life. In the words of SETI&#x27;s Frank Drake, &quot;All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters&quot;. Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating habitability criteria on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The Wow! signal, detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.

On the other hand, other scientists are pessimistic. Jacques Monod wrote that &quot;Man knows at last that he is alone in the indifferent immensity of the universe, whence which he has emerged by chance&quot;. In 2000, geologist and paleontologist Peter Ward and astrobiologist Donald Brownlee published a book entitled &quot;Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe&quot;. In it, they discussed the Rare Earth hypothesis, in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the universe, whereas microbial life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics such as DNA and carbon.

As for the possible risks, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking warned in 2010 that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. &quot;If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn&#x27;t turn out well for the Native Americans&quot;, he said. Jared Diamond had earlier expressed similar concerns. On 20 July 2015, Hawking and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, along with the SETI Institute, announced a well-funded effort, called the Breakthrough Initiatives, to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life. The group contracted the services of the 100-meter Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia in the United States and the 64-meter Parkes Telescope in New South Wales, Australia. On 13 February 2015, scientists (including Geoffrey Marcy, Seth Shostak, Frank Drake and David Brin) at a convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent extraterrestrials in the Cosmos was a good idea; one result was a statement, signed by many, that a &quot;worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent&quot;.

==Government responses==
The 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement define rules of planetary protection against potentially hazardous extraterrestrial life. COSPAR also provides guidelines for planetary protection. A committee of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs had in 1977 discussed for a year strategies for interacting with extraterrestrial life or intelligence. The discussion ended without any conclusions. As of 2010, the UN lacks response mechanisms for the case of an extraterrestrial contact.

One of the NASA divisions is the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA), also known as the Planetary Protection Office. A part of its mission is to &quot;rigorously preclude backward contamination of Earth by extraterrestrial life.&quot;

In 2016, the Chinese Government released a white paper detailing its space program. According to the document, one of the research objectives of the program is the search for extraterrestrial life. It is also one of the objectives of the Chinese Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) program.

In 2020, Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Russian space agency, said the search for extraterrestrial life is one of the main goals of deep space research. 
He also acknowledged the possibility of existence of primitive life on other planets of the Solar System.

The French space agency has an office for the study of &quot;non-identified aero spatial phenomena&quot;. The agency is maintaining a publicly accessible database of such phenomena, with over 1600 detailed entries. According to the head of the office, the vast majority of entries have a mundane explanation; but for 25% of entries, their extraterrestrial origin can neither be confirmed nor denied.

In 2020, chairman of the Israel Space Agency Isaac Ben-Israel stated that the probability of detecting life in outer space is &quot;quite large&quot;. But he disagrees with his former colleague Haim Eshed who stated that there are contacts between an advanced alien civilisation and some of Earth&#x27;s governments.

==In fiction==
Although the idea of extraterrestrial peoples became feasible once astronomy developed enough to understand the nature of planets, they were not thought of as being any different from humans. Having no scientific explanation for the origin of mankind and its relation to other species, there was no reason to expect them to be any other way. This was changed by the 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; by Charles Darwin, which proposed the theory of evolution. Now with the notion that evolution on other planets may take other directions, science fiction authors created bizarre aliens, clearly distinct from humans. A usual way to do that was to add body features from other animals, such as insects or octopuses. Costuming and special effects feasibility alongside budget considerations forced films and TV series to tone down the fantasy, but these limitations lessened since the 1990s with the advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI), and later on as CGI became more effective and less expensive.

Real-life events sometimes captivate people&#x27;s imagination and this influences the works of fiction. For example, during the Barney and Betty Hill incident, the first recorded claim of an alien abduction, the couple reported that they were abducted and experimented on by aliens with oversized heads, big eyes, pale grey skin, and small noses, a description that eventually became the grey alien archetype once used in works of fiction.

<text>European Strategic Programme on Research in Information Technology (ESPRIT) was a series of integrated programmes of information technology research and development projects and industrial technology transfer measures. It was a European Union initiative managed by the Directorate General for Industry (DG III) of the European Commission.

==Programmes==
Five ESPRIT programmes (ESPRIT 0 to ESPRIT 4) ran consecutively from 1983 to 1998. ESPRIT 4 was succeeded by the Information Society Technologies (IST) programme in 1999.

==Projects==
Some of the projects and products supported by ESPRIT were: 

* BBC Domesday Project, a partnership between Acorn Computers Ltd, Philips, Logica and the BBC with some funding from the European Commission&#x27;s ESPRIT programme, to mark the 900th anniversary of the original Domesday Book, an 11th-century census of England. It is frequently cited as an example of digital obsolescence on account of the physical medium used for data storage.
* CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) is a software library that aims to provide easy access to efficient and reliable algorithms in computational geometry. While primarily written in C++, Python bindings are also available. The original funding for the project came from the ESPRIT project.
* Eurocoop &amp; Eurocode: ESPRIT III projects to develop systems for supporting distributed collaborative working.
* Open Document Architecture, a free and open international standard document file format maintained by the ITU-T to replace all proprietary document file formats. In 1985 ESPRIT financed a pilot implementation of the ODA concept, involving, among others, Bull corporation, Olivetti, ICL and Siemens AG.
* Paradise: A sub-project of the ESPRIT I project, COSINE which established a pan-European computer-based network infrastructure that enabled research workers to communicate with each other using OSI. Paradise implemented a distributed X.500 directory across the academic community.
* Password: Part of the ESPRIT III VALUE project, developed secure applications based on the X.509 standard for use in the academic community.
* ProCoS I Project (1989â1991), ProCoS II Project (1992â1995), and ProCoS-WG Working Group (1994â1997) on Provably Correct Systems, under ESPRIT II.
* REDO Project (1989â1992) on software maintenance, under ESPRIT II.
* RAISE, Rigorous Approach to Industrial Software Engineering, was developed as part of the European ESPRIT II LaCoS project in the 1990s, led by Dines BjÃ¸rner.
* REMORA methodology is an event-driven approach for designing information systems, developed by Colette Rolland. This methodology integrates behavioral and temporal aspects with concepts for modelling the structural aspects of an information system. In the ESPRIT I project TODOS, which has led to the development of an integrated environment for the design of office information systems (OISs),
* SAMPA: The Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet (SAMPA) is a computer-readable phonetic script originally developed in the late 1980s.
* SCOPES: The Systematic Concurrent design of Products, Equipments and Control Systems project was a 3-year project launched in July, 1992, with the aim of specifying integrated computer-aided (CAD) tools for design and control of flexible assembly lines. 
* SIP (Advanced Algorithms and Architectures for Speech and Image Processing), a partnership between Thomson-CSF, AEG, CSELT and ENSPS (ESPRIT P26), to develop the algorithmic and architectural techniques required for recognizing and understanding spoken or visual signals and to demonstrate these techniques in suitable applications.
* StatLog: &quot;ESPRIT project 5170. Comparative testing and evaluation of statistical and logical learning algorithms on large-scale applications to classification, prediction and control&quot;
* SUNDIAL (Speech UNderstanding DIALgue) started in September 1988 with Logica Ltd. as prime contractor, together with Erlangen University, CSELT, Daimler-Benz, Capgemini, Politecnico di Torino. Followed the Esprit P.26 to implement and evaluate dialogue systems to be used in telephone industry. The final results were 4 prototypes in 4 languages, involving speech and understanding technologies, and some criteria for evaluation were also reported.
* Web for Schools, an ESPRIT IV project that introduced the World Wide Web in secondary schools in Europe. Teachers created more than 70 international collaborative educational projects that resulted in an exponential growth of teacher communities and educational activities using the World Wide Web
* AGENT: A project led by IGN-France aiming at developing an operational automated map generalisation software based on multi-agent system paradigm.

<text>Edward Estlin Cummings (October 14, 1894 â September 3, 1962), commonly known as e e cummings or E. E. Cummings, was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. During World War I, he worked as an ambulance driver and was imprisoned in an internment camp, which provided the basis for his novel &quot;The Enormous Room&quot; in 1922. The following year he published his first collection of poetry, &quot;Tulips and Chimneys&quot;, which showed his early experiments with grammar and typography. He wrote four plays; &quot;HIM&quot; (1927) and &quot;Santa Claus: A Morality&quot; (1946) were the most successful ones. He wrote &quot;EIMI&quot; (1933), a travelog of the Soviet Union, and delivered the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures in poetry, published as &quot;iâsix nonlectures&quot; (1953). &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; (1965), a collection of short stories, was published posthumously. 

Cummings wrote approximately 2,900 poems. He is often regarded as one of the most important American poets of the 20th century. He is associated with modernist free-form poetry, and much of his work uses idiosyncratic syntax and lower-case spellings for poetic expression. M. L. Rosenthal wrote:
For Norman Friedman, Cummings&#x27;s inventions &quot;are best understood as various ways of stripping the film of familiarity from language to strip the film of familiarity from the world. Transform the word, he seems to have felt, and you are on the way to transforming the world.&quot;

The poet Randall Jarrell said of Cummings, &quot;No one else has ever made avant-garde, experimental poems so attractive to the general and the special reader.&quot; James Dickey wrote, &quot;I think that Cummings is a daringly original poet, with more vitality and more sheer, uncompromising talent than any other living American writer.&quot; Dickey described himself as &quot;ashamed and even a little guilty in picking out flaws&quot; in Cummings&#x27;s poetry, which he compared to noting &quot;the aesthetic defects in a rose. It is better to say what must finally be said about Cummings: that he has helped to give life to the language.&quot;

==Life==

===Early years===
Edward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Edward Cummings and Rebecca Haswell (), a well-known Unitarian upper-class couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University who later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Edward and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings&#x27;s parents supported his creative gifts. Cummings wrote poems and drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of family friends such as the philosophers William James and Josiah Royce. Many of Cummings&#x27;s summers were spent on Silver Lake in Madison, New Hampshire, where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby Joy Farm where Cummings had his primary summer residence.

He expressed transcendental leanings his entire life. As he matured, Cummings moved to an &quot;I, Thou&quot; relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to &quot;le bon Dieu,&quot; as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as &quot;Bon Dieu! may i some day do something truly great. amen.&quot;). Cummings &quot;also prayed for strength to be his essential self (&#x27;may I be I is the only prayerânot may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong&#x27;), and for relief of spirit in times of depression (&#x27;almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; &amp; may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness&#x27;)&quot;.

Cummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily from age 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He studied Latin and Greek at Cambridge Latin High School. He attended Harvard University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree magna cum laude and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society in 1915. The following year, he received a Master of Arts degree from the university. During his studies at Harvard, he developed an interest in modern poetry, which ignored conventional grammar and syntax and aimed for a dynamic use of language. His first published poems appeared in &quot;Eight Harvard Poets&quot; (1917). Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.
===War years===
In 1917, with the First World War going on in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps. On the boat to France, he met William Slater Brown and they quickly became friends. Due to an administrative error, Cummings and Brown did not receive an assignment for five weeks, a period they spent exploring Paris. Cummings fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.

During their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views, Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans. On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities, they were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the , in La FertÃ©-MacÃ©, Orne, Normandy.

They were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings&#x27;s father made strenuous efforts to obtain his son&#x27;s release through diplomatic channels; although advised his son&#x27;s release was approved, there were lengthy delays, with little explanation. In frustration, Cummings&#x27;s father wrote a letter to President Woodrow Wilson in December 1917. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, returning to his family in the U.S. by New Year&#x27;s Day, 1918. Cummings, his father, and Brown&#x27;s family continued to agitate for Brown&#x27;s release. By mid-February, he, too, was America-bound. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, &quot;The Enormous Room&quot; (1922), about which F. Scott Fitzgerald said, &quot;Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survivesâ&quot;The Enormous Room&quot; by E. E. CummingsÂ ... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality.&quot; Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served a training deployment in the 12th Division at Camp Devens, Massachusetts, until November 1918.

===Post-war years===
Cummings returned to Paris in 1921, and lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection &quot;Tulips and Chimneys,&quot; was published in 1923, and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. &quot;XLI Poems&quot; was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant-garde poet.

During the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the Soviet Union, recounting his experiences in &quot;Eimi&quot;, published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and Mexico, and he worked as an essayist and portrait artist for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine (1924â1927).

In 1926, Cummings&#x27;s parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his &quot;i: six nonlectures&quot; series given at Harvard (as part of the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures) in 1952 and 1953:
His father&#x27;s death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem &quot;my father moved through dooms of love&quot;.

In the 1930s, Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs was Cummings&#x27;s publisher; he had started the Golden Eagle Press after working as a typographer and publisher.

===Final years===
In 1952, his alma mater, Harvard University, awarded Cummings an honorary seat as a guest professor. The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures he gave in 1952 and 1955 were later collected as &quot;i: six nonlectures&quot;.
Cummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, Joy Farm, in Silver Lake, New Hampshire. He died of a stroke on September 3, 1962, at the age of 67 at Memorial Hospital in North Conway, New Hampshire. Cummings was buried at Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston, Massachusetts. At the time of his death, Cummings was recognized as the &quot;second most widely read poet in the United States, after Robert Frost&quot;.

Cummings&#x27;s papers are held at the Houghton Library at Harvard University and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===

Cummings was married twice: first to Elaine Orr Thayer in 1924, then to Anne Minnerly Barton in 1929. His longest relationship, with Marion Morehouse, began in 1934, and lasted more than three decades.

In 1917, before his first marriage, Cummings shared several passionate love letters with a Parisian prostitute, Marie Louise Lallemand. Despite Cummings&#x27;s efforts, he was unable to find Lallemand upon his return to Paris after serving at the front.

Cummings&#x27;s relationship with Elaine Orr began as a love affair in 1918, while she was still married to Scofield Thayer, one of Cummings&#x27; friends from Harvard. During this time, he wrote a large portion of his erotic poetry. The couple had a daughter while Orr was still married to Thayer. After Orr divorced Thayer, Cummings and Orr married on March 19, 1924. Thayer had been registered on the child&#x27;s birth certificate as the father, but Cummings legally adopted her after his marriage to Orr. Although his relationship with Orr stretched back several years, the marriage was brief. On a trip to Paris, Orr met and fell in love with the Irish nobleman, future politician, author, journalist, and former banker Frank MacDermot. The couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later. 

Cummings married his second wife, Anne Minnerly Barton, on May 1, 1929. They separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Minnerly obtained a Mexican divorce; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.

In 1934, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. It is not clear whether the two were ever formally married. Morehouse lived with Cummings until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969, while living at 4 Patchin Place, Greenwich Village, New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.

===Political views===
According to his testimony in &quot;EIMI&quot;, Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931. He subsequently shifted rightward on many political and social issues. Despite his radical and bohemian public image, he was a Republican and later an ardent supporter of Joseph McCarthy.

== Literary overview ==
=== Poetry ===
As well as being influenced by notable modernists, including Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound, Cummings was particularly drawn to early imagist experiments; later, his visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and Surrealism, which was reflected in his writing style. Cummings critic and biographer Norman Friedman remarks that in Cummings&#x27;s later work the &quot;shift from simile to symbol&quot; created poetry that is &quot;frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier&quot;.

Despite Cummings&#x27;s familiarity with avant-garde styles (likely affected by the calligrams of French poet Apollinaire, according to a contemporary observation), much of his work draws inspiration from traditional forms. For example, many of his poems are sonnets, albeit described by Richard D. Cureton as &quot;revisionary... with scrambled rhymes and rearranged, disproportioned structures; awkwardly unpredictable metrical variation; clashing, mawkish diction; complex, wandering syntax; etc.&quot; He occasionally drew from the blues form and used acrostics. Many of Cummings&#x27;s poems are satirical and address social issues but have an equal or even stronger bias toward Romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.

While his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the Romantic tradition, critic Emily Essert asserts that Cummings&#x27;s work is particularly modernist and frequently employs what linguist Irene Fairley calls &quot;syntactic deviance&quot;. Some poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones; many of the poems he is best known for, however, do possess a stylistic typography he made his own, particularly in his insistent use of the lower case &#x27;i&#x27;.


While some of his poetry is free verse (and not beheld to rhyme or meter), Cureton has remarked that many of his sonnets follow an intricate rhyme scheme, and often employ pararhyme. A number of Cummings&#x27;s poems feature his typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, wherein Essert asserts &quot;feeling is first&quot; and the work begs to &quot;be re-read in order to be understood&quot;; Cummings, also a painter, created his texts not just as literature, but as &quot;visual objects&quot; on the page, and used typography to &quot;paint a picture&quot;.

The seeds of Cummings&#x27;s unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:

Following his autobiographical novel, &quot;The Enormous Room&quot;, Cummings&#x27;s first published work was a collection of poems titled &quot;Tulips and Chimneys&quot; (1923). This early work already displayed Cummings&#x27;s characteristically eccentric use of grammar and punctuation, although a fair amount of the poems are written in conventional language.

Cummings&#x27;s works often do not follow the conventional rules that generate typical English sentences, or what Fairley identifies as &quot;ungrammar&quot;. In addition, a number of Cummings&#x27;s poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also employs what Fairley describes as &quot;morphological innovation&quot;, wherein he frequently creates what critic Ian Landles calls: &quot;unusual compounds suggestive of &#x27;a child&#x27;s language&#x27;&quot; like &quot;&#x27;mud-luscious&#x27; and &#x27;puddle-wonderful&#x27;&quot;. Literary critic R. P. Blackmur has commented that this use of language is &quot;frequently unintelligible because [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favor of merely private and personal associations&quot;.

Fellow poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, in her equivocal letter recommending Cummings for the Guggenheim Fellowship he was awarded in 1934, expressed her frustration at his opaque symbolism. &quot;[I]f he prints and offers for sale poetry which he is quite content should be, after hours of sweating concentration, inexplicable from any point of view to a person as intelligent as myself, then he does so with a motive which is frivolous from the point of view of art, and should not be helped or encouraged by any serious person or group of persons... there is fine writing and powerful writing (as well as some of the most pompous nonsense I ever let slip to the floor with a wide yawn)... What I propose, then, is this: that you give Mr. Cummings enough rope. He may hang himself; or he may lasso a unicorn.&quot;

Cummings also wrote children&#x27;s books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;.

Cummings included ethnic slurs in his writing, which proved controversial. In his 1950 collection &quot;Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems&quot;, Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters. Friedman considered these two poems to be &quot;condensed&quot; and &quot;cryptic&quot; parables, &quot;sparsely told&quot;, in which setting the use of such &quot;inflammatory material&quot; was likely to meet with reader misapprehension. Poet William Carlos Williams spoke out in his defense.
Cummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy:
===Plays===
During his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. &quot;HIM&quot;, a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the Provincetown Players in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play&#x27;s main characters are &quot;Him&quot;, a playwright, portrayed by William Johnstone, and &quot;Me&quot;, his girlfriend, portrayed by Erin O&#x27;Brien-Moore.

Cummings said of the unorthodox play:
&quot;Anthropos, or the Future of Art&quot; is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology &quot;Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium&quot;. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three &quot;infrahumans&quot;, or inferior beings. The word &quot;anthropos&quot; is the Greek word for &quot;man&quot;, in the sense of &quot;mankind&quot;.

&quot;Tom, A Ballet&quot; is a ballet based on &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. The ballet is detailed in a &quot;synopsis&quot; as well as descriptions of four &quot;episodes&quot;, which were published by Cummings in 1935. It remained unperformed until 2015.

&quot;Santa Claus: A Morality&quot; was probably Cummings&#x27;s most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, &quot;Wake&quot;. The play&#x27;s main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus&#x27;s family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus&#x27;s faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.

===Art===
Cummings was an avid painter, referring to writing and painting as his &lt;q&gt;twin obsessions&lt;/q&gt; and to himself as a &lt;q&gt;poetandpainter.&lt;/q&gt; He painted &lt;q&gt;continuously, relentlessly, from childhood until his death, and left in his estate more than 1600 oils and watercolors (a figure that does not include the works he sold during his career) and over 9,000 drawings.&lt;/q&gt; In a self-interview from &quot;Foreword to an Exhibit: II&quot; (1945), the artist asked himself, &lt;q&gt;Tell me, doesn&#x27;t your painting interfere with your writing?&lt;/q&gt; and answered, &lt;q&gt;Quite the contrary: they love each other dearly.&lt;/q&gt;

Cummings had more than 30 exhibits of his paintings in his lifetime. He received substantial acclaim as an American cubist and an abstract, avant garde painter between the World Wars, but with the publication of his books &quot;The Enormous Room&quot; and &quot;Tulips and Chimneys&quot; in the 1920s, his reputation as a poet eclipsed his success as a visual artist. In 1931, he published a limited edition volume of his artwork entitled &quot;CIOPW&quot;, named for his media of charcoal, ink, oil, pencil, and watercolor. About this same time, he began to break from Modernist aesthetics and employ a more subjective and spontaneous style; his work became more representational: landscapes, nudes, still lifes, and portraits.

===Name and capitalization===
Cummings&#x27;s publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional orthography in his poetry by writing his name in lower case. Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.

The use of lower case for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to &quot;E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer&quot; by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings &quot;had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case&quot;. According to Cummings&#x27;s widow, however, this is incorrect. She wrote to Friedman: &quot;You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid &amp; childish statement about Cummings &amp; his signature.&quot; On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on. One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lower case, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use. Additionally, &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalization of names in accordance with the bearer&#x27;s strongly stated preference, notes &quot;E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name.&quot;

==Adaptations==
In 1943, modern dancer and choreographer, Jean Erdman presented &quot;The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell&quot; with a commissioned score by John Cage and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the Arts Club of Chicago. Erdman also choreographed &quot;Twenty Poems&quot; (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings&#x27;s poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by Teiji Ito. It was performed in the round at the Circle in the Square Theatre in Greenwich Village.

Numerous composers have set Cummings&#x27;s poems to music:
* In 1970, Pierre Boulez composed &quot;Cummings ist der Dichter&quot; (&#x27;cummings is the Poet&#x27;) from poems by E. E. Cummings.
* Aribert Reimann set Cummings to music in &quot;Impression IV&quot; (1961) for soprano and piano.
* Italian composer Luciano Berio&#x27;s 1960 composition &quot;Circles&quot; is a setting of three poems by E. E. Cummings, including the poems &quot;Stinging&quot;, &quot;Riverly Is a Flower&quot;, and &quot;N(o)w&quot;.
* Morton Feldman (1926â1987) in 1951 composed &quot;4 Songs to e.e. cummings&quot; for soprano, piano and cello, using material from Cummings&#x27;s &quot;50 Poems&quot; of 1940: &quot;!Blac&quot;, &quot;Air&quot;, &quot;(Sitting In A Tree-)&quot; and &quot;(Moan)&quot;.
* The Icelandic singer BjÃ¶rk used lines from Cummings&#x27;s poem &quot;I Will Wade Out&quot; for the lyrics of &quot;Sun in My Mouth&quot; on her 2001 album &quot;Vespertine&quot;. On her next album, &quot;MedÃºlla&quot; (2004), BjÃ¶rk used his poem &quot;It May Not Always Be So&quot; as the lyrics for the song &quot;Sonnets/Unrealities XI&quot;.
* The American composer Eric Whitacre wrote a cycle of works for choir titled &quot;The City and the Sea&quot;, which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music. He also wrote music for &quot;little tree&quot; and &quot;i carry your heart&quot;, among others.
* Others who have composed settings for his poems include, among many others:

<text>The East River is a saltwater tidal estuary or strait in New York City. The waterway, which is not a river despite its name, connects Upper New York Bay on its south end to Long Island Sound on its north end. It separates Long Island, with the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, from Manhattan Island, and from the Bronx on the North American mainland.

Because of its connection to Long Island Sound, it was once also known as the &quot;Sound River&quot;. The tidal strait changes its direction of flow regularly, and is subject to strong fluctuations in its current, which are accentuated by its narrowness and variety of depths. The waterway is navigable for its entire length of , and was historically the center of maritime activities in the city.

==Formation and description==

Technically a drowned valley, like the other waterways around New York City, the strait was formed approximately 11,000 years ago at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation. The distinct change in the shape of the strait between the lower and upper portions is evidence of this glacial activity. The upper portion (from Long Island Sound to Hell Gate), running largely perpendicular to the glacial motion, is wide, meandering, and has deep narrow bays on both banks, scoured out by the glacier&#x27;s movement. The lower portion (from Hell Gate to New York Bay) runs northâsouth, parallel to the glacial motion. It is much narrower, with straight banks. The bays that exist, as well as those that used to exist before being filled in by human activity, are largely wide and shallow.
The section known as &quot;Hell Gate&quot;from the Dutch name meaning either &quot;bright strait&quot; or &quot;clear opening&quot;, given to the entire river in 1614 by explorer Adriaen Block when he passed through it in his ship &quot;Tyger&quot;is a narrow, turbulent, and particularly treacherous stretch of the river. Tides from the Long Island Sound, New York Harbor and the Harlem River meet there, making it difficult to navigate, especially because of the number of rocky islets which once dotted it, with names such as &quot;Frying Pan&quot;, &quot;Pot, Bread and Cheese&quot;, &quot;Hen and Chicken&quot;, &quot;Heel Top&quot;; &quot;Flood&quot;; and &quot;Gridiron&quot;, roughly 12 islets and reefs in all, all of which led to a number of shipwrecks, including HMS &quot;Hussar&quot;, a British frigate that sank in 1780 while supposedly carrying gold and silver intended to pay British troops. The stretch has since been cleared of rocks and widened. Washington Irving wrote of Hell Gate that the current sounded &quot;like a bull bellowing for more drink&quot; at half tide, while at full tide it slept &quot;as soundly as an alderman after dinner&quot;. He said it was like &quot;a peaceable fellow enough when he has no liquor at all, or when he has a skinful, but who, when half-seas over, plays the very devil.&quot; The tidal regime is complex, with the two major tidesfrom the Long Island Sound and from the Atlantic Oceanseparated by about two hours; and this is without consideration of the tidal influence of the Harlem River, all of which creates a &quot;dangerous cataract&quot;, as one ship&#x27;s captain put it.

The river is navigable for its entire length of . In 1939 it was reported that the stretch from The Battery to the former Brooklyn Navy Yard near Wallabout Bay, a run of about , was deep, the long section from there, running to the west of Roosevelt Island, through Hell Gate and to Throg&#x27;s Neck was at least deep, and then eastward from there the river was, at mean low tide, deep.

The broadness of the river&#x27;s channel south of Roosevelt Island is caused by the dipping of the hardy Fordham gneiss underlying the island under the less strong Inwood marble which lies under the river bed. Why the river turns to the east as it approaches the three lower Manhattan bridges is geologically unknown.

===Islands===
Roosevelt Island, a long () and narrow () landmass, lies in the stretch of the river between Manhattan Island and the borough of Queens, roughly from the latitude of Manhattan&#x27;s East 46th to 86th Streets. The abrupt termination of the island on its north end is due to an extension of the 125th Street Fault. Politically, the island&#x27;s constitute part of the borough of Manhattan. It is connected to Queens by the Roosevelt Island Bridge, to Manhattan by the Roosevelt Island Tramway, and to both boroughs by a subway station served by the F train. The Queensboro Bridge also runs across Roosevelt Island, and an elevator allowing both pedestrian and vehicular access to the island was added to the bridge in 1930, but elevator service was discontinued in 1955 following the opening of the Roosevelt Island Bridge, and the elevator was demolished in 1970. The island, which was formerly known as Blackwell&#x27;s Island and Welfare Island before being renamed in honor of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, historically served as the site of a penitentiary and a number of hospitals; today, it is dominated by residential neighborhoods consisting of large apartment buildings and parkland (much of which is dotted with the ruins of older structures).

The largest land mass in the River south of Roosevelt Island is U Thant Island, an artificial islet created during the construction of the Steinway Tunnel (which currently serves the subway&#x27;s 7 and &lt;7&gt; lines). Officially named Belmont Island after one of the tunnel&#x27;s financiers, the landmass owes its popular name (after Burmese diplomat U Thant, former Secretary-General of the United Nations) to the efforts of a group associated with the guru Sri Chinmoy that held mediation meetings on the island in the 1970s. Today, the island is owned by New York State and serves as a migratory bird sanctuary that is closed to visitors.

Proceeding north and east from Roosevelt Island, the River&#x27;s principal islands include Manhattan&#x27;s Mill Rock, an island located about 1000 feet from Manhattan&#x27;s East 96th Street; Manhattan&#x27;s 520-acre Randalls and Wards Islands, two formerly separate islands joined by landfill that are home to a large public park, a number of public institutions, and the supports for the Triborough and the Hell Gate Bridges; the Bronx&#x27;s Rikers Island, once under but now over following extensive landfill expansion after the island&#x27;s 1884 purchase by the city as a prison farm and still home to New York City&#x27;s massive and controversial primary jail complex; and North and South Brother Islands, both of which also constitute part of the Bronx.
===Tributaries===
The Bronx River, Pugsley Creek, and Westchester Creek drain into the northern bank of the East River in the northern section of the strait. The Flushing River, historically known as Flushing Creek, empties into the strait&#x27;s southern bank near LaGuardia Airport via Flushing Bay. Further west, Luyster Creek drains into the East River in Astoria, Queens.

North of Randalls Island, it is joined by the Bronx Kill. Along the east of Wards Island, at approximately the strait&#x27;s midpoint, it narrows into a channel called Hell Gate, which is spanned by both the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge (formerly the Triborough), and the Hell Gate Bridge. On the south side of Wards Island, it is joined by the Harlem River.

Newtown Creek on Long Island, which itself contained several tributaries, drains into the East River and forms part of the boundary between Queens and Brooklyn. Bushwick Inlet and Wallabout Bay on Long Island also drain into the strait on the Long Island side. The Gowanus Canal was built from Gowanus Creek, which emptied into the river.

Historically, there were other small streams which emptied into the river, though these and their associated wetlands have been filled in and built over. These small streams included the Harlem Creek, one of the most significant tributaries originating in Manhattan. Other streams that emptied into the East River included the Sawkill in Manhattan, Mill Brook in the Bronx, and Sunswick Creek in Queens.

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the land north of the East River was occupied by the Siwanoys, one of many groups of Algonquin-speaking Lenapes in the area. Those of the Lenapes who lived in the northern part of Manhattan Island in a campsite known as Konaande Kongh used a landing at around the current location of East 119th street to paddle into the river in canoes fashioned from tree trunks in order to fish.

Dutch settlement of what became New Amsterdam began in 1623. Some of the earliest of the small settlements in the area were along the west bank of the East River on sites that had previously been Native American settlements. As with the Native Americans, the river was central to their lives for transportation for trading and for fishing. They gathered marsh grass to feed their cattle, and the East River&#x27;s tides helped to power mills which ground grain to flour. By 1642 there was a ferry running on the river between Manhattan island and what is now Brooklyn, and the first pier on the river was built in 1647 at Pearl and Broad Streets. After the British took over the colony in 1664, which was renamed &quot;New York&quot;, the development of the waterfront continued, and a shipbuilding industry grew up once New York started exporting flour. By the end of the 17th century, the Great Dock, located at Corlear&#x27;s Hook on the East River, had been built.

===Narrowing the river===
Historically, the lower portion of the strait, which separates Manhattan from Brooklyn, was one of the busiest and most important channels in the world, particularly during the first three centuries of New York City&#x27;s history. Because the water along the lower Manhattan shoreline was too shallow for large boats to tie up and unload their goods, from 1686 onafter the signing of the Dongan Charter, which allowed intertidal land to be owned and soldthe shoreline was &quot;wharfed out&quot; to the high-water mark by constructing retaining walls that were filled in with every conceivable kind of landfill: excrement, dead animals, ships deliberately sunk in place, ship ballast, and muck dredged from the bottom of the river. On the new land were built warehouses and other structures necessary for the burgeoning sea trade. Many of the &quot;water-lot&quot; grants went to the rich and powerful families of the merchant class, although some went to tradesmen. By 1700, the Manhattan bank of the river had been &quot;wharfed-out&quot; up to around Whitehall Street, narrowing the strait of the river.
After the signing of the Montgomerie Charter in the late 1720s, another 127 acres of land along the Manhattan shore of the East River was authorized to be filled-in, this time to a point 400 feet beyond the low-water mark; the parts that had already been expanded to the low water markmuch of which had been devastated by a coastal storm in the early 1720s and a nor&#x27;easter in 1723were also expanded, narrowing the channel even further. What had been quiet beach land was to become new streets and buildings, and the core of the city&#x27;s sea-borne trade. This infilling went as far north as Corlear&#x27;s Hook. In addition, the city was given control of the western shore of the river from Wallabout Bay south.

===American Revolution===
Expansion of the waterfront halted during the American Revolution, in which the East River played an important role early in the conflict. On August 28, 1776, while British and Hessian troops rested after besting the Americans at the Battle of Long Island, General George Washington was rounding up all the boats on the east shore of the river, in what is now Brooklyn, and used them to successfully move his troops across the riverunder cover of night, rain, and fogto Manhattan island, before the British could press their advantage. Thus, though the battle was a victory for the British, the failure of Sir William Howe to destroy the Continental Army when he had the opportunity allowed the Americans to continue fighting. Without the stealthy withdrawal across the East River, the American Revolution might have ended much earlier.

Wallabout Bay on the River was the site of most of the British prison shipsmost notoriously where thousands of American prisoners of war were held in terrible conditions. These prisoners had come into the hands of the British after the fall of New York City on September 15, 1776, after the American loss at the Battle of Long Island and the loss of Fort Washington on November 16. Prisoners began to be housed on the broken-down warships and transports in December; about 24 ships were used in total, but generally only 5 or 6 at a time. Almost twice as many Americans died from neglect in these ships than did from all the battles in the war: as many as 12,000 soldiers, sailors and civilians. The bodies were thrown overboard or were buried in shallow graves on the riverbanks, but their bonessome of which were collected when they washed ashorewere later relocated and are now inside the Prison Ship Martyrs&#x27; Monument in nearby Fort Greene Park. The existence of the ships and the conditions the men were held in was widely known at the time through letters, diaries and memoirs, and was a factor not only in the attitude of Americans toward the British, but in the negotiations to formally end the war.

===Development begins again===
After the war, East River waterfront development continued once more. New York State legislation, which in 1807 had authorized what would become the Commissioners Plan of 1811, authorized the creation of new land out to 400 feet from the low water mark into the river, and with the advent of gridded streets along the new waterlineJoseph Mangin had laid out such a grid in 1803 in his &quot;A Plan and Regulation of the City of New York&quot;, which was rejected by the city, but established the conceptthe coastline become regularized at the same time that the strait became even narrower.

One result of the narrowing of the East River along the shoreline of Manhattan and, later, Brooklynwhich continued until the mid-19th century when the state put a stop to itwas an increase in the speed of its current. Buttermilk Channel, the strait that divides Governors Island from Red Hook in Brooklyn, and which is located directly south of the &quot;mouth&quot; of the East River, was in the early 17th century a fordable waterway across which cattle could be driven. Further investigation by Colonel Jonathan Williams determined that the channel was by 1776 three fathoms deep (), five fathoms deep () in the same spot by 1798, and when surveyed by Williams in 1807 had deepened to 7 fathoms () at low tide. What had been almost a bridge between two landforms that were once connected had become a fully navigable channel, thanks to the constriction of the East River and the increased flow it caused. Soon, the current in the East River had become so strong that larger ships had to use auxiliary steam power in order to turn. The continued narrowing of the channel on both side may have been the reasoning behind the suggestion of one New York State Senator, who wanted to fill in the East River and annex Brooklyn, with the cost of doing so being covered by selling the newly made land. Others proposed a dam at Roosevelt Island (then Blackwell&#x27;s Island) to create a wet basin for shipping.
===Filling in the river===
Filling in part of the river was also proposed in 1867 by engineer James E. Serrell, later a city surveyor, but with emphasis on solving the problem of Hell Gate. Serrell proposed filling in Hell Gate and building a &quot;New East River&quot; through Queens with an extension to Westchester County. Serrell&#x27;s planwhich he publicized with maps, essay and lectures as well as presentations to the city, state and federal governmentswould have filled in the river from 14th Street to 125th Street. The New East River through Queens would be about three times the average width of the existing one at an even throughout, and would run as straight as an arrow for . The new land, and the portions of Queens which would become part of Manhattan, adding , would be covered with an extension of the existing street grid of Manhattan.

Variations on Serrell&#x27;s plan would be floated over the years. A pseudonymous &quot;Terra Firma&quot; brought up filling in the East River again in the &quot;Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1904, and Thomas Alva Edison took it up in 1906. Then Thomas Kennard Thompson, a bridge and railway engineer, proposed in 1913 to fill in the river from Hell Gate to the tip of Manhattan and, as Serrell had suggested, make a new canalized East River, only this time from Flushing Bay to Jamaica Bay. He would also expand Brooklyn into the Upper Harbor, put up a dam from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and make extensive landfill in the Lower Bay. At around the same time, in the 1920s, John A. Harriss, New York City&#x27;s chief traffic engineer, who had developed the first traffic signals in the city, also had plans for the river. Harriss wanted to dam the East River at Hell Gate and the Williamsburg Bridge, then remove the water, put a roof over it on stilts, and build boulevards and pedestrian lanes on the roof along with &quot;majestic structures&quot;, with transportation services below. The East River&#x27;s course would, once again, be shifted to run through Queens, and this time Brooklyn as well, to channel it to the Harbor.

===Clearing Hell Gate===
Periodically, merchants and other interested parties would try to get something done about the difficulty of navigating through Hell Gate. In 1832, the New York State legislature was presented with a petition for a canal to be built through nearby Hallet&#x27;s Point, thus avoiding Hell Gate altogether. Instead, the legislature responded by providing ships with pilots trained to navigate the shoals for the next 15 years.

In 1849, a French engineer whose specialty was underwater blasting, Benjamin Maillefert, had cleared some of the rocks which, along with the mix of tides, made the Hell Gate stretch of the river so dangerous to navigate. Ebenezer Meriam had organized a subscription to pay Maillefert $6,000 to, for instance, reduce &quot;Pot Rock&quot; to provide of depth at low-mean water. While ships continued to run aground (in the 1850s about 2% of ships did so) and petitions continued to call for action, the federal government undertook surveys of the area which ended in 1851 with a detailed and accurate map. By then Maillefert had cleared the rock &quot;Baldheaded Billy&quot;, and it was reported that Pot Rock had been reduced to , which encouraged the United States Congress to appropriate $20,000 for further clearing of the strait. However, a more accurate survey showed that the depth of Pot Rock was actually a little more than , and eventually Congress withdrew its funding.

With the main shipping channels through The Narrows into the harbor silting up with sand due to littoral drift, thus providing ships with less depth, and a new generation of larger ships coming onlineepitomized by Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Leviathan&quot;New York began to be concerned that it would start to lose its status as a great port if a &quot;back door&quot; entrance into the harbor was not created. In the 1850s the depth continued to lessenthe harbor commission said in 1850 that the mean water low was and the extreme water low was while the draft required by the new ships continued to increase, meaning it was only safe for them to enter the harbor at high tide.

The U.S. Congress, realizing that the problem needed to be addressed, appropriated $20,000 for the Army Corps of Engineers to continue Maillefert&#x27;s work. In 1851, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, &quot;under Lt. Bartlett of the Army Corps of Engineers,&quot; began to do the job, in an operation which was to span 70 years. The appropriated money was soon spent without appreciable change in the hazards of navigating the strait. An advisory council recommended in 1856 that the strait be cleared of all obstacles, but nothing was done, and the Civil War soon broke out.

====After the Civil War====
In the late 1860s, after the Civil War, Congress realized the military importance of having easily navigable waterways, and charged the Army Corps of Engineers with clearing Hell Gate. Newton estimated that the operation would cost about half as much as the annual losses in shipping. The 2021 book by Thomas Barthel titled &quot;Opening the East River: John Newton and the Blasting of Hell Gate&quot; traces Newton&#x27;s work on this project from 1866 to 1885. On September 24, 1876, the Corps used of explosives to blast the rocks, which was followed by further blasting. The process was started by excavating under Hallets reef from Astoria. Cornish miners, assisted by steam drills, dug galleries under the reef, which were then interconnected. They later drilled holes for explosives. A patent was issued for the detonating device. After the explosion, the rock debris was dredged and dropped into a deep part of the river. This was not repeated at the later Flood Rock explosion.

On October 10, 1885, the Corps carried out the largest explosion in this process, annihilating Flood Rock with of explosives. The blast was felt as far away as Princeton, New Jersey (50 miles). It sent a geyser of water in the air. The blast has been described as &quot;the largest planned explosion before testing began for the atomic bomb&quot;, although the detonation at the Battle of Messines in 1917 was larger. Some of the rubble from the detonation was used in 1890 to fill the gap between Great Mill Rock and Little Mill Rock, merging the two islands into a single island, Mill Rock.

At the same time that Hell Gate was being cleared, the Harlem River Ship Canal was being planned. When it was completed in 1895, the &quot;back door&quot; to New York&#x27;s center of ship-borne trade in the docks and warehouses of the East River was open from two directions, through the cleared East River, and from the Hudson River through the Harlem River to the East River. Ironically, though, while both forks of the northern shipping entrance to the city were now open, modern dredging techniques had cut through the sandbars of the Atlantic Ocean entrance, allowing new, even larger ships to use that traditional passage into New York&#x27;s docks.

At the beginning of the 19th century, the East River was the center of New York&#x27;s shipping industry, but by the end of the century, much of it had moved to the Hudson River, leaving the East River wharves and slips to begin a long process of decay, until the area was finally rehabilitated in the mid-1960s, and the South Street Seaport Museum was opened in 1967.

===A new seawall===
By 1870, the condition of the Port of New York along both the East and Hudson Rivers had so deteriorated that the New York State legislature created the Department of Docks to renovate the port and keep New York competitive with other ports on the American East Coast. The Department of Docks was given the task of creating the master plan for the waterfront, and General George B. McClellan was engaged to head the project. McClellan held public hearings and invited plans to be submitted, ultimately receiving 70 of them, although in the end he and his successors put his own plan into effect. That plan called for the building of a seawall around Manhattan island from West 61st Street on the Hudson, around The Battery, and up to East 51st Street on the East River. The area behind the masonry wall (mostly concrete but in some parts granite blocks) would be filled in with landfill, and wide streets would be laid down on the new land. In this way, a new edge for the island (or at least the part of it used as a commercial port) would be created.

The department had surveyed of shoreline by 1878, as well as documenting the currents and tides. By 1900, had been surveyed and core samples had been taken to inform the builders of how deep the bedrock was. The work was completed just as World War I began, allowing the Port of New York to be a major point of embarkation for troops and materiel.

The new seawall helps protect Manhattan island from storm surges, although it is only above the mean sea level, so that particularly dangerous storms, such as the nor&#x27;easter of 1992 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which hit the city in a way to create surges which are much higher, can still do significant damage. (The Hurricane of September 3, 1821, created the biggest storm surge on record in New York City: a rise of in one hour at the Battery, flooding all of lower Manhattan up to Canal Street.) Still, the new seawall begun in 1871 gave the island a firmer edge, improved the quality of the port, and continues to protect Manhattan from normal storm surges.

===Bridges and tunnels===

The Brooklyn Bridge, completed in 1883, was the first bridge to span the East River, connecting the cities of New York and Brooklyn, and all but replacing the frequent ferry service between them, which did not return until the late 20th century. The bridge offered cable car service across the span. The Brooklyn Bridge was followed by the Williamsburg Bridge (1903), the Queensboro Bridge (1909), the Manhattan Bridge (1912) and the Hell Gate Railroad Bridge (1916). Later would come the Triborough Bridge (1936), the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge (1939), the Throgs Neck Bridge (1961) and the Rikers Island Bridge (1966). In addition, numerous rail tunnels pass under the East Rivermost of them part of the New York City Subway systemas does the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. (See Crossings below for details.) Also under the river is Water Tunnel #1 of the New York City water supply system, built in 1917 to extend the Manhattan portion of the tunnel to Brooklyn, and via City Tunnel #2 (1936) to Queens; these boroughs became part of New York City after the city&#x27;s consolidation in 1898. City Tunnel #3 will also run under the river, under the northern tip of Roosevelt Island, and is expected to not be completed until at least 2026; the Manhattan portion of the tunnel went into service in 2013.
===20th century===
Philanthropist John D. Rockefeller founded what is now Rockefeller University in 1901, between 63rd and 64th Streets on the river side of York Avenue, overlooking the river. The university is a research university for doctoral and post-doctoral scholars, primarily in the fields of medicine and biological science. North of it is one of the major medical centers in the city, NewYork Presbyterian / Weill Cornell Medical Center, which is associated with the medical schools of both Columbia University and Cornell University. Although it can trace its history back to 1771, the center on York Avenue, much of which overlooks the river, was built in 1932.

The East River was the site of one of the greatest disasters in the history of New York City when, in June 1904, the PS &quot;General Slocum&quot; sank near North Brother Island due to a fire. It was carrying 1,400 German-Americans to a picnic site on Long Island for an annual outing. There were only 321 survivors of the disaster, one of the worst losses of life in the city&#x27;s long history, and a devastating blow to the Little Germany neighborhood on the Lower East Side. The captain of the ship and the managers of the company that owned it were indicted, but only the captain was convicted; he spent years of his 10-year sentence at Sing Sing Prison before being released by a federal parole board, and then pardoned by President William Howard Taft.

Beginning in 1934, and then again from 1948 to 1966, the Manhattan shore of the river became the location for the limited-access East River Drive, which was later renamed after Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and is universally known by New Yorkers as the &quot;FDR Drive&quot;. The road is sometimes at grade, sometimes runs under locations such as the site of the Headquarters of the United Nations and Carl Schurz Park and Gracie Mansionthe mayor&#x27;s official residence, and is at time double-decked, because Hell Gate provides no room for more landfill. It begins at Battery Park, runs past the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg and Queensboro Bridges, and the Ward&#x27;s Island Footbridge, and terminates just before the Robert F. Kennedy Triboro Bridge when it connects to the Harlem River Drive. Between most of the FDR Drive and the River is the East River Greenway, part of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway. The East River Greenway was primarily built in connection with the building of the FDR Drive, although some portions were built as recently as 2002, and other sections are still incomplete.

In 1963, Con Edison built the Ravenswood Generating Station on the Long Island City shore of the river, on land some of which was once stone quarries which provided granite and marble slabs for Manhattan&#x27;s buildings. The plant has since been owned by KeySpan. National Grid and TransCanada, the result of deregulation of the electrical power industry. The station, which can generate about 20% of the electrical needs of New York Cityapproximately 2,500 megawattsreceives some of its fuel by oil barge.

North of the power plant can be found Socrates Sculpture Park, an illegal dumpsite and abandoned landfill that in 1986 was turned into an outdoor museum, exhibition space for artists, and public park by sculptor Mark di Suvero and local activists. The area also contains Rainey Park, which honors Thomas C. Rainey, who attempted for 40 years to get a bridge built in that location from Manhattan to Queens. The Queensboro Bridge was eventually built south of this location.

===21st century===
In 2011, NY Waterway started operating its East River Ferry line. The route was a 7-stop East River service that runs in a loop between East 34th Street and Hunters Point, making two intermediate stops in Brooklyn and three in Queens. The ferry, an alternative to the New York City Subway, cost $4 per one-way ticket. It was instantly popular: from June to November 2011, the ferry saw 350,000 riders, over 250% of the initial ridership forecast of 134,000 riders. In December 2016, in preparation for the start of NYC Ferry service the next year, Hornblower Cruises purchased the rights to operate the East River Ferry. NYC Ferry started service on May 1, 2017, with the East River Ferry as part of the system.

In February 2012 the federal government announced an agreement with Verdant Power to install 30 tidal turbines in the channel of the East River. The turbines were projected to begin operations in 2015 and are supposed to produce 1.05 megawatts of power. The strength of the current foiled an earlier effort in 2007 to tap the river for tidal power.

On May 7, 2017, the catastrophic failure of a Con Edison substation in Brooklyn caused a spill into the river of over of dielectric fluid, a synthetic mineral oil used to cool electrical equipment and prevent electrical discharges. (See below.)

At the end of 2022, gold miner John Reeves claimed that up to 50 tons of ice age artifacts bound for the American Museum of Natural History, including mammoth remains, had been dumped into the East River near 65th Street. Although the museum denied that any fossils had been dumped into the river, Reeves&#x27;s allegations prompted commercial divers to search the river for evidence of mammoth bones.

==Ecosystem collapse, pollution and health==
Throughout most of the history of New York City, and New Amsterdam before it, the East River has been the receptacle for the city&#x27;s garbage and sewage. &quot;Night men&quot; who collected &quot;night soil&quot; from outdoor privies would dump their loads into the river, and even after the construction of the Croton Aqueduct (1842) and then the New Croton Aqueduct (1890) gave rise to indoor plumbing, the waste that was flushed away into the sewers, where it mixed with ground runoff, ran directly into the river, untreated. The sewers terminated at the slips where ships docked, until the waste began to build up, preventing dockage, after which the outfalls were moved to the end of the piers. The &quot;landfill&quot; which created new land along the shoreline when the river was &quot;wharfed out&quot; by the sale of &quot;water lots&quot; was largely garbage such as bones, offal, and even whole dead animals, along with excrementhuman and animal. The result was that by the 1850s, if not before, the East River, like the other waterways around the city, was undergoing the process of eutrophication where the increase in nitrogen from excrement and other sources led to a decrease in free oxygen, which in turn led to an increase in phytoplankton such as algae and a decrease in other life forms, breaking the area&#x27;s established food chain. The East River became very polluted, and its animal life decreased drastically.

In an earlier time, one person had described the transparency of the water: &quot;I remember the time, gentlemen, when you could go in twelve feet of water and you could see the pebbles on the bottom of this river.&quot; As the water got more polluted, it darkened, underwater vegetation (such as photosynthesizing seagrass) began dying, and as the seagrass beds declined, the many associated species of their ecosystems declined as well, contributing to the decline of the river. Also harmful was the general destruction of the once plentiful oyster beds in the waters around the city, and the over-fishing of menhaden, or mossbunker, a small silvery fish which had been used since the time of the Native Americans for fertilizing cropshowever it took 8,000 of these schooling fish to fertilize a single acre, so mechanized fishing using the purse seine was developed, and eventually the menhaden population collapsed. Menhaden feed on phytoplankton, helping to keep them in check, and are also a vital step in the food chain, as bluefish, striped bass and other fish species which do not eat phytoplankton feed on the menhaden. The oyster is another filter feeder: oysters purify 10 to 100 gallons a day, while each menhaden filters four gallons in a minute, and their schools were immense: one report had a farmer collecting 20 oxcarts worth of menhaden using simple fishing nets deployed from the shore. The combination of more sewage, due to the availability of more potable waterNew York&#x27;s water consumption &quot;per capita&quot; was twice that of Europeindoor plumbing, the destruction of filter feeders, and the collapse of the food chain, damaged the ecosystem of the waters around New York, including the East River, almost beyond repair.

Because of these changes to the ecosystem, by 1909, the level of dissolved-oxygen in the lower part of the river had declined to less than 65%, where 55% of saturation is the point at which the amount of fish and the number of their species begins to be affected. Only 17 years later, by 1926, the level of dissolved oxygen in the river had fallen to 13%, below the point at which most fish species can survive.

Due to heavy pollution, the East River is dangerous to people who fall in or attempt to swim in it, although as of mid-2007 the water was cleaner than it had been in decades. , the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) categorizes the East River as Use Classification I, meaning it is safe for secondary contact activities such as boating and fishing. According to the marine sciences section of the DEP, the channel is swift, with water moving as fast as four knots, just as it does in the Hudson River on the other side of Manhattan. That speed can push casual swimmers out to sea. A few people drown in the waters around New York City each year.

, it was reported that the level of bacteria in the river was below federal guidelines for swimming on most days, although the readings may vary significantly, so that the outflow from Newtown Creek or the Gowanus Canal can be tens or hundreds of times higher than recommended, according to Riverkeeper, a non-profit environmentalist advocacy group. The counts are also higher along the shores of the strait than they are in the middle of its flow. Nevertheless, the &quot;Brooklyn Bridge Swim&quot; is an annual event where swimmers cross the channel from Brooklyn Bridge Park to Manhattan.

Thanks to reductions in pollution, cleanups, the restriction of development, and other environmental controls, the East River along Manhattan is one of the areas of New York&#x27;s waterwaysincluding the Hudson-Raritan Estuary and both shores of Long Islandwhich have shown signs of the return of biodiversity. On the other hand, the river is also under attack from hardy, competitive, alien species, such as the European green crab, which is considered to be one of the world&#x27;s ten worst invasive species, and is present in the river.

===2017 oil spill===
On May 7, 2017, the catastrophic failure of Con Edison&#x27;s Farragut Substation at 89 John Street in Dumbo, Brooklyn, caused a spill of dielectric fluidan insoluble synthetic mineral oil, considered non-toxic by New York state, used to cool electrical equipment and prevent electrical dischargesinto the East River from a tank. The National Response Center received a report of the spill at 1:30pm that day, although the public did not learn of the spill for two days, and then only from tweets from NYC Ferry. A &quot;safety zone&quot; was established, extending from a line drawn between Dupont Street in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, to East 25th Street in Kips Bay, Manhattan, south to Buttermilk Channel. Recreational and human-powered vehicles such as kayaks and paddleboards were banned from the zone while the oil was being cleaned up, and the speed of commercial vehicles restricted so as not to spread the oil in their wakes, causing delays in NYC Ferry service. The clean-up efforts were being undertaken by Con Edison personnel and private environmental contractors, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, with the assistance of NYC Emergency Management.

The loss of the sub-station caused a voltage dip in the power provided by Con Ed to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority&#x27;s New York City Subway system, which disrupted its signals.

The Coast Guard estimated that of oil spilled into the water, with the remainder soaking into the soil at the substation. In the past the Coast Guard has on average been able to recover about 10% of oil spilled, however the complex tides in the river make the recovery much more difficult, with the turbulent water caused by the river&#x27;s change of tides pushing contaminated water over the containment booms, where it is then carried out to sea and cannot be recovered. By Friday May 12, officials from Con Edison reported that almost had been taken out of the water.

Environmental damage to wildlife is expected to be less than if the spill was of petroleum-based oil, but the oil can still block the sunlight necessary for the river&#x27;s fish and other organisms to live. Nesting birds are also in possible danger from the oil contaminating their nests and potentially poisoning the birds or their eggs. Water from the East River was reported to have tested positive for low levels of PCB, a known carcinogen.

Putting the spill into perspective, John Lipscomb, the vice president of advocacy for Riverkeepers said that the chronic release after heavy rains of overflow from city&#x27;s wastewater treatment system was &quot;a bigger problem for the harbor than this accident.&quot; The state Department of Environmental Conservation is investigating the spill. It was later reported that according to DEC data which dates back to 1978, the substation involved had spilled 179 times previously, more than any other Con Ed facility. The spills have included 8,400 gallons of dielectric oil, hydraulic oil, and antifreeze which leaked at various times into the soil around the substation, the sewers, and the East River.

On June 22, Con Edison used non-toxic green dye and divers in the river to find the source of the leak. As a result, a hole was plugged. The utility continued to believe that the bulk of the spill went into the ground around the substation, and excavated and removed several hundred cubic yards of soil from the area. They estimated that about went into the river, of which were recovered. Con Edison said that it installed a new transformer, and intended to add new barrier around the facility to help guard against future spills propagating into the river.

<doc id="9593" wikidata="Q38066" url="?curid=9593" title="Existentialism">
<text>Existentialism is a family of philosophical views and inquiry that study existence from the individual&#x27;s perspective and explore the human struggle to lead an authentic life despite the apparent absurdity or incomprehensibility of the universe. In examining meaning, purpose, and value, existentialist thought often includes concepts such as existential crises, angst, courage, and freedom.

Existentialism is associated with several 19th- and 20th-century European philosophers who shared an emphasis on the human subject, despite often profound differences in thought. Among the 19th-century figures now associated with existentialism are philosophers SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, as well as novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, all of whom critiqued rationalism and concerned themselves with the problem of meaning. The word &quot;existentialism&quot;, however, was not coined until the mid-20th century, during which it became most associated with contemporaneous philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, Simone de Beauvoir, Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, Paul Tillich, and more controversially Albert Camus. 

Many existentialists considered traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in style and content, to be too abstract and removed from concrete human experience. A primary virtue in existentialist thought is authenticity. Existentialism would influence many disciplines outside of philosophy, including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology.

Existentialist philosophy encompasses a range of perspectives, but it shares certain underlying concepts. Among these, a central tenet of existentialism is that personal freedom, individual responsibility, and deliberate choice are essential to the pursuit of self-discovery and the determination of life&#x27;s meaning.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;existentialism&quot; () was coined by the French Catholic philosopher Gabriel Marcel in the mid-1940s. When Marcel first applied the term to Jean-Paul Sartre, at a colloquium in 1945, Sartre rejected it. Sartre subsequently changed his mind and, on October 29, 1945, publicly adopted the existentialist label in a lecture to the Club Maintenant in Paris, published as (&quot;Existentialism Is a Humanism&quot;), a short book that helped popularize existentialist thought. Marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of &quot;Neo-Socratic&quot;, in honor of Kierkegaard&#x27;s essay &quot;On the Concept of Irony&quot;.

Some scholars argue that the term should be used to refer only to the cultural movement in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s associated with the works of the philosophers Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Albert Camus. Others extend the term to Kierkegaard, and yet others extend it as far back as Socrates. However, it is often identified with the philosophical views of Sartre.

== Definitional issues and background ==
The labels &quot;existentialism&quot; and &quot;existentialist&quot; are often seen as historical conveniences in as much as they were first applied to many philosophers long after they had died. While existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was Sartre. Sartre posits the idea that &quot;what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence&quot;, as the philosopher Frederick Copleston explains. According to philosopher Steven Crowell, defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better understood as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself. In a lecture delivered in 1945, Sartre described existentialism as &quot;the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent atheism&quot;. For others, existentialism need not involve the rejection of God, but rather &quot;examines mortal man&#x27;s search for meaning in a meaningless universe&quot;, considering less &quot;What is the good life?&quot; (to feel, be, or do, good), instead asking &quot;What is life good for?&quot;.

Although many outside Scandinavia consider the term existentialism to have originated from Kierkegaard, it is more likely that Kierkegaard adopted this term (or at least the term &quot;existential&quot; as a description of his philosophy) from the Norwegian poet and literary critic Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven. This assertion comes from two sources:

* The Norwegian philosopher Erik Lundestad refers to the Danish philosopher Fredrik Christian Sibbern. Sibbern is supposed to have had two conversations in 1841, the first with Welhaven and the second with Kierkegaard. It is in the first conversation that it is believed that Welhaven came up with &quot;a word that he said covered a certain thinking, which had a close and positive attitude to life, a relationship he described as existential&quot;. This was then brought to Kierkegaard by Sibbern.
* The second claim comes from the Norwegian historian Rune Slagstad, who claimed to prove that Kierkegaard himself said the term &quot;existential&quot; was borrowed from the poet. He strongly believes that it was Kierkegaard himself who said that &quot;Hegelians do not study philosophy &#x27;existentially;&#x27; to use a phrase by Welhaven from one time when I spoke with him about philosophy.&quot;

== Concepts ==

=== Existence precedes essence ===
Sartre argued that a central proposition of existentialism is that existence precedes essence, which is to say that individuals shape themselves by existing and cannot be perceived through preconceived and &quot;a priori&quot; categories, an &quot;essence&quot;. The actual life of the individual is what constitutes what could be called their &quot;true essence&quot; instead of an arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Human beings, through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a meaning to their life. This view is in contradiction to Aristotle and Aquinas, who taught that essence precedes individual existence. Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as Heidegger, and Kierkegaard:

Some interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything. However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence â what Sartre would call &quot;bad faith&quot;. Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are defined only insofar as they act and that they are responsible for their actions. Someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is opposed to their genes, or &quot;human nature&quot;, bearing the blame.

As Sartre said in his lecture &quot;Existentialism is a Humanism&quot;: &quot;Man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the worldâand defines himself afterwards.&quot; The more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: a person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person.

Jonathan Webber interprets Sartre&#x27;s usage of the term &quot;essence&quot; not in a modal fashion, i.e. as necessary features, but in a teleological fashion: &quot;an essence is the relational property of having a set of parts ordered in such a way as to collectively perform some activity&quot;. For example, it belongs to the essence of a house to keep the bad weather out, which is why it has walls and a roof. Humans are different from houses becauseâunlike housesâthey do not have an inbuilt purpose: they are free to &quot;choose&quot; their own purpose and thereby shape their essence; thus, &quot;their existence precedes their essence&quot;.

Sartre is committed to a radical conception of freedom: nothing fixes our purpose but we ourselves, our projects have no weight or inertia except for our endorsement of them. Simone de Beauvoir, on the other hand, holds that there are various factors, grouped together under the term &quot;sedimentation&quot;, that offer resistance to attempts to change our direction in life. &quot;Sedimentations&quot; are themselves products of past choices and can be changed by choosing differently in the present, but such changes happen slowly. They are a force of inertia that shapes the agent&#x27;s evaluative outlook on the world until the transition is complete.

Sartre&#x27;s definition of existentialism was based on Heidegger&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Being and Time&quot; (1927). In the correspondence with Jean Beaufret later published as the &quot;Letter on Humanism&quot;, Heidegger implied that Sartre misunderstood him for his own purposes of subjectivism, and that he did not mean that actions take precedence over being so long as those actions were not reflected upon. Heidegger commented that &quot;the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement&quot;, meaning that he thought Sartre had simply switched the roles traditionally attributed to essence and existence without interrogating these concepts and their history.

=== The absurd ===

The notion of the absurd contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it. This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or &quot;unfairness&quot; of the world. This can be highlighted in the way it opposes the traditional Abrahamic religious perspective, which establishes that life&#x27;s purpose is the fulfillment of God&#x27;s commandments. This is what gives meaning to people&#x27;s lives. To live the life of the absurd means rejecting a life that finds or pursues specific meaning for man&#x27;s existence since there is nothing to be discovered. According to Albert Camus, the world or the human being is not in itself absurd. The concept only emerges through the juxtaposition of the two; life becomes absurd due to the incompatibility between human beings and the world they inhabit. This view constitutes one of the two interpretations of the absurd in existentialist literature. The second view, first elaborated by SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, holds that absurdity is limited to actions and choices of human beings. These are considered absurd since they issue from human freedom, undermining their foundation outside of themselves.

The absurd contrasts with the claim that &quot;bad things don&#x27;t happen to good people&quot;; to the world, metaphorically speaking, there is no such thing as a good person or a bad person; what happens happens, and it may just as well happen to a &quot;good&quot; person as to a &quot;bad&quot; person. Because of the world&#x27;s absurdity, anything can happen to anyone at any time and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the absurd. Many of the literary works of Kierkegaard, Beckett, Kafka, Dostoevsky, Ionesco, Miguel de Unamuno, Luigi Pirandello, Sartre, Joseph Heller, and Camus contain descriptions of people who encounter the absurdity of the world.

It is because of the devastating awareness of meaninglessness that Camus claimed in &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; that &quot;There is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.&quot; Although &quot;prescriptions&quot; against the possible deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary, from Kierkegaard&#x27;s religious &quot;stage&quot; to Camus&#x27; insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity, the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers. The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of quietism, which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy. It has been said that the possibility of suicide makes all humans existentialists. The ultimate hero of absurdism lives without meaning and faces suicide without succumbing to it.

=== Facticity ===

Facticity is defined by Sartre in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; (1943) as the &quot;in-itself&quot;, which for humans takes the form of being and not being. It is the facts of one&#x27;s personal life and as per Heidegger, it is &quot;the way in which we are thrown into the world.&quot; This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to a person&#x27;s past: one&#x27;s past forms the person who exists in the present. However, to reduce a person to their past would ignore the change a person undergoes in the present and future, while saying that one&#x27;s past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from the present self. A denial of one&#x27;s concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and also applies to other kinds of facticity (having a human body with all it&#x27;s limitations, identity, values, etc.).

Facticity is a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of a person&#x27;s facticity consists of things they did not choose (birthplace, etc.), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one&#x27;s values most likely depend on these factors. However, even though one&#x27;s facticity is fixed, it cannot determine a person: they may choose to assign as much value to their facticity as they choose. As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything. Both have committed many crimes, but the first man, remembering nothing, leads a rather normal life while the second man, feeling trapped by his past, continues a life of crime, blaming his own past. There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past.

However, to disregard one&#x27;s facticity during the evolution of one&#x27;s sense of self would be a denial of the conditions shaping the present self and would be inauthentic. An example of the focus solely on possible projects without reflecting on one&#x27;s current facticity would be continually thinking about future possibilities related to being rich (e.g. a better car, bigger house, better quality of life, etc.) without acknowledging the facticity of &quot;not currently having the financial means to do so&quot;. In this example, considering both facticity and transcendence, an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one&#x27;s current finances (e.g. putting in extra hours, or investing savings) in order to arrive at a real future, or &quot;future-facticity&quot; of a modest pay rise, further leading to purchase of an affordable car.

Another aspect of facticity is that it entails angst. Freedom &quot;produces&quot; angst when limited by facticity and the lack of the possibility of having facticity to &quot;step in&quot; and take responsibility for something one has done also produces angst.

Another aspect of existential freedom is that one can change one&#x27;s values. One is responsible for one&#x27;s values, regardless of society&#x27;s values. The focus on freedom in existentialism is related to the limits of responsibility one bears, as a result of one&#x27;s freedom. The relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible.

=== Authenticity ===
Many noted existentialists consider the theme of authentic existence important. Authenticity involves the idea that one has to &quot;create oneself&quot; and live in accordance with this self. For an authentic existence, one should act as oneself, not as &quot;one&#x27;s acts&quot; or as &quot;one&#x27;s genes&quot; or as any other essence requires. The authentic act is one in accordance with one&#x27;s freedom. A component of freedom is facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity determines one&#x27;s transcendent choices (one could then blame one&#x27;s background for making the choice one made [chosen project, from one&#x27;s transcendence]). Facticity, in relation to authenticity, involves acting on one&#x27;s actual values when making a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard&#x27;s Aesthete, &quot;choosing&quot; randomly), so that one takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values.

In contrast, the inauthentic is the denial to live in accordance with one&#x27;s freedom. This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, convincing oneself that some form of determinism is true, or &quot;mimicry&quot; where one acts as &quot;one should&quot;.

How one &quot;should&quot; act is often determined by an image one has, of how one in such a role (bank manager, lion tamer, sex worker, etc.) acts. In &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;, Sartre uses the example of a waiter in &quot;bad faith&quot;. He merely takes part in the &quot;act&quot; of being a typical waiter, albeit very convincingly. This image usually corresponds to a social norm, but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic. The main point is the attitude one takes to one&#x27;s own freedom and responsibility and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom.

=== The Other and the Look ===

The Other (written with a capital &quot;O&quot;) is a concept more properly belonging to phenomenology and its account of intersubjectivity. However, it has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. The Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this experience of the Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences)âonly from &quot;over there&quot;âthe world is constituted as objective in that it is something that is &quot;there&quot; as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things. This experience of the Other&#x27;s look is what is termed the Look (sometimes the Gaze).

While this experience, in its basic phenomenological sense, constitutes the world as objective and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity (one experiences oneself as seen in the Other&#x27;s Look in precisely the same way that one experiences the Other as seen by him, as subjectivity), in existentialism, it also acts as a kind of limitation of freedom. This is because the Look tends to objectify what it sees. When one experiences oneself in the Look, one does not experience oneself as nothing (no thing), but as something (some thing). In Sartre&#x27;s example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole, the man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in. He is in a pre-reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room. Suddenly, he hears a creaking floorboard behind him and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the Other. He is then filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doingâas a Peeping Tom. For Sartre, this phenomenological experience of shame establishes proof for the existence of other minds and defeats the problem of solipsism. For the conscious state of shame to be experienced, one has to become aware of oneself as an object of another look, proving a priori, that other minds exist. The Look is then co-constitutive of one&#x27;s facticity.

Another characteristic feature of the Look is that no Other really needs to have been there: It is possible that the creaking floorboard was simply the movement of an old house; the Look is not some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the Other sees one (there may have been someone there, but he could have not noticed that person). It is only one&#x27;s perception of the way another might perceive him.

=== Angst and dread ===
&quot;Existential angst&quot;, sometimes called existential dread, anxiety, or anguish, is a term common to many existentialist thinkers. It is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility. The archetypal example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that &quot;nothing is holding me back&quot;, one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one&#x27;s own freedom.

It can also be seen in relation to the previous point how angst is before nothing, and this is what sets it apart from fear that has an object. While one can take measures to remove an object of fear, for angst no such &quot;constructive&quot; measures are possible. The use of the word &quot;nothing&quot; in this context relates to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one&#x27;s actions and to the fact that, in experiencing freedom as angst, one also realizes that one is fully responsible for these consequences. There is nothing in people (genetically, for instance) that acts in their steadâthat they can blame if something goes wrong. Therefore, not every choice is perceived as having dreadful possible consequences (and, it can be claimed, human lives would be unbearable if every choice facilitated dread). However, this does not change the fact that freedom remains a condition of every action.

=== Despair ===

Despair is generally defined as a loss of hope. In existentialism, it is more specifically a loss of hope in reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the defining qualities of one&#x27;s self or identity. If a person is invested in being a particular thing, such as a bus driver or an upstanding citizen, and then finds their being-thing compromised, they would normally be found in a state of despairâa hopeless state. For example, a singer who loses the ability to sing may despair if they have nothing else to fall back onânothing to rely on for their identity. They find themselves unable to be what defined their being.

What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when they are not overtly in despair. So long as a person&#x27;s identity depends on qualities that can crumble, they are in perpetual despairâand as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the individual&#x27;s sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. As Kierkegaard defines it in &quot;Either/Or&quot;: &quot;Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person&#x27;s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy.&quot; In &quot;Works of Love&quot;, he says:

== Opposition to positivism and rationalism ==
Existentialists oppose defining human beings as primarily rational, and, therefore, oppose both positivism and rationalism. Existentialism asserts that people make decisions based on subjective meaning rather than pure rationality. 
The rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought, as is the focus on the anxiety and dread that we feel in the face of our own radical free will and our awareness of death. Kierkegaard advocated rationality as a means to interact with the objective world (e.g., in the natural sciences), but when it comes to existential problems, reason is insufficient: &quot;Human reason has boundaries&quot;.

Like Kierkegaard, Sartre saw problems with rationality, calling it a form of &quot;bad faith&quot;, an attempt by the self to impose structure on a world of phenomenaâ&quot;the Other&quot;âthat is fundamentally irrational and random. According to Sartre, rationality and other forms of bad faith hinder people from finding meaning in freedom. To try to suppress feelings of anxiety and dread, people confine themselves within everyday experience, Sartre asserted, thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing to being possessed in one form or another by &quot;the Look&quot; of &quot;the Other&quot; (i.e., possessed by another personâor at least one&#x27;s idea of that other person).

== Religion ==
An existentialist reading of the Bible would demand that the reader recognize that they are an existing subject studying the words more as a recollection of events. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of &quot;truths&quot; that are outside and unrelated to the reader, but may develop a sense of reality/God. Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing these commandments upon them, but as though they are inside them and guiding them from inside. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: &quot;Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor&#x27;s distance from everyday lifeâor the learner who should put it to use?&quot; Philosophers such as Hans Jonas and Rudolph Bultmann introduced the concept of existentialist demythologization into the field of early Christianity and Christian theology, respectively.

== Confusion with nihilism ==
Although nihilism and existentialism are distinct philosophies, they are often confused with one another since both are rooted in the human experience of anguish and confusion that stems from the apparent meaninglessness of a world in which humans are compelled to find or create meaning. A primary cause of confusion is that Friedrich Nietzsche was an important philosopher in both fields.

Existentialist philosophers often stress the importance of angst as signifying the absolute lack of any objective ground for action, a move that is often reduced to moral or existential nihilism. A pervasive theme in existentialist philosophy, however, is to persist through encounters with the absurd, as seen in Albert Camus&#x27;s philosophical essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; (1942): &quot;One must imagine Sisyphus happy&quot;. and it is only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality or one&#x27;s self-created meaning: SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard regained a sort of morality in the religious (although he would not agree that it was ethical; the religious suspends the ethical), and Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s final words in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; (1943): &quot;All these questions, which refer us to a pure and not an accessory (or impure) reflection, can find their reply only on the ethical plane. We shall devote to them a future work.&quot;

== History ==

=== Precursors ===
Some have argued that existentialism has long been an element of European religious thought, even before the term came into use. William Barrett identified Blaise Pascal and SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard as two specific examples. Jean Wahl also identified William Shakespeare&#x27;s Prince Hamlet (&quot;To be, or not to be&quot;), Jules Lequier, Thomas Carlyle, and William James as existentialists. According to Wahl, &quot;the origins of most great philosophies, like those of Plato, Descartes, and Kant, are to be found in existential reflections.&quot; Precursors to existentialism can also be identified in the works of Iranian Muslim philosopher Mulla Sadra (c. 1571â1635), who would posit that &quot;existence precedes essence&quot; becoming the principle expositor of the School of Isfahan, which is described as &quot;alive and active&quot;.

=== 19th century ===

==== Kierkegaard and Nietzsche ====
Kierkegaard is generally considered to have been the first existentialist philosopher. He proposed that each individualânot reason, society, or religious orthodoxyâis solely tasked with giving meaning to life and living it sincerely, or &quot;authentically&quot;.

Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement, though neither used the term &quot;existentialism&quot; and it is unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism of the 20th century. They focused on subjective human experience rather than the objective truths of mathematics and science, which they believed were too detached or observational to truly get at the human experience. Like Pascal, they were interested in people&#x27;s quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom. Unlike Pascal, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche also considered the role of making free choices, particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs, and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser. Kierkegaard&#x27;s knight of faith and Nietzsche&#x27;s Ãbermensch are representative of people who exhibit freedom, in that they define the nature of their own existence. Nietzsche&#x27;s idealized individual invents his own values and creates the very terms they excel under. By contrast, Kierkegaard, opposed to the level of abstraction in Hegel, and not nearly as hostile (actually welcoming) to Christianity as Nietzsche, argues through a pseudonym that the objective certainty of religious truths (specifically Christian) is not only impossible, but even founded on logical paradoxes. Yet he continues to imply that a leap of faith is a possible means for an individual to reach a higher stage of existence that transcends and contains both an aesthetic and ethical value of life. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were also precursors to other intellectual movements, including postmodernism, and various strands of psychotherapy. However, Kierkegaard believed that individuals should live in accordance with their thinking.

In &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot;, Nietzsche&#x27;s sentiments resonate the idea of &quot;existence precedes essence.&quot; He writes, &quot;no one &quot;gives&quot; man his qualities-- neither God, nor society, nor his parents and ancestors, nor he himself...No one is responsible for man&#x27;s being there at all, for his being such-and-such, or for his being in these circumstances or in this environment...Man is not the effect of some special purpose of a will, and end...&quot; Within this view, Nietzsche ties in his rejection of the existence of God, which he sees as a means to &quot;redeem the world.&quot; By rejecting the existence of God, Nietzsche also rejects beliefs that claim humans have a predestined purpose according to what God has instructed.

====Dostoyevsky====

The first important literary author also important to existentialism was the Russian, Dostoyevsky. Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself. Sartre, in his book on existentialism &quot;Existentialism is a Humanism&quot;, quoted Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; as an example of existential crisis. Other Dostoyevsky novels covered issues raised in existentialist philosophy while presenting story lines divergent from secular existentialism: for example, in &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, the protagonist Raskolnikov experiences an existential crisis and then moves toward a Christian Orthodox worldview similar to that advocated by Dostoyevsky himself.

=== Early 20th century ===
In the first decades of the 20th century, a number of philosophers and writers explored existentialist ideas. The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo, in his 1913 book &quot;The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations&quot;, emphasized the life of &quot;flesh and bone&quot; as opposed to that of abstract rationalism. Unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual&#x27;s quest for faith. He retained a sense of the tragic, even absurd nature of the quest, symbolized by his enduring interest in the eponymous character from the Miguel de Cervantes novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. A novelist, poet and dramatist as well as philosophy professor at the University of Salamanca, Unamuno wrote a short story about a priest&#x27;s crisis of faith, &quot;Saint Manuel the Good, Martyr&quot;, which has been collected in anthologies of existentialist fiction. Another Spanish thinker, JosÃ© Ortega y Gasset, writing in 1914, held that human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life: &quot;Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia&quot; (&quot;I am myself and my circumstances&quot;). Sartre likewise believed that human existence is not an abstract matter, but is always situated (&quot;en situation&quot;).

Although Martin Buber wrote his major philosophical works in German, and studied and taught at the Universities of Berlin and Frankfurt, he stands apart from the mainstream of German philosophy. Born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1878, he was also a scholar of Jewish culture and involved at various times in Zionism and Hasidism. In 1938, he moved permanently to Jerusalem. His best-known philosophical work was the short book &quot;I and Thou&quot;, published in 1922. For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence, too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought, is &quot;man with man&quot;, a dialogue that takes place in the so-called &quot;sphere of between&quot; (&quot;das Zwischenmenschliche&quot;).

Two Russian philosophers, Lev Shestov and Nikolai Berdyaev, became well known as existentialist thinkers during their post-Revolutionary exiles in Paris. Shestov had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as 1905 in his book of aphorisms &quot;All Things Are Possible&quot;. Berdyaev drew a radical distinction between the world of spirit and the everyday world of objects. Human freedom, for Berdyaev, is rooted in the realm of spirit, a realm independent of scientific notions of causation. To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom. &quot;Man&quot; is not to be interpreted naturalistically, but as a being created in God&#x27;s image, an originator of free, creative acts. He published a major work on these themes, &quot;The Destiny of Man&quot;, in 1931.

Gabriel Marcel, long before coining the term &quot;existentialism&quot;, introduced important existentialist themes to a French audience in his early essay &quot;Existence and Objectivity&quot; (1925) and in his &quot;Metaphysical Journal&quot; (1927). A dramatist as well as a philosopher, Marcel found his philosophical starting point in a condition of metaphysical alienation: the human individual searching for harmony in a transient life. Harmony, for Marcel, was to be sought through &quot;secondary reflection&quot;, a &quot;dialogical&quot; rather than &quot;dialectical&quot; approach to the world, characterized by &quot;wonder and astonishment&quot; and open to the &quot;presence&quot; of other people and of God rather than merely to &quot;information&quot; about them. For Marcel, such presence implied more than simply being there (as one thing might be in the presence of another thing); it connoted &quot;extravagant&quot; availability, and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other.

Marcel contrasted &quot;secondary reflection&quot; with abstract, scientific-technical &quot;primary reflection&quot;, which he associated with the activity of the abstract Cartesian ego. For Marcel, philosophy was a concrete activity undertaken by a sensing, feeling human being incarnateâembodiedâin a concrete world. Although Sartre adopted the term &quot;existentialism&quot; for his own philosophy in the 1940s, Marcel&#x27;s thought has been described as &quot;almost diametrically opposed&quot; to that of Sartre. Unlike Sartre, Marcel was a Christian, and became a Catholic convert in 1929.

In Germany, the psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspersâwho later described existentialism as a &quot;phantom&quot; created by the publicâcalled his own thought, heavily influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, &quot;Existenzphilosophie&quot;. For Jaspers, &quot;&quot;Existenz&quot;-philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself...This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker&quot;.

Jaspers, a professor at the university of Heidelberg, was acquainted with Heidegger, who held a professorship at Marburg before acceding to Husserl&#x27;s chair at Freiburg in 1928. They held many philosophical discussions, but later became estranged over Heidegger&#x27;s support of National Socialism. They shared an admiration for Kierkegaard, and in the 1930s, Heidegger lectured extensively on Nietzsche. Nevertheless, the extent to which Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In &quot;Being and Time&quot; he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (&quot;Dasein&quot;) to be analysed in terms of existential categories (&quot;existentiale&quot;); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement.

=== After the Second World War ===

Following the Second World War, existentialism became a well-known and significant philosophical and cultural movement, mainly through the public prominence of two French writers, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, who wrote best-selling novels, plays and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts. These years also saw the growing reputation of &quot;Being and Time&quot; outside Germany.
Sartre dealt with existentialist themes in his 1938 novel &quot;Nausea&quot; and the short stories in his 1939 collection &quot;The Wall&quot;, and had published his treatise on existentialism, &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;, in 1943, but it was in the two years following the liberation of Paris from the German occupying forces that he and his close associatesâCamus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and othersâbecame internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism. In a very short period of time, Camus and Sartre in particular became the leading public intellectuals of post-war France, achieving by the end of 1945 &quot;a fame that reached across all audiences.&quot; Camus was an editor of the most popular leftist (former French Resistance) newspaper &quot;Combat&quot;; Sartre launched his journal of leftist thought, &quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot;, and two weeks later gave the widely reported lecture on existentialism and secular humanism to a packed meeting of the Club Maintenant. Beauvoir wrote that &quot;not a week passed without the newspapers discussing us&quot;; existentialism became &quot;the first media craze of the postwar era.&quot;

By the end of 1947, Camus&#x27; earlier fiction and plays had been reprinted, his new play &quot;Caligula&quot; had been performed and his novel &quot;The Plague&quot; published; the first two novels of Sartre&#x27;s &quot;The Roads to Freedom&quot; trilogy had appeared, as had Beauvoir&#x27;s novel &quot;The Blood of Others&quot;. Works by Camus and Sartre were already appearing in foreign editions. The Paris-based existentialists had become famous.

Sartre had traveled to Germany in 1930 to study the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, and he included critical comments on their work in his major treatise &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;. Heidegger&#x27;s thought had also become known in French philosophical circles through its use by Alexandre KojÃ¨ve in explicating Hegel in a series of lectures given in Paris in the 1930s. The lectures were highly influential; members of the audience included not only Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, but Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, Louis Althusser, AndrÃ© Breton, and Jacques Lacan. A selection from &quot;Being and Time&quot; was published in French in 1938, and his essays began to appear in French philosophy journals.
Heidegger read Sartre&#x27;s work and was initially impressed, commenting: &quot;Here for the first time I encountered an independent thinker who, from the foundations up, has experienced the area out of which I think. Your work shows such an immediate comprehension of my philosophy as I have never before encountered.&quot; Later, however, in response to a question posed by his French follower Jean Beaufret, Heidegger distanced himself from Sartre&#x27;s position and existentialism in general in his &quot;Letter on Humanism&quot;. Heidegger&#x27;s reputation continued to grow in France during the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, Sartre attempted to reconcile existentialism and Marxism in his work &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot;. A major theme throughout his writings was freedom and responsibility.

Camus was a friend of Sartre, until their falling-out, and wrote several works with existential themes including &quot;The Rebel&quot;, &quot;Summer in Algiers&quot;, &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, and &quot;The Stranger&quot;, the latter being &quot;consideredâto what would have been Camus&#x27;s irritationâthe exemplary existentialist novel.&quot; Camus, like many others, rejected the existentialist label, and considered his works concerned with facing the absurd. In the titular book, Camus uses the analogy of the Greek myth of Sisyphus to demonstrate the futility of existence. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned for eternity to roll a rock up a hill, but when he reaches the summit, the rock will roll to the bottom again. Camus believes that this existence is pointless but that Sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task, simply by continually applying himself to it. The first half of the book contains an extended rebuttal of what Camus took to be existentialist philosophy in the works of Kierkegaard, Shestov, Heidegger, and Jaspers.

Simone de Beauvoir, an important existentialist who spent much of her life as Sartre&#x27;s partner, wrote about feminist and existentialist ethics in her works, including &quot;The Second Sex&quot; and &quot;The Ethics of Ambiguity&quot;. Although often overlooked due to her relationship with Sartre, de Beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism, unheard of at the time, resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as Camus.

Paul Tillich, an important existentialist theologian following Kierkegaard and Karl Barth, applied existentialist concepts to Christian theology, and helped introduce existential theology to the general public. His seminal work &quot;The Courage to Be&quot; follows Kierkegaard&#x27;s analysis of anxiety and life&#x27;s absurdity, but puts forward the thesis that modern humans must, via God, achieve selfhood in spite of life&#x27;s absurdity. Rudolf Bultmann used Kierkegaard&#x27;s and Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy of existence to demythologize Christianity by interpreting Christian mythical concepts into existentialist concepts.

Maurice Merleau-Ponty, an existential phenomenologist, was for a time a companion of Sartre. Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Perception&quot; (1945) was recognized as a major statement of French existentialism. It has been said that Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s work &quot;Humanism and Terror&quot; greatly influenced Sartre. However, in later years they were to disagree irreparably, dividing many existentialists such as de Beauvoir, who sided with Sartre.

Colin Wilson, an English writer, published his study &quot;The Outsider&quot; in 1956, initially to critical acclaim. In this book and others (e.g. &quot;Introduction to the New Existentialism&quot;), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience. He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards.

==== Film and television ====

Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1957 anti-war film &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; &quot;illustrates, and even illuminates...existentialism&quot; by examining the &quot;necessary absurdity of the human condition&quot; and the &quot;horror of war&quot;. The film tells the story of a fictional World War I French army regiment ordered to attack an impregnable German stronghold; when the attack fails, three soldiers are chosen at random, court-martialed by a &quot;kangaroo court&quot;, and executed by firing squad. The film examines existentialist ethics, such as the issue of whether objectivity is possible and the &quot;problem of authenticity&quot;. Orson Welles&#x27;s 1962 film &quot;The Trial&quot;, based upon Franz Kafka&#x27;s book of the same name (&quot;Der ProzeÃ&quot;), is characteristic of both existentialist and absurdist themes in its depiction of a man (Joseph K.) arrested for a crime for which the charges are neither revealed to him nor to the reader.

&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; is a Japanese science fiction animation series created by the anime studio Gainax and was both directed and written by Hideaki Anno. Existential themes of individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility are heavily relied upon throughout the entire series, particularly through the philosophies of Jean-Paul Sartre and SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard. Episode 16&#x27;s title, is a reference to Kierkegaard&#x27;s book, &quot;The Sickness Unto Death&quot;.

Some contemporary films dealing with existentialist issues include &quot;Melancholia&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot;, &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot;, &quot;Waking Life&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Ordinary People&quot;, &quot;Life in a Day&quot;, &quot;Barbie&quot;, and &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;. Likewise, films throughout the 20th century such as &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, &quot;Ikiru&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films, &quot;PokÃ©mon: The First Movie&quot;, &quot;The Great Silence&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;, &quot;High Noon&quot;, &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;Badlands&quot;, and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; also have existentialist qualities.
Notable directors known for their existentialist films include Ingmar Bergman, Bela Tarr, Robert Bresson, Jean-Pierre Melville, FranÃ§ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa, Terrence Malick, Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, Ãric Rohmer, Wes Anderson, Woody Allen, and Christopher Nolan. Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; focuses on the protagonist&#x27;s desire to find existential meaning. Similarly, in Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Red Beard&quot;, the protagonist&#x27;s experiences as an intern in a rural health clinic in Japan lead him to an existential crisis whereby he questions his reason for being. This, in turn, leads him to a better understanding of humanity. The French film, &quot;Mood Indigo&quot; (directed by Michel Gondry) embraced various elements of existentialism. The film &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, released in 1994, depicts life in a prison in Maine, United States to explore several existentialist concepts.

==== Literature ====

Existential perspectives are also found in modern literature to varying degrees, especially since the 1920s. Louis-Ferdinand CÃ©line&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot; (&quot;Voyage au bout de la nuit&quot;, 1932) celebrated by both Sartre and Beauvoir, contained many of the themes that would be found in later existential literature, and is in some ways, the proto-existential novel. Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Nausea&quot; was &quot;steeped in Existential ideas&quot;, and is considered an accessible way of grasping his philosophical stance. Between 1900 and 1960, other authors such as Albert Camus, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke, T. S. Eliot, Yukio Mishima, Hermann Hesse, Luigi Pirandello, Ralph Ellison, and Jack Kerouac composed literature or poetry that contained, to varying degrees, elements of existential or proto-existential thought. The philosophy&#x27;s influence even reached pulp literature shortly after the turn of the 20th century, as seen in the existential disparity witnessed in Man&#x27;s lack of control of his fate in the works of H. P. Lovecraft.

==== Theatre ====
Sartre wrote &quot;No Exit&quot; in 1944, an existentialist play originally published in French as &quot;Huis Clos&quot; (meaning &quot;&quot; or &quot;behind closed doors&quot;), which is the source of the popular quote, &quot;Hell is other people.&quot; (In French, &quot;L&#x27;enfer, c&#x27;est les autres&quot;). The play begins with a Valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell. Eventually he is joined by two women. After their entry, the Valet leaves and the door is shut and locked. All three expect to be tortured, but no torturer arrives. Instead, they realize they are there to torture each other, which they do effectively by probing each other&#x27;s sins, desires, and unpleasant memories.

Existentialist themes are displayed in the Theatre of the Absurd, notably in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone (or something) named Godot who never arrives. They claim Godot is an acquaintance, but in fact, hardly know him, admitting they would not recognize him if they saw him. Samuel Beckett, once asked who or what Godot is, replied, &quot;If I knew, I would have said so in the play.&quot; To occupy themselves, the men eat, sleep, talk, argue, sing, play games, exercise, swap hats, and contemplate suicideâanything &quot;to hold the terrible silence at bay&quot;. The play &quot;exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and pathos.&quot; The play also illustrates an attitude toward human experience on earth: the poignancy, oppression, camaraderie, hope, corruption, and bewilderment of human experience that can be reconciled only in the mind and art of the absurdist. The play examines questions such as death, the meaning of human existence and the place of God in human existence.

Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; is an absurdist tragicomedy first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966. The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Comparisons have also been drawn to Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, for the presence of two central characters who appear almost as two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing Questions, impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time. The two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world beyond their understanding. They stumble through philosophical arguments while not realizing the implications, and muse on the irrationality and randomness of the world.

Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot; also presents arguments founded on existentialist ideas. It is a tragedy inspired by Greek mythology and the play of the same name (&quot;Antigone&quot;, by Sophocles) from the fifth century BC. In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original French form, approximately &quot;Ante-GÅN.&quot; The play was first performed in Paris on 6 February 1944, during the Nazi occupation of France. Produced under Nazi censorship, the play is purposefully ambiguous with regards to the rejection of authority (represented by Antigone) and the acceptance of it (represented by Creon). The parallels to the French Resistance and the Nazi occupation have been drawn. Antigone rejects life as desperately meaningless but without affirmatively choosing a noble death. The crux of the play is the lengthy dialogue concerning the nature of power, fate, and choice, during which Antigone says that she is, &quot;...Â disgusted with [the]...promise of a humdrum happiness.&quot; She states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence.

Critic Martin Esslin in his book &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot; pointed out how many contemporary playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, EugÃ¨ne Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Arthur Adamov wove into their plays the existentialist belief that we are absurd beings loose in a universe empty of real meaning. Esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by Sartre and Camus. Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled &quot;Absurdist&quot; (based on Esslin&#x27;s book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with &#x27;Pataphysics or with Surrealism than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin&#x27;s observation.
=== Activism ===

Black existentialism explores the existence and experiences of Black people in the world. Classical and contemporary thinkers include C.L.R James, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B DuBois, Frantz Fanon, Angela Davis, Cornel West, Naomi Zack, bell hooks, Stuart Hall, Lewis Gordon, and Audre Lorde.

=== Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ===
A major offshoot of existentialism as a philosophy is existentialist psychology and psychoanalysis, which first crystallized in the work of Otto Rank, Freud&#x27;s closest associate for 20 years. Without awareness of the writings of Rank, Ludwig Binswanger was influenced by Freud, Edmund Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre. A later figure was Viktor Frankl, who briefly met Freud as a young man. His logotherapy can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy. The existentialists would also influence social psychology, antipositivist micro-sociology, symbolic interactionism, and post-structuralism, with the work of thinkers such as Georg Simmel and Michel Foucault. Foucault was a great reader of Kierkegaard even though he almost never refers to this author, who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive.

An early contributor to existentialist psychology in the United States was Rollo May, who was strongly influenced by Kierkegaard and Otto Rank. One of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existentialist psychology in the US is Irvin D. Yalom. Yalom states that
A more recent contributor to the development of a European version of existentialist psychotherapy is the British-based Emmy van Deurzen.

Anxiety&#x27;s importance in existentialism makes it a popular topic in psychotherapy. Therapists often offer existentialist philosophy as an explanation for anxiety. The assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual&#x27;s complete freedom to decide, and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions. Psychotherapists using an existentialist approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively. Instead of suppressing anxiety, patients are advised to use it as grounds for change. By embracing anxiety as inevitable, a person can use it to achieve his full potential in life. Humanistic psychology also had major impetus from existentialist psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets. Terror management theory, based on the writings of Ernest Becker and Otto Rank, is a developing area of study within the academic study of psychology. It looks at what researchers claim are implicit emotional reactions of people confronted with the knowledge that they will eventually die.

Also, Gerd B. Achenbach has refreshed the Socratic tradition with his own blend of philosophical counseling; as did Michel Weber with his Chromatiques Center in Belgium.

== Criticisms ==

=== General criticisms ===
Walter Kaufmann criticized &quot;the profoundly unsound methods and the dangerous contempt for reason that have been so prominent in existentialism.&quot; Logical positivist philosophers, such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer, assert that existentialists are often confused about the verb &quot;to be&quot; in their analyses of &quot;being&quot;. Specifically, they argue that the verb &quot;is&quot; is transitive and pre-fixed to a predicate (e.g., an apple &quot;is red&quot;) (without a predicate, the word &quot;is&quot; is meaningless), and that existentialists frequently misuse the term in this manner. Colin Wilson has stated in his book &quot;The Angry Years&quot; that existentialism has created many of its own difficulties: &quot;We can see how this question of freedom of the will has been vitiated by post-romantic philosophy, with its inbuilt tendency to laziness and boredom, we can also see how it came about that existentialism found itself in a hole of its own digging, and how the philosophical developments since then have amounted to walking in circles round that hole.&quot;

=== Sartre&#x27;s philosophy ===
Many critics argue Sartre&#x27;s philosophy is contradictory. Specifically, they argue that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claiming that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. Herbert Marcuse criticized &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: &quot;Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it hypostatizes specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory.&quot;

In &quot;Letter on Humanism&quot;, Heidegger criticized Sartre&#x27;s existentialism:

<text>The ellipsis (, plural ellipses; from , , ), rendered , alternatively described as suspension points/dots, points/periods of ellipsis, or ellipsis points, or colloquially, dot-dot-dot, is a punctuation mark consisting of a series of three dots. An ellipsis can be used in many ways, such as for intentional omission of text or numbers, to imply a concept without using words. Style guides differ on how to render an ellipsis in printed material.

==Style==
Opinions differ on how to render an ellipsis in printed material and are to some extent based on the technology used for rendering. According to &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, it should consist of three periods, each separated from its neighbor by a non-breaking space: . According to the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;, the periods should be rendered with no space between them: . A third option available in electronic text is to use the precomposed character U+2026 .
When text is omitted following a sentence, a period (full stop) terminates the sentence, and a subsequent ellipsis indicates one or more omitted sentences before continuing a longer quotation. &quot;Business Insider&quot; magazine suggests this style and it is also used in many academic journals. The &quot;Associated Press Stylebook&quot; favors this approach.

When a sentence ends with ellipsis, some style guides indicate there should be four dots; three for ellipsis and a period. &quot;Chicago&quot; advises it, as does the &quot;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association&quot; (APA style), while some other style guides do not; the &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; and related works treat this style as optional, saying that it &quot;may&quot; be used.

==In writing==
In her book on the ellipsis, &quot;Ellipsis in English Literature: Signs of Omission&quot;, Anne Toner suggests that the first use of the punctuation in the English language dates to a 1588 translation of Terence&#x27;s &quot;Andria&quot;, by Maurice Kyffin. In this case, however, the ellipsis consists not of dots but of short dashes. &quot;Subpuncting&quot; of medieval manuscripts also denotes omitted meaning and may be related.

The popularity of the ellipsis took off after Kyffin&#x27;s usage; containing three examples in his 1588 translation of &quot;Andria&quot;, by the 1627 translation of the same play there were 29 examples of its usage. They appear in William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in addition to Ben Jonson&#x27;s. In 1634, John Barton, an English schoolmaster, wrote in &quot;The Art of Rhetorick&quot; that &quot;eclipsis&quot; is much used in playbooks âwhere they are noted thus ---â. In the first folio edition of Shakespeareâs &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, Toner writes, &quot;Hotspur dies on a dash&quot;, with his last words cut short.

Different types of ellipsis faced opposition. In the 18th-century, Jonathan Swift rhymed &quot;dash&quot; with &quot;printed trash&quot;, while Henry Fielding chose the name &#x27;Dash&#x27; for an unlikeable character in his 1730 play &quot;The Author&#x27;s Farce&quot;. It has also been championed by writers such as Percy Bysshe Shelley, Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf. According to Toner, an early example of the dot dot dot phrase is in Woolf&#x27;s short story &quot;An Unwritten Novel&quot; (1920).

Occasionally, it would be used in pulp fiction and other works of early 20th-century fiction to denote expletives that would otherwise have been censored.

An ellipsis may also imply an unstated alternative indicated by context. For example, &quot;I never drink wineÂ ...&quot; implies that the speaker does drink something elsesuch as vodka.

In reported speech, the ellipsis can be used to represent an intentional silence.

In poetry, an ellipsis is used as a thought-pause or line break at the caesura or this is used to highlight sarcasm or make the reader think about the last points in the poem.

In news reporting, often put inside square brackets, it is used to indicate that a quotation has been condensed for space, brevity or relevance, as in &quot;The President said that [...] he would not be satisfied&quot;, where the exact quotation was &quot;The President said that, for as long as this situation continued, he would not be satisfied&quot;.

Herb Caen, Pulitzer-prize-winning columnist for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, became famous for his &quot;three-dot journalism&quot;.

Depending on context, ellipsis can indicate an unfinished thought, a leading statement, a slight pause, an echoing voice, or a nervous or awkward silence. Aposiopesis is the use of an ellipsis to trail off into silenceâfor example: &quot;But I thought he was...&quot; When placed at the end of a sentence, an ellipsis may be used to suggest melancholy or longing.

In newspaper and magazine columns, ellipses may separate items of a list instead of paragraph breaks.

Merriam-Webster&#x27;s &quot;Manual for Writers and Editors&quot; uses a line of ellipsis to indicate omission of whole lines in a quoted poem.

==In different languages==
===In English===
====American English====
&quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; suggests the use of an ellipsis for any omitted word, phrase, line, or paragraph from within but not at the end of a quoted passage. There are two commonly used methods of using ellipses: one uses three dots for any omission, while the second one makes a distinction between omissions within a sentence (using three dots:Â .Â .Â .) and omissions between sentences (using a period and a space followed by three dots:Â .Â ...). The &quot;Chicago Style&quot; recommends that writers avoid using the precomposed Â (U+2026) character in manuscripts and to place three periods plus two nonbreaking spaces (.Â .Â .) instead, leaving the editor, publisher, or typographer to replace them later.

The Modern Language Association (MLA) used to indicate that an ellipsis must include spaces before and after each dot in all uses. If an ellipsis is meant to represent an omission, square brackets must surround the ellipsis to make it clear that there was no pause in the original quote: . Currently, the MLA has removed the requirement of brackets in its style handbooks. However, some maintain that the use of brackets is still correct because it clears confusion.

The MLA now indicates that a three-dot, spaced ellipsis should be used for removing material from within one sentence within a quote. When crossing sentences (when the omitted text contains a period, so that omitting the end of a sentence counts), a four-dot, spaced (except for before the first dot) ellipsis should be used. When ellipsis points are used in the original text, ellipsis points that are not in the original text should be distinguished by enclosing them in square brackets (e.g. ).

According to the Associated Press, the ellipsis should be used to condense quotations. It is less commonly used to indicate a pause in speech or an unfinished thought or to separate items in material such as show business gossip. The stylebook indicates that if the shortened sentence before the mark can stand as a sentence, it should do so, with an ellipsis placed after the period or other ending punctuation. When material is omitted at the end of a paragraph and also immediately following it, an ellipsis goes both at the end of that paragraph and at the beginning of the next, according to this style.

According to Robert Bringhurst&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Typographic Style&quot;, the details of typesetting ellipses depend on the character and size of the font being set and the typographer&#x27;s preference. Bringhurst writes that a full space between each dot is &quot;another Victorian eccentricity. In most contexts, the Chicago ellipsis is much too wide&quot;âhe recommends using flush dots (with a normal word space before and after), or &quot;thin&quot;-spaced dots (up to one-fifth of an em), or the prefabricated ellipsis character . Bringhurst suggests that normally an ellipsis should be spaced fore-and-aft to separate it from the text, but when it combines with other punctuation, the leading space disappears and the other punctuation follows. This is the usual practice in typesetting. He provides the following examples:

In legal writing in the United States, Rule 5.3 in the &quot;Bluebook&quot; citation guide governs the use of ellipses and requires a space before the first dot and between the two subsequent dots. If an ellipsis ends the sentence, then there are three dots, each separated by a space, followed by the final punctuation (e.g. ). In some legal writing, an ellipsis is written as three asterisks, or , to make it obvious that text has been omitted or to signal that the omitted text extends beyond the end of the paragraph.

====British English====
&quot;The Oxford Style Guide&quot; recommends setting the ellipsis as a single character or as a series of three (narrow) spaced dots surrounded by spaces, thus: . If there is an ellipsis at the end of an incomplete sentence, the final full stop is omitted. However, it is retained if the following ellipsis represents an omission between two complete sentences.

&lt;poem&gt;The ... fox jumps ...
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. ... And if they have not died, they are still alive today.
It is not cold ... it is freezing cold.&lt;/poem&gt;

Contrary to &quot;The Oxford Style Guide&quot;, the &quot;University of Oxford Style Guide&quot; demands an ellipsis not to be surrounded by spaces, except when it stands for a pause; then, a space has to be set after the ellipsis (but not before), and it states that an ellipsis should never be preceded or followed by a full stop.

&lt;poem&gt;The...fox jumps...
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog...And if they have not died, they are still alive today.
It is not cold... it is freezing cold.&lt;/poem&gt;

===In Polish===
When applied in Polish syntax, the ellipsis is called , literally &quot;multidot&quot;. The word &quot;wielokropek&quot; distinguishes the ellipsis of Polish syntax from that of mathematical notation, in which it is known as an . When an ellipsis replaces a fragment omitted from a quotation, the ellipsis is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. An unbracketed ellipsis indicates an interruption or pause in speech. The syntactic rules for ellipses are standardized by the 1983 Polska Norma document PN-83/P-55366, (Rules for Setting Texts in Polish).

===In Russian===
The combination &quot;ellipsis+period&quot; is replaced by the ellipsis. The combinations &quot;ellipsis+exclamation mark&quot; and &quot;ellipsis+question mark&quot; are written in this way: !.. ?..

===In Japanese===
The most common character corresponding to an ellipsis is called &quot;3&quot;-ten rÄ«dÄ (&quot;&quot;3&quot;-dot leaders&quot;, ). 2-ten rÄ«dÄ exists as a character, but it is used less commonly. In writing, the ellipsis consists usually of six dots (two &quot;3&quot;-ten rÄ«dÄ characters, ). Three dots (one &quot;3&quot;-ten rÄ«dÄ character) may be used where space is limited, such as in a header. However, variations in the number of dots exist. In horizontally written text the dots are commonly vertically centered within the text height (between the baseline and the ascent line), as in the standard Japanese Windows fonts; in vertically written text the dots are always centered horizontally. As the Japanese word for dot is pronounced &quot;, the dots are colloquially called &quot; (, akin to the English &quot;dot dot dot&quot;).

In text in Japanese media, such as in manga or video games, ellipses are much more frequent than in English, and are often changed to another punctuation sign in translation. The ellipsis by itself represents speechlessness, or a &quot;pregnant pause&quot;. Depending on the context, this could be anything from an admission of guilt to an expression of being dumbfounded at another person&#x27;s words or actions. As a device, the &quot;ten-ten-ten&quot; is intended to focus the reader on a character while allowing the character to not speak any dialogue. This conveys to the reader a focus of the narrative &quot;camera&quot; on the silent subject, implying an expectation of some motion or action. It is not unheard of to see inanimate objects &quot;speaking&quot; the ellipsis.

===In Chinese===
In Chinese, the ellipsis is six dots (in two groups of three dots, occupying the same horizontal or vertical space as two characters). In horizontally written text the dots are commonly vertically centered along the midline (halfway between the Roman descent and Roman ascent, or equivalently halfway between the Roman baseline and the capital height, i.e. ). This is generally true of Traditional Chinese, while Simplified Chinese tends to have the ellipses aligned with the baseline; in vertically written text the dots are always centered horizontally (i.e. ). Also note that Taiwan and China have different punctuation standards.

===In Spanish===
In Spanish, the ellipsis is commonly used as a substitute of &quot;et cetera&quot; at the end of unfinished lists. So it means &quot;and so forth&quot; or &quot;and other things&quot;.

Other use is the suspension of a part of a text, or a paragraph, or a phrase or a part of a word because it is obvious, or unnecessary, or implied. For instance, sometimes the ellipsis is used to avoid the complete use of expletives.

When the ellipsis is placed alone into a parenthesis (...) orâless oftenâbetween brackets [...], which is what happens usually within a text transcription, it means the original text had more contents on the same position but are not useful to our target in the transcription. When the suppressed text is at the beginning or at the end of a text, the ellipsis does not need to be placed in a parenthesis.

The number of dots is three and only three. They should have no space in between them nor with the preceding word, but there should be an space with the following word (except if they are followed by a punctuation sign, such as a comma).

===In French===
In French, the ellipsis is commonly used at the end of lists to represent . In French typography, the ellipsis is written immediately after the preceding word, but has a space after it, for example: . If, exceptionally, it begins a sentence, there is a space before and after, for example: . However, any omitted word, phrase or line at the end of a quoted passage would be indicated as follows: [...] (space before and after the square brackets but not inside), for example: .

===In German===
In German, the ellipsis in general is surrounded by spaces, if it stands for one or more omitted words. On the other side there is no space between a letter or (part of) a word and an ellipsis, if it stands for one or more omitted letters, that should stick to the written letter or letters.

Example for both cases, using German style: &quot;The first el...is stands for omitted letters, the second ... for an omitted word.&quot;

If the ellipsis is at the end of a sentence, the final full stop is omitted.

Example: &quot;I think that ...&quot;

=== In Italian ===
The suggests the use of an ellipsis () to indicate a pause longer than a period and, when placed between brackets, the omission of letters, words or phrases. 

==In mathematical notation==
An ellipsis is used in mathematics to mean &quot;and so forth&quot;; usually indicating the omission of terms that follow an obvious pattern as indicated by included terms.

The whole numbers from 1 to 100 can be shown as:

: formula_1

The positive whole numbers, an infinite list, can be shown as:

: formula_2

To indicate omitted terms in a repeated operation, an ellipsis is sometimes raised from the baseline, as:

: formula_3

But, this raised formatting is not standard. For example, Russian mathematical texts use the baseline format.

The ellipsis is not a formally defined mathematical symbol. Repeated summations or products may be more formally denoted using capital sigma and capital pi notation, respectively:

: formula_4 (see termial)
: formula_5 (see factorial)

Ellipsis is sometimes used where the pattern is not clear. For example, indicating the indefinite continuation of an irrational number such as:

: formula_6

It can be useful to display an expression compactly, for example:

: formula_7

In set notation, the ellipsis is used as horizontal, vertical and diagonal for indicating missing matrix terms, such as the size-&quot;n&quot; identity matrix:

: formula_8

==In computer programming==
Some programming languages use ellipsis to indicate a range or for a variable argument list.

The CSS codice_1 property can be set to codice_2, which cuts off text with an ellipsis when it overflows the content area.

==In computer user interface==

===More===
An ellipsis is sometimes used as the label for a button to access user interface that has been omitted probably due to space limitations particularly in mobile apps running on small screen devices. This may be described as a &quot;more button&quot;.

Similar functionality may be accessible via a button with a hamburger icon (â¡) or a narrow version called the kebab icon which is a vertical ellipsis ().

===More info needed===

According to some style guides, a menu item or button labeled with a trailing ellipsis requests an operation that cannot be completed without additional information and selecting it will prompt the user for input. Without an ellipsis, selecting the item or button will perform an action without user input.

For example, the menu item &quot;Save&quot; overwrites an existing file whereas &quot;Save as...&quot; prompts the user for save options before saving.

===Busy/progress===
Ellipsis is commonly used to indicate that a longer-lasting operation is in progress like &quot;Loading...&quot;, &quot;Saving...&quot;.

Sometimes progress is animated with an ellipse-like construct of repeatedly adding dots to a label.

==In texting==
In text-based communications, the ellipsis may indicate:
* Floor holding, signal that more is to come, for instance when people break up longer turns in chat.
* Politeness, for instance indicating topic change or hesitation.
* Turn construction unit to signal silence, for example when indicating disagreement, disapproval or confusion.

Although an ellipsis is complete with three periods (...), an ellipsis-like construct with more dots is used to indicate &quot;trailing-off&quot; or &quot;silence&quot;. The extent of repetition in itself might serve as an additional contextualization or paralinguistic cue; one paper wrote that they &quot;extend the lexical meaning of the words, add character to the sentences, and allow fine-tuning and personalisation of the message&quot;.

While composing a text message, some environments show others in the conversation a typing awareness indicator ellipsis to indicate remote activity.

==Computer representations==
In computing, several ellipsis characters have been codified.

===Unicode===

Unicode defines the following ellipsis characters:
* 
* 
* 
* 

Unicode recognizes a series of three period characters () as compatibility equivalent (though not canonical) to the horizontal ellipsis character.

===HTML===

In HTML, the horizontal ellipsis character may be represented by the entity reference codice_3 (since HTML 4.0), and the vertical ellipsis character by the entity reference codice_4 (since HTML 5.0). Alternatively, in HTML, XML, and SGML, a numeric character reference such as codice_5 or codice_6 can be used.

===TeX===

In the TeX typesetting system, the following types of ellipsis are available:
In LaTeX, the reverse orientation of codice_7 can be achieved with codice_8 provided by the codice_9 package: codice_10 yields .

With the codice_11 package from AMS-LaTeX, more specific ellipses are provided for math mode.
===Other===

The horizontal ellipsis character also appears in older character maps:

* in Windows-1250âWindows-1258 and in IBM/MS-DOS Code page 874, at code 85 (hexadecimal)
* in Mac-Roman, Mac-CentEuro and several other Macintosh encodings, at code C9 (hexadecimal)
* in Ventura International encoding at code C1 (hexadecimal)

Note that ISO/IEC 8859 encoding series provides no code point for ellipsis.

As with all characters, especially those outside the ASCII range, the author, sender and receiver of an encoded ellipsis must be in agreement upon what bytes are being used to represent the character. Naive text processing software may improperly assume that a particular encoding is being used, resulting in mojibake.

===Input===
In Windows using a suitable code page, can be inserted with , using the numeric keypad.

In macOS, it can be inserted with (on an English language keyboard).

In some Linux distributions, it can be inserted with (this produces an interpunct on other systems), or .

In Android, ellipsis is a long-press key. If Gboard is in alphanumeric layout, change to numeric and special characters layout by pressing from alphanumeric layout. Once in numeric and special characters layout, long press key to insert an ellipsis. This is a single symbol without spaces in between the three dots ( ).

In Chinese and sometimes in Japanese, ellipsis characters are made by entering two consecutive &quot;horizontal ellipses&quot;, each with Unicode code point U+2026. In vertical texts, the application should rotate the symbol accordingly.

* â a row of three dots (usually widely separated) alone in the middle of a gap between two paragraphs, to indicate a sub-chapter.
* An em dash is sometimes used instead of an ellipsis, especially in written dialogue.
* . In written text, this is sometimes denoted using the horizontal ellipsis.

<text>The Enola Gay () is a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, named after Enola Gay Tibbets, the mother of the pilot, Colonel Paul Tibbets. On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of World War II, it became the first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb in warfare. The bomb, code-named &quot;Little Boy&quot;, was targeted at the city of Hiroshima, Japan, and destroyed about three-quarters of the city. &quot;Enola Gay&quot; participated in the second nuclear attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of Kokura. Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in Nagasaki, a secondary target, being bombed instead.

After the war, the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; returned to the United States, where it was operated from Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. In May 1946, it was flown to Kwajalein for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in the Pacific, but was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll. Later that year, it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before its 1961 disassembly and storage at a Smithsonian facility in Suitland, Maryland.

In the 1980s, veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) on the National Mall, for the bombing&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The last survivor of its crew, Theodore Van Kirk, died on 28 July 2014 at the age of 93.

==World War II==

===Early history===
The &quot;Enola Gay&quot; (Model number B-29-45-MO, Serial number 44-86292, Victor number 82) was built by the Glenn L. Martin Company (later part of Lockheed Martin) at its bomber plant in Bellevue, Nebraska, located at Offutt Field, now Offutt Air Force Base. The bomber was one of the first fifteen B-29s built to the &quot;Silverplate&quot; specificationâ of 65 eventually completed during and after World War IIâgiving them the primary ability to function as nuclear &quot;weapon delivery&quot; aircraft. These modifications included an extensively modified bomb bay with pneumatic doors and British bomb attachment and release systems, reversible pitch propellers that gave more braking power on landing, improved engines with fuel injection and better cooling, and the removal of protective armor and gun turrets.

&quot;Enola Gay&quot; was personally selected by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets Jr., the commander of the 509th Composite Group, on 9 May 1945, while still on the assembly line. The aircraft was accepted by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) on 18 May 1945 and assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy, 509th Composite Group. Crew B-9, commanded by Captain Robert A. Lewis, took delivery of the bomber and flew it from Omaha to the 509th base at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, on 14 June 1945.

Thirteen days later, the aircraft left Wendover for Guam, where it received a bomb-bay modification, and flew to North Field, Tinian, on 6 July. It was initially given the Victor (squadron-assigned identification) number 12, but on 1 August, was given the circle R tail markings of the 6th Bombardment Group as a security measure and had its Victor number changed to 82 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft. During July, the bomber made eight practice or training flights and flew two missions, on 24 and 26 July, to drop pumpkin bombs on industrial targets at Kobe and Nagoya. &quot;Enola Gay&quot; was used on 31 July on a rehearsal flight for the actual mission.

The partially assembled Little Boy gun-type fission weapon L-11, weighing , was contained inside a wooden crate that was secured to the deck of the . Unlike the six uranium-235 target discs, which were later flown to Tinian on three separate aircraft arriving 28 and 29 July, the assembled projectile with the nine uranium-235 rings installed was shipped in a single lead-lined steel container weighing that was locked to brackets welded to the deck of Captain Charles B. McVay III&#x27;s quarters. Both the L-11 and projectile were dropped off at Tinian on 26 July 1945.

===Hiroshima mission===
On 5 August 1945, during preparation for the first atomic mission, Tibbets assumed command of the aircraft and named it after his mother, Enola Gay Tibbets, who, in turn, had been named for the heroine of a novel. When it came to selecting a name for the plane, Tibbets later recalled that: 

In the early morning hours, just prior to the 6 August mission, Tibbets had a young Army Air Forces maintenance man, Private Nelson Miller, paint the name just under the pilot&#x27;s window. Regularly assigned aircraft commander Robert A. Lewis was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of 6 August to see it painted with the now-famous nose art.

Hiroshima was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, in the Northern Mariana Islands, about six hours&#x27; flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, &quot;The Great Artiste&quot;, carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called &quot;Necessary Evil&quot;, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves Jr., wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned out the window to direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave for the cameras.
After leaving Tinian, the three aircraft made their way separately to Iwo Jima, where they rendezvoused at and set course for Japan. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at . Navy Captain William S. &quot;Deak&quot; Parsons of Project Alberta, who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during takeoff. His assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, removed the safety devices 30 minutes before reaching the target area.

The release at 08:15 (Hiroshima time) went as planned, and the Little Boy took 53 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at to the predetermined detonation height about above the city. &quot;Enola Gay&quot; traveled before it felt the shock waves from the blast. Although buffeted by the shock, neither &quot;Enola Gay&quot; nor &quot;The Great Artiste&quot; was damaged.

The detonation created a blast equivalent to . The U-235 weapon was considered very inefficient, with only 1.7% of its fissile material reacting. The radius of total destruction was about , with resulting fires across . Americans estimated that of the city were destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima&#x27;s buildings were destroyed and another 6â7% damaged. Some 70,000â80,000 people, 30% of the city&#x27;s population, were killed by the blast and resultant firestorm, and another 70,000 injured. Out of those killed, 20,000 were soldiers and 20,000 were Korean slave laborers.

&quot;Enola Gay&quot; returned safely to its base on Tinian to great fanfare, touching down at 2:58 pm, after 12 hours 13 minutes. &quot;The Great Artiste&quot; and &quot;Necessary Evil&quot; followed at short intervals. Several hundred people, including journalists and photographers, had gathered to watch the planes return. Tibbets was the first to disembark and was presented with the Distinguished Service Cross on the spot.

===Nagasaki mission===
The Hiroshima mission was followed by another atomic strike. Originally scheduled for 11 August, it was brought forward by two days to 9 August owing to a forecast of bad weather. This time, a nuclear bomb code-named &quot;Fat Man&quot; was carried by B-29 &quot;Bockscar&quot;, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney. &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, flown by Captain George Marquardt&#x27;s Crew B-10, was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for Kokura, the primary target. &quot;Enola Gay&quot; reported clear skies over Kokura, but by the time &quot;Bockscar&quot; arrived, the city was obscured by smoke from fires from the conventional bombing of Yahata by 224 B-29s the day before. After three unsuccessful passes, &quot;Bockscar&quot; diverted to its secondary target, Nagasaki, where it dropped its bomb. In contrast to the Hiroshima mission, the Nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched, although the mission did meet its objectives. The crew encountered a number of problems in execution and had very little fuel by the time they landed at the emergency backup landing site Yontan Airfield on Okinawa.

==Crews==
===Hiroshima mission===

&quot;Enola Gay&quot;â³s crew on 6 August 1945 consisted of 12 men. The crew was:

* Colonel Paul W. Tibbets Jr.Â â pilot and aircraft commander
* Captain Robert A. LewisÂ â co-pilot; &quot;Enola Gay&quot;&#x27;s regularly assigned aircraft commander*
* Major Thomas FerebeeÂ â bombardier
* Captain Theodore &quot;Dutch&quot; Van KirkÂ â navigator
* Captain William S. &quot;Deak&quot; Parsons, USNÂ â weaponeer and mission commander
* First Lieutenant Jacob BeserÂ â radar countermeasures (also the only man to fly on both of the nuclear bombing aircraft.)
* Second Lieutenant Morris R. JeppsonÂ â assistant weaponeer
* Staff Sergeant Robert &quot;Bob&quot; CaronÂ â tail gunner*

Asterisks denote regular crewmen of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;.

Of mission commander Parsons, it was said: &quot;There is no one more responsible for getting this bomb out of the laboratory and into some form useful for combat operations than Captain Parsons, by his plain genius in the ordnance business.&quot;

===Nagasaki mission===

* Sergeant Joseph M. DiJulioÂ â radar operator 
* Sergeant Melvin H. BiermanÂ â tail gunner 
* Sergeant Anthony D. Capua Jr.Â â assistant engineer/scanner

==Subsequent history==
On 6 November 1945, Lewis flew the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; back to the United States, arriving at the 509th&#x27;s new base at Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico, on 8 November. On 29 April 1946, &quot;Enola Gay&quot; left Roswell as part of the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific. It flew to Kwajalein Atoll on 1 May. It was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll and left Kwajalein on 1 July, the date of the test, reaching Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field, California, the next day.

The decision was made to preserve the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, and on 24 July 1946, the aircraft was flown to DavisâMonthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona, in preparation for storage. On 30 August 1946, the title to the aircraft was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution and the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; was removed from the USAAF inventory. From 1946 to 1961, the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; was put into temporary storage at a number of locations. It was at Davis-Monthan from 1 September 1946 until 3 July 1949, when it was flown to Orchard Place Air Field, Park Ridge, Illinois, by Tibbets for acceptance by the Smithsonian. It was moved to Pyote Air Force Base, Texas, on 12 January 1952, and then to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, on 2 December 1953, because the Smithsonian had no storage space for the aircraft.

It was hoped that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, it was left outdoors on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian Institution became concerned about the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;â³s condition, and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, on 21 July 1961.

The &quot;Enola Gay&quot; remained at Suitland for many years. By the early 1980s, two veterans of the 509th, Don Rehl and his former navigator in the 509th, Frank B. Stewart, began lobbying for the aircraft to be restored and put on display. They enlisted Tibbets and Senator Barry Goldwater in their campaign. In 1983, Walter J. Boyne, a former B-52 pilot with the Strategic Air Command, became director of the National Air and Space Museum, and he made the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;â³s restoration a priority. Looking at the aircraft, Tibbets recalled, was a &quot;sad meeting. [My] fond memories, and I don&#x27;t mean the dropping of the bomb, were the numerous occasions I flew the airplaneÂ ... I pushed it very, very hard and it never failed meÂ ... It was probably the most beautiful piece of machinery that any pilot ever flew.&quot;

==Restoration==
Restoration of the bomber began on 5 December 1984, at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland-Silver Hill, Maryland. The propellers that were used on the bombing mission were later shipped to Texas A&amp;M University. One of these propellers was trimmed to for use in the university&#x27;s Oran W. Nicks Low Speed Wind Tunnel. The lightweight aluminum variable-pitch propeller is powered by a 1,250 kVA electric motor, providing a wind speed up to . Two engines were rebuilt at Garber and two at San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum. Some parts and instruments had been removed and could not be located. Replacements were found or fabricated, and marked so that future curators could distinguish them from the original components.

===Exhibition controversy===

The &quot;Enola Gay&quot; became the center of a controversy at the Smithsonian Institution when the museum planned to put its fuselage on public display in 1995 as part of an exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The exhibit, &quot;The Crossroads: The End of World War II, the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War,&quot; was drafted by the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum staff, and arranged around the restored &quot;Enola Gay&quot;.

Critics of the planned exhibit, especially those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, rather than on the motives for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb&#x27;s role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. After attempts to revise the exhibit to meet the satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy. He later reflected that

The forward fuselage went on display on 28 June 1995. On 2 July 1995, three people were arrested for throwing ash and human blood on the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage, following an earlier incident in which a protester had thrown red paint over the gallery&#x27;s carpeting. The exhibition closed on 18 May 1998 and the fuselage was returned to the Garber Facility for final restoration.

===Complete restoration and display===

Its restoration work began in 1984, and eventually required 300,000 staff hours. While the fuselage was on display, from 1995 to 1998, work continued on the remaining unrestored components. The aircraft was shipped in pieces to the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia from MarchâJune 2003, with the fuselage and wings reunited for the first time since 1960 on 10 April 2003 and assembly completed on 8 August 2003. The aircraft has been on display at the Udvar-Hazy Center since the museum annex opened on 15 December 2003. As a result of the earlier controversy, the signage around the aircraft provided only the same succinct technical data as is provided for other aircraft in the museum, without discussion of the controversial issues. It read:


The display of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; without reference to the historical context of World War II, the Cold War, or the development and deployment of nuclear weapons aroused controversy. A petition from a group calling themselves the Committee for a National Discussion of Nuclear History and Current Policy bemoaned the display of &quot;Enola Gay&quot; as a technological achievement, which it described as an &quot;extraordinary callousness toward the victims, indifference to the deep divisions among American citizens about the propriety of these actions, and disregard for the feelings of most of the world&#x27;s peoples&quot;. It attracted signatures from notable figures including historian Gar Alperovitz, social critic Noam Chomsky, whistle blower Daniel Ellsberg, physicist Joseph Rotblat, writer Kurt Vonnegut, producer Norman Lear, actor Martin Sheen and filmmaker Oliver Stone.

<text>In physics, an electronvolt (symbol eV), also written electron-volt and electron volt, is the measure of an amount of kinetic energy gained by a single electron accelerating through an electric potential difference of one volt in vacuum. When used as a unit of energy, the numerical value of 1 eV in joules (symbol J) is equal to the numerical value of the charge of an electron in coulombs (symbol C). Under the 2019 revision of the SI, this sets 1Â eV equal to the exact value 

Historically, the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences, because a particle with electric charge &quot;q&quot; gains an energy after passing through a voltage of &quot;V&quot;.

== Definition and use ==
An electronvolt is the amount of energy gained or lost by a single electron when it moves through an electric potential difference of one volt. Hence, it has a value of one volt, which is , multiplied by the elementary charge Therefore, one electronvolt is equal to 

The electronvolt (eV) is a unit of energy, but is not an SI unit. It is a commonly used unit of energy within physics, widely used in solid state, atomic, nuclear and particle physics, and high-energy astrophysics. It is commonly used with SI prefixes &quot;milli-&quot; (10â3), &quot;kilo-&quot; (103), &quot;mega-&quot; (106), &quot;giga-&quot; (109), &quot;tera-&quot; (1012), &quot;peta-&quot; (1015) or &quot;exa-&quot; (1018), the respective symbols being meV, keV, MeV, GeV, TeV, PeV and EeV. The SI unit of energy is the joule (J).

In some older documents, and in the name &quot;Bevatron&quot;, the symbol &quot;BeV&quot; is used, where the &quot;B&quot; stands for &quot;billion&quot;. The symbol &quot;BeV&quot; is therefore equivalent to &quot;GeV&quot;, though neither is an SI unit.

== Relation to other physical properties and units ==
In the fields of physics in which the electronvolt is used, other quantities are typically measured using units derived from the electronvolt as a product with fundamental constants of importance in the theory are often used.

=== Mass ===
By massâenergy equivalence, the electronvolt corresponds to a unit of mass. It is common in particle physics, where units of mass and energy are often interchanged, to express mass in units of eV/&quot;c&quot;2, where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum (from ). It is common to informally express mass in terms of eV as a unit of mass, effectively using a system of natural units with &quot;c&quot; set to 1. The kilogram equivalent of is:

formula_1

For example, an electron and a positron, each with a mass of , can annihilate to yield of energy. A proton has a mass of . In general, the masses of all hadrons are of the order of , which makes the GeV/&quot;c&quot;2 a convenient unit of mass for particle physics:
The atomic mass constant (&quot;m&quot;u), one twelfth of the mass a carbon-12 atom, is close to the mass of a proton. To convert to electronvolt mass-equivalent, use the formula:
=== Momentum ===
By dividing a particle&#x27;s kinetic energy in electronvolts by the fundamental constant &quot;c&quot; (the speed of light), one can describe the particle&#x27;s momentum in units of eV/&quot;c&quot;. In natural units in which the fundamental velocity constant &quot;c&quot; is numerically 1, the &quot;c&quot; may informally be omitted to express momentum using the unit electronvolt.

The energyâmomentum relation
formula_2
in natural units (with formula_3)
formula_4
is a Pythagorean equation. When a relatively high energy is applied to a particle with relatively low rest mass, it can be approximated as formula_5 in high-energy physics such that an applied energy with expressed in the unit eV conveniently results in a numerically approximately equivalent change of momentum when expressed with the unitÂ eV/&quot;c&quot;.

The dimension of momentum is . The dimension of energy is . Dividing a unit of energy (such as eV) by a fundamental constant (such as the speed of light) that has the dimension of velocity () facilitates the required conversion for using a unit of energy to quantify momentum.

For example, if the momentum &quot;p&quot; of an electron is , then the conversion to MKS system of units can be achieved by:
formula_6

=== Distance ===
In particle physics, a system of natural units in which the speed of light in vacuum &quot;c&quot; and the reduced Planck constant &quot;Ä§&quot; are dimensionless and equal to unity is widely used: . In these units, both distances and times are expressed in inverse energy units (while energy and mass are expressed in the same units, see massâenergy equivalence). In particular, particle scattering lengths are often presented using a unit of inverse particle mass.

Outside this system of units, the conversion factors between electronvolt, second, and nanometer are the following:
formula_7

The above relations also allow expressing the mean lifetime &quot;Ï&quot; of an unstable particle (in seconds) in terms of its decay width Î (in eV) via . For example, the meson has a lifetime of 1.530(9)Â picoseconds, mean decay length is , or a decay width of .

Conversely, the tiny meson mass differences responsible for meson oscillations are often expressed in the more convenient inverse picoseconds.

Energy in electronvolts is sometimes expressed through the wavelength of light with photons of the same energy:
formula_8

=== Temperature ===
In certain fields, such as plasma physics, it is convenient to use the electronvolt to express temperature. The electronvolt is divided by the Boltzmann constant to convert to the Kelvin scale:
formula_9
where &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant.

The &quot;k&quot;B is assumed when using the electronvolt to express temperature, for example, a typical magnetic confinement fusion plasma is (kiloelectronvolt), which is equal to 174Â MK (megakelvin).

As an approximation: &quot;k&quot;B&quot;T&quot; is about (â ) at a temperature of .

=== Wavelength ===
The energy &quot;E&quot;, frequency &quot;Î½&quot;, and wavelength &quot;Î»&quot; of a photon are related by
formula_10
where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light. This reduces to
formula_11
A photon with a wavelength of (green light) would have an energy of approximately . Similarly, would correspond to an infrared photon of wavelength or frequency .

== Scattering experiments ==
In a low-energy nuclear scattering experiment, it is conventional to refer to the nuclear recoil energy in units of eVr, keVr, etc. This distinguishes the nuclear recoil energy from the &quot;electron equivalent&quot; recoil energy (eVee, keVee, etc.) measured by scintillation light. For example, the yield of a phototube is measured in phe/keVee (photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent energy). The relationship between eV, eVr, and eVee depends on the medium the scattering takes place in, and must be established empirically for each material.

== Energy comparisons ==


=== Molar energy ===
One mole of particles given 1Â eV of energy each has approximately 96.5Â kJ of energy â this corresponds to the Faraday constant (&quot;F&quot; â ), where the energy in joules of &quot;n&quot; moles of particles each with energy &quot;E&quot;Â eV is equal to &quot;E&quot;Â·&quot;F&quot;Â·&quot;n&quot;.

<text>Electrochemistry is the branch of physical chemistry concerned with the relationship between electrical potential difference and identifiable chemical change. These reactions involve electrons moving via an electronically conducting phase (typically an external electrical circuit, but not necessarily, as in electroless plating) between electrodes separated by an ionically conducting and electronically insulating electrolyte (or ionic species in a solution).

When a chemical reaction is driven by an electrical potential difference, as in electrolysis, or if a potential difference results from a chemical reaction as in an electric battery or fuel cell, it is called an &quot;electrochemical&quot; reaction. Unlike in other chemical reactions, in electrochemical reactions electrons are not transferred directly between atoms, ions, or molecules, but via the aforementioned electronically conducting circuit. This phenomenon is what distinguishes an electrochemical reaction from a conventional chemical reaction.

==History==

=== 16thâ18th century ===
Understanding of electrical matters began in the sixteenth century. During this century, the English scientist William Gilbert spent 17 years experimenting with magnetism and, to a lesser extent, electricity. For his work on magnets, Gilbert became known as the &quot;Father of Magnetism.&quot; He discovered various methods for producing and strengthening magnets.

In 1663, the German physicist Otto von Guericke created the first electric generator, which produced static electricity by applying friction in the machine. The generator was made of a large sulfur ball cast inside a glass globe, mounted on a shaft. The ball was rotated by means of a crank and an electric spark was produced when a pad was rubbed against the ball as it rotated. The globe could be removed and used as source for experiments with electricity.

By the mid-18th century the French chemist Charles FranÃ§ois de Cisternay du Fay had discovered two types of static electricity, and that like charges repel each other whilst unlike charges attract. Du Fay announced that electricity consisted of two fluids: &quot;vitreous&quot; (from the Latin for &quot;glass&quot;), or positive, electricity; and &quot;resinous,&quot; or negative, electricity. This was the &quot;two-fluid theory&quot; of electricity, which was to be opposed by Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;one-fluid theory&quot; later in the century.

In 1785, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb developed the law of electrostatic attraction as an outgrowth of his attempt to investigate the law of electrical repulsions as stated by Joseph Priestley in England.

In the late 18th century the Italian physician and anatomist Luigi Galvani marked the birth of electrochemistry by establishing a bridge between chemical reactions and electricity on his essay &quot;De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius&quot; (Latin for Commentary on the Effect of Electricity on Muscular Motion) in 1791 where he proposed a &quot;nerveo-electrical substance&quot; on biological life forms.

In his essay Galvani concluded that animal tissue contained a here-to-fore neglected innate, vital force, which he termed &quot;animal electricity,&quot; which activated nerves and muscles spanned by metal probes. He believed that this new force was a form of electricity in addition to the &quot;natural&quot; form produced by lightning or by the electric eel and torpedo ray as well as the &quot;artificial&quot; form produced by friction (i.e., static electricity).

Galvani&#x27;s scientific colleagues generally accepted his views, but Alessandro Volta rejected the idea of an &quot;animal electric fluid,&quot; replying that the frog&#x27;s legs responded to differences in metal temper, composition, and bulk. Galvani refuted this by obtaining muscular action with two pieces of the same material. Nevertheless, Volta&#x27;s experimentation led him to develop the first practical battery, which took advantage of the relatively high energy (weak bonding) of zinc and could deliver an electrical current for much longer than any other device known at the time.

===19th century===

In 1800, William Nicholson and Johann Wilhelm Ritter succeeded in decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis using Volta&#x27;s battery. Soon thereafter Ritter discovered the process of electroplating. He also observed that the amount of metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic process depended on the distance between the electrodes. By 1801, Ritter observed thermoelectric currents and anticipated the discovery of thermoelectricity by Thomas Johann Seebeck.

By the 1810s, William Hyde Wollaston made improvements to the galvanic cell.
Sir Humphry Davy&#x27;s work with electrolysis led to the conclusion that the production of electricity in simple electrolytic cells resulted from chemical action and that chemical combination occurred between substances of opposite charge. This work led directly to the isolation of metallic sodium and potassium by electrolysis of their molten salts, and of the alkaline earth metals from theirs, in 1808.

Hans Christian Ãrsted&#x27;s discovery of the magnetic effect of electric currents in 1820 was immediately recognized as an epoch-making advance, although he left further work on electromagnetism to others. AndrÃ©-Marie AmpÃ¨re quickly repeated Ãrsted&#x27;s experiment, and formulated them mathematically.

In 1821, Estonian-German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck demonstrated the electrical potential between the juncture points of two dissimilar metals when there is a temperature difference between the joints.

In 1827, the German scientist Georg Ohm expressed his law in this famous book &quot;Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet&quot; (The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically) in which he gave his complete theory of electricity.

In 1832, Michael Faraday&#x27;s experiments led him to state his two laws of electrochemistry. In 1836, John Daniell invented a primary cell which solved the problem of polarization by introducing copper ions into the solution near the positive electrode and thus eliminating hydrogen gas generation. Later results revealed that at the other electrode, amalgamated zinc (i.e., zinc alloyed with mercury) would produce a higher voltage.

William Grove produced the first fuel cell in 1839. In 1846, Wilhelm Weber developed the electrodynamometer. In 1868, Georges LeclanchÃ© patented a new cell which eventually became the forerunner to the world&#x27;s first widely used battery, the zincâcarbon cell.

Svante Arrhenius published his thesis in 1884 on &quot;Recherches sur la conductibilitÃ© galvanique des Ã©lectrolytes&quot; (Investigations on the galvanic conductivity of electrolytes). From his results the author concluded that electrolytes, when dissolved in water, become to varying degrees split or dissociated into electrically opposite positive and negative ions.

In 1886, Paul HÃ©roult and Charles M. Hall developed an efficient method (the HallâHÃ©roult process) to obtain aluminium using electrolysis of molten alumina.

In 1894, Friedrich Ostwald concluded important studies of the conductivity and electrolytic dissociation of organic acids.

Walther Hermann Nernst developed the theory of the electromotive force of the voltaic cell in 1888. In 1889, he showed how the characteristics of the voltage produced could be used to calculate the free energy change in the chemical reaction producing the voltage. He constructed an equation, known as Nernst equation, which related the voltage of a cell to its properties.

In 1898, Fritz Haber showed that definite reduction products can result from electrolytic processes if the potential at the cathode is kept constant. In 1898, he explained the reduction of nitrobenzene in stages at the cathode and this became the model for other similar reduction processes.

===20th century===
In 1902, The Electrochemical Society (ECS) was founded.

In 1909, Robert Andrews Millikan began a series of experiments (see oil drop experiment) to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron.
In 1911, Harvey Fletcher, working with Millikan, was successful in measuring the charge on the electron, by replacing the water droplets used by Millikan, which quickly evaporated, with oil droplets. Within one day Fletcher measured the charge of an electron within several decimal places.

In 1923, Johannes Nicolaus BrÃ¸nsted and Martin Lowry published essentially the same theory about how acids and bases behave, using an electrochemical basis.

In 1937, Arne Tiselius developed the first sophisticated electrophoretic apparatus. Some years later, he was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize for his work in protein electrophoresis.

A year later, in 1949, the International Society of Electrochemistry (ISE) was founded.

By the 1960sâ1970s quantum electrochemistry was developed by Revaz Dogonadze and his students.

==Principles==

===Oxidation and reduction===
The term &quot;redox&quot; stands for reduction-oxidation. It refers to electrochemical processes involving electron transfer to or from a molecule or ion, changing its oxidation state. This reaction can occur through the application of an external voltage or through the release of chemical energy. Oxidation and reduction describe the change of oxidation state that takes place in the atoms, ions or molecules involved in an electrochemical reaction. Formally, oxidation state is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were 100% ionic. An atom or ion that gives up an electron to another atom or ion has its oxidation state increase, and the recipient of the negatively charged electron has its oxidation state decrease.

For example, when atomic sodium reacts with atomic chlorine, sodium donates one electron and attains an oxidation state of +1. Chlorine accepts the electron and its oxidation state is reduced to â1. The sign of the oxidation state (positive/negative) actually corresponds to the value of each ion&#x27;s electronic charge. The attraction of the differently charged sodium and chlorine ions is the reason they then form an ionic bond.

The loss of electrons from an atom or molecule is called oxidation, and the gain of electrons is reduction. This can be easily remembered through the use of mnemonic devices. Two of the most popular are &quot;OIL RIG&quot; (Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain) and &quot;LEO&quot; the lion says &quot;GER&quot; (Lose Electrons: Oxidation, Gain Electrons: Reduction). Oxidation and reduction always occur in a paired fashion such that one species is oxidized when another is reduced. For cases where electrons are shared (covalent bonds) between atoms with large differences in electronegativity, the electron is assigned to the atom with the largest electronegativity in determining the oxidation state.

The atom or molecule which loses electrons is known as the &quot;reducing agent&quot;, or &quot;reductant&quot;, and the substance which accepts the electrons is called the &quot;oxidizing agent&quot;, or &quot;oxidant&quot;. Thus, the oxidizing agent is always being reduced in a reaction; the reducing agent is always being oxidized. Oxygen is a common oxidizing agent, but not the only one. Despite the name, an oxidation reaction does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. In fact, a fire can be fed by an oxidant other than oxygen; fluorine fires are often unquenchable, as fluorine is an even stronger oxidant (it has a weaker bond and higher electronegativity, and thus accepts electrons even better) than oxygen.

For reactions involving oxygen, the gain of oxygen implies the oxidation of the atom or molecule to which the oxygen is added (and the oxygen is reduced). In organic compounds, such as butane or ethanol, the loss of hydrogen implies oxidation of the molecule from which it is lost (and the hydrogen is reduced). This follows because the hydrogen donates its electron in covalent bonds with non-metals but it takes the electron along when it is lost. Conversely, loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen implies reduction.

===Balancing redox reactions===

Electrochemical reactions in water are better analyzed by using the ion-electron method, where H+, OHâ ion, H2O and electrons (to compensate the oxidation changes) are added to the cell&#x27;s half-reactions for oxidation and reduction.

====Acidic medium====
In acidic medium, H+ ions and water are added to balance each half-reaction.
For example, when manganese reacts with sodium bismuthate.
:&quot;Unbalanced reaction&quot;: Mn2+ + NaBiO3 â Bi3+ + 
:&quot;Oxidation&quot;: 4 H2O + Mn2+ â + 8 H+ + 5 eâ
:&quot;Reduction&quot;: 2 eâ + 6 H+ + â Bi3+ + 3 H2O

Finally, the reaction is balanced by multiplying the stoichiometric coefficients so the numbers of electrons in both half reactions match
:8 H2O + 2 Mn2+ â 2 + 16 H+ + 10 eâ
:10 eâ + 30 H+ + 5 â 5 Bi3+ + 15 H2O
and adding the resulting half reactions to give the balanced reaction:
:14 H+ + 2 Mn2+ + 5 NaBiO3 â 7 H2O + 2 + 5 Bi3+ + 5 Na+

====Basic medium====
In basic medium, OHâ ions and water are added to balance each half-reaction. For example, in a reaction between potassium permanganate and sodium sulfite:
:&quot;Unbalanced reaction&quot;: KMnO4 + Na2SO3 + H2O â MnO2 + Na2SO4 + KOH
:&quot;Reduction&quot;: 3 eâ + 2 H2O + â MnO2 + 4 OHâ
:&quot;Oxidation&quot;: 2 OHâ + â + H2O + 2 eâ

Here, &#x27;spectator ions&#x27; (K+, Na+) were omitted from the half-reactions. By multiplying the stoichiometric coefficients so the numbers of electrons in both half reaction match:
:6 eâ + 4 H2O + 2 â 2 MnO2 + 8 OHâ
:6 OHâ + 3 â 3 + 3 H2O + 6 eâ
the balanced overall reaction is obtained:
:2 KMnO4 + 3 Na2SO3 + H2O â 2 MnO2 + 3 Na2SO4 + 2 KOH

====Neutral medium====
The same procedure as used in acidic medium can be applied, for example, to balance the complete combustion of propane:
:&quot;Unbalanced reaction&quot;: C3H8 + O2 â CO2 + H2O
:&quot;Reduction&quot;: 4 H+ + O2 + 4 eâ â 2 H2O
:&quot;Oxidation&quot;: 6 H2O + C3H8 â 3 CO2 + 20 eâ + 20 H+

By multiplying the stoichiometric coefficients so the numbers of electrons in both half reaction match:
:20 H+ + 5 O2 + 20 eâ â 10 H2O
:6 H2O + C3H8 â 3 CO2 + 20 eâ + 20 H+
the balanced equation is obtained:
:C3H8 + 5 O2 â 3 CO2 + 4 H2O

==Electrochemical cells==
An electrochemical cell is a device that produces an electric current from energy released by a spontaneous redox reaction. This kind of cell includes the Galvanic cell or Voltaic cell, named after Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta, both scientists who conducted experiments on chemical reactions and electric current during the late 18th century.

Electrochemical cells have two conductive electrodes (the anode and the cathode). The anode is defined as the electrode where oxidation occurs and the cathode is the electrode where the reduction takes place. Electrodes can be made from any sufficiently conductive materials, such as metals, semiconductors, graphite, and even conductive polymers. In between these electrodes is the electrolyte, which contains ions that can freely move.

The galvanic cell uses two different metal electrodes, each in an electrolyte where the positively charged ions are the oxidized form of the electrode metal. One electrode will undergo oxidation (the anode) and the other will undergo reduction (the cathode). The metal of the anode will oxidize, going from an oxidation state of 0 (in the solid form) to a positive oxidation state and become an ion. At the cathode, the metal ion in solution will accept one or more electrons from the cathode and the ion&#x27;s oxidation state is reduced to 0. This forms a solid metal that electrodeposits on the cathode. The two electrodes must be electrically connected to each other, allowing for a flow of electrons that leave the metal of the anode and flow through this connection to the ions at the surface of the cathode. This flow of electrons is an electric current that can be used to do work, such as turn a motor or power a light.

A galvanic cell whose electrodes are zinc and copper submerged in zinc sulfate and copper sulfate, respectively, is known as a Daniell cell.

The half reactions in a Daniell cell are as follows:
:Zinc electrode (anode): Zn â Zn2+ + 2 eâ
:Copper electrode (cathode): Cu2+ + 2 eâ â Cu

In this example, the anode is the zinc metal which is oxidized (loses electrons) to form zinc ions in solution, and copper ions accept electrons from the copper metal electrode and the ions deposit at the copper cathode as an electrodeposit. This cell forms a simple battery as it will spontaneously generate a flow of electric current from the anode to the cathode through the external connection. This reaction can be driven in reverse by applying a voltage, resulting in the deposition of zinc metal at the anode and formation of copper ions at the cathode.

To provide a complete electric circuit, there must also be an ionic conduction path between the anode and cathode electrolytes in addition to the electron conduction path. The simplest ionic conduction path is to provide a liquid junction. To avoid mixing between the two electrolytes, the liquid junction can be provided through a porous plug that allows ion flow while minimizing electrolyte mixing. To further minimize mixing of the electrolytes, a salt bridge can be used which consists of an electrolyte saturated gel in an inverted U-tube. As the negatively charged electrons flow in one direction around this circuit, the positively charged metal ions flow in the opposite direction in the electrolyte.

A voltmeter is capable of measuring the change of electrical potential between the anode and the cathode.

The electrochemical cell voltage is also referred to as electromotive force or emf.

A cell diagram can be used to trace the path of the electrons in the electrochemical cell. For example, here is a cell diagram of a Daniell cell:
:Zn | Zn2+ (1 M) || Cu2+ (1 M) | Cu

First, the reduced form of the metal to be oxidized at the anode (Zn) is written. This is separated from its oxidized form by a vertical line, which represents the limit between the phases (oxidation changes). The double vertical lines represent the saline bridge on the cell. Finally, the oxidized form of the metal to be reduced at the cathode, is written, separated from its reduced form by the vertical line. The electrolyte concentration is given as it is an important variable in determining the exact cell potential.

==Standard electrode potential==
To allow prediction of the cell potential, tabulations of standard electrode potential are available. Such tabulations are referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The standard hydrogen electrode undergoes the reaction
:2 H+ + 2 eâ â H2

which is shown as a reduction but, in fact, the SHE can act as either the anode or the cathode, depending on the relative oxidation/reduction potential of the other electrode/electrolyte combination. The term standard in SHE requires a supply of hydrogen gas bubbled through the electrolyte at a pressure of 1 atm and an acidic electrolyte with H+ activity equal to 1 (usually assumed to be [H+] = 1Â mol/liter, i.e. pH = 0).

The SHE electrode can be connected to any other electrode by a salt bridge and an external circuit to form a cell. If the second electrode is also at standard conditions, then the measured cell potential is called the standard electrode potential for the electrode. The standard electrode potential for the SHE is zero, by definition. The polarity of the standard electrode potential provides information about the relative reduction potential of the electrode compared to the SHE. If the electrode has a positive potential with respect to the SHE, then that means it is a strongly reducing electrode which forces the SHE to be the anode (an example is Cu in aqueous CuSO4 with a standard electrode potential of 0.337 V). Conversely, if the measured potential is negative, the electrode is more oxidizing than the SHE (such as Zn in ZnSO4 where the standard electrode potential is â0.76 V).

Standard electrode potentials are usually tabulated as reduction potentials. However, the reactions are reversible and the role of a particular electrode in a cell depends on the relative oxidation/reduction potential of both electrodes. The oxidation potential for a particular electrode is just the negative of the reduction potential. A standard cell potential can be determined by looking up the standard electrode potentials for both electrodes (sometimes called half cell potentials). The one that is smaller will be the anode and will undergo oxidation. The cell potential is then calculated as the sum of the reduction potential for the cathode and the oxidation potential for the anode.

:&quot;E&quot;Â°cell = &quot;E&quot;Â°red (cathode) â &quot;E&quot;Â°red (anode) = &quot;E&quot;Â°red (cathode) + &quot;E&quot;Â°oxi (anode)

For example, the standard electrode potential for a copper electrode is:

&quot;Cell diagram&quot;
:Pt | H2 (1 atm) | H+ (1 M) || Cu2+ (1 M) | Cu
:&quot;E&quot;Â°cell = &quot;E&quot;Â°red (cathode) â &quot;E&quot;Â°red (anode)

At standard temperature, pressure and concentration conditions, the cell&#x27;s emf (measured by a multimeter) is 0.34 V. By definition, the electrode potential for the SHE is zero. Thus, the Cu is the cathode and the SHE is the anode giving
:&quot;E&quot;cell = &quot;E&quot;Â°(Cu2+/Cu) â &quot;E&quot;Â°(H+/H2)
Or,
:&quot;E&quot;Â°(Cu2+/Cu) = 0.34 V

Changes in the stoichiometric coefficients of a balanced cell equation will not change the &quot;E&quot;Â°red value because the standard electrode potential is an intensive property.

==Spontaneity of redox reaction==
During operation of an electrochemical cell, chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. This can be expressed mathematically as the product of the cell&#x27;s emf &quot;E&quot;cell measured in volts (V) and the electric charge &quot;Q&quot;ele,trans transferred through the external circuit.
:Electrical energy = &quot;E&quot;cell&quot;Q&quot;ele,trans

&quot;Q&quot;ele,trans is the cell current integrated over time and measured in coulombs (C); it can also be determined by multiplying the total number &quot;n&quot;e of electrons transferred (measured in moles) times Faraday&#x27;s constant (&quot;F&quot;).

The emf of the cell at zero current is the maximum possible emf. It can be used to calculate the maximum possible electrical energy that could be obtained from a chemical reaction. This energy is referred to as electrical work and is expressed by the following equation:
:formula_1,

where work is defined as positive when it increases the energy of the system.

Since the free energy is the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a system, one can write:
:formula_2

A positive cell potential gives a negative change in Gibbs free energy. This is consistent with the cell production of an electric current from the cathode to the anode through the external circuit. If the current is driven in the opposite direction by imposing an external potential, then work is done on the cell to drive electrolysis.

A spontaneous electrochemical reaction (change in Gibbs free energy less than zero) can be used to generate an electric current in electrochemical cells. This is the basis of all batteries and fuel cells. For example, gaseous oxygen (O2) and
hydrogen (H2) can be combined in a fuel cell to form water and energy, typically a combination of heat and electrical energy.

Conversely, non-spontaneous electrochemical reactions can be driven forward by the application of a current at sufficient voltage. The electrolysis of water into gaseous oxygen and hydrogen is a typical example.

The relation between the equilibrium constant, &quot;K&quot;, and the Gibbs free energy for an electrochemical cell is expressed as follows:
:formula_3.

Rearranging to express the relation between standard potential and equilibrium constant yields
:formula_4.

At &quot;T&quot; = 298 K, the previous equation can be rewritten using the Briggsian logarithm as follows:
:formula_5

==Cell EMF dependency on changes in concentration==

===Nernst equation===
The standard potential of an electrochemical cell requires standard conditions (Î&quot;G&quot;Â°) for all of the reactants. When reactant concentrations differ from standard conditions, the cell potential will deviate from the standard potential. In the 20th century German chemist Walther Nernst proposed a mathematical model to determine the effect of reactant concentration on electrochemical cell potential.

In the late 19th century, Josiah Willard Gibbs had formulated a theory to predict whether a chemical reaction is spontaneous based on the free energy
:formula_6

Here Î&quot;G&quot; is change in Gibbs free energy, Î&quot;G&quot;Â° is the cell potential when &quot;Q&quot; is equal to 1, &quot;T&quot; is absolute temperature (Kelvin), &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant and &quot;Q&quot; is the reaction quotient, which can be calculated by dividing concentrations of products by those of reactants, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient, using only those products and reactants that are aqueous or gaseous.

Gibbs&#x27; key contribution was to formalize the understanding of the effect of reactant concentration on spontaneity.

Based on Gibbs&#x27; work, Nernst extended the theory to include the contribution from electric potential on charged species. As shown in the previous section, the change in Gibbs free energy for an electrochemical cell can be related to the cell potential. Thus, Gibbs&#x27; theory becomes
:formula_7

Here &quot;ne&quot; is the number of electrons (in moles), &quot;F&quot; is the Faraday constant (in coulombs/mole), and Î&quot;E&quot; is the cell potential (in volts).

Finally, Nernst divided through by the amount of charge transferred to arrive at a new equation which now bears his name:
:formula_8

Assuming standard conditions (&quot;T&quot; = 298 K or 25Â Â°C) and &quot;R&quot; = 8.3145 J/(KÂ·mol), the equation above can be expressed on base-10 logarithm as shown below:
:formula_9
Note that &quot;&quot; is also known as the thermal voltage &quot;V&quot;T and is found in the study of plasmas and semiconductors as well. The value 0.05916Â V in the above equation is just the thermal voltage at standard temperature multiplied by the natural logarithm of 10.

===Concentration cells===

A concentration cell is an electrochemical cell where the two electrodes are the same material, the electrolytes on the two half-cells involve the same ions, but the electrolyte concentration differs between the two half-cells.

An example is an electrochemical cell, where two copper electrodes are submerged in two copper(II) sulfate solutions, whose concentrations are 0.05 M and 2.0 M, connected through a salt bridge. This type of cell will generate a potential that can be predicted by the Nernst equation. Both can undergo the same chemistry (although the reaction proceeds in reverse at the anode)
:Cu2+ + 2 eâ â Cu

Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle indicates that the reaction is more favorable to reduction as the concentration of Cu2+ ions increases. Reduction will take place in the cell&#x27;s compartment where the concentration is higher and oxidation will occur on the more dilute side.

The following cell diagram describes the concentration cell mentioned above:
:Cu | Cu2+ (0.05 M) || Cu2+ (2.0 M) | Cu

where the half cell reactions for oxidation and reduction are:
:Oxidation: Cu â Cu2+ (0.05 M) + 2 eâ
:Reduction: Cu2+ (2.0 M) + 2 eâ â Cu
:Overall reaction: Cu2+ (2.0 M) â Cu2+ (0.05 M)

The cell&#x27;s emf is calculated through the Nernst equation as follows:
:formula_10

The value of &quot;E&quot;Â° in this kind of cell is zero, as electrodes and ions are the same in both half-cells.

After replacing values from the case mentioned, it is possible to calculate cell&#x27;s potential:
:formula_11

or by:
:formula_12

However, this value is only approximate, as reaction quotient is defined in terms of ion activities which can be approximated with the concentrations as calculated here.

The Nernst equation plays an important role in understanding electrical effects in cells and organelles. Such effects include nerve synapses and cardiac beat as well as the resting potential of a somatic cell.

==Battery==
Many types of battery have been commercialized and represent an important practical application of electrochemistry. Early wet cells powered the first telegraph and telephone systems, and were the source of current for electroplating. The zinc-manganese dioxide dry cell was the first portable, non-spillable battery type that made flashlights and other portable devices practical. The mercury battery using zinc and mercuric oxide provided higher levels of power and capacity than the original dry cell for early electronic devices, but has been phased out of common use due to the danger of mercury pollution from discarded cells.

The leadâacid battery was the first practical secondary (rechargeable) battery that could have its capacity replenished from an external source. The electrochemical reaction that produced current was (to a useful degree) reversible, allowing electrical energy and chemical energy to be interchanged as needed. Common lead acid batteries contain a mixture of sulfuric acid and water, as well as lead plates. The most common mixture used today is 30% acid. One problem, however, is if left uncharged acid will crystallize within the lead plates of the battery rendering it useless. These batteries last an average of 3 years with daily use but it is not unheard of for a lead acid battery to still be functional after 7â10 years. Lead-acid cells continue to be widely used in automobiles.

All the preceding types have water-based electrolytes, which limits the maximum voltage per cell. The freezing of water limits low temperature performance. The lithium metal battery, which does not (and cannot) use water in the electrolyte, provides improved performance over other types; a rechargeable lithium-ion battery is an essential part of many mobile devices.

The flow battery, an experimental type, offers the option of vastly larger energy capacity because its reactants can be replenished from external reservoirs. The fuel cell can turn the chemical energy bound in hydrocarbon gases or hydrogen and oxygen directly into electrical energy with a much higher efficiency than any combustion process; such devices have powered many spacecraft and are being applied to grid energy storage for the public power system.

==Corrosion==
Corrosion is an electrochemical process, which reveals itself as rust or tarnish on metals like iron or copper and their respective alloys, steel and brass.

===Iron corrosion===
For iron rust to occur the metal has to be in contact with oxygen and water. The chemical reactions for this process are relatively complex and not all of them are completely understood. It is believed the causes are the following:
Electron transfer (reduction-oxidation)
:One area on the surface of the metal acts as the anode, which is where the oxidation (corrosion) occurs. At the anode, the metal gives up electrons.
::Fe â Fe2+ + 2 eâ
:Electrons are transferred from iron, reducing oxygen in the atmosphere into water on the cathode, which is placed in another region of the metal.
::O2 + 4 H+ + 4 eâ â 2 H2O
:Global reaction for the process:
::2 Fe + O2 + 4 H+ â 2 Fe2+ + 2 H2O
:Standard emf for iron rusting:
::&quot;E&quot;Â° = &quot;E&quot;Â° (cathode) â &quot;E&quot;Â° (anode)
::&quot;E&quot;Â° = 1.23V â (â0.44 V) = 1.67 V

Iron corrosion takes place in an acid medium; H+ ions come from reaction between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and water, forming carbonic acid. Fe2+ ions oxidize further, following this equation:
: 4 Fe2+ + O2 + (4+2) H2O â 2 Fe2O3Â·H2O + 8 H+
Iron(III) oxide hydrate is known as rust. The concentration of water associated with iron oxide varies, thus the chemical formula is represented by Fe2O3Â·H2O.

An electric circuit is formed as passage of electrons and ions occurs; thus if an electrolyte is present it will facilitate oxidation, explaining why rusting is quicker in salt water.

===Corrosion of common metals===
Coinage metals, such as copper and silver, slowly corrode through use.
A patina of green-blue copper carbonate forms on the surface of copper with exposure to the water and carbon dioxide in the air. Silver coins or cutlery that are exposed to high sulfur foods such as eggs or the low levels of sulfur species in the air develop a layer of black silver sulfide.

Gold and platinum are extremely difficult to oxidize under normal circumstances, and require exposure to a powerful chemical oxidizing agent such as aqua regia.

Some common metals oxidize extremely rapidly in air. Titanium and aluminium oxidize instantaneously in contact with the oxygen in the air. These metals form an extremely thin layer of oxidized metal on the surface, which bonds with the underlying metal. This thin oxide layer protects the underlying bulk of the metal from the air preventing the entire metal from oxidizing. These metals are used in applications where corrosion resistance is important. Iron, in contrast, has an oxide that forms in air and water, called rust, that does not bond with the iron and therefore does not stop the further oxidation of the iron. Thus iron left exposed to air and water will continue to rust until all of the iron is oxidized.

===Prevention of corrosion===
Attempts to save a metal from becoming anodic are of two general types. Anodic regions dissolve and destroy the structural integrity of the metal.

While it is almost impossible to prevent anode/cathode formation, if a non-conducting material covers the metal, contact with the electrolyte is not possible and corrosion will not occur.

====Coating====
Metals can be coated with paint or other less conductive metals (&quot;passivation&quot;). This prevents the metal surface from being exposed to electrolytes. Scratches exposing the metal substrate will result in corrosion. The region under the coating adjacent to the scratch acts as the anode of the reaction.

====Sacrificial anodes====

A method commonly used to protect a structural metal is to attach a metal which is more anodic than the metal to be protected. This forces the structural metal to be cathodic, thus spared corrosion. It is called &quot;sacrificial&quot; because the anode dissolves and has to be replaced periodically.

Zinc bars are attached to various locations on steel ship hulls to render the ship hull cathodic. The zinc bars are replaced periodically. Other metals, such as magnesium, would work very well but zinc is the least expensive useful metal.

To protect pipelines, an ingot of buried or exposed magnesium (or zinc) is buried beside the pipeline and is connected electrically to the pipe above ground. The pipeline is forced to be a cathode and is protected from being oxidized and rusting. The magnesium anode is sacrificed. At intervals new ingots are buried to replace those dissolved.

==Electrolysis==
The spontaneous redox reactions of a conventional battery produce electricity through the different reduction potentials of the cathode and anode in the electrolyte. However, electrolysis requires an external source of electrical energy to induce a chemical reaction, and this process takes place in a compartment called an electrolytic cell.

===Electrolysis of molten sodium chloride===

When molten, the salt sodium chloride can be electrolyzed to yield metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine. Industrially this process takes place in a special cell named Downs cell. The cell is connected to an electrical power supply, allowing electrons to migrate from the power supply to the electrolytic cell.

Reactions that take place in a Downs cell are the following:
:Anode (oxidation): 2 Clâ â Cl2 + 2 eâ
:Cathode (reduction): 2 Na+ + 2 eâ â 2 Na
:Overall reaction: 2 Na+ + 2 Clâ â 2 Na + Cl2

This process can yield large amounts of metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine, and is widely used in mineral dressing and metallurgy industries.

The emf for this process is approximately â4Â V indicating a (very) non-spontaneous process. In order for this reaction to occur the power supply should provide at least a potential difference of 4Â V. However, larger voltages must be used for this reaction to occur at a high rate.

===Electrolysis of water===

Water can be converted to its component elemental gases, H2 and O2, through the application of an external voltage. Water does not decompose into hydrogen and oxygen spontaneously as the Gibbs free energy change for the process at standard conditions is very positive, about 474.4 kJ. The decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen can be performed in an electrolytic cell. In it, a pair of inert electrodes usually made of platinum immersed in water act as anode and cathode in the electrolytic process. The electrolysis starts with the application of an external voltage between the electrodes. This process will not occur except at extremely high voltages without an electrolyte such as sodium chloride or sulfuric acid (most used 0.1 M).

Bubbles from the gases will be seen near both electrodes. The following half reactions describe the process mentioned above:
:Anode (oxidation): 2 H2O â O2 + 4 H+ + 4 eâ
:Cathode (reduction): 2 H2O + 2 eâ â H2 + 2 OHâ
:Overall reaction: 2 H2O â 2 H2 + O2

Although strong acids may be used in the apparatus, the reaction will not net consume the acid. While this reaction will work at any conductive electrode at a sufficiently large potential, platinum catalyzes both hydrogen and oxygen formation, allowing for relatively low voltages (~2 V depending on the pH).

===Electrolysis of aqueous solutions===
Electrolysis in an aqueous solution is a similar process as mentioned in electrolysis of water. However, it is considered to be a complex process because the contents in solution have to be analyzed in half reactions, whether reduced or oxidized.

====Electrolysis of a solution of sodium chloride====

The presence of water in a solution of sodium chloride must be examined in respect to its reduction and oxidation in both electrodes. Usually, water is electrolysed as mentioned above in electrolysis of water yielding &quot;gaseous oxygen in the anode&quot; and gaseous hydrogen in the cathode. On the other hand, sodium chloride in water dissociates in Na+ and Clâ ions. The cation, which is the positive ion, will be attracted to the cathode (â), thus reducing the sodium ion. The chloride anion will then be attracted to the anode (+), where it is oxidized to chlorine gas.

The following half reactions should be considered in the process mentioned:
# Cathode: Na+ + eâ â Na&quot;E&quot;Â°red = â2.71 V
# Anode: 2 Clâ â Cl2 + 2 eâ&quot;E&quot;Â°red = +1.36 V
# Cathode: 2 H2O + 2 eâ â H2 + 2 OHâ&quot;E&quot;Â°red = â0.83 V
# Anode: 2 H2O â O2 + 4 H+ + 4 eâ&quot;E&quot;Â°red = +1.23 V

Reaction 1 is discarded as it has the most negative value on standard reduction potential thus making it less thermodynamically favorable in the process.

When comparing the reduction potentials in reactions 2 and 4, the oxidation of chloride ion is favored over oxidation of water, thus chlorine gas is produced at the anode and not oxygen gas.

Although the initial analysis is correct, there is another effect, known as the overvoltage effect. Additional voltage is sometimes required, beyond the voltage predicted by the &quot;E&quot;Â°cell. This may be due to kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. In fact, it has been proven that the activation energy for the chloride ion is very low, hence favorable in kinetic terms. In other words, although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame, the voltage of the external source has to be increased (hence, overvoltage).

The overall reaction for the process according to the analysis is the following:
:Anode (oxidation): 2 Clâ â Cl2 + 2 eâ
:Cathode (reduction): 2 H2O + 2 eâ â H2 + 2 OHâ
:Overall reaction: 2 H2O + 2 Clâ â H2 + Cl2 + 2 OHâ

As the overall reaction indicates, the concentration of chloride ions is reduced in comparison to OHâ ions (whose concentration increases). The reaction also shows the production of gaseous hydrogen, chlorine and aqueous sodium hydroxide.

===Quantitative electrolysis and Faraday&#x27;s laws===

Quantitative aspects of electrolysis were originally developed by Michael Faraday in 1834. Faraday is also credited to have coined the terms &quot;electrolyte&quot;, electrolysis, among many others while he studied quantitative analysis of electrochemical reactions. Also he was an advocate of the law of conservation of energy.

====First law====
Faraday concluded after several experiments on electric current in a non-spontaneous process that the mass of the products yielded on the electrodes was proportional to the value of current supplied to the cell, the length of time the current existed, and the molar mass of the substance analyzed. In other words, the amount of a substance deposited on each electrode of an electrolytic cell is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the cell.

Below is a simplified equation of Faraday&#x27;s first law:
:formula_13

where
:&quot;m&quot; is the mass of the substance produced at the electrode (in grams),
:&quot;Q&quot; is the total electric charge that passed through the solution (in coulombs),
:&quot;n&quot; is the valence number of the substance as an ion in solution (electrons per ion),
:&quot;M&quot; is the molar mass of the substance (in grams per mole),
:&quot;F&quot; is Faraday&#x27;s constant (96485 coulombs per mole).

====Second law====

Faraday devised the laws of chemical electrodeposition of metals from solutions in 1857. He formulated the second law of electrolysis stating &quot;the amounts of bodies which are equivalent to each other in their ordinary chemical action have equal quantities of electricity naturally associated with them.&quot; In other words, the quantities of different elements deposited by a given amount of electricity are in the ratio of their chemical equivalent weights.

An important aspect of the second law of electrolysis is electroplating, which together with the first law of electrolysis has a significant number of applications in industry, as when used to protectively coat metals to avoid corrosion.

==Applications==

There are various important electrochemical processes in both nature and industry, like the coating of objects with metals or metal oxides through electrodeposition, the addition (electroplating) or removal (electropolishing) of thin layers of metal from an object&#x27;s surface, and the detection of alcohol in drunk drivers through the redox reaction of ethanol. The generation of chemical energy through photosynthesis is inherently an electrochemical process, as is production of metals like aluminum and titanium from their ores. Certain diabetes blood sugar meters measure the amount of glucose in the blood through its redox potential. In addition to established electrochemical technologies (like deep cycle lead acid batteries) there is also a wide range of new emerging technologies such as fuel cells, large format lithium-ion batteries, electrochemical reactors and super-capacitors that are becoming increasingly commercial. Electrochemical or coulometric titrations were introduced for quantitative analysis of minute quantities in 1938 by the Hungarian chemists LÃ¡szlÃ³ SzebellÃ©dy and Zoltan Somogyi. Electrochemistry also has important applications in the food industry, like the assessment of food/package interactions, the analysis of milk composition, the characterization and the determination of the freezing end-point of ice-cream mixes, or the determination of free acidity in olive oil.

<text>Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 council areas. The city is located in southeast Scotland and is bounded to the north by the Firth of Forth and to the south by the Pentland Hills. Edinburgh had a population of in , making it the second-most populous city in Scotland and the seventh-most populous in the United Kingdom. The wider metropolitan area had a population of 912,490 in the same year.

Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, the highest courts in Scotland, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the monarch in Scotland. It is also the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scottish law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is considered one of the best research institutions in the world. The financial centre of Scotland, Edinburgh is the second-largest financial centre in the United Kingdom, the fourth largest in Europe, and the thirteenth largest internationally.

The city is a cultural centre, and is the home of institutions including the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. The city is also known for the Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe, the latter being the world&#x27;s largest annual international arts festival. Historic sites in Edinburgh include Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the churches of St. Giles, Greyfriars and the Canongate, and the extensive Georgian New Town built in the 18th/19th centuries. Edinburgh&#x27;s Old Town and New Town together are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which has been managed by Edinburgh World Heritage since 1999. The city&#x27;s historical and cultural attractions have made it the UK&#x27;s second-most visited tourist destination, attracting 4.9 million visits, including 2.4 million from overseas in 2018.

Edinburgh is governed by the City of Edinburgh Council, a unitary authority. The City of Edinburgh council area had an estimated population of in , and includes outlying towns and villages which are not part of Edinburgh proper. The city is in the Lothian region and was historically part of the shire of Midlothian (also called Edinburghshire).

==Etymology==

&quot;Edin&quot;, the root of the city&#x27;s name, derives from &quot;&quot;, the name for the region in Cumbric, the Brittonic Celtic language formerly spoken there. The name&#x27;s meaning is unknown. The district of Eidyn was centred on the stronghold of Din Eidyn, the dun or hillfort of Eidyn. This stronghold is believed to have been located at Castle Rock, now the site of Edinburgh Castle. A siege of Din Eidyn by Oswald, king of the Angles of Northumbria in 638 marked the beginning of three centuries of Germanic influence in south east Scotland that laid the foundations for the development of Scots, before the town was ultimately subsumed in 954 by the kingdom known to the English as Scotland. As the language shifted from Cumbric to Northumbrian Old English and then Scots, the Brittonic &quot;din&quot; in Din Eidyn was replaced by &quot;burh&quot;, producing &quot;Edinburgh&quot;. In Scottish Gaelic &quot;din&quot; becomes &quot;dÃ¹n&quot;, producing modern &quot;DÃ¹n Ãideann&quot;.

==Nicknames==

The city is affectionately nicknamed &quot;Auld Reekie&quot;, Scots for &quot;Old Smoky&quot;, for the views from the country of the smoke-covered Old Town. A note in a collection of the works of the poet, Allan Ramsay, explains, &quot;Auld Reeky...A name the country people give Edinburgh, from the cloud of smoke or reek that is always impending over it.&quot; In Walter Scott&#x27;s 1820 novel &quot;The Abbot&quot;, a character observes that &quot;yonder stands Auld Reekieâyou may see the smoke hover over her at twenty miles&#x27; distance&quot;. In 1898, Thomas Carlyle comments on the phenomenon: &quot;Smoke cloud hangs over old Edinburgh, for, ever since Aeneas Silvius&#x27;s time and earlier, the people have the art, very strange to Aeneas, of burning a certain sort of black stones, and Edinburgh with its chimneys is called &#x27;Auld Reekie&#x27; by the country people&quot;. The 19th-century historian Robert Chambers asserted that the sobriquet could not be traced before the reign of Charles II in the late 17th century. He attributed the name to a Fife laird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements. &quot;It&#x27;s time now bairns, to tak&#x27; the beuks, and gang to our beds, for yonder&#x27;s Auld Reekie, I see, putting on her nicht -cap!&quot;.

Edinburgh has been popularly called the &quot;Athens of the North&quot; since the early 19th century. References to Athens, such as &quot;Athens of Britain&quot; and &quot;Modern Athens&quot;, had been made as early as the 1760s. The similarities were seen to be topographical but also intellectual. Edinburgh&#x27;s Castle Rock reminded returning grand tourists of the Athenian Acropolis, as did aspects of the neoclassical architecture and layout of New Town. Both cities had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a port several miles away (respectively, Leith and Piraeus). Intellectually, the Scottish Enlightenment, with its humanist and rationalist outlook, was influenced by Ancient Greek philosophy. In 1822, artist Hugh William Williams organized an exhibition that showed his paintings of Athens alongside views of Edinburgh, and the idea of a direct parallel between both cities quickly caught the popular imagination. When plans were drawn up in the early 19th century to architecturally develop Calton Hill, the design of the National Monument directly copied Athens&#x27; Parthenon. Tom Stoppard&#x27;s character Archie of &quot;Jumpers&quot; said, perhaps playing on ReykjavÃ­k meaning &quot;smoky bay&quot;, that the &quot;ReykjavÃ­k of the South&quot; would be more appropriate.

The city has also been known by several Latin names, such as &quot;Edinburgum&quot;, while the adjectival forms &quot;Edinburgensis&quot; and &quot;Edinensis&quot; are used in educational and scientific contexts.

&quot;Edina&quot; is a late 18th-century poetical form used by the Scots poets Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns. &quot;Embra&quot; or &quot;Embro&quot; are colloquialisms from the same time, as in Robert Garioch&#x27;s &quot;Embro to the Ploy&quot;.

Ben Jonson described it as &quot;Britaine&#x27;s other eye&quot;, and Sir Walter Scott referred to it as &quot;yon Empress of the North&quot;. Robert Louis Stevenson, also a son of the city, wrote that Edinburgh &quot;is what Paris ought to be&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest known human habitation in the Edinburgh area was at Cramond, where evidence was found of a Mesolithic camp site dated to c. 8500 BC. Traces of later Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements have been found on Castle Rock, Arthur&#x27;s Seat, Craiglockhart Hill and the Pentland Hills.

When the Romans arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they found a Brittonic Celtic tribe whose name they recorded as the Votadini. The Votadini transitioned into the Gododdin kingdom in the Early Middle Ages, with Eidyn serving as one of the kingdom&#x27;s districts. During this period, the Castle Rock site, thought to have been the stronghold of Din Eidyn, emerged as the kingdom&#x27;s major centre. The medieval poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; describes a war band from across the Brittonic world who gathered in Eidyn before a fateful raid; this may describe a historical event around AD 600.

In 638, the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to King Oswald of Northumbria, and around this time control of Lothian passed to the Angles. Their influence continued for the next three centuries until around 950, when, during the reign of Indulf, son of Constantine II, the &quot;burh&quot; (fortress), named in the 10th-century &quot;Pictish Chronicle&quot; as &quot;oppidum Eden&quot;, was abandoned to the Scots. It thenceforth remained, for the most part, under their jurisdiction.

The royal burgh was founded by King David I in the early 12th century on land belonging to the Crown, though the date of its charter is unknown. The first documentary evidence of the medieval burgh is a royal charter, , by King David I granting a toft in to the Priory of Dunfermline. The shire of Edinburgh seems to have also been created in the reign of David I, possibly covering all of Lothian at first, but by 1305 the eastern and western parts of Lothian had become Haddingtonshire and Linlithgowshire, leaving Edinburgh as the county town of a shire covering the central part of Lothian, which was called Edinburghshire or Midlothian (the latter name being an informal, but commonly used, alternative until the county&#x27;s name was legally changed in 1947).

Edinburgh was largely under English control from 1291 to 1314 and from 1333 to 1341, during the Wars of Scottish Independence. When the English invaded Scotland in 1298, Edward I of England chose not to enter Edinburgh but passed by it with his army.

In the middle of the 14th century, the French chronicler Jean Froissart described it as the capital of Scotland (c. 1365), and James III (1451â88) referred to it in the 15th century as &quot;the principal burgh of our kingdom&quot;. In 1482 James III &quot;granted and perpetually confirmed to the said Provost, Bailies, Clerk, Council, and Community, and their successors, the office of Sheriff within the Burgh for ever, to be exercised by the Provost for the time as Sheriff, and by the Bailies for the time as Sheriffsdepute conjunctly and severally; with full power to hold Courts, to punish transgressors not only by banishment but by death, to appoint officers of Court, and to do everything else appertaining to the office of Sheriff; as also to apply to their own proper use the fines and escheats arising out of the exercise of the said office.&quot; Despite being burnt by the English in 1544, Edinburgh continued to develop and grow, and was at the centre of events in the 16th-century Scottish Reformation and 17th-century Wars of the Covenant. In 1582, Edinburgh&#x27;s town council was given a royal charter by King James VI permitting the establishment of a university; founded as &quot;Tounis College&quot; (Town&#x27;s College), the institution developed into the University of Edinburgh, which contributed to Edinburgh&#x27;s central intellectual role in subsequent centuries.

===17th century===
In 1603, King James VI of Scotland succeeded to the English throne, uniting the crowns of Scotland and England in a personal union known as the Union of the Crowns, though Scotland remained, in all other respects, a separate kingdom. In 1638, King Charles I&#x27;s attempt to introduce Anglican church forms in Scotland encountered stiff Presbyterian opposition culminating in the conflicts of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Subsequent Scottish support for Charles Stuart&#x27;s restoration to the throne of England resulted in Edinburgh&#x27;s occupation by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Commonwealth of England forces â the New Model Army â in 1650.

In the 17th century, Edinburgh&#x27;s boundaries were still defined by the city&#x27;s defensive town walls. As a result, the city&#x27;s growing population was accommodated by increasing the height of the houses. Buildings of 11 storeys or more were common, and have been described as forerunners of the modern-day skyscraper. Most of these old structures were replaced by the predominantly Victorian buildings seen in today&#x27;s Old Town. In 1611 an act of parliament created the High Constables of Edinburgh to keep order in the city, thought to be the oldest statutory police force in the world.

===18th century===

Following the Treaty of Union in 1706, the Parliaments of England and Scotland passed Acts of Union in 1706 and 1707 respectively, uniting the two kingdoms in the Kingdom of Great Britain effective from 1 May 1707. As a consequence, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain, which sat at Westminster in London. The Union was opposed by many Scots, resulting in riots in the city.

By the first half of the 18th century, Edinburgh was described as one of Europe&#x27;s most densely populated, overcrowded and unsanitary towns. Visitors were struck by the fact that the social classes shared the same urban space, even inhabiting the same tenement buildings; although here a form of social segregation did prevail, whereby shopkeepers and tradesmen tended to occupy the cheaper-to-rent cellars and garrets, while the more well-to-do professional classes occupied the more expensive middle storeys.

During the Jacobite rising of 1745, Edinburgh was briefly occupied by the Jacobite &quot;Highland Army&quot; before its march into England. After its eventual defeat at Culloden, there followed a period of reprisals and pacification, largely directed at the rebellious clans. In Edinburgh, the Town Council, keen to emulate London by initiating city improvements and expansion to the north of the castle, reaffirmed its belief in the Union and loyalty to the Hanoverian monarch George III by its choice of names for the streets of the New Town: for example, Rose Street and Thistle Street; and for the royal family, George Street, Queen Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Princes Street (in honour of George&#x27;s two sons). The consistently geometric layout of the plan for the extension of Edinburgh was the result of a major competition in urban planning staged by the Town Council in 1766.

In the second half of the century, the city was at the heart of the Scottish Enlightenment, when thinkers like David Hume, Adam Smith, James Hutton and Joseph Black were familiar figures in its streets. Edinburgh became a major intellectual centre, earning it the nickname &quot;Athens of the North&quot; because of its many neo-classical buildings and reputation for learning, recalling ancient Athens. In the 18th-century novel &quot;The Expedition of Humphry Clinker&quot; by Tobias Smollett one character describes Edinburgh as a &quot;hotbed of genius&quot;. Edinburgh was also a major centre for the Scottish book trade. The highly successful London bookseller Andrew Millar was apprenticed there to James McEuen.

From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant &quot;one-family&quot; residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the city&#x27;s social character. According to the foremost historian of this development, &quot;Unity of social feeling was one of the most valuable heritages of old Edinburgh, and its disappearance was widely and properly lamented.&quot;

===19th and 20th centuries===
Despite an enduring myth to the contrary, Edinburgh became an industrial centre with its traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continuing to grow in the 19th century and joined by new industries such as rubber works, engineering works and others. By 1821, Edinburgh had been overtaken by Glasgow as Scotland&#x27;s largest city. The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s. The Old Town became an increasingly dilapidated, overcrowded slum with high mortality rates. Improvements carried out under Lord Provost William Chambers in the 1860s began the transformation of the area into the predominantly Victorian Old Town seen today. More improvements followed in the early 20th century as a result of the work of Patrick Geddes, but relative economic stagnation during the two world wars and beyond saw the Old Town deteriorate further before major slum clearance in the 1960s and 1970s began to reverse the process. University building developments which transformed the George Square and Potterrow areas proved highly controversial.

Since the 1990s a new &quot;financial district&quot;, including the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, has grown mainly on demolished railway property to the west of the castle, stretching into Fountainbridge, a run-down 19th-century industrial suburb which has undergone radical change since the 1980s with the demise of industrial and brewery premises. This ongoing development has enabled Edinburgh to maintain its place as the United Kingdom&#x27;s second largest financial and administrative centre after London. Financial services now account for a third of all commercial office space in the city. The development of Edinburgh Park, a new business and technology park covering , west of the city centre, has also contributed to the District Council&#x27;s strategy for the city&#x27;s major economic regeneration.

In 1998, the Scotland Act, which came into force the following year, established a devolved Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive (renamed the Scottish Government since September 2007). Both based in Edinburgh, they are responsible for governing Scotland while reserved matters such as defence, foreign affairs and some elements of income tax remain the responsibility of the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London.

===21st century===
In 2022, Edinburgh was affected by the 2022 Scotland bin strikes. In 2023, Edinburgh became the first capital city in Europe to sign the global Plant Based Treaty, which was introduced at COP26 in 2021 in Glasgow. Green Party councillor Steve Burgess introduced the treaty. The Scottish Countryside Alliance and other farming groups called the treaty &quot;anti-farming&quot;.

==Geography==
===Location===
Situated in Scotland&#x27;s Central Belt, Edinburgh lies on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. The city centre is southwest of the shoreline of Leith and inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the North Sea at Dunbar. While the early burgh grew up near the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on seven hills, namely Calton Hill, Corstorphine Hill, Craiglockhart Hill, Braid Hill, Blackford Hill, Arthur&#x27;s Seat and the Castle Rock, giving rise to allusions to the seven hills of Rome.

===Cityscape===

Occupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the Pentland Hills and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.
 Igneous activity between 350 and 400 million years ago, coupled with faulting, led to the creation of tough basalt volcanic plugs, which predominate over much of the area. One such example is the Castle Rock which forced the advancing ice sheet to divide, sheltering the softer rock and forming a tail of material to the east, thus creating a distinctive crag and tail formation. Glacial erosion on the north side of the crag gouged a deep valley later filled by the now drained Nor Loch. These features, along with another hollow on the rock&#x27;s south side, formed an ideal natural strongpoint upon which Edinburgh Castle was built. Similarly, Arthur&#x27;s Seat is the remains of a volcano dating from the Carboniferous period, which was eroded by a glacier moving west to east during the ice age. Erosive action such as plucking and abrasion exposed the rocky crags to the west before leaving a tail of deposited glacial material swept to the east. This process formed the distinctive Salisbury Crags, a series of teschenite cliffs between Arthur&#x27;s Seat and the location of the early burgh. The residential areas of Marchmont and Bruntsfield are built along a series of drumlin ridges south of the city centre, which were deposited as the glacier receded.

Other prominent landforms such as Calton Hill and Corstorphine Hill are also products of glacial erosion. The Braid Hills and Blackford Hill are a series of small summits to the south of the city centre that command expansive views looking northwards over the urban area to the Firth of Forth.

Edinburgh is drained by the river named the Water of Leith, which rises at the Colzium Springs in the Pentland Hills and runs for through the south and west of the city, emptying into the Firth of Forth at Leith. The nearest the river gets to the city centre is at Dean Village on the north-western edge of the New Town, where a deep gorge is spanned by Thomas Telford&#x27;s Dean Bridge, built in 1832 for the road to Queensferry. The Water of Leith Walkway is a mixed-use trail that follows the course of the river for from Balerno to Leith.

Excepting the shoreline of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a green belt, designated in 1957, which stretches from Dalmeny in the west to Prestongrange in the east. With an average width of the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas. Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as Edinburgh Airport and the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston lie within the zone. Similarly, suburbs such as Juniper Green and Balerno are situated on green belt land. One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples of these independent wedges of green belt include Holyrood Park and Corstorphine Hill.

===Areas===

====Early settlements====
Edinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Many areas, such as Dalry, contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known as tenements, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been less built-up with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.

The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe of Princes Street Gardens. To the south, the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on Castle Rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.

The West End includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.

====Old and New Towns====
Edinburgh&#x27;s Old and New Towns were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 listed buildings within the city, a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.

The castle is perched on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano) and the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it terminating at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or wynds) lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern. Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest &quot;high rise&quot; residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as &quot;lands&quot; were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys. Numerous vaults below street level were inhabited to accommodate the influx of incomers, particularly Irish immigrants, during the Industrial Revolution. The street has several fine public buildings such as St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, the City Chambers and the Law Courts. Other places of historical interest nearby are Greyfriars Kirkyard and Mary King&#x27;s Close. The Grassmarket, running deep below the castle is connected by the steep double terraced Victoria Street. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many Northern European cities.

The New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a &quot;New Town&quot; was won by James Craig, a 27-year-old architect. The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with Enlightenment ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be George Street, running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the &quot;Old Town&quot;. To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburgh&#x27;s main shopping street and now has few of its Georgian buildings in their original state. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by St Andrew Square and Charlotte Square respectively. The latter, designed by Robert Adam, influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century. Bute House, the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland, is on the north side of Charlotte Square.

The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the Nor Loch, which was created for the town&#x27;s defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their sewage. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city&#x27;s northward expansion. Craig&#x27;s original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch, but this idea was abandoned. Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the loch to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as The Mound.

In the middle of the 19th century the National Gallery of Scotland and Royal Scottish Academy Building were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between Haymarket and Waverley stations were driven through it.

====Southside====

The Southside is a residential part of the city, which includes the districts of St Leonards, Marchmont, Morningside, Newington, Sciennes, the Grange and Blackford. The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the Burgh Muir, and was developed as a residential area after the opening of the South Bridge in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around George Square just north of Marchmont and the Meadows), and Napier University (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotel and &quot;bed and breakfast&quot; accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example, Church Hill in Morningside, was the home of Muriel Spark&#x27;s Miss Jean Brodie, and Ian Rankin&#x27;s Inspector Rebus lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.

====Leith====

Leith was historically the port of Edinburgh, an arrangement of unknown date that was confirmed by the royal charter Robert the Bruce granted to the city in 1329. The port developed a separate identity from Edinburgh, which to some extent it still retains, and it was a matter of great resentment when the two burghs merged in 1920 into the City of Edinburgh. Even today the parliamentary seat is known as &quot;Edinburgh North and Leith&quot;. The loss of traditional industries and commerce (the last shipyard closed in 1983) resulted in economic decline. The Edinburgh Waterfront development has transformed old dockland areas from Leith to Granton into residential areas with shopping and leisure facilities and helped rejuvenate the area. With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The coastal suburb of Portobello is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a beach and promenade and cafÃ©s, bars, restaurants and independent shops. There are rowing and sailing clubs, a restored Victorian swimming pool, and Victorian Turkish baths.

====Urban area====

The urban area of Edinburgh is almost entirely within the City of Edinburgh Council boundary, merging with Musselburgh in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include Inverkeithing, Haddington, Tranent, Prestonpans, Dalkeith, Bonnyrigg, Loanhead, Penicuik, Broxburn, Livingston and Dunfermline. Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh &amp; South East Scotland City region with a population in 2014 of 1,339,380.

===Climate===
Like most of Scotland, Edinburgh has a cool temperate maritime climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) which, despite its northerly latitude, is milder than places which lie at similar latitudes such as Moscow and Labrador. The city&#x27;s proximity to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Winter daytime temperatures rarely fall below freezing while summer temperatures are moderate, rarely exceeding . The highest temperature recorded in the city was on 25 July 2019 at Gogarbank, beating the previous record of on 4 August 1975 at Edinburgh Airport. The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was during December 2010 at Gogarbank.

Given Edinburgh&#x27;s position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as &quot;the windy city&quot;, with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south-west, which is often associated with warm, unstable air from the North Atlantic Current that can give rise to rainfall â although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow. Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by haar, a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as European windstorms, can affect the city between October and April.

Located slightly north of the city centre, the weather station at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) has been an official weather station for the Met Office since 1956.
The Met Office operates its own weather station at Gogarbank on the city&#x27;s western outskirts, near Edinburgh Airport. This slightly inland station has a slightly wider temperature span between seasons, is cloudier and somewhat wetter, but differences are minor.

Temperature and rainfall records have been kept at the Royal Observatory since 1764.

==Demography==
===Current===

The most recent official population estimates () are for the locality (includes Currie), and for the Edinburgh settlement (includes Musselburgh).

Edinburgh has a high proportion of young adults, with 19.5% of the population in their 20s (exceeded only by Aberdeen) and 15.2% in their 30s which is the highest in Scotland. The proportion of Edinburgh&#x27;s population born in the UK fell from 92% to 84% between 2001 and 2011, while the proportion of White Scottish-born fell from 78% to 70%. Of those Edinburgh residents born in the UK, 335,000 or 83% were born in Scotland, with 58,000 or 14% being born in England. 

Some 16,000 people or 3.2% of the city&#x27;s population are of Polish descent. 77,800 people or 15.1% of Edinburgh&#x27;s population class themselves as Non-White which is an increase from 8.2% in 2011 and 4% in 2001. Of the Non-White population, the largest group by far are Asian, totalling about 44 thousand people. Within the Asian population, people of Chinese descent are now the largest sub-group, with 15,076 people, amounting to about 2.9% of the city&#x27;s total population. The city&#x27;s population of Indian descent amounts to 12,414 (2.4% of the total population), while there are some 7,454 of Pakistani descent (1.5% of the total population). Although they account for only 2,685 people or 0.5% of the city&#x27;s population, Edinburgh has the highest number and proportion of people of Bangladeshi descent in Scotland. Close to 12,000 people were born in African countries (2.3% of the total population) and over 13,000 in the Americas. With the notable exception of Inner London, Edinburgh has a higher number of people born in the United States (over 6,500) than any other city in the UK.

The proportion of people residing in Edinburgh born outside the UK was 23.5% in 2022, compared with 15.9% in 2011 and 8.3% in 2001. Below are the largest overseas-born groups in Edinburgh according to the 2022 census, alongside the two previous censuses.

===Historical===

A census by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 recorded a population of 8,003 adults spread equally north and south of the High Street which runs along the spine of the ridge sloping down from the Castle. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas. As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped tenements that lined the present day Royal Mile and the Cowgate, were exacerbated. Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease, with outbreaks of cholera occurring in 1832, 1848 and 1866.

The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.
 Expansion southwards from the Old Town saw more tenements being built in the 19th century, giving rise to Victorian suburbs such as Dalry, Newington, Marchmont and Bruntsfield.

Early 20th-century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh&#x27;s population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.

From the early to mid 20th century, the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as Dumbiedykes, Leith, and Fountainbridge, led to the creation of new estates such as Stenhouse and Saughton, Craigmillar and Niddrie, Pilton and Muirhouse, Piershill, and Sighthill.

===Religion===
In 2018, the Church of Scotland had 20,956 members in 71 congregations in the Presbytery of Edinburgh. Its most prominent church is St Giles&#x27; on the Royal Mile, first dedicated in 1243 but believed to date from before the 12th century. Saint Giles is historically the patron saint of Edinburgh. St Cuthbert&#x27;s, situated at the west end of Princes Street Gardens in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle and St Giles&#x27; can lay claim to being the oldest Christian sites in the city, though the present St Cuthbert&#x27;s, designed by Hippolyte Blanc, was dedicated in 1894.

Other Church of Scotland churches include Greyfriars Kirk, the Canongate Kirk, and the Barclay Church. The Church of Scotland Offices are in Edinburgh, as is the Assembly Hall where the annual General Assembly is held.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh has 27 parishes across the city. The Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh has his official residence in Greenhill, the diocesan offices are in nearby Marchmont, and its cathedral is St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Edinburgh. The Diocese of Edinburgh of the Scottish Episcopal Church has over 50 churches, half of them in the city. Its centre is the late 19th-century Gothic style St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in the West End&#x27;s Palmerston Place. Orthodox Christianity is represented by Pan, Romanian and Russian Orthodox churches, including St Andrew&#x27;s Orthodox Church, part of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain. There are several independent churches in the city, both Catholic and Protestant, including Charlotte Chapel, Carrubbers Christian Centre, Bellevue Chapel and Sacred Heart. There are also churches belonging to Quakers, Christadelphians, Seventh-day Adventists, Church of Christ, Scientist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Elim Pentecostal Church.

Muslims have several places of worship across the city. Edinburgh Central Mosque, the largest Islamic place of worship, is located in Potterrow on the city&#x27;s Southside, near Bristo Square. Construction was largely financed by a gift from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and was completed in 1998. There is also an Ahmadiyya Muslim community.

The first recorded presence of a Jewish community in Edinburgh dates back to the late 18th century. Edinburgh&#x27;s Orthodox synagogue, opened in 1932, is in Salisbury Road and can accommodate a congregation of 2000. A Liberal Jewish congregation also meets in the city.

A Sikh gurdwara and a Hindu mandir are located in Leith. The city also has a Brahma Kumaris centre in the Polwarth area.

The Edinburgh Buddhist Centre, run by the Triratna Buddhist Community, formerly situated in Melville Terrace, now runs sessions at the Healthy Life Centre, Bread Street. Other Buddhist traditions are represented by groups which meet in the capital: the Community of Interbeing (followers of Thich Nhat Hanh), Rigpa, Samye Dzong, Theravadin, Pure Land and Shambala. There is a SÅtÅ Zen Priory in Portobello and a Theravadin Thai Buddhist Monastery in Slateford Road.

Edinburgh is home to a BahÃ¡Ê¼Ã­ community, and a Theosophical Society meets in Great King Street.

Edinburgh has an Inter-Faith Association.

Edinburgh has over 39 graveyards and cemeteries, many of which are listed and of historical character, including several former church burial grounds. Examples include Old Calton Burial Ground, Greyfriars Kirkyard and Dean Cemetery.

==Economy==


Edinburgh has the strongest economy of any city in the United Kingdom outside London and the highest percentage of professionals in the UK with 43% of the population holding a degree-level or professional qualification. According to the Centre for International Competitiveness, it is the most competitive large city in the United Kingdom. It also has the highest gross value added per employee of any city in the UK outside London, measuring Â£57,594 in 2010. It was named European Best Large City of the Future for Foreign Direct Investment and Best Large City for Foreign Direct Investment Strategy in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; magazine in 2012.

As the centre of Scotland&#x27;s government and legal system, the public sector plays a central role in Edinburgh&#x27;s economy. Many departments of the Scottish Government are in the city, including the headquarters of the government at St Andrew&#x27;s House, the official residence of the First Minister at Bute House and Scottish Government offices at Victoria Quay. Other major sectors across the city include administrative and support services, the education sector, public administration and defence, the health and social care sector, scientific and technical services, and construction and manufacturing. When the Â£1.3bn Edinburgh &amp; South East Scotland City Region Deal was signed in 2018, the region&#x27;s Gross Value Added (GVA) contribution to the Scottish economy was cited as Â£33bn, or 33% of the country&#x27;s output. The City Region Deal funds a range of &quot;Data Driven Innovation&quot; hubs which are using data to innovate in the region, recognising the region&#x27;s strengths in technology and data science, the growing importance of the data economy, and the need to tackle the digital skills gap, as a route to social and economic prosperity.

Tourism is also an important element in the city&#x27;s economy. As a World Heritage Site, tourists visit historical sites such as Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Old and New Towns. Their numbers are augmented in August each year during the Edinburgh Festivals, which attracts 4.4Â million visitors, and generates over Â£100M for the local economy. In March 2010, unemployment in Edinburgh was comparatively low at 3.6%, and it remains consistently below the Scottish average of 4.5%. In 2022 Edinburgh was the second most visited city in the United Kingdom, behind London, by overseas visitors.

==Culture==
===Festivals and celebrations===
====Edinburgh festivals====

The city hosts a series of festivals that run between the end of July and early September each year. The best known of these events are the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Edinburgh International Festival, the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the Edinburgh Art Festival and the Edinburgh International Book Festival.

The longest established of these festivals is the Edinburgh International Festival, which was first held in 1947 and consists mainly of a programme of high-profile theatre productions and classical music performances, featuring international directors, conductors, theatre companies and orchestras.

This has since been overtaken in size by the Edinburgh Fringe which began as a programme of marginal acts alongside the &quot;official&quot; Festival and has become the world&#x27;s largest performing arts festival. In 2017, nearly 3400 different shows were staged in 300 venues across the city. Comedy has become one of the mainstays of the Fringe, with numerous well-known comedians getting their first &#x27;break&#x27; there, often by being chosen to receive the Edinburgh Comedy Award. The Edinburgh Military Tattoo, occupies the Castle Esplanade every night for three weeks each August, with massed pipe bands and military bands drawn from around the world. Performances end with a short fireworks display.

As well as the summer festivals, many other festivals are held during the rest of the year, including the Edinburgh International Film Festival and Edinburgh International Science Festival.

The summer of 2020 was the first time in its 70-year history that the Edinburgh festival was not run, being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This affected many of the tourist-focused businesses in Edinburgh which depend on the various festivals over summer to return an annual profit.

====Edinburgh&#x27;s Hogmanay====
The annual Edinburgh Hogmanay celebration was originally an informal street party focused on the Tron Kirk in the Old Town&#x27;s High Street. Since 1993, it has been officially organised with the focus moved to Princes Street. In 1996, over 300,000 people attended, leading to ticketing of the main street party in later years up to a limit of 100,000 tickets. Hogmanay now covers four days of processions, concerts and fireworks, with the street party beginning on Hogmanay. Alternative tickets are available for entrance into the Princes Street Gardens concert and CÃ¨ilidh, where well-known artists perform and ticket holders can participate in traditional Scottish cÃ¨ilidh dancing. The event attracts thousands of people from all over the world.

====Beltane and other festivals====
On the night of 30 April the Beltane Fire Festival takes place on Calton Hill, involving a procession followed by scenes inspired by pagan old spring fertility celebrations. At the beginning of October each year the Dussehra Hindu Festival is also held on Calton Hill.

===Music, theatre and film===

Outside the Festival season, Edinburgh supports several theatres and production companies. The Royal Lyceum Theatre has its own company, while the King&#x27;s Theatre, Edinburgh Festival Theatre and Edinburgh Playhouse stage large touring shows. The Traverse Theatre presents a more contemporary repertoire. Amateur theatre companies productions are staged at the Bedlam Theatre, Church Hill Theatre and King&#x27;s Theatre among others.

The Usher Hall is Edinburgh&#x27;s premier venue for classical music, as well as occasional popular music concerts. It was the venue for the Eurovision Song Contest 1972. Other halls staging music and theatre include The Hub, the Assembly Rooms and the Queen&#x27;s Hall. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra is based in Edinburgh.

Edinburgh has one repertory cinema, The Cameo, and formerly, the Edinburgh Filmhouse as well as the independent Dominion Cinema and a range of multiplexes.

Large concerts are occasionally staged at Murrayfield Stadium and Meadowbank Stadium, while mid-sized events take place at smaller venues such as O2 Academy Edinburgh. In 2010, PRS for Music listed Edinburgh among the UK&#x27;s top ten &#x27;most musical&#x27; cities. Several city pubs are well known for their live performances of folk music.

Like many other cities in the UK, numerous nightclub venues host Electronic dance music events.

===Media===

The main local newspaper is the &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot;. It is owned and published alongside its sister titles &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; by JPIMedia. Student newspapers include, &quot;The Journal&quot; Scotland wide Universities, and &quot;The Student&quot; University of Edinburgh which was founded in 1887. Community newspapers include &quot;The Spurtle&quot; from Broughton, &quot;Spokes Bulletin&quot;, and &quot;The Edinburgh Reporter&quot;.

The city has many commercial radio stations including Forth 1, a station which broadcasts mainstream chart music, Greatest Hits Edinburgh on DAB which plays classic hits and Edge Radio. Capital Scotland and Heart Scotland also have transmitters covering Edinburgh. Along with the UK national radio stations, BBC Radio Scotland and the Gaelic language service BBC Radio nan GÃ idheal are also broadcast. DAB digital radio is broadcast over two local multiplexes. BFBS Radio broadcasts from studios on the base at Dreghorn Barracks across the city on 98.5FM as part of its UK Bases network. Small scale DAB started October 2022 with numerous community stations on board.

Television, along with most radio services, is broadcast to the city from the Craigkelly transmitting station situated in Fife on the opposite side of the Firth of Forth and the Black Hill transmitting station in North Lanarkshire to the west.

There are no television stations based in the city. Edinburgh Television existed in the late 1990s to early 2003 and STV Edinburgh existed from 2015 to 2018.

===Museums, libraries and galleries===

Edinburgh has many museums and libraries. These include the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland, National War Museum, the Museum of Edinburgh, Surgeons&#x27; Hall Museum, the Writers&#x27; Museum, the Museum of Childhood and Dynamic Earth. The Museum on The Mound has exhibits on money and banking.

Edinburgh Zoo, covering on Corstorphine Hill, is the second most visited paid tourist attraction in Scotland, and was previously home to two giant pandas, Tian Tian and Yang Guang, on loan from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Edinburgh is also home to The Royal Yacht Britannia, decommissioned in 1997 and now a five-star visitor attraction and evening events venue permanently berthed at Ocean Terminal.

Edinburgh contains Scotland&#x27;s three National Galleries of Art as well as numerous smaller art galleries. The national collection is housed in the Scottish National Gallery, located on The Mound, comprising the linked National Gallery of Scotland building and the Royal Scottish Academy building. Contemporary collections are shown in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art which occupies a split site at Belford. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery on Queen Street focuses on portraits and photography.

The council-owned City Art Centre in Market Street mounts regular art exhibitions. Across the road, The Fruitmarket Gallery offers world-class exhibitions of contemporary art, featuring work by British and international artists with both emerging and established international reputations.

The city hosts several of Scotland&#x27;s galleries and organisations dedicated to contemporary visual art. Significant strands of this infrastructure include Creative Scotland, Edinburgh College of Art, Talbot Rice Gallery (University of Edinburgh), Collective Gallery (based at the City Observatory) and the Edinburgh Annuale.

There are also many small private shops/galleries that provide space to showcase works from local artists.

===Shopping===
The locale around Princes Street is the main shopping area in the city centre, with souvenir shops, chain stores such as Boots the Chemist, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, and H&amp;M. George Street, north of Princes Street, has several upmarket shops and independent stores. At the east end of Princes Street, the redeveloped St James Quarter opened its doors in June 2021, while next to the Balmoral Hotel and Waverley Station is Waverley Market. Multrees Walk is a pedestrian shopping district, dominated by the presence of Harvey Nichols, and other names including Louis Vuitton, Mulberry and Michael Kors.

Edinburgh also has substantial retail parks outside the city centre. These include The Gyle Shopping Centre and Hermiston Gait in the west of the city, Cameron Toll Shopping Centre, Straiton Retail Park (actually just outside the city, in Midlothian) and Fort Kinnaird in the south and east, and Ocean Terminal in the north on the Leith waterfront.

==Government and politics==
===Government===
Following local government reorganisation in 1996, the City of Edinburgh Council constitutes one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. Like all other local authorities of Scotland, the council has powers over most matters of local administration such as housing, planning, local transport, parks, economic development and regeneration. The council comprises 63 elected councillors, returned from 17 multi-member electoral wards in the city. Following the 2007 City of Edinburgh Council election the incumbent Labour Party lost majority control of the council after 23 years to a Liberal Democrat/SNP coalition.

After the 2017 election, the SNP and Labour formed a coalition administration, which lasted until the next election in 2022. The 2022 City of Edinburgh Council election resulted in the most politically balanced council in the UK, with 19 SNP, 13 Labour, 12 Liberal Democrat, 10 Green and 9 Conservative councillors. A minority Labour administration was formed, being voted in by Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal Democrat councillors. The SNP and Greens presented a coalition agreement, but could not command majority support in the council. This caused controversy amongst the Scottish Labour Party group for forming an administration supported by Conservatives and led to the suspension of two Labour councillors on the council for abstaining on the vote to approve the new administration. The city&#x27;s coat of arms was registered by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1732.

===Politics=== 

Edinburgh, like all of Scotland, is represented in the Scottish Parliament, situated in the Holyrood area of the city. For electoral purposes, the city is divided into six constituencies which, along with 3 seats outside of the city, form part of the Lothian region. Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional MSPs to produce a result based on a form of proportional representation.

As of the 2021 election, the Scottish National Party have four MSPs: Ash Denham for Edinburgh Eastern, Ben Macpherson for Edinburgh Northern and Leith and Gordon MacDonald for Edinburgh Pentlands and Angus Robertson for Edinburgh Central constituencies. Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats represents Edinburgh Western and Daniel Johnson of the Scottish Labour Party represents Edinburgh Southern constituency. In addition, the city is also represented by seven regional MSPs representing the Lothian electoral region: The Conservatives have three regional MSPs: Jeremy Balfour, Miles Briggs and Sue Webber, Labour have two regional MSPs: Sarah Boyack and Foysol Choudhury; two Scottish Green regional MSPs were elected: Green&#x27;s Co-Leader Lorna Slater and Alison Johnstone. However, following her election as the Presiding Officer of the 6th Session of the Scottish Parliament on 13 May 2021, Alison Johnstone has abided by the established parliamentary convention for speakers and renounced all affiliation with her former political party for the duration of her term as Presiding Officer. So she presently sits as an independent MSP for the Lothians Region.

Edinburgh is also represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by five Members of Parliament. The city is divided into Edinburgh North and Leith, Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, Edinburgh South, Edinburgh South West, and Edinburgh West, each constituency electing one member by the first past the post system. Since the 2024 UK General election, Edinburgh is represented by four Labour MPs (Tracy Gilbert in Edinburgh North and Leith, Chris Murray in Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, Ian Murray in Edinburgh South, and Scott Arthur in Edinburgh South West), and one Liberal Democrat MP in Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine).
==Transport==
===Air===
Edinburgh Airport is Scotland&#x27;s busiest airport and the principal international gateway to the capital, handling over 14.7Â million passengers; it was also the sixth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom by total passengers in 2019. In anticipation of rising passenger numbers, the former operator of the airport BAA outlined a draft masterplan in 2011 to provide for the expansion of the airfield and the terminal building. In June 2012, Global Infrastructure Partners purchased the airport for Â£807 million. The possibility of building a second runway to cope with an increased number of aircraft movements has also been mooted.

===Buses===

Travel in Edinburgh is undertaken predominantly by bus. Lothian Buses, the successor company to Edinburgh Corporation Transport Department, operate the majority of city bus services within the city and to surrounding suburbs, with the most routes running via Princes Street. Services further afield operate from the Edinburgh Bus Station off St Andrew Square and Waterloo Place and are operated mainly by Stagecoach East Scotland, Scottish Citylink, National Express Coaches and Borders Buses.

Lothian Buses and McGill&#x27;s Scotland East operate the city&#x27;s branded public tour buses. The night bus service and airport buses are mainly operated by Lothian Buses link. In 2019, Lothian Buses recorded 124.2 million passenger journeys.

To tackle traffic congestion, Edinburgh is now served by six park &amp; ride sites on the periphery of the city at Sheriffhall (in Midlothian), Ingliston, Riccarton, Inverkeithing (in Fife), Newcraighall and Straiton (in Midlothian). A referendum of Edinburgh residents in February 2005 rejected a proposal to introduce congestion charging in the city.
===Railway===

Edinburgh Waverley is the second-busiest railway station in Scotland, with only Glasgow Central handling more passengers. On the evidence of passenger entries and exits between April 2015 and March 2016, Edinburgh Waverley is the fifth-busiest station outside London; it is also the UK&#x27;s second biggest station in terms of the number of platforms and area size. Waverley is the terminus for most trains arriving from London King&#x27;s Cross and the departure point for many rail services within Scotland operated by ScotRail.

To the west of the city centre lies Haymarket station, which is an important commuter stop. Opened in 2003, Edinburgh Park station serves the Gyle business park in the west of the city and the nearby Gogarburn headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Edinburgh Crossrail route connects Edinburgh Park with Haymarket, Edinburgh Waverley and the suburban stations of Brunstane and Newcraighall in the east of the city. There are also commuter lines to Edinburgh Gateway, South Gyle and Dalmeny, the latter serving South Queensferry by the Forth Bridges, and to Wester Hailes and Curriehill in the south-west of the city.

===Trams===
Edinburgh Trams became operational on 31 May 2014. The city had been without a tram system since Edinburgh Corporation Tramways ceased on 16 November 1956. Following parliamentary approval in 2007, construction began in early 2008. The first stage of the project was expected to be completed by July 2011 but, following delays caused by extra utility work and a long-running contractual dispute between the council and the main contractor, Bilfinger SE, the project was rescheduled. The line opened in 2014 but had been cut short to in length, running from Edinburgh Airport To York Place in the east end of the city.

The line was later extended north onto Leith and Newhaven opening a further eight stops to passengers in June 2023. The York Place stop was replaced by a new island stop at Picardy Place. The original plan would have seen a second line run from Haymarket through Ravelston and Craigleith to Granton Square on the Waterfront Edinburgh.This was shelved in 2011 but is now once again under consideration, as is another line potentially linking the south of the city and the Bioquarter. There were also long-term plans for lines running west from the airport to Ratho and Newbridge and another connecting Granton to Newhaven via Lower Granton Road. Lothian Buses and Edinburgh Trams are both owned and operated by Transport for Edinburgh.

Despite its modern transport links, in January 2021 Edinburgh was named the most congested city in the UK for the fourth year running, though has since fallen to 7th place in 2022
==Education==
===Schools===

There are 18 nursery, 94 primary and 23 secondary schools administered by the City of Edinburgh Council.

The city also has several independent, fee-paying schools including Edinburgh Academy, Fettes College, George Heriot&#x27;s School, George Watson&#x27;s College, Merchiston Castle School, Stewart&#x27;s Melville College and The Mary Erskine School. In 2009, the proportion of pupils attending independent schools was 24.2%, far above the Scottish national average of just over 7% and higher than in any other region of Scotland. In August 2013, the City of Edinburgh Council opened the city&#x27;s first stand-alone Gaelic primary school, Bun-sgoil Taobh na PÃ irce.

===College and university===

There are three universities in Edinburgh: the University of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt University and Edinburgh Napier University.

Established by royal charter in 1583, the University of Edinburgh is one of Scotland&#x27;s ancient universities and is the fourth oldest in the country after St Andrews, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Originally centred on Old College the university expanded to premises on The Mound, the Royal Mile and George Square. Today, the King&#x27;s Buildings in the south of the city contain most of the schools within the College of Science and Engineering. In 2002, the medical school moved to purpose built accommodation adjacent to the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh at Little France. The university is placed 16th in the QS World University Rankings for 2022.

Heriot-Watt University is based at the Riccarton campus in the west of Edinburgh. Originally established in 1821, as the world&#x27;s first mechanics&#x27; institute, it was granted university status by royal charter in 1966. It has other campuses in the Scottish Borders, Orkney, United Arab Emirates and Putrajaya in Malaysia. It takes the name &quot;Heriot-Watt&quot; from Scottish inventor James Watt and Scottish philanthropist and goldsmith George Heriot. Heriot-Watt University has been named International University of the Year by &quot;The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2018&quot;. In the latest Research Excellence Framework, it was ranked overall in the Top 25% of UK universities and 1st in Scotland for research impact.

Edinburgh Napier University was originally founded as the Napier College, which was renamed Napier Polytechnic in 1986 and gained university status in 1992. Edinburgh Napier University has campuses in the south and west of the city, including the former Merchiston Tower and Craiglockhart Hydropathic. It is home to the Screen Academy Scotland.

Queen Margaret University was located in Edinburgh before it moved outside the city boundary to a new campus in the county of East Lothian on the outskirts of Musselburgh in 2008. Until 2012, further education colleges in the city included Jewel and Esk College (incorporating Leith Nautical College founded in 1903), Telford College, opened in 1968, and Stevenson College, opened in 1970. These have now been amalgamated to form Edinburgh College. Scotland&#x27;s Rural College also has a campus in south Edinburgh. Other institutions include the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh which were established by royal charter in 1506 and 1681 respectively. The Trustees&#x27; Academy of Edinburgh, founded in 1760, became the Edinburgh College of Art in 1907.

==Healthcare==
The main NHS Lothian hospitals serving the Edinburgh area are the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which includes the University of Edinburgh Medical School, and the Western General Hospital, which has a large cancer treatment centre and nurse-led Minor Injuries Clinic. The Royal Edinburgh Hospital in Morningside specialises in mental health. The Royal Hospital for Children and Young People, colloquially referred to as &quot;the Sick Kids&quot;, is a specialist paediatrics hospital.

Edinburgh has a long literary tradition, which became especially evident during the Scottish Enlightenment. This heritage and the city&#x27;s lively literary life in the present led to it being declared the first UNESCO City of Literature in 2004. Prominent authors who have lived in Edinburgh include the economist Adam Smith, born in Kirkcaldy and author of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, James Boswell, biographer of Samuel Johnson; Sir Walter Scott, creator of the historical novel and author of works such as &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, and &quot;Heart of Midlothian&quot;; James Hogg, author of &quot;The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot;; Robert Louis Stevenson, creator of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, and &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes; Muriel Spark, author of &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;; Irvine Welsh, author of &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, whose novels are mostly set in the city and often written in colloquial Scots;

Rowling, author of Harry Potter, who wrote much of her first book in Edinburgh coffee shops and now lives in the Cramond area of the city.

Scotland has a rich history of science and engineering, with Edinburgh producing a number of leading figures. John Napier, inventor of logarithms, was born in Merchiston Tower and lived and died in the city. His house now forms part of the original campus of Napier University which was named in his honour. He lies buried under St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Church. James Clerk Maxwell, founder of the modern theory of electromagnetism, was born at 14 India Street (now the home of the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation) and educated at the Edinburgh Academy and the University of Edinburgh, as was the engineer and telephone pioneer Alexander Graham Bell. James Braidwood, who organised Britain&#x27;s first municipal fire brigade, was also born in the city and began his career there.

Other names connected with the city include physicist Max Born, a principle founder of Quantum mechanics and Nobel laureate; Charles Darwin, the biologist who propounded the theory of natural selection; David Hume, philosopher, economist and historian; James Hutton, regarded as the &quot;Father of Geology&quot;; Joseph Black, the chemist who discovered magnesium and carbon dioxide, and one of the founders of Thermodynamics; pioneering medical researchers Joseph Lister and James Young Simpson; chemist and discoverer of the element nitrogen Daniel Rutherford; Colin Maclaurin, mathematician and developer of the Maclaurin series, and Ian Wilmut, the geneticist involved in the cloning of Dolly the sheep just outside Edinburgh, at the Roslin Institute. The stuffed carcass of Dolly the sheep is now on display in the National Museum of Scotland. The latest in a long line of science celebrities associated with the city is theoretical physicist, Nobel laureate and professor emeritus at the University of Edinburgh Peter Higgs, born in Newcastle but resident in Edinburgh for most of his academic career, after whom the Higgs boson particle has been named.

Edinburgh has been the birthplace of actors like Alastair Sim and Sir Sean Connery, known for being the first cinematic James Bond, the comedian and actor Ronnie Corbett, best known as one of The Two Ronnies, and the impressionist Rory Bremner. Famous artists from the city include the portrait painters Sir Henry Raeburn, Sir David Wilkie and Allan Ramsay.

Notorious criminals from Edinburgh&#x27;s past include Deacon Brodie, head of a trades guild and Edinburgh city councillor by day but a burglar by night, who is said to have been the inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s story, the &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, and murderers Burke and Hare who delivered fresh corpses for dissection to the famous anatomist Robert Knox.

Another well-known Edinburgh resident was Greyfriars Bobby. The small Skye Terrier reputedly kept vigil over his dead master&#x27;s grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard for 14 years in the 1860s and 1870s, giving rise to a story of canine devotion which plays a part in attracting visitors to the city.

==International relations==
===Twin towns and sister cities===

The City of Edinburgh has entered into 14 international twinning arrangements since 1954. Most of the arrangements are styled as &quot;Twin Cities&quot; but the agreement with KrakÃ³w is designated as a &quot;Partner City&quot;, and the agreement with Kyoto Prefecture is officially styled as a &quot;Friendship Link&quot;, reflecting its status as the only region to be twinned with Edinburgh.

In June 2024, the City of Edinburgh Council shelved plans for a friendship arrangement with Kaohsiung, Taiwan, after a report raised concerned the agreement could heighten cyber attacks. A few weeks before the decision, the Chinese consul general met with Scottish government minister Angus Robertson to protest the potential agreement. In a letter to the city council, the Chinese representative said signing a sister city agreement &quot;will hurt the feeling of the Chinese people and bring about serious consequences to â¦ bilateral relations&quot;.

<text>Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson (30 August 1871Â â 19 October 1937) was a New Zealand physicist who was a pioneering researcher in both atomic and nuclear physics. He has been described as &quot;the father of nuclear physics&quot;, and &quot;the greatest experimentalist since Michael Faraday&quot;. In 1908, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances.&quot; He was the first Oceanian Nobel laureate, and the first to perform the awarded work in Canada.

Rutherford&#x27;s discoveries include the concept of radioactive half-life, the radioactive element radon, and the differentiation and naming of alpha and beta radiation. Together with Thomas Royds, Rutherford is credited with proving that alpha radiation is composed of helium nuclei. In 1911, he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus. He arrived at this theory through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering during the gold foil experiment performed by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. In 1912 he invited Niels Bohr to join his lab, leading to the Bohr-Rutherford model of the atom. In 1917, he performed the first artificially induced nuclear reaction by conducting experiments in which nitrogen nuclei were bombarded with alpha particles. These experiments led him to discover the emission of a subatomic particle that he initially called the &quot;hydrogen atom&quot;, but later (more precisely) renamed the proton. He is also credited with developing the atomic numbering system alongside Henry Moseley. His other achievements include advancing the fields of radio communications and ultrasound technology.

Rutherford became Director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in 1919. Under his leadership, the neutron was discovered by James Chadwick in 1932. In the same year, the first controlled experiment to split the nucleus was performed by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, working under his direction. In honour of his scientific advancements, Rutherford was recognised as a baron of the United Kingdom. After his death in 1937, he was buried in Westminster Abbey near Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton. The chemical element rutherfordium (104Rf) was named after him in 1997.

== Early life and education ==
Ernest Rutherford was born on 30 August 1871 in Brightwater, a town near Nelson, New Zealand. He was the fourth of twelve children of James Rutherford, an immigrant farmer and mechanic from Perth, Scotland, and his wife Martha Thompson, a schoolteacher from Hornchurch, England. Rutherford&#x27;s birth certificate was mistakenly written as &#x27;Earnest&#x27;. He was known by his family as Ern. 

When Rutherford was five he moved to Foxhill, New Zealand, and attended Foxhill School. At age 11 in 1883, the Rutherford family moved to Havelock, a town in the Marlborough Sounds. The move was made to be closer to the flax mill Rutherford&#x27;s father developed. Ernest studied at Havelock School.

In 1887, on his second attempt, he won a scholarship to study at Nelson College. On his first examination attempt, he had the highest mark of anyone from Nelson. When he was awarded the scholarship, he had received 580 out of 600 possible marks. After being awarded the scholarship, Havelock School presented him with a five-volume set of books titled &quot;The Peoples of the World&quot;. He studied at Nelson College between 1887 and 1889, and was head boy in 1889. He also played in the school&#x27;s rugby team. He was offered a cadetship in government service, but he declined as he still had 15 months of college remaining.

In 1889, after his second attempt, he won a scholarship to study at Canterbury College, University of New Zealand, between 1890 and 1894. He participated in its debating society and the Science Society. At Canterbury, he was awarded a complex BA in Latin, English, and Maths in 1892, a MA in Mathematics and Physical Science in 1893, and a BSc in Chemistry and Geology in 1894.

Thereafter, he invented a new form of radio receiver, and in 1895 Rutherford was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, to travel to England for postgraduate study at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. In 1897, he was awarded a BA Research Degree and the Coutts-Trotter Studentship from Trinity College, Cambridge.

== Scientific career ==
When Rutherford began his studies at Cambridge, he was among the first &#x27;aliens&#x27; (those without a Cambridge degree) allowed to do research at the university, and was additionally honoured to study under J. J. Thomson.

With Thomson&#x27;s encouragement, Rutherford detected radio waves at , and briefly held the world record for the distance over which electromagnetic waves could be detected, although when he presented his results at the British Association meeting in 1896, he discovered he had been outdone by Guglielmo Marconi, whose radio waves had sent a message across nearly .

=== Work with radioactivity ===
Again under Thomson&#x27;s leadership, Rutherford worked on the conductive effects of X-rays on gases, which led to the discovery of the electron, the results first presented by Thomson in 1897. Hearing of Henri Becquerel&#x27;s experience with uranium, Rutherford started to explore its radioactivity, discovering two types that differed from X-rays in their penetrating power. Continuing his research in Canada, in 1899 he coined the terms &quot;alpha ray&quot; and &quot;beta ray&quot; to describe these two distinct types of radiation.

In 1898, Rutherford was accepted to the chair of Macdonald Professor of physics position at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, on Thomson&#x27;s recommendation. From 1900 to 1903, he was joined at McGill by the young chemist Frederick Soddy (Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1921) for whom he set the problem of identifying the noble gas emitted by the radioactive element thorium, a substance which was itself radioactive and would coat other substances. Once he had eliminated all the normal chemical reactions, Soddy suggested that it must be one of the inert gases, which they named thoron. This substance was later found to be 220Rn, an isotope of radon. They also found another substance they called Thorium X, later identified as 224Rn, and continued to find traces of helium. They also worked with samples of &quot;Uranium X&quot; (protactinium), from William Crookes, and radium, from Marie Curie. Rutherford further investigated thoron in conjunction with R.B. Owens and found that a sample of radioactive material of any size invariably took the same amount of time for half the sample to decay (in this case, 11 minutes), a phenomenon for which he coined the term &quot;half-life&quot;. Rutherford and Soddy published their paper &quot;Law of Radioactive Change&quot; to account for all their experiments. Until then, atoms were assumed to be the indestructible basis of all matter; and although Curie had suggested that radioactivity was an atomic phenomenon, the idea of the atoms of radioactive substances breaking up was a radically new idea. Rutherford and Soddy demonstrated that radioactivity involved the spontaneous disintegration of atoms into other, as yet, unidentified matter.

In 1903, Rutherford considered a type of radiation, discovered (but not named) by French chemist Paul Villard in 1900, as an emission from radium, and realised that this observation must represent something different from his own alpha and beta rays, due to its very much greater penetrating power. Rutherford therefore gave this third type of radiation the name of gamma ray. All three of Rutherford&#x27;s terms are in standard use today â other types of radioactive decay have since been discovered, but Rutherford&#x27;s three types are among the most common. In 1904, Rutherford suggested that radioactivity provides a source of energy sufficient to explain the existence of the Sun for the many millions of years required for the slow biological evolution on Earth proposed by biologists such as Charles Darwin. The physicist Lord Kelvin had argued earlier for a much younger Earth, based on the insufficiency of known energy sources, but Rutherford pointed out, at a lecture attended by Kelvin, that radioactivity could solve this problem. Later that year, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society, and in 1907 he returned to Britain to take the chair of physics at the Victoria University of Manchester.

In Manchester, Rutherford continued his work with alpha radiation. In conjunction with Hans Geiger, he developed zinc sulfide scintillation screens and ionisation chambers to count alpha particles. By dividing the total charge accumulated on the screen by the number counted, Rutherford determined that the charge on the alpha particle was two. In late 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds allowed alphas to penetrate a very thin window into an evacuated tube. As they sparked the tube into discharge, the spectrum obtained from it changed, as the alphas accumulated in the tube. Eventually, the clear spectrum of helium gas appeared, proving that alphas were at least ionised helium atoms, and probably helium nuclei. 
In 1910 Rutherford, with Geiger and mathematician Harry Bateman published
their classic paper describing the first analysis of the distribution in time of radioactive emission, a distribution now called the Poisson distribution.

Ernest Rutherford was awarded the 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances&quot;.

=== Model of the atom ===

Rutherford continued to make ground-breaking discoveries long after receiving the Nobel prize in 1908. Under his direction in 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden performed the GeigerâMarsden experiment, which demonstrated the nuclear nature of atoms by measuring the deflection of alpha particles passing through a thin gold foil. Rutherford was inspired to ask Geiger and Marsden in this experiment to look for alpha particles with very high deflection angles, which was not expected according to any theory of matter at that time. Such deflection angles, although rare, were found. Reflecting on these results in one of his last lectures, Rutherford was quoted as saying: &quot;It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.&quot; It was Rutherford&#x27;s interpretation of this data that led him to propose the nucleus, a very small, charged region containing much of the atom&#x27;s mass.

In 1912, Rutherford was joined by Niels Bohr (who postulated that electrons moved in specific orbits about the compact nucleus). Bohr adapted Rutherford&#x27;s nuclear structure to be consistent with Max Planck&#x27;s quantum hypothesis. The resulting RutherfordâBohr model was the basis for quantum mechanical atomic physics of Heisenberg which remains valid today.

=== Piezoelectricity ===
During World War I, Rutherford worked on a top-secret project to solve the practical problems of submarine detection. Both Rutherford and Paul Langevin suggested the use of piezoelectricity, and Rutherford successfully developed a device which measured its output. The use of piezoelectricity then became essential to the development of ultrasound as it is known today. The claim that Rutherford developed sonar, however, is a misconception, as subaquatic detection technologies utilise Langevin&#x27;s transducer.

=== Discovery of the proton ===
Together with H.G. Moseley, Rutherford developed the atomic numbering system in 1913. Rutherford and Moseley&#x27;s experiments used cathode rays to bombard various elements with streams of electrons and observed that each element responded in a consistent and distinct manner. Their research was the first to assert that each element could be defined by the properties of its inner structures â an observation that later led to the discovery of the atomic nucleus. This research led Rutherford to theorize that the hydrogen atom (at the time the least massive entity known to bear a positive charge) was a sort of &quot;positive electron&quot; â a component of every atomic element.

It was not until 1919 that Rutherford expanded upon his theory of the &quot;positive electron&quot; with a series of experiments beginning shortly before the end of his time at Manchester. He found that nitrogen, and other light elements, ejected a proton, which he called a &quot;hydrogen atom&quot;, when hit with Î± (alpha) particles. In particular, he showed that particles ejected by alpha particles colliding with hydrogen have unit charge and 1/4 the momentum of alpha particles.

Rutherford returned to the Cavendish Laboratory in 1919, succeeding J. J. Thomson as the Cavendish professor and the laboratory&#x27;s director, posts that he held until his death in 1937. During his tenure, Nobel prizes were awarded to James Chadwick for discovering the neutron (in 1932), John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton for an experiment that was to be known as &quot;splitting the atom&quot; using a particle accelerator, and Edward Appleton for demonstrating the existence of the ionosphere.

=== Development of proton and neutron theory ===
In 1919â1920, Rutherford continued his research on the &quot;hydrogen atom&quot; to confirm that alpha particles break down nitrogen nuclei and to affirm the nature of the products. This result showed Rutherford that hydrogen nuclei were a part of nitrogen nuclei (and by inference, probably other nuclei as well). Such a construction had been suspected for many years, on the basis of atomic weights that were integral multiples of that of hydrogen; see Prout&#x27;s hypothesis. Hydrogen was known to be the lightest element, and its nuclei presumably the lightest nuclei. Now, because of all these considerations, Rutherford decided that a hydrogen nucleus was possibly a fundamental building block of all nuclei, and also possibly a new fundamental particle as well, since nothing was known to be lighter than that nucleus. Thus, confirming and extending the work of Wilhelm Wien, who in 1898 discovered the proton in streams of ionized gas, in 1920 Rutherford postulated the hydrogen nucleus to be a new particle, which he dubbed the &quot;proton&quot;.

In 1921, while working with Niels Bohr, Rutherford theorized about the existence of neutrons, (which he had christened in his 1920 Bakerian Lecture), which could somehow compensate for the repelling effect of the positive charges of protons by causing an attractive nuclear force and thus keep the nuclei from flying apart, due to the repulsion between protons. The only alternative to neutrons was the existence of &quot;nuclear electrons&quot;, which would counteract some of the proton charges in the nucleus, since by then it was known that nuclei had about twice the mass that could be accounted for if they were simply assembled from hydrogen nuclei (protons). But how these nuclear electrons could be trapped in the nucleus, was a mystery.

In 1932, Rutherford&#x27;s theory of neutrons was proved by his associate James Chadwick, who recognised neutrons immediately when they were produced by other scientists and later himself, in bombarding beryllium with alpha particles. In 1935, Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.

=== Induced nuclear reaction and probing the nucleus ===
In Rutherford&#x27;s four-part article on the &quot;Collision of Î±-particles with light atoms&quot; he reported two additional fundamental and far reaching discoveries. First, he showed that at high angles the scattering of alpha particles from hydrogen differed from the theoretical results he himself published in 1911. These were the first results to probe the interactions that hold a nucleus together. Second, he showed that Î±-particles colliding with nitrogen nuclei would react rather than simply bounce off. One product of the reaction was the proton; the other product was shown by Patrick Blackett, Rutherford&#x27;s colleague and former student, to be oxygen:
:14N + Î± â 17O + p. 
Rutherford therefore recognised &quot;that the nucleus may increase rather than diminish in mass as the result of collisions in which the proton is expelled&quot;.
Blackett was awarded the Nobel prize in 1948 for his work in perfecting the high-speed cloud chamber apparatus used to make that discovery and many others.

=== Later years and honours ===
Rutherford received significant recognition in his home country of New Zealand. In 1901, he earned a DSc from the University of New Zealand. In 1916, he was awarded the Hector Memorial Medal. In 1925, Rutherford called for the New Zealand Government to support education and research, which led to the formation of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) in the following year. In 1933, Rutherford was one of the two inaugural recipients of the T. K. Sidey Medal, which was established by the Royal Society of New Zealand as an award for outstanding scientific research.

Additionally, Rutherford received a number of awards from the British Crown. He was knighted in 1914. He was appointed to the Order of Merit in the 1925 New Year Honours. Between 1925 and 1930, he served as President of the Royal Society, and later as president of the Academic Assistance Council which helped almost 1,000 university refugees from Germany. In 1931 was raised to Baron of the United Kingdom under the title Baron Rutherford of Nelson, decorating his coat of arms with a kiwi and a MÄori warrior. The title became extinct upon his unexpected death in 1937.

Since 1992 his portrait appears on the New Zealand one hundred-dollar note.

== Personal life and death ==
Around 1888 Rutherford made his grandmother a wooden potato masher which is now in the collection of the Royal Society.

In 1900, at St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church, Papanui in Christchurch, Rutherford married Mary Georgina Newton (1876â1954), to whom he had been engaged before leaving New Zealand. They had one daughter, Eileen Mary (1901â1930); she married the physicist Ralph Fowler, and died during the birth of her fourth child. Rutherford&#x27;s hobbies included golf and motoring.

For some time before his death, Rutherford had a small hernia, which he neglected to have repaired, and it eventually became strangulated, rendering him violently ill. He had an emergency operation in London, but died in Cambridge four days later, on 19 October 1937, at age 66, of what physicians termed &quot;intestinal paralysis&quot;. After cremation at Golders Green Crematorium, he was given the high honour of burial in Westminster Abbey, near Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, and other illustrious British scientists.

== Legacy ==
At the opening session of the 1938 Indian Science Congress, which Rutherford had been expected to preside over before his death, astrophysicist James Jeans spoke in his place and deemed him &quot;one of the greatest scientists of all time&quot;, saying:

Rutherford is known as &quot;the father of nuclear physics&quot; because his research, and work done under him as laboratory director, established the nuclear structure of the atom and the essential nature of radioactive decay as a nuclear process. Patrick Blackett, a research fellow working under Rutherford, using natural alpha particles, demonstrated &quot;induced&quot; nuclear transmutation. Later, Rutherford&#x27;s team, using protons from an accelerator, demonstrated &quot;artificially-induced&quot; nuclear reactions and transmutation.

Rutherford died too early to see LeÃ³ SzilÃ¡rd&#x27;s idea of controlled nuclear chain reactions come into being. However, a speech of Rutherford&#x27;s about his artificially-induced transmutation in lithium, printed in the 12 September 1933 issue of &quot;The Times&quot;, was reported by SzilÃ¡rd to have been his inspiration for thinking of the possibility of a controlled energy-producing nuclear chain reaction.

Rutherford&#x27;s speech touched on the 1932 work of his students John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton in &quot;splitting&quot; lithium into alpha particles by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. Rutherford realised that the energy released from the split lithium atoms was enormous, but he also realised that the energy needed for the accelerator, and its essential inefficiency in splitting atoms in this fashion, made the project an impossibility as a practical source of energy (accelerator-induced fission of light elements remains too inefficient to be used in this way, even today). Rutherford&#x27;s speech in part, read:

The element rutherfordium, Rf, Z=104, was named in honour of Rutherford in 1997.

==In popular culture==
Andrew Hodwitz portrays Rutherford in episode 11 of season 13 &quot;Staring Blindly into the Future&quot; (January 13, 2020) of the Canadian television period detective series Murdoch Mysteries.

<text>The many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts that the universal wavefunction is objectively real, and that there is no wave function collapse. This implies that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are physically realized in different &quot;worlds&quot;. The evolution of reality as a whole in MWI is rigidly deterministic and local. Many-worlds is also called the relative state formulation or the Everett interpretation, after physicist Hugh Everett, who first proposed it in 1957. Bryce DeWitt popularized the formulation and named it &quot;many-worlds&quot; in the 1970s.

In modern versions of many-worlds, the subjective appearance of wave function collapse is explained by the mechanism of quantum decoherence. Decoherence approaches to interpreting quantum theory have been widely explored and developed since the 1970s. MWI is considered a mainstream interpretation of quantum mechanics, along with the other decoherence interpretations, the Copenhagen interpretation, and hidden variable theories such as Bohmian mechanics.

The many-worlds interpretation implies that there are many parallel, non-interacting worlds. It is one of a number of multiverse hypotheses in physics and philosophy. MWI views time as a many-branched tree, wherein every possible quantum outcome is realized. This is intended to resolve the measurement problem and thus some paradoxes of quantum theory, such as Wigner&#x27;s friend, the EPR paradox and SchrÃ¶dinger&#x27;s cat, since every possible outcome of a quantum event exists in its own world.

==Overview of the interpretation==
The many-worlds interpretation&#x27;s key idea is that the linear and unitary dynamics of quantum mechanics applies everywhere and at all times and so describes the whole universe. In particular, it models a measurement as a unitary transformation, a correlation-inducing interaction, between observer and object, without using a collapse postulate, and models observers as ordinary quantum-mechanical systems. This stands in contrast to the Copenhagen interpretation, in which a measurement is a &quot;primitive&quot; concept, not describable by unitary quantum mechanics; using the Copenhagen interpretation the universe is divided into a quantum and a classical domain, and the collapse postulate is central. In MWI there is no division between classical and quantum: everything is quantum and there is no collapse. MWI&#x27;s main conclusion is that the universe (or multiverse in this context) is composed of a quantum superposition of an uncountable or undefinable amount or number of increasingly divergent, non-communicating parallel universes or quantum worlds. Sometimes dubbed Everett worlds, each is an internally consistent and actualized alternative history or timeline.

The many-worlds interpretation uses decoherence to explain the measurement process and the emergence of a quasi-classical world. Wojciech H. Zurek, one of decoherence theory&#x27;s pioneers, said: &quot;Under scrutiny of the environment, only pointer states remain unchanged. Other states decohere into mixtures of stable pointer states that can persist, and, in this sense, exist: They are einselected.&quot; Zurek emphasizes that his work does not depend on a particular interpretation.

The many-worlds interpretation shares many similarities with the decoherent histories interpretation, which also uses decoherence to explain the process of measurement or wave function collapse. MWI treats the other histories or worlds as real, since it regards the universal wave function as the &quot;basic physical entity&quot; or &quot;the fundamental entity, obeying at all times a deterministic wave equation&quot;. The decoherent histories interpretation, on the other hand, needs only one of the histories (or worlds) to be real.

Several authors, including Everett, John Archibald Wheeler and David Deutsch, call many-worlds a theory or metatheory, rather than just an interpretation. Everett argued that it was the &quot;only completely coherent approach to explaining both the contents of quantum mechanics and the appearance of the world.&quot; Deutsch dismissed the idea that many-worlds is an &quot;interpretation&quot;, saying that to call it an interpretation &quot;is like talking about dinosaurs as an &#x27;interpretation&#x27; of fossil records.&quot;

===Formulation===
In his 1957 doctoral dissertation, Everett proposed that, rather than relying on external observation for analysis of isolated quantum systems, one could mathematically model an object, as well as its observers, as purely physical systems within the mathematical framework developed by Paul Dirac, John von Neumann, and others, discarding altogether the &quot;ad hoc&quot; mechanism of wave function collapse.

===Relative state===
Everett&#x27;s original work introduced the concept of a &quot;relative state&quot;. Two (or more) subsystems, after a general interaction, become &quot;correlated&quot;, or as is now said, entangled. Everett noted that such entangled systems can be expressed as the sum of products of states, where the two or more subsystems are each in a state relative to each other. After a measurement or observation one of the pair (or triple...) is the measured, object or observed system, and one other member is the measuring apparatus (which may include an observer) having recorded the state of the measured system. Each product of subsystem states in the overall superposition evolves over time independently of other products. Once the subsystems interact, their states have become correlated or entangled and can no longer be considered independent. In Everett&#x27;s terminology, each subsystem state was now &quot;correlated&quot; with its &quot;relative state&quot;, since each subsystem must now be considered relative to the other subsystems with which it has interacted.

In the example of SchrÃ¶dinger&#x27;s cat, after the box is opened, the entangled system is the cat, the poison vial and the observer. &quot;One&quot; relative triple of states would be the alive cat, the unbroken vial and the observer seeing an alive cat. &quot;Another&quot; relative triple of states would be the dead cat, the broken vial and the observer seeing a dead cat.

In the example of a measurement of a continuous variable (e.g., position &quot;q&quot;) the object-observer system decomposes into a continuum of pairs of relative states: the object system&#x27;s relative state becomes a Dirac delta function each centered on a particular value of &quot;q&quot; and the corresponding observer relative state representing an observer having recorded the value of &quot;q&quot;. The states of the pairs of relative states are, post measurement, &quot;correlated&quot; with each other.

In Everett&#x27;s scheme, there is no collapse; instead, the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, or its quantum field theory, relativistic analog, holds all the time, everywhere. An observation or measurement is modeled by applying the wave equation to the entire system, comprising the object being observed &quot;and&quot; the observer. One consequence is that every observation causes the combined observerâobject&#x27;s wavefunction to change into a quantum superposition of two or more non-interacting branches.

Thus the process of measurement or observation, or any correlation-inducing interaction, splits the system into sets of relative states, where each set of relative states, forming a branch of the universal wave function, is consistent within itself, and all future measurements (including by multiple observers) will confirm this consistency.

=== Renamed many-worlds ===
Everett had referred to the combined observerâobject system as split by an observation, each split corresponding to the different or multiple possible outcomes of an observation. These splits generate a branching tree, where each branch is a set of all the states relative to each other. Bryce DeWitt popularized Everett&#x27;s work with a series of publications calling it the Many Worlds Interpretation. Focusing on the splitting process, DeWitt introduced the term &quot;world&quot; to describe a single branch of that tree, which is a consistent history. All observations or measurements within any branch are consistent within themselves.

Since many observation-like events have happened and are constantly happening, Everett&#x27;s model implies that there are an enormous and growing number of simultaneously existing states or &quot;worlds&quot;.

===Properties===

MWI removes the observer-dependent role in the quantum measurement process by replacing wave function collapse with the established mechanism of quantum decoherence. As the observer&#x27;s role lies at the heart of all &quot;quantum paradoxes&quot; such as the EPR paradox and von Neumann&#x27;s &quot;boundary problem&quot;, this provides a clearer and easier approach to their resolution.

Since the Copenhagen interpretation requires the existence of a classical domain beyond the one described by quantum mechanics, it has been criticized as inadequate for the study of cosmology. While there is no evidence that Everett was inspired by issues of cosmology, he developed his theory with the explicit goal of allowing quantum mechanics to be applied to the universe as a whole, hoping to stimulate the discovery of new phenomena. This hope has been realized in the later development of quantum cosmology.

MWI is a realist, deterministic and local theory. It achieves this by removing wave function collapse, which is indeterministic and nonlocal, from the deterministic and local equations of quantum theory.

MWI (like other, broader multiverse theories) provides a context for the anthropic principle, which may provide an explanation for the fine-tuned universe.

MWI depends crucially on the linearity of quantum mechanics, which underpins the superposition principle. If the final theory of everything is non-linear with respect to wavefunctions, then many-worlds is invalid. All quantum field theories are linear and compatible with the MWI, a point Everett emphasized as a motivation for the MWI. While quantum gravity or string theory may be non-linear in this respect, there is as yet no evidence of this.

===Alternative to wavefunction collapse===
As with the other interpretations of quantum mechanics, the many-worlds interpretation is motivated by behavior that can be illustrated by the double-slit experiment. When particles of light (or anything else) pass through the double slit, a calculation assuming wavelike behavior of light can be used to identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.

Some versions of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed a process of &quot;collapse&quot; in which an indeterminate quantum system would probabilistically collapse onto, or select, just one determinate outcome to &quot;explain&quot; this phenomenon of observation. Wave function collapse was widely regarded as artificial and &quot;ad hoc&quot;, so an alternative interpretation in which the behavior of measurement could be understood from more fundamental physical principles was considered desirable.

Everett&#x27;s PhD work provided such an interpretation. He argued that for a composite systemâsuch as a subject (the &quot;observer&quot; or measuring apparatus) observing an object (the &quot;observed&quot; system, such as a particle)âthe claim that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become entangled: we can only specify the state of one &quot;relative&quot; to the other, i.e., the state of the observer and the observed are correlated &quot;after&quot; the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wave function collapse) the notion of a &quot;relativity of states&quot;.

Everett noticed that the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone entailed that after an observation is made each element of the quantum superposition of the combined subjectâobject wave function contains two &quot;relative states&quot;: a &quot;collapsed&quot; object state and an associated observer who has observed the same collapsed outcome; what the observer sees and the state of the object have become correlated by the act of measurement or observation. The subsequent evolution of each pair of relative subjectâobject states proceeds with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other elements, &quot;as if&quot; wave function collapse has occurred, which has the consequence that later observations are always consistent with the earlier observations. Thus the &quot;appearance&quot; of the object&#x27;s wave function&#x27;s collapse has emerged from the unitary, deterministic theory itself. (This answered Einstein&#x27;s early criticism of quantum theory: that the theory should define what is observed, not for the observables to define the theory.) Since the wave function &quot;appears&quot; to have collapsed then, Everett reasoned, there was no need to actually assume that it &quot;had&quot; collapsed. And so, invoking Occam&#x27;s razor, he removed the postulate of wave function collapse from the theory.

===Testability===

In 1985, David Deutsch proposed a variant of the Wigner&#x27;s friend thought experiment as a test of many-worlds versus the Copenhagen interpretation. It consists of an experimenter (Wigner&#x27;s friend) making a measurement on a quantum system in an isolated laboratory, and another experimenter (Wigner) who would make a measurement on the first one. According to the many-worlds theory, the first experimenter would end up in a macroscopic superposition of seeing one result of the measurement in one branch, and another result in another branch. The second experimenter could then interfere these two branches in order to test whether it is in fact in a macroscopic superposition or has collapsed into a single branch, as predicted by the Copenhagen interpretation. Since then Lockwood, Vaidman, and others have made similar proposals, which require placing macroscopic objects in a coherent superposition and interfering them, a task currently beyond experimental capability.

==Probability and the Born rule==

Since the many-worlds interpretation&#x27;s inception, physicists have been puzzled about the role of probability in it. As put by Wallace, there are two facets to the question: the &quot;incoherence problem&quot;, which asks why we should assign probabilities at all to outcomes that are certain to occur in some worlds, and the &quot;quantitative problem&quot;, which asks why the probabilities should be given by the Born rule.

Everett tried to answer these questions in the paper that introduced many-worlds. To address the incoherence problem, he argued that an observer who makes a sequence of measurements on a quantum system will in general have an apparently random sequence of results in their memory, which justifies the use of probabilities to describe the measurement process. To address the quantitative problem, Everett proposed a derivation of the Born rule based on the properties that a measure on the branches of the wave function should have. His derivation has been criticized as relying on unmotivated assumptions. Since then several other derivations of the Born rule in the many-worlds framework have been proposed. There is no consensus on whether this has been successful.

===Frequentism===

DeWitt and Graham and Farhi et al., among others, have proposed derivations of the Born rule based on a frequentist interpretation of probability. They try to show that in the limit of uncountably many measurements, no worlds would have relative frequencies that didn&#x27;t match the probabilities given by the Born rule, but these derivations have been shown to be mathematically incorrect.

===Decision theory===
A decision-theoretic derivation of the Born rule was produced by David Deutsch (1999) and refined by Wallace and Saunders. They consider an agent who takes part in a quantum gamble: the agent makes a measurement on a quantum system, branches as a consequence, and each of the agent&#x27;s future selves receives a reward that depends on the measurement result. The agent uses decision theory to evaluate the price they would pay to take part in such a gamble, and concludes that the price is given by the utility of the rewards weighted according to the Born rule. Some reviews have been positive, although these arguments remain highly controversial; some theoretical physicists have taken them as supporting the case for parallel universes. For example, a &quot;New Scientist&quot; story on a 2007 conference about Everettian interpretations quoted physicist Andy Albrecht as saying, &quot;This work will go down as one of the most important developments in the history of science.&quot; In contrast, the philosopher Huw Price, also attending the conference, found the DeutschâWallaceâSaunders approach fundamentally flawed.

===Symmetries and invariance===
In 2005, Zurek produced a derivation of the Born rule based on the symmetries of entangled states; Schlosshauer and Fine argue that Zurek&#x27;s derivation is not rigorous, as it does not define what probability is and has several unstated assumptions about how it should behave.

In 2016, Charles Sebens and Sean M. Carroll, building on work by Lev Vaidman, proposed a similar approach based on self-locating uncertainty. In this approach, decoherence creates multiple identical copies of observers, who can assign credences to being on different branches using the Born rule. The SebensâCarroll approach has been criticized by Adrian Kent, and Vaidman does not find it satisfactory.

===Branch counting===
In 2021, Simon Saunders produced a branch counting derivation of the Born rule. The crucial feature of this approach is to define the branches so that they all have the same magnitude or 2-norm. The ratios of the numbers of branches thus defined give the probabilities of the various outcomes of a measurement, in accordance with the Born rule.

==The preferred basis problem==

As originally formulated by Everett and DeWitt, the many-worlds interpretation had a privileged role for measurements: they determined which basis of a quantum system would give rise to the eponymous worlds. Without this the theory was ambiguous, as a quantum state can equally well be described (e.g.) as having a well-defined position or as being a superposition of two delocalized states. The assumption is that the preferred basis to use is the one which assigns a unique measurement outcome to each world. This special role for measurements is problematic for the theory, as it contradicts Everett and DeWitt&#x27;s goal of having a reductionist theory and undermines their criticism of the ill-defined measurement postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation. This is known today as the &quot;preferred basis problem&quot;.

The preferred basis problem has been solved, according to Saunders and Wallace, among others, by incorporating decoherence into the many-worlds theory. In this approach, the preferred basis does not have to be postulated, but rather is identified as the basis stable under environmental decoherence. In this way measurements no longer play a special role; rather, any interaction that causes decoherence causes the world to split. Since decoherence is never complete, there will always remain some infinitesimal overlap between two worlds, making it arbitrary whether a pair of worlds has split or not. Wallace argues that this is not problematic: it only shows that worlds are not a part of the fundamental ontology, but rather of the &quot;emergent&quot; ontology, where these approximate, effective descriptions are routine in the physical sciences. Since in this approach the worlds are derived, it follows that they must be present in any other interpretation of quantum mechanics that does not have a collapse mechanism, such as Bohmian mechanics.

This approach to deriving the preferred basis has been criticized as creating circularity with derivations of probability in the many-worlds interpretation, as decoherence theory depends on probability and probability depends on the ontology derived from decoherence. Wallace contends that decoherence theory depends not on probability but only on the notion that one is allowed to do approximations in physics.

==History==
MWI originated in Everett&#x27;s Princeton University PhD thesis &quot;The Theory of the Universal Wave Function&quot;, developed under his thesis advisor John Archibald Wheeler, a shorter summary of which was published in 1957 under the title &quot;Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics&quot; (Wheeler contributed the title &quot;relative state&quot;; Everett originally called his approach the &quot;Correlation Interpretation&quot;, where &quot;correlation&quot; refers to quantum entanglement). The phrase &quot;many-worlds&quot; is due to Bryce DeWitt, who was responsible for the wider popularization of Everett&#x27;s theory, which had been largely ignored for a decade after publication in 1957.

Everett&#x27;s proposal was not without precedent. In 1952, Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger gave a lecture in Dublin in which at one point he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might &quot;seem lunatic&quot;. He went on to assert that while the SchrÃ¶dinger equation seemed to be describing several different histories, they were &quot;not alternatives but all really happen simultaneously&quot;. According to David Deutsch, this is the earliest known reference to many-worlds; Jeffrey A. Barrett describes it as indicating the similarity of &quot;general views&quot; between Everett and SchrÃ¶dinger. SchrÃ¶dinger&#x27;s writings from the period also contain elements resembling the modal interpretation originated by Bas van Fraassen. Because SchrÃ¶dinger subscribed to a kind of post-Machian neutral monism, in which &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; are only different aspects or arrangements of the same common elements, treating the wave function as physical and treating it as information became interchangeable.

Leon Cooper and Deborah Van Vechten developed a very similar approach before reading Everett&#x27;s work. Zeh also came to the same conclusions as Everett before reading his work, then built a new theory of quantum decoherence based on these ideas.

According to people who knew him, Everett believed in the literal reality of the other quantum worlds. His son and wife reported that he &quot;never wavered in his belief over his many-worlds theory&quot;. In their detailed review of Everett&#x27;s work, Osnaghi, Freitas, and Freire Jr. note that Everett consistently used quotes around &quot;real&quot; to indicate a meaning within scientific practice.

==Reception==

MWI&#x27;s initial reception was overwhelmingly negative, in the sense that it was ignored, with the notable exception of DeWitt. Wheeler made considerable efforts to formulate the theory in a way that would be palatable to Bohr, visited Copenhagen in 1956 to discuss it with him, and convinced Everett to visit as well, which happened in 1959. Nevertheless, Bohr and his collaborators completely rejected the theory. Everett had already left academia in 1957, never to return, and in 1980, Wheeler disavowed the theory.

===Support===

One of MWI&#x27;s strongest longtime advocates is David Deutsch. According to him, the single photon interference pattern observed in the double slit experiment can be explained by interference of photons in multiple universes. Viewed this way, the single photon interference experiment is indistinguishable from the multiple photon interference experiment. In a more practical vein, in one of the earliest papers on quantum computing, Deutsch suggested that parallelism that results from MWI could lead to &quot;a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it&quot;. He also proposed that MWI will be testable (at least against &quot;naive&quot; Copenhagenism) when reversible computers become conscious via the reversible observation of spin.

=== Equivocal ===
Philosophers of science James Ladyman and Don Ross say that MWI could be true, but do not embrace it. They note that no quantum theory is yet empirically adequate for describing all of reality, given its lack of unification with general relativity, and so do not see a reason to regard any interpretation of quantum mechanics as the final word in metaphysics. They also suggest that the multiple branches may be an artifact of incomplete descriptions and of using quantum mechanics to represent the states of macroscopic objects. They argue that macroscopic objects are significantly different from microscopic objects in not being isolated from the environment, and that using quantum formalism to describe them lacks explanatory and descriptive power and accuracy.

===Rejection===

Some scientists consider some aspects of MWI to be unfalsifiable and hence unscientific because the multiple parallel universes are non-communicating, in the sense that no information can be passed between them.

Victor J. Stenger remarked that Murray Gell-Mann&#x27;s published work explicitly rejects the existence of simultaneous parallel universes. Collaborating with James Hartle, Gell-Mann worked toward the development of a more &quot;palatable&quot; &quot;post-Everett quantum mechanics&quot;. Stenger thought it fair to say that most physicists find MWI too extreme, though it &quot;has merit in finding a place for the observer inside the system being analyzed and doing away with the troublesome notion of wave function collapse&quot;.

Roger Penrose argues that the idea is flawed because it is based on an oversimplified version of quantum mechanics that does not account for gravity. In his view, applying conventional quantum mechanics to the universe implies the MWI, but the lack of a successful theory of quantum gravity negates the claimed universality of conventional quantum mechanics. According to Penrose, &quot;the rules must change when gravity is involved&quot;. He further asserts that gravity helps anchor reality and &quot;blurry&quot; events have only one allowable outcome: &quot;electrons, atoms, molecules, etc., are so minute that they require almost no amount of energy to maintain their gravity, and therefore their overlapping states. They can stay in that state forever, as described in standard quantum theory&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;in the case of large objects, the duplicate states disappear in an instant due to the fact that these objects create a large gravitational field&quot;.

Philosopher of science Robert P. Crease says that MWI is &quot;one of the most implausible and unrealistic ideas in the history of science&quot; because it means that everything conceivable happens. Science writer Philip Ball calls MWI&#x27;s implications fantasies, since &quot;beneath their apparel of scientific equations or symbolic logic, they are acts of imagination, of &#x27;just supposing.

Theoretical physicist Gerard &#x27;t Hooft also dismisses the idea: &quot;I do not believe that we have to live with the many-worlds interpretation. Indeed, it would be a stupendous number of parallel worlds, which are only there because physicists couldn&#x27;t decide which of them is real.&quot;

Asher Peres was an outspoken critic of MWI. A section of his 1993 textbook had the title &quot;Everett&#x27;s interpretation and other bizarre theories&quot;. Peres argued that the various many-worlds interpretations merely shift the arbitrariness or vagueness of the collapse postulate to the question of when &quot;worlds&quot; can be regarded as separate, and that no objective criterion for that separation can actually be formulated.

=== Polls ===
A poll of 72 &quot;leading quantum cosmologists and other quantum field theorists&quot; conducted before 1991 by L. David Raub showed 58% agreement with &quot;Yes, I think MWI is true&quot;.

Max Tegmark reports the result of a &quot;highly unscientific&quot; poll taken at a 1997 quantum mechanics workshop. According to Tegmark, &quot;The many worlds interpretation (MWI) scored second, comfortably ahead of the consistent histories and Bohm interpretations.&quot;

In response to Sean M. Carroll&#x27;s statement &quot;As crazy as it sounds, most working physicists buy into the many-worlds theory&quot;, Michael Nielsen counters: &quot;at a quantum computing conference at Cambridge in 1998, a many-worlder surveyed the audience of approximately 200 people... Many-worlds did just fine, garnering support on a level comparable to, but somewhat below, Copenhagen and decoherence.&quot; But Nielsen notes that it seemed most attendees found it to be a waste of time: Peres &quot;got a huge and sustained round of applauseâ¦when he got up at the end of the polling and asked &#x27;And who here believes the laws of physics are decided by a democratic vote?

A 2005 poll of fewer than 40 students and researchers taken after a course on the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics at the Institute for Quantum Computing University of Waterloo found &quot;Many Worlds (and decoherence)&quot; to be the least favored.

A 2011 poll of 33 participants at an Austrian conference on quantum foundations found 6 endorsed MWI, 8 &quot;Information-based/information-theoretical&quot;, and 14 Copenhagen; the authors remark that MWI received a similar percentage of votes as in Tegmark&#x27;s 1997 poll.

==Speculative implications==
DeWitt has said that Everett, Wheeler, and Graham &quot;do not in the end exclude any element of the superposition. All the worlds are there, even those in which everything goes wrong and all the statistical laws break down.&quot; Tegmark affirmed that absurd or highly unlikely events are rare but inevitable under MWI: &quot;Things inconsistent with the laws of physics will never happenâeverything else will... it&#x27;s important to keep track of the statistics, since even if everything conceivable happens somewhere, really freak events happen only exponentially rarely.&quot; David Deutsch speculates in his book &quot;The Beginning of Infinity&quot; that some fiction, such as alternate history, could occur somewhere in the multiverse, as long as it is consistent with the laws of physics.

According to Ladyman and Ross, many seemingly physically plausible but unrealized possibilities, such as those discussed in other scientific fields, generally have no counterparts in other branches, because they are in fact incompatible with the universal wave function. According to Carroll, human decision-making, contrary to common misconceptions, is best thought of as a classical process, not a quantum one, because it works on the level of neurochemistry rather than fundamental particles. Human decisions do not cause the world to branch into equally realized outcomes; even for subjectively difficult decisions, the &quot;weight&quot; of realized outcomes is almost entirely concentrated in a single branch.

&quot;Quantum suicide&quot; is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics and the philosophy of physics that can purportedly distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many-worlds interpretation by a variation of the SchrÃ¶dinger&#x27;s cat thought experiment, from the cat&#x27;s point of view. &quot;Quantum immortality&quot; refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide. Most experts believe the experiment would not work in the real world, because the world with the surviving experimenter has a lower &quot;measure&quot; than the world before the experiment, making it less likely that the experimenter will experience their survival.
